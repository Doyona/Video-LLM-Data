What antidote would you bring if you were a guest on Hot Ones?
Sean try ayran, turkish drink on the show, could be better than all the other remedies you have tried.
I had to drink milk while watching this! I started sweating because I could feel the heat through my phone!
I love Melissa McCarthy.😊
That crazy. Crystal lake? I grew up in Algonquin :)
She reminds me of my favorite aunt. RIP. She was so funny.
😂😂😂
😂😂 I love her!!! She is all of us 🔥 🥵
This is just too funny 😂😂
I love her sooo much!!!!
Not that I dislike Melissa, but holy doodle, the amount of makeup that was caked on her face... scary.
This is my favorite episode of hot ones.
Stop hot Ones Melissa mccarthy
Da bomb is why I watch this mostly 😅
Imagine Peter Steele doing this
If I had to pick one person on earth to be stuck in a room for a week with, it would probably be Melissa McMarthy.
Don’t know who they referred to saying there’s no desire for comedy, that’s complete BS, thanks for fighting for us! Seems more like society conditioning, I know folks want, they NEED comedy these days more then ever.
Only Melissa would bring milk in a spray bottle 😂😂
I love watching her talk. Idk what it is. Im fascinated watching her teeth & lips as she talks. Just like comedian Kathleen Madigan. Both have an entrancing way of speaking, a pleaseant voice, articulation, both funny, both smart & witty and both glowingly warm visually & have fun energy. Just utterly fascinated. Took those wings like a gd champ while still being funny, charming & (most importantly) herself. I love that every episode of Hot Ones makes me say "THIS is my favorite guest" every time.
Didn’t sell
Stop hot ones you Melisa
This was beyond Excellent,,,Melissa,,,We LOVE  YOU So Much
She remains the best
McCarthy is hysterical 😂 this hot ones is my favorite
she is such a breath of fresh air. thank you
Stop hot ones you
The Heat still my favourite MM movie.
Front end is bad enough, back end is worse
"As you try to breathe in ...to live!"  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The bread works because you are wiping the capsaicin off your tongue with the soft part.  It removes those molecules that like little shurikens by wiping them off.
Explain too me how the hottest sauce in the world is a lower scoville level than the one at the end
Sean Evans l’a compris, c’est ce que tout le monde devrait savoir dans cet épisode
Tornadon liittolainen? Se kuulostaa vaaralliselta
Melissa McCarthy is my favourite person ❤
This was one if my favorite episodes. And it makes me want hot wings. 🔥
16:34 i don’t know what to do 😂
Some of the Hot ones videos have hot sauces that have spiciness of TBA spiciness why🌶
I do no care what anybody sez, Melissa McCarthy is smoking hot.  Would jump her bones in a heartbeat
I totally agree we need MORE COMEDY less killing and shooting movies.
Comedy cures all that ails ❤
Wow the dramatic background music 😅
Bananas.  Eat them.
You think it's bad going in, wait till the next day when it coming out! lol
she's so cute
She's awesome 💐👏👏👏👏
The finger :D
Movies and Video Games are made, by the top companies, for profit and profit only. Somewhere along the way they forgot that we want good movies and video games. Not profit making ones. We don't care if your movie or game makes a profit. If its good we'll buy it. So when she say's she'll fight for comedies till her dying breath, which was unfortunately 4 wings later, I highly respect that.
she has the most beautiful eyes
Try apple slices or peach slices or any cool fruit..  The reason people have sambals with hot curries
ARI SHAFFIR NEXT!
As you try to breathe to live, it gets worse.
I’m 2 years behind, but Sean, you almost killed MELISSA MCCARTHY!!!! I WOULD HAVE NEVER FORGIVEN YOU. (Obviously she didn’t die, cause I’ve watched her recent interviews, but she shouldn’t have gone through this torture)
Do they have EMTs if a guest stops breathing?
She didn't hold back and take nibbles like a lot of people. She took the challenge 💯❤
12:40 I agree with her 💯! I also think comedians are sometimes the only ones holding the line for free speech in our overly polarized cancel culture. 🙏
U GOOOOOO,MS. MELISSA!!!!!  WHEN U START WITH THE FIRST INE AND IT IS HOT TO U AND U FINISH,IR A PHAAACKKKIIING ROCKSTAR!!!!! WE LOVE U,GIRLIIIEEE❤
🤣🤣🤣 I LOVE her so much.  One of my favourite actresses.  I just see her in a film and I start giggling straight away 🥰
Melissa did better than Gordon Ramsey.
Ha! I'm from Crystal Lake and also terrified of tornadoes! I know exactly the tornado he's talking about.
Sean: stop repeating yourself. You’re as big as the guys you interview.😊
Why is she so beautiful is the question wemon should ask beautiful they get surgery to look like something else
Melissa McCarthy is, inside and out, one of the most beautiful women I have ever encountered. And now we know she is brave af too! Cheers from Canada! ❤❤😎😎🍁🍁
I love love love!
3rd time watching this episode.. love her 😂
Melissa!!......... DON'T DRINK THE WATER!!  It makes it worse!!  That's why the milk is there!  Casein is a compound in milk that binds to the  capsaicin , which causes the burning sensation. When the two compounds bind, the casein neutralizes the capsaicin.   it was hilarious watching you.  Thank you.
That was god keeping y’all safe
Canada loves Melissa McCarthy.  She is good people.
I love you Melissa no matter what you are doing , your awsome 🎉😂🎉😂❤❤
You the Eddie Murphy of the 2000s.    You are funny and can act.... actually act 😂
Poor unfunate soul
After death sauce 😅😮😢
I’m so glad she’s spoke on how important comedies are. It seems like lately movies have been getting darker and unbearable to watch. Me and my husband always go back to the 2000s family movies because they feel so much lighter and during these times the last thing I want to watch is another drama or another catastrophe because we see it everyday now lol. Of course we love watching her movies too :)
Every one can sign my cast 😭🤣🤣I’m dying 🤣🤣🤣
Love Melissa!
I absolutely love Melissa McCarthy
I love you, Mellissa!   Habbies is as far as I go!😢try. Spraying vinegar instead of water or milk
If they would eat or drink some chocolate in between bites it would totally soothe the burning
I don't claim it
I haven't liked everything she's done but she seems like a pleasant person to have a conversation with. Her sincerity in believing that comedies are a necessity made me a fan
16:54 Sean sweatin hard under the arms
Will Ferrell and John C Reilly they interview you!
Can you please have a drag queen on.  Like Willam, Bob the Drag Queen, Jinkx Monsoon, Or Jimbo!
Melissa McCarthy Is Chicago Blackhawks Bait
Chicago Blackhawks Needs Melissa McCarthy
It's Chicago Blackhawks Time For Melissa McCarthy
Do you think Sean knows? How many times is he going to say ‘I know’ in this episode
Milk is helpful for spicy foods, but sugar is better to bring down the spiciness
Melissa did an awesome job she's fantastic.
That spray bottle tickled me!😂😂
Malissa was hilarious
So it's very surprising that Da'bomb is that lethal. I'm reading up on this and reevaluating everything I thought I know about shu. And I've eaten Carolina reaper more than once. I always felt that Trinidad scorpion was much worse than reaper and I'm probably right!
I so love her!! Loved this one. Thx
Carbondale Illinois in the house.  Class of 94
Melissa is like the mother i never had
This is a fun show some honorable mentions that cost barely anything at Walmart is Tabasco scorpion, pepper sauce or on Amazon it’s like three bucks and the ghost pepper sauce by Melinda’s very very great hot sauce.
She was spot on how we need to shy away from dark content
She could be reading the encyclopedia and this bish would still be funnier than half the comedians out there! We faux wit u white lady from the movies 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I can’t believe they’re just now realizing that bread i.e. starch foods, helps a lot.  Jamaican food is often very hot, but there is usually rice nearby to calm the hot before going back for more😃.  Soda crackers, work well too.
Fun to watch, but for most of guests, it's a waste of food with all the baby bites
Isn't bread supposed to be the thing that stops the burn?
Melissa McCarthy is freaking awesome!
I'm here because I love her!
One of the best ones.
Sean has the best questions. His researchers are the best. And Melissa is just a dream.
Can someone explain to me why DaBomb with 135k scoville kicks so much harder than the sauces with over 1m? 😂
The look of betrayal on Melissa's face at 12:06. 🤣
She is gorgeous ❤️
Melissa you ,ade a comment about comedy. I am  not a company fan unless there are good actors.
Sorry forgot to add the YouTube muk bangers name her name is Raina Huang
She’s not an actor but she does muk bangs and food challenges on You Tube , she loves spicy it would be nice to see her  on Hot Ones, please consider her.
How could you not ask Melissa about one of her best comedy movies, Spy?! It came out in 2015 so it had to be before this interview.  🤔  Unless, and i suspect, the guests give a list of things you can ask about, or they want to talk about and things that are off limits.  But, that movie was great and hilarious with a great famous cast, who all did great! I consider it something she could be proud of and brag on! Would have heard some great off camera stories on location in Prague, i think, and about co star interactions! 😃
She is such a gorgeous woman. Add a brilliant actress.
Eating a banana helps with the burning of the hot sauce!! Really!!
I lived in island lake! My mom had a salon in Huntley. I worked at Kelsey road House.. miss living around there!!
16:20 #8 Da Bomb
17:37 got me howling 😂😂😂
I regret not watching this episode sooner 😂 I love this woman❤
CAN SHE STRETCH HER SKIN ANY FARTHER
Honestly Sean, y'all have ice cream most of the time now. Why can't one of your PAs fix up an ice bath & carafe with whole milk already?
I laughed close to the hardest I ever have in an older Melissa McCarthy film Identity Thief. I don't remember what device I watched it on or where, but I would advise you to stream it--if you would like to  laugh so hard it hurts!!!😁😁😁😁
"What's your legal situation?" I love Melissa!!!!🤣🤣🤣
You have the worst show in the world 😂😂😂
AS YOU TRY TO BREATHE IN TO LIVE
If you want to see her teats is on netflix movie wasp 🐝
LEMON WEDGES
SOOKIEEEE ❤
I love her so much
We need Lauren Graham to do this too! Full GG playlist :)
Imagine if this show existed when Chris Farley was alive and he was a guest. His reactions to the spice burn would have been epic.
Can not look cause the music
Melissa McCarthy  - finishes the wings and runs to the sink - It's coming out mf me like Lava!!! hahahaha
She is actually funny, unlike Amy Schumer
I have never laughed so hard at one of these
❤❤🎉🎉🌹🌹
she not a singer but she absolutely killed it
She’s so cool!!
Gosh I just love her!!!!!!😅❤
I think Melissa can be absolutely hilarious!! I also love an actor/actress that stays completely out of politics. She failed to do so. Still enjoyed this episode.
Man Tim Dillon is hilarious
Probably one of the funniest of all time.
I adore her!
Sean is just sooo lovely and nice and genuine and it's such a fresh feeling for TV!
Probably like my 4th or 5th re-watch of all the episodes..... if you haven't had these sauces, specifically DA BOMB, you will not understand.
She is me!! Haha!
She's great even on Mike & Molly she was so funny and the writing was absolutely wonderful
😂
Sean lookin like Dr. Evil with that shirt 😂💀
Isn’t the goal to be good? 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂 I can't stop laughing
Melissa is legit one of the funniest women imo, and I love how she can go from a funny comedy to the most dramatic and realest movie
I love her so much. In so many ways. And she handled that with such Grace and poise and composure. That's impressive.   And I love that at the end the first thing she said was that she was a mom of two kids. ❤️❤️ Yay motherhood!
She needs ranch
Why doesn't anybody ever take a second bite from the opposite side of the wing that doesn't have sauce -- and chew both bites together?  It just seems like too much hot sauce for the size of the bite of chicken.
I love her, she is the best! She took it like a champ. From South Africa
Great interview with another wonderful woman
Love Melissa!!!  Good job
I mean dj Khalid kinda left right away lol
Stop hot ones Melisa mc cartey i AM GENTLEMAN you
I absolutely LOVE Melissa McCarthy ♥️ 💕 ❤️ 💗 💖
That tornado she mentions was one of the worst tornadoes in history. An unwarned super strong tornado.
Lol y'all need to have baby wipes available for the hands cause that'd be terrifying to get in ur eyes
I love her as a human. Such a beautiful person
I feel for you Melissa
Water makes I worse. Can't believe they don't know that.    Milk, ice cream and plain yogart is what you need.
Stop hot ones you
Melissa is kinda like Madea of white people in a way. lol
Good try! DJ Khaled
Him saying 'I know' more than a dozen times is very annoying. This woman is dying and he just keeps saying 'I know'!  Ridiculous. What a show. And let's see when he has to have esophageal surgery for his constant eating of this garbage. Just sayin'
I totally agree that comedy is needed in the world. And have a variety. I personally enjoy action comedies. They help me when I've had a long day or a stressful day. Laughter is medicine for the soul.
Love Melissa! Good job finishing!!
I am interested in doing the Wings Of Death on this show. How do I get in touch with the host of this show?
Im from IL too. Was the tornado in Belvidere? Im from there! 😁 we had a monument in front of our school for all the lost lives and our school talked about it every year for rememberance
I hate spicy food 🌶️😱
I love her, Melissa is so funny! Wonderful comedian and actress! She is the best!
She is not only hysterical she's genuinely a lovely and real person. Just love her!!
twix...12 pack.
🫨 The perseverance !! Congratulations Melissa 👏🔥✨
My Favorite Actress!! And i think she's gorgeous!!!
Melissa: "I make bad choices"  Same girl, same....
It was fun though, like when you break your leg,....
Where is the double like button for yt 😂 that was the best hot ones ever
Has any guest/commenter ever asked about the preparation of the wings themselves? I know they’re cooked however the guest wants them to be, but I’m thinking about the level of hot sauce saturation. Like do they just toss them around in each different sauce to coat them? Or is there some other way?
For a woman who hates spice, she did an awesome job! 🎉🎉
I so love you Melissa!!!
She's absolutely so adorable and has always been so relatable ❤
This was the best video I feel like.
What does the host take is the ? Because he is lying to me
I deeply appreciate and respect that she doesn't bother to act all collected and graceful when she's dying from all the spice.
--------- Why they have any Wet WIPES on the table with a variety of Napkins? 😢😢😢  One Napkin is too dangerous...
supervideo,
This chick is still around? Gross.
I don’t like that they take just one bite 😂 wasting wings 😂🤦🏽‍♀️
You guys should put mark weins on the show. I would to see how he reacts to the hottest one
Two greats together... love this.
Love thiss😂😂💕
My question is why is the hotest one #8 and #10 is 2,000,000 but nobody flinches. What? I dont understand
We did this for Halloween last year and used bowls to dip the sauce in. When we went to wash the bowls our entire 2 bedroom apartment turned into a gas chamber and we had to leave with windows open and fans on. One of our guests was a veteran with training on gas exposure. He stayed behind to finish washing. Ya'll need instructions on how to handle these! NO BOWLS FOR DIPPING.
By far my favorite episode… just subscribed
Ursula misunderstood?  Naw bruh.
I really never laughed so hard off this episode 😅😢
She's so hilarious her faces alone 😅
Melissa is perfection, funny, bright, lovely and talented. Her and her husband should be the royalty of hollywood. Loved this  interview
Lake In The Hills was my hometown… Lived out in Crystal Lake for a few years! Small world ❤
0:43 yeah, DJ Khaled
She's the best ❤❤
why do i genuinely want johnny depp to do this
I'm new to this show.  I think the reason that this show works is because of the host.  He's an absolutely perfect host for  a show like this, and as young as he is, it's as if he's got decades of experience in a venue like this.  He's polite, cordial, respectful, cautious and even caring, not to mention a very intelligent and sophisticated person.  Hosts can make or break a show.  In this young man, they've got a treasure.
This girl is so frigg'n funny, everything coming out of her mouth is hysterical! Iz she single?
I just love her so much
LOL 😂 love her
Did the ad pop up when you replayed that last part 😂
😂😂😂, I can't text😂😂
I’m scared of the aftermath… does Tums even help? 😣
I respect that she was inventive with the milk spray bottle! I also love her ❤ thank you for the laughs and smiles💝🙏🏽
didn't she have her stomach stapled?
Melissa pulling out random food is such a laugh.
Love the spray bottle. MELISSA IS THE VERY BEST
Now i want hot sauce
I adore Melissa Mccarthy
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
🏁
milk milk and more milk room temp, fridge cooled, freezer pops. freezer 4L  JUGS.
I WHOULD bare down and fight through it. it only hurts for a wile
MELISSA IS SO GREAT LOVEYOU IN EVERYTHING. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO.   LOVE YOU
Sean, this is a great shirt on you.
Holy Cyber Farts!!! 🏳‍⚧🏳‍🌈
I’ve heard that milk kinda locks in the spice into your tastebuds so I’d think the spray whip cream would create a whole barrier. I’d try doing a coat or two of that before the first bite. I’d be sweating. I’d need a pony tail and lots of Kleenex to excavate the  face
Nothing on Gilmore girls I was waiting for it 🥹
She was genuinely funny! I enjoyed this episode so much!! 😄
When I did the "Hot Ones" challenge at home, I got the hickups, too! 😅
The look she gave Sean after the "Spicy Shark" was like he hit her. 😂🤣😂
Wow!!!! I didn’t know these two were from Illinois!!!!! Let’s go Illinois!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
If you haven't watched the UNDERTAKER on this show ya just gotta he's Still Invincible!! 😂😂😂😂😂
PARSLEY!! And Milk best two items for HOT Foods but they Never have it on the show not even Gordon Ramsay thought of it???? Drinking Water actually increases the eat so i was told by an Expert on the topic!?? 😮😢😱
for someone who said she isn't good with spice, she went through them amazingly ^^
👍👍😊
HAPPY ST.PATTYS DAY 😊
We love her 😊
I loved when she said, "you have the $4ittiest job ever."
Love the Narnia music xD
I choose to believe Chris Farley forcefully possessed Melissa McCarthy.  Because that's awesome. Hahaha I got this. Go float.
Surprised they don't supply "wet wipes" to clean your hands with their napkins so they don't get the sauce on their face by mistake. Because napkins won't take away the chili oil..
Dj Khaled had the record
Melissa and Sean should both come and see us in Carbondale, IL. Subs and beers at Booby's on me!
I love ❤️ this brilliant woman! 😂❤
Melissa is a heavy weight and will eat anything!
I hope the Ghostbusters comes up lol
It was like she was acting the whole way
Hilarious!
Best one I've seen 😂❤
What a trooper. melissa is funny to the core of her core. A treasure.
Outstanding Ursula. Atrocious Ariel.
She's cute.
She is so awesome.
Little peed that Gilmore wasn't brought up
Lady Gaga.. eating hot wings . I can't tolerate mild wings. Haha. And she didn't get sauce all over her person while being interviewed. Love her new  song Abracadabra. Pretty face and beautiful skin.  My first time watching this show and I gotta say, Sean, you're the best darned interviewer I've seen in years. So on point . You know your stuff. And fast!! Tops too you, Sean 💯👏 I subscribed.
7:29 crystal lake?? Isn't that where Jason Voorhees... 🤔
She could seriously use some of that Hidden Valley ranch from the SNL episode!
So beautifulll
SEE U TOMORROW ICONIC LOL
love her so much
You just have to REMOVE da bom from the show.
Her sense of humor makes me laugh so hard my ribs hurt
I used to hate her but I loved her in The Happytime Murders so much that I started watching more of her content.
Melissa is so beautiful internally and externally. Her sense of humor & kindness are like the icing on a wedding cake. Absolutely Love her. 🫶🙏🫶
She's so Cute and Funny
14:20 are we supposed to pretend it’s not Ready Whip?
"I hate you so much!" Huge love to both!
OK I know this is an old post ..,. Can you have " Anatoli" on the show
Melissa McCarthy is the GOAT!! ❤
Like I need another reason to love her!!😂😂😂
I can now consider myself a fan of hers. She was great
I love her smile and mischievous laugh ❤
My favorite haha
I was so worried for her after that first wing 😂😂😂 loved this episode ! Comedies for the win !
I love Melissa McCarthy!!!!❤😂
This is great, funny! But why do they play this awful music underneath all the time?? It's just annoying!
Eat the bread, EAT THE BREAD!!! She is hilarious, love Melissa McCarthy to death!! You know it's funny if she is there!
I love her! It's official . Melissa you have a fanboy in Greece
❤
I LOVE her props!! She brought her own bag of tricks 😂😂😂 LOVE HERRR
I LOVE her props!! She brought her own bag of tricks 😂😂😂 LOVE HERRR
Melissa dying  Sean: "I'm hear with you" 🤣
Whats your legal situation 😂😂
What a CHAMP!! 🎉🎉 Melissa is the Best ❤❤❤
the bread lol
Nobody eat like lady Gaga off course in style!!! She is beautiful 😻 mother monster arrives
my glottigloppus? my uthula? No I think that's lower lol
Seans from Crystal Lake? Wild im the next town over lol
She is one of the funniest participants. Love her
How a person became evil is always interesting. But we shouldn’t normalize empathizing with abusers.
I cannot watch this episode enough times! I can see her act and react and it’s so genuine. She is my fave!   MM: “I hate you so much” Sean: “I know, I get it”
amazing mad love you Melissa!!❤❤❤❤
The silent finger was hilarious 😂
I will fight to my last breath which will be in four hot wings!😂I nearly choked on my yoghurt.😂
He needs an Amelia from the chicken shop cross over
Love this show!
No, but how does Sean do this over and over again?
You need to do an average Joe version where you pick fans to participate and put them through the gauntlet
Melissa McCarthy is my favorite female comedic actress
I love her awesome pick
Carpentersville Illinois raised right here. Still love it. Other sister lives in Huntley Illinois.
my Plainfield Illinois legend.
She explained it so well at the end. I never really thought about it until she said it
I am in tears 🤣
Spicy Shart not "shark"
I love the DND Bardify music in the background for Da Bomb ☠️☠️☠️
This is the funniest one ever.
I just love her. ❤
Its always the bomb that gets everyone
Lol I watched this probably five times and she’s so funny. I just love her.
Awesome!! But you're saying that Plainfield IL is like a giant Etcher Sketch. Every year or so, they shake it up and start again. 😎
I agree so much that comedy is sooo important. We NEED the hahas people! Laughter is medicine and in a world that is so sick and needs so much love and healing, we need joy and laughter in every form we can get it. ❤
Had no idea hea from crystal lake. I use to live there tooo
what's your legal situation?
22 seconds in. DJ Khaled totally left quick af.
Carbondale native 🙌🏼
God bless you Melissa McCarthy and @FirstWrFeast
Milkshakes and homemade 🍞 are my antidotes @FirstWeFeast
12:40 Hollywood already stopped making audiences laugh cuz they make so many horror movies 😱 they want you to be sad and depressed and demonized.
I love how Sean meets the guests where they are with spice tolerance. People who have a low tolerance he’s with them the entire way of acknowledging the spice being there and the heat- vs people with higher tolerance he’s like ‘oh it’s coming’
One of my good friends lives in her old house in Plainfield & they text her (such a sweetheart)
I loveeee herrrr ✨💯🙏🏽❤️☺️🥰
I( Would Love To Meet You!!!
At 135k it is definitely not the hottest chilli in the world. The ghost pepper and others are in the MILLIONS. JS
I love this show! Melissa McCarthy is amazing!
"I will fight 'til my last breath, which will probably be in about 4 more wings"   Lol
She is the best 😂🤣😂🤣😂🫶🫶🤣🫶🫶😂🤣😂🫶😂
😍
I’ve loved Melissa since the first time I saw her on camera 💯 She’s my secret best friend I’ve never met and if we were ever together in any environment, we’d be belles of the ball!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I absolutely love Melissa so much!!!
🎉😂 I've seen a lot of these and Melissa McCarthy you have me on the floor and it's hysterics❤
Da bomb es la mas picante,la anterior a da bomb es 10 veces menos picante y las 2 que le siguen son como la 5 y la 6,está comprobado en laboratorio hay un video y la escala no es la que ponen 🎉🎉🖖
alright I wasn't going to say this cuz it might ruin it but pepper capsaicin are bizarre however they are totally "reverse engineerable"  sounds odd but it's true.. taste the hottest pepper in the world, it will burn but then taste the mildest pepper in the world that has capsaicin and the heat level you experience will be that of the last sauce or capsaicinoids you had on your taste buds . .   after eating a dab or two of old # 8, go back and take a few dabs of # 1 or # 2 . .   yup, your bids will signal for the last sauce you put on your tongue .  .  mix it with water swish it around in your mouth...  yup
I am laughing so hard it hurts.  I am screaming not the water! ! Go for the milk
I love her
Where does she keep pulling put stuff from?!?! 😂😂😂
One of the Funniest people on TV
Aww its so nice of you guys to give this chance to someone who isnt famous. Bless
Melissa us my favourite actress only like even more as she’s so humble and funny as an aspiring actor hope to one-day audition for her movies
🤡
Hands down the funniest chick on earth!😂
If there has been a more disgusting celebrity, I can’t recall it.
Is he calling her Martha?
I only want to get famous to go on this show
Melissa McCarthy! \YOU/ ARE THE FIRST MS. WOLVERINE!!!! J.S. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The host is from Jason's place? Hahahhahahah
Sean’s concern for someone else while he’s dying is really admirable
I love her so much😂😅😊❤💕🤎
Wow 😊
Her legs shaking before her live impression of Farley was probably Chris himself possessing her for the performance!
She is a National Treasure!
Love she is so funny ❤
One of the best hot ones. You should have more comedians
I do wonder if after all these wings that Seans stomach must be messed up or just immune to it all
They need to get Mark Weins ,the YouTube food vlogger,on Hot ones.
She probably asked for a plate to go...
Not one mention of Gilmore Girls. Interesting.
Acid balances out the burn the most! We figured it out with pizza sauce after we did the hottest chip, but we didn't have much in the house after a snowstorm lol.
Melissa is just plain funny and sincere. This may be my favorite interview you've done.
Yay ! Melissa🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂
Look I’m gonna be honest if next election comes and both candidates don’t come on hot ones, I’m just not gonna vote.
Melissa McCarthy is a National Treasure.
Love her!! She’s my favourite on this show by far, such a hilarious genuine person
Loved this one so much
Love her 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Süt yerine ayran içerseniz mideniz daha rahat eder
Hands down this is now one of my favs! 😅 Love Melissa!!! She’s naturally hilarious 😍💯🙏🏾
He gave a Crystal Lake shoutout and I’ll take it!
She is hilarious. Loved this.
Love her, ;)
Yes we love you Melissa McCarthy - unconditionally!
23:23 .... Yeah they should have hired an actual drag queen to do her makeup
Melissa McCarthy, as usual, knocks it out of the park!  So hilarious!
Get a tub of sour cream works great for cooling off ur mouth!!
This is my favorite episode so far! So hilarious 😂
Around 12 min when she says "you try to breathe in to live" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Melissa, your the best, you seem like such a nice down to earth person.
As someone who says they make inherently bad choices, she can't say that about her choice in partner...at least I hope that is the case, because people obviously put on facades. I just feel like they are genuinely two incredible humans and it is beautiful to see them together! ✌️💗
"When you try to breathe in to live it's worse 🤣"
Brilliantly funny 😂😂😂
For someone so heat adverse, she did great.  I think the worst case scenario had to be Chef Ramsey.  He totally lost it.
I love how she brought all the stuff with her she was ready
She got through it ❤ I DO NOT KNOW HOW U EQT WITH EVERY GUEST!!!
Weird Southern IL Carbondale mention
I really like Melissa’s take on how “comedies” is dying but it’s not, it’s really just the “bad comedies” dying. But the world needs humor not just “dark themed” shows. Thank you for saying this, Melissa
Melissa rocks!!!!
Sean is one of the hottest guys ever. Melissa is the sweetest  and super pure. I Love her so much.
My god she's funny. What a great guest
“Gladaglopus” has me rolling🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Iced Milk! YES!!  Good Tip!!!
Guys, you don’t have playlist with 22,23 seasons
Entertainment, watching another person suffer
Loved Melissa since the first time I saw her in Gilmore girls. Her character in "The Heat" film is the best acting ever and I still laugh everytime I see her in the film. Love her so much.
Man... Who doesn't love MM.... Absolutely adore her.
"It's a distant memory, it's behind us" 22:16 😂😂😂😂
Melissa McCarthy is one of the greats
Man, I love this lady!! ❤❤
A friend of mine had The Last Dab and let me try it. It's honestly a good sauce, lingers, but it's got a good flavor.
Where is Sean's shirt from?
No way! First time watching this episode and had no clue you were from Crystal Lake! Used to work out of that area! Small world! 😆
Way to go Melissa
Loved her in Tammy😊❤️
Love her and she is spot on. We need more good comedy movies!!!
I can't believe she did the dab after feeling the first. What a champ!
'You try to breath in to live and it gets worse' Hahaha
How did the friend know a tornado was about to hit?!
No Nine Perfect Strangers question??????? !!!
She’s not even flinching! Can I love her any more!
Her crying with the finger is the best thing I've seen in a while!
Madalina Ghenea is her name, the lady in yellow, she is from Romania.
"Jesus Christ, you're terrible at this."  Finally, someone NOT complimenting Sean haha
ONE OF MY FAVORITE EPISODES ❤ 😂❤...it's soo awesomeness 👌 how the guest's personality is REALLY the STAR OF THE SHOW...(aside from Sean, of course...😅)
she's great!I remember her since when i was watching Gilmore Girls on my teens! cheers Melissa!
I love this woman so much!!! Every time I hear her voice it just makes me wanna watch Gilmore Girls
I clicked this vid and got a Hot Ones ad. I was like, "I came here to watch Melissa. Who the heck is this guy?" THEN, I realized it was an ad. smh
This woman has a very good talent at comedy. Even suffering at hot sauce she was avail to throw jokes all along xd
Melissa is one of the most genuine, lovely people. I love her!!!!
I love you so much😂 Melissa is hands down one of my favorite actresses and comedians of all time ❤
buttered toast
Rau Lock
"Isn't the goal to be good"😂😂😂
THE SPRAY BOTTLE AAHAHAHAHA YESSS
I love the giggling and laughing of the crew in the background, it's so cute.
She's right. We need more comedies and uplifting movies and less negativity in general. The world won't die unless we let it. America is the best nation in the world based on any metric (other than maternal mortality, education, etc.). So we're not perfect, but we are the best. Let's be positive. Our future can be great. We can make it so. (Vote KH)
I’ve got the saucer and we did the wings … they are hot I thought I was gonna die! And da bomb isn’t playing!! 😮
Gonzalez Mary Clark Jose Young Scott
Born and raised in Chicago,  I could tell that both of you are from Illinois. Winners never quit
She's the funniest woman, she makes everyone laugh hope she makes lots of more movies
Melissa, how long were you sick after eating all that hot stuff????
A Comedic Genius. Now I’ve Seen It All
I love her❤❤ 8:34
Melissa you did a wonderful..loved the movie..you are awesome ..im a fellow Illinoisan..Flora Illinois...Love you girl
Talked makes the heat worse and that’s why she answers and says “oh!” Big secret for people trying the carolina reaper competitions. Don’t breath through your mouth and do not talk.
God bless her! She had me rolling laughing!
Young Daniel Miller Paul Williams Sharon
I love her!!!
"As you try to breathe in to live it gets worse."
Hit the cow 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥
Booooooo
Great show. It would also be awesome to see all three gals on the show together competing then do the same with the guys from the show!
I'm always worried they are going to touch their eyes!
She is my favorite!!!! 😂
Sean is the Best interviewer on screen
Love her.
How could you not ask her any questions about Gilmore Girls?!!
I love that she flipped him off!
I like Melissa McCarthy so much more now
I love Melissa, shes so naturally funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤗🩷
It isn't true that my mattress is made of cotton candy.
I love her!!   I don't know how she did that.  She kept grabbing water. I'm screaming Milk Milk!  Great job.  And she could keep talking!! ❤
Do it with Joe Rogan😊
Love when her eyes watered up. Thats a trooper
HILARIOUS.  Two white people people from small town Illinois eating salsa that hot!  LOL
The problem with the movie is that Ursula in particular is sacred to a lot of people (me)   You just can’t redo it live action with no other big changes, you will never measure up to the original
I would love his job. *Adds a wavier*
I just love her!!!!!! Melissa you are amazing!❤
Fun fact coffee works better than anything else for extreme heat .
SIU CARBONDALE 🎉 GO DAWGS!!!!
Every time I see her, I find her so beautiful. There is something so charming, genuine and attractive about her. She is quite smart brining her own stuff to extinguish the "fire". In Hot Ones France, they have whipped cream and also honey, they are both the favourite amongst the participants.
I love her. ❤️
The look on her face when she's flipping him off might well be the best moment on this entire series. Well done, Melissa!
the uptempo, death defying, death escaping music change is HILARIOUS!!
Comedy's are one of my fav genre's, laughing makes you feel good, laughing increases dopamine, endorphins and oxytocin, all good things!
She has very pretty eyes.
Yeh, just like her bad choices with friends. Cabbage hat & making fun of my Queen will be unforgivable.  It looks like Karma arrived really quickly for her. Sorry, see you for next one.
4:20 I love you Melissa! This Show is simply good :D
Love this woman 😂❤❤
Melissa McCarthy is incredibly precious.
Happy Birthday to the funniest amazing actress Melissa McCarthy 🌟🏆🎉
Pls get karol g on hot ones pls
“I will fight till my last breath.. which will be in about 4 more wings..”  I fkn died 🤣🤣
Ok, I agree with her that genius is a bit of a stretch (kids these days). However, mad points for efficiency
I love 'er Eh? Class never drops the F-BOMB!
18:29 Too funny!
What's your legal position? Exposed 🤣
Hi Sean from Schaumburg good to see Midwest people in LA
Garcia Jessica Johnson Michael Wilson Susan
Funny story, her parents come into the restaurant I work at almost weekly. Super nice people, dad definitely has a bit of a funny streak too lol.
Yet another guest that I wasn't a fan of before, and became one after seeing them handle the run of wings.
Loved her since seeing her in Bridesmaids where she stole the show, then Identity Thief, the Heat w/ Sandra Bullock, would have liked to see her and Zach Galifianakis in more of a comedic team than we got on the 3rd Hangover movie.
Yes the bread is more helpful….liquids just float the oil.
Simply love her
I fully believe that was Chris she felt before doing van down by the river
Love it!  too funny!! But I wish I could turn down the music a lil bit 😖it’s so loud.
This has to be one of the best Hot Ones episode as far as a fighter. She has such a great attitude throughout. She was committed.
YES!!!!!  MORE COMEDY!!!
sookie!!!!
12:38 I felt that. That’s how “regret” would sound like if it could talk. 🤣
Sour creme
i think Mike& Molly was good  show . I wish the show continued,
this was hilarious😂you should totally get Sofia Vergara on this show
She’s hysterical! I love this woman.
I love all your videos ❤ great intimate conversations and very respectful. I appreciate you Sean!
Melissa McCarthy kills me. She is hilarious!!!
I feel like coughing is one of THE WORST things you can do when eating something this hot😂
Love Melissa, she's  a trooper.
Love her. Mike & Molly is one of my favorite tv shows. How many items did she bring to this? LOL
Love, love, love Melissa! She is sooo pretty and so ridiculously talented! ☺️🌹❤️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
My top 5 fav episode..lol
Her as press secretary Sean Spicer is my favorite SNL charachter ever. That is saying something. She killed it.
Can anyone clear this up for me,please? So, the host of this show eats super hot sauces each show? Does he have guts of steel??
The way she switched so quick on that "This is.. I don't think I'm- OUH!" 😂😂😂
IWFHSB ❤
Sean getting the finger lol... I always imagines he his the devil dressed as a cute sheep.
I believe vinegar puts out the fire🚒. I ate cucumbers too🥒
17:38 lol
Can't stand this women, if you can call it a woman.
I love her so much anytime I'm feeling down. I go back to this video just so I can laugh at her. She's so funny.
I want to meet Sean one day 😅
❤❤❤❤❤ love her.... top ten wings interview..  so is Kevin Hart
The thing that got me was her saying “I’m not a singer” …
“..Why don’t I feel anything” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She's a wonderful comedic actor and she was also wonderful in the couple of serious dramatic roles I've seen her play.
" 15:57 it hurts so much to smile" felt that..
what do they mean pressure when tornado is about to hit?
She had the best and realest reaction to da'bomb
Joliet Jake!!! Do NOT let comedy die.
Amen Melissa!  "comedies are important and I think it brings people together."  So true!!
I just don't get why he called her by her full name every time
I love this woman!!! ❤😂❤🎉
She's like Mary Poppins pulling stuff out of her bag hahahaha 😂....she's going to pull out a pizza next lol
Cold Chocolate pudding would be good
She is one of my most favorite female actors.I love her so much
Her bringing bread with her 😂😂😂 Can't
I love her. She is iconic
When she gave him the finger… 😂 that was the breaking point when I LOL
I love her!!  So sweet :)
You can see her fingers and hands swelling from the sauce.  Such a sweet lady.
I ❤ you Melissa McCarthy
That finger was great no offense but it was funny
Funniest thing I've seen Melissa do was Sean Spicer on SNL..DIABOLICAL
She's still obese. Big is not beautiful
BTW, My friend Raquel McKnight actually wrote "The Little Mermaid" & Disney stole it, via a writer there that she thought she could trust. So careful who you support. Love Melissa however! Why are yo torturing folks?!
I started laugh crying when she threw Sean the bread. 😂😂😂 this is one of the best episodes.
Wait till you go 💩 your other end will be on fire !! ❤❤ 2024😂😂😂😂
Peanut butter helps with hot foods !! ❤❤ 2024
I love her acting she is the best comedy actress!! ❤❤ 2024
Well done Melissa!! ❤
I absolutely love Melissa
She has always been awesome.
“Now everyone gets to sign my cast.”  She ALWAYS knows how to leave you laughing. ☺️
I absolutely love Melissa McCarthy, she is a gem
Adore her ❤
Melissa McCarthy is a national treasure! 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😍😍😍😍😂😂😍😍🤣🤣
Love Melissa ❤ being a fan of the original little mermaid, im not going to fall into the woke trap, but i can't think of a better person to play Ursula....
HONEY!!!  Why in the heck don't you people use HONEY???
Collecting feelings, yes!! We deserve to feel joy and sadness equally, it’s what makes us human!
That is so true about movies. I need comedy in a mix of a movie. She is spot on and one of my favorite actresses. Not one movie have i watched that i didn't enjoy or laugh. I even cried in Identity Thief and Heat. Melissa is a born actress that we need in our lives.
Sean is so comforting…plus he is so good at distracting them from the pain.
Melissa came prepared!!! 😂😂😂 A+++
i got a hotones ad, watching hotones
I was laughing so much that I was shaking!  This was delightful!  Thank you for enduring this for us Melissa!
THANK YOU ARC ANGLE MICHAEL FOR MELISSA MCCARTHY  MY NAME IS MELISSA WEATHERBEE  I M IN EMINEM FROM HAMILTON AND SASKATOON IF I COULD HAVE SOME ONE PLAY ME IN A MOVIE IT WOULD BE YOU THANK YOU FOR MAKING US LAUGH
I enjoy watching her in interviews. I truly hope she's as nice as she seems
My new life goal is to become famous enough to be invited to hot ones and then just immediately leave.
Legend
Noooo Melissa! Noooo! I felt so bad for her...and she cracked me up at the same time...
😅😅😅 love melissa so much 💖
I haven't cried while laughing like this in a long time😂😂😂
Sorry but I don't get Melissa McCarthy, and I really try, but just not funny. My loss I guess.
Made the mistake, the first time trying Da Bomb without really knowing what its significance was, of eating an entire spoonful of it in one go. Had an easier time with the one chip challange. Thought id throw up for a bit, but the endorphin high after was transcendental!
Wonderful interview. She's so down to earth.  It's fun like when you break your leg, now everyone gets to sign my cast
I don’t care what anyone says, Melissa is a gem and comedy needs to be pushed to the forefront of movie making. Her Ghostbusters movie was good for what it was supposed to be not what it got labeled!!
Lever is regrowing🙃
Melissa McCarthy is Expert Difficulty
Love this woman 💝
I love melissa mcarthy! ❤️🥰
¡Muchas gracias por el video tan útil! 🇲🇽
new body part coined on this one - "glattigopus" lol
I love Melissa so much she is my favorite actress ever
This one still makes me cry laughing. My nose is stuffy.
This has been my favorite episode. Thanks!
😂😂😂😂 i love how Melissa came prepared 😂😂
I see these videos occasionally. I love them. Please do something about the music. It really blows. Flowwers, puppies, beaches, etc. It’s not good. I don’t mean do anything like hip-hop or anything raucous, but better.
Love her!!
I feel bad for the tummy aches they’re going to have later.
❤
i love her
Ive tried "da bomb" it's like taking a bit out the sun
Heck yeah, GO LADY. VIDEO. STILL have yet to see THAT movie, gonna though. <3
I love the cartoon depictions
When she took DA BOMB that was soooo URSULA HAHAHAHAHA
Had no clue you’re from Crystal Lake… I’m on the border of Crystal Lake in Mchenry.  Nice area!
She is the funniest funniest I can't even look at her without remembering this little rap gig thing she did and cracking crackin up
« Comedies are important, they bring people together » so true. used to watch them with my gma before she passed all the time. was a big part of our bonding.
How much do they put on each wing? I see at the end they add a little blob but are the wings already coated in the sauce?
She's the actual best❤ some people just do life right and she's one of them.
We need to get Claudia Jessie on here!
You guys should get Josh Allen to do this... Buffalo QB... Who else to represent wings that originated in Buffalo...
Knowing she was a drag queen makes you understand her kind of humor better and I love ittt
I love this actrice so much😂😂❤
The background music though😂😂😂😂 I love you Melissa McCarthy❤
That skit with Jane curtain or whatever was gold ❤ Jane is a treasure and has been since I saw her in 3rd rock from the sun ❤
she has such a great laugh
Please Get Jason Statham NEXT 🙏🏼 i Loved Both Jason & Melissa On Spy. It Was One Of The Funniest Movies Ever!
she was fvcked from the get go she thought one was bad 😭
I love you Melissa McCarthy
Thank you Mrs. Melissa McCarthy. Your awesome this hands down definitely made my week and was one of my favorite episodes “ We Love You Beautiful Queen !!!” God bless ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love hearing and seeing famous people from Illinois and not far from the city I live in
Your wish has come true, Chris Hemsworth and his brother Liam Hemsworth are guilty of child abusing an innocent child, his name is Joshua Peter William Garbett, I will be reporting him and his brother and many many others to the police.
heeeeelpp i keep coming back to this one 🤣🤣 didn’t think she had it in her but she slayed
She’s so adorable
Melissa needs some Hidden Valley Ranch. You betta it's a blast!!
*flips him off* I’m effing done😂😂
The best reaction to “Da Bomb” I’ve ever seen. I admit that I’m a fan of Melissa and her humor is contagious because she makes me laugh even when I’m sad. Her naturalness is wonderful and every gesture hypnotizes. Thank you for bringing her to the program.
One of the best, almost near Gordon.
Love her!!!❤
Sean answer some replies or Hot Ones😊.
100 percent she is right comedy's are awesome and we all need to laugh
1:20 in and ANOTHER commercial???  Youtube is becoming trash. Trying to FORCE you to buy to avoid them.
If I have missed it, I am sorry. But he needs to have Tina Fey and Amy Poehler on this show.
I haven’t laughed so hard in a while 😂
God bless you Melissa! Thank you for your message of hope. I'm a hot sauce fanatic - but those wings must have been painful.
She is sooo cute!
Sean actin like he’s hurting as much as her is taking me out 😂
GET ONE TABLE. TWO IS TOO FAR AWAY!
Melissa is tremendous in every way, every moment she is in front of the cameras, seeing her is always a pleasure. Her reaction to “Da Bomb” is unmatched, I watch it again a thousand times, she makes me laugh out loud. A first class actress.
Goat is horrible......so rude!!
Love Melissa... I've been a fan for decades!!!
Brilliant
We need Melanie Martinez on this show lol
I love her!!! Epic episode 😂😂😂u took it like a g boo!!!
I would love it if you could just lower down the music volume of your shows a bit. Im autistic and I cant focus on the interview when the music is so loud. I never could watch one show completely because of that :(  thank you !
The great Robin Williams would have been on FIRE on this show. We miss you Mork...
Met at groundlings el coyote flex spa melrose spa. Knew she had it.❤
Really want to see Demi Lovato attack those wings! Lol
1.) She's awesome 2.) Please get Shannon Sharp on Hot Ones🔥
It’s the can of whip cream coming out for me!! Haha that is honestly so smart….
I love Melissa!!   She is not only naturally hilarious, but incredibly intelligent and mindful.   She is brilliant!
She's the BESTEST
Melissa McCarthy: "it hurts so much to smile." 15:57
MELISSA IS ADORABLE
Very smart Melissa milk works well
"And you try to breath in to live." 💀12:15
It hurts so much to smile!  She's awesome!
I lost it when we ate da bomb 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great Questions. Love MMcCarthy. --- music was suuuuuuuper distracting for me.
I just love everything about her <3 Such a wonderful human being!
I love Melissa! Such talent and beauty wrapped up in one package is a very rare and special thing!
sorry morge blood pink why?
Love you Melissa!!!! ❤❤❤
One of the best in show business she’s humble kind and funny af!!
She had many things to counteract the heat😂😂😂
Love Melissa McCarthy. I agree. We need to keep comedy shows and filmes alive. I love SciFi, but it's lost it's humour and gone so dark. 90s scifi was peak. Tired of all the doom and gloom.
She is the best ❤
This is my fav episode of hot wings so far
thank u n because of melissa mcharty im ur newest subscriber. ❤😂
Stomach ulcers be on ✨fleek✨
I love her so much!
Protect . This. Queen.
Melissa - you are by far my favs!
I rewound the DA BOMB reaction, at least 4 times.  Shes amazing
I didn't know that Sean was from crystal lake camp 😨
I lost all respect for her. Laughing and making jokes about a person who's dying of cancer is not comedy to me.  She's a good comedian , just not my style.
One wish. Just the one. Get Adele on this. I beg you 😂🙏
THE PROBLEM IS NOT WHEN EATING IT  IT'S WHEN IT COMES OUT. MY FAVORITE COMEDIAN. ALL NATURAL. LOVE IT!
Mrs. McCarthy is a national treasure.
I would love to see Mike Tyson do the wing gauntlet. That would be epic. I’m gonna paste this everywhere to get Sean’s attention.
She’s absolutely stunning and I love her personality
I'll bet that Sean Spicer couldn't have pulled off this feat! And by the third wing, trump himself would have claimed that the system was rigged against him and walked off set, while claiming that he'd done the best that any participant had ever done.
So he's from Crystal Lake. Does he eat like this to keep Jason Voorhees away?
15:57, 17:39, 19:15, 20:25
Comparing the hottest sauce to Wasabi, is there a significant difference? Wasabi 😍
LOL, she said, trying to breathe in to live! 😂
I love ya Mel ,but that's what you get for  using JC as a curse word 😂 !
Her  christmas tree was hanging upside down
Sean: “who is your bread guy” “Jesus Christ bc this my last supper”
I could never do this test. I have 0 tolerance for spicy stuff.
21:52 "You know what? We're already dead" had me rolling
Do they have medics standing by when they do this ?? Yikes! Brave people! We ❤ Melissa McCarthy.
❤‍🔥
Brilliant 🎉😂 great episode!
I just love Melissa so this one I thoroughly enjoyed🥶
I'm wondering if people can get some serious issues from the super spicey sauces...?!
Awe🫢, I actually feel sorry for  Melissa 😮‍💨
Her Sean Spicer bits on SNL still make my sides hurt.
Loved bridesmaids so much!
She’s so amazing
'Hit the COWWWW!!'😂😂😂😂12:35
Bridesmaids Spy The Heat Identity Thief
This background music doesn’t fit the vibe at all 😂😂
13:00 completely agree with her
Ibs and this show would not work for me but kudos to these ppl lolol
I can't imagine their stomachs later lol
Get Sandra Bullock and Sarah Paulson on Hot Ones ASAP 🙌🏼😂
Portage, MI was just hit with a tornado and a few days before that there was another tornado warning but the pressure was really weird while there was thunder and lightning outside right before it started to downpour. It was because of this video where Melissa McCarthy talks about the pressure difference with tornados that I knew something bad might happen there soon. I had a horrible feeling a tornado would hit in the same area a few days later. A few days later a high end EF2 tornado hit Portage (135 mph winds, 1 mph short of EF3). Nobody died. Maybe it was because we watched hot ones…
McCarthy will take 200 ea.   -onset/post haste [x] already had at "wings" btw  all just only brain dendrites   ..as reality bites;P
Wearing shorts is just a bad idea lol 😂
Such a funny and lovely lady. i love her s2
The more hot it got the more vilgar she got 😂😂😂😂 i love it
She was the best sea witch i loved her ursela
In 5-10 years, he'll have developed a whole in his stomach..it's not healthy to eat  pepper daily.
Melissa is a good sport, funny as all get out and actually, quite pretty, IMO.  As far as going to a theater to watch a  movie, I don't see that happening.  Last time I went, I left after confronting some folks about using their mobile phones . . . on speakerphone.  They wanted to fight a 70 year old man just so they could use their phones in a theater.  Needless to say, the 16 year old attendant sure as heck wasn't going do anything.  So much for phone etiquette . . . I miss going to the movies!
ded
I've found that Lemonade is one of the best chasers to tame the heat in the mouth when eating hot or spicy wings.
Why 2 tables this time ?
Key Glock for hot ones
Have you had the creator of pepper x and soon y on???🤔 ❤
This woman is naturally just hilarious. She’s up there with Gilda until she disappoints me
That's such a goood episode how did i not see it she is brilliant
Is it always the same sauces?
At first she started confident and happy  now we can see the sadness on her eyes 😂😂😂😂
I love Melissa wish i could meet her!
I totally lost it when she said the following. 'I hate you', 'You have the shitiest job on earth'. At one point, she gave him the finger.    LOL   LOL   LOL
None of these sauces have anywhere near the scoville level of the one I tired that a coworker brought into work. 6 million scoville I took it like a champ but about 20 mins later if felt like my insides were gonna rupture lol brutal. The end I think it was called
Melissa McCarthy love you girl . I went to watch your movie love love funny 😂😂😂😂😂she is like Kevin hart version female so confident and joke about her and it’s amazing 😂😂😂😂😂I want to see her in standup 😂😂😂😂😂
I know I know I know I know I know I know
I got to try da bomb and one of my local places has a hotter one than that. It's called Reaper.   I could eat da bomb no problem now I have to try the last dab but on the show it says it's not as bad as da bomb.   Da bomb is only like one or two levels hotter than Buffalo hot sauce for me. It's got punch but nothing that I can't handle. No milk needed. And no side effects afterwards
The music is out of place and distracting 🫠 I love her though
Why is it so funny to watch someone in such agony
I feel so bad for her ☹️ why did she agree to do this?!
What's your legal situation 😂😂😂😂
17:53 Well, now we know where Jesús is.
17:53 The Eucharist in live action
FYI. Everyone on your shows look very pink.. there eyes, eyelids, nose area., and chest areas. White balance is off or something. I've seen this on many episodes.
Da bomb is always the worst.. but she is the best!! 🎉 so funny
When she brought up how much older she is that Sean i had to look it up. I thought i was older than her, shes 12 years older than me. She aged great!
she doesnt lose her sense of humor even while dying lol
I loved this interview ❤
it will be mostly sad and the rest expected/funny when the host ultimately steps down from crohns disease
Melissa McCarthy could charm the tentacles off of Ursula.
Comedy definitely is important! Melissa brought so many smiles & laughter when I was in a dark place. Thank you so much for being this beautiful colourful person Melissa ♥️
Melissa accidentally doing Whip-its on camera is hilarious.
What’s in the spray bottle
Crystal Lake?  Sean Vorhee?
This guy is the best interviewer ever!
My 9 year old did da bomb twice. He’s way tougher than me 😂
Melissa McCarthy modern day Lucille Ball!
lol….she’s great.
Melissa McCarthy is the best person EVER!! I absolutely love her.
You need to do a compilation of all the Bomb 💣 wings!!!
She is such a sweetheart
BEST episode ever!  I love Melissa McCarthy, she is the funniest comedian ever.   Thanks for the laugh.   You ROCK Melissa. lol   As for the question "What antidote would you bring if you were a guest on Hot Ones?"  Sour Cream is the only thing I'd bring, it works really well to cut the heat.
I absolutely Love! Love! Love! Melissa McCarthy!!
I like her and think she did a great job.  She did better than I would have done, and I like hot sauce.
She looks so much better now with the weight loss.
Sean: I’m no superhero… But I’m pretty close
Melissa is so awesome!! Totally cool 💛💛
They need some wet wipes for their fingers.
Isn't she an absolute delight?
If anyone isn't familiar with the 1990 Plainfield, IL tornado it was an F5 that is not talked about much, but it happened so fast and was so bad And there were literally no warnings sent out no sirens or anything, that there is literally no footage of it. Most tornadoes go from SW to NE and this one went NW to SE.  That must have been really traumatic for her. I grew up between where her and Sean were and I think it wasn't uncommon from Midwestern kids to have irrational fears of tornadoes, I know I did
She did such a beautiful tribute to Farley on SNL40 . Phenomenal,  and it made everyone who ever loved anything he did proud, like she killed it and the fact that she got to wear his actual jacket from it must have been such an honor. Can't wait to see what she does next year for 50.
Melissa McCarthy's voice got lower and lower. What a trooper!
Sean is so skilled at conversation, interpersonal interaction, presence and banter, but then he spouts out these wooden questions that are such a contrast to his actual personality and charm. It's just a winning combination that makes it all more entertaining and funny. I always hear Mikey Day's voice when Sean switches to his long questions. Hilarious.
She’s my starfish!!!
Holy cow. She's Lucky her friend was so up on tornadoes.
We're in for one today  Lol yup
Laughing so hard it can't breathe.......it hurts from laughing
I like that her first plug is, "I'm a mother of two"  ❤
Did he just say Joliet😂 !!! Wooooohhooo lol
I'm only here to watch McCarthy suffer.
I would love to see Kelly Ripa and her husband do this show.
Please  do a Kardashian.
What a lovely warm charcuterie board 🤣🤣🤣
Whos your bread guy
Who knew hot wings turned Melissa McCarthy into Tammy Faye Bakker
SUKI!!!!
If anyone here cares…when you are looking for relief from the hot, drinking something only floats the oil that is the source of the heat.   Bread, rice, potato all act to soak up the oil and bring relief.
Why are they seat so far apart?
This show baffles me as to why nobody ask for rice ?
Melissa is my favorite celebrity on this show.
Lookout Melissa.  You will get the red chili quick step.
Melissa McCarthy, thanks for that Farley story. Yeah, I remember thinking when watching you do that sketch, she is jumping into some big shoes while surrounded by absolute legends. And she absolutely killed it!
It was interesting to see Melissa Mccarthy take on Hot Ones, she did well honestly !!
No lie I would love to hit that😂
Just realize i never heard her in english, only the woman who make her voice in portuguese hahahaha thats crazy The dramatic reaction is everything
She's appolyonian XD
I absolutely looove Melissa. But the Ursula makeup was a sabotage . A talentless disgrace
❤😊😊😊
I can't sign her cast, but I will say I love Melissa McCarthy. I did not know about Ursula. I will watch it.
Is there someone who eats all wings at once?
THE QUEEN ACTRESS ❤❤❤❤
😍😍😍🧚‍♀️😍😍😍
the milk spray bottle took me out 🤣shes hilarious
She’s just legit and it’s you can see her not just as an actress or comedian here, but her. The laughter and honesty, maturity showing  etc
Melissa McCarthy is THE FUNNIEST. I mean, the spray, the bread, and "what's your legal situation", really got me 😅 and she does it completely natural, I don't understand why she hasn't won an Oscar yet
Love the show, they should invite influencers from Tik tok 🙂
I just love her. Suki!!!!
Their poor buttholes will thank them after its all said and done. Lol
She is super funny
I love Melissa 🥹❤️
This is THE WORST MUSIC EVER. DOES NOT EVER GO WITH THE SEGMENT.
Palm Sunday tornado 1965! Friends lost 3 sides of their home in Crystal Lake!!!! The sky that afternoon from Streamwood where I  was , pea green color and DEAD QUIET... NO BIRDS. Nussbaums, our neighbors left their basement door open for us neighbors (they were one of the few with a basement in the neighborhood) to access 24/7. amazing huh?  Melissa's story is another  wicked weather trial!!!
The music is very distracting...
"Oh! I feel that in my 'uvula'...wait that might be lower." Love her love her!!
Do you guys heat up the wings between takes?
Has Amy Shumer done this show?
What’s the music in the back at the end. It’s so nice 🥺
“We’re already dead…”
Love you both..Love from the CHI!!!!❤
I went to Catholic high school with her, she has not changed at all except she isn’t as gothic… Her and her sister are the sweetest ever! Love ya Melissa!
Her small business pizza loan skit and her skit where her character joins a women’s group and talks her wishes to avenge the death of her father on SNL are 2 skits I always go back to. Not many non-regulars have iconic skits, and she has TWO (at minimum).
How she kept pulling props out 🤣🤣🤣
I have some who can meet those hot wings. They need to do one where others that aren't celebrities that can change him.
00:00
00:29 I have the record for the lowest time on this video
Love Melissa McCarthy
16:28 playing funny with that one is the worst you can do, if you caugh or sneeze is over
22:14 HER HEAD I CANT BREATHE ABAHHABAA
“As you try to breathe in— to live— it gets worse” she’s so funny   HIT THE COW
I heard bread or salt help with the spicy?
I wonder which line up and what year most loved or hated.
funny woman I love her :) and I don't know if you've ever heard of ayran, it's a Turkish drink. It is very good at eliminating the bitter taste of bitter foods. You should add it to drinks.
I've always had a huge crush on her.  She's real and genuine.
“as you try to breathe in .. to live” that had me in TEARSSSS😭😭😭😭
Good Afternoon from New Zealand 🇳🇿 John Teni Teni
I was 11 years old living in Lockport Illinois when that tornado hit Plainfield Illinois
This episode was one of my favorites.  Melissa was so down-to-earth and willing to feast, even though she isn't into spicy ❤
I agree with her comment on how dark movies have gotten. Just not fun at all anymore. I have not even seen a movie trailer that even makes me want to see anything lately. What happened to good old fashioned entertainment rather than gore and sadness?
What's your legal situation?  Bedt episode ever!
The Milk Spritzer IS brilliant!
I love her. She is so naturally hilarious.
For GOD so Loved the world that He Gave His One and Only Begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, so that anyone who Believes in Him will not perish but have Eternal Life (John 3:16)
Did Melissa totally burn Guy Fieri? 😂😂
😂😂😂
Lol "hit the cow!"
😂😂😂😂 Thanks for the big laughs!
I love this show
12:48 Love what she said about the importance of (good) comedy films
Her eyes were SO RED in the intro!
I would love to see one of these episodes live streamed!
She is freakin’ adorable ❤
5:21 got me teary eyed.. just imagine Farley on hot ones !😢
I still can't get P.J. snl skit outta my mind. My body is a tool...the swiss army knife of thespians!!!
Don't mind Melissa, just accidentally doing a whip-it on hot ones 😂 that might be how she made it to the end, from outer space
Yesssss it was a beautiful movie and yes Mccarthy did great
8:18 talks about the tornado. You're welcome
You did it!!! 🎉 lol I love you Melissa !
I love Melissa McCarthy so much! :)
Honestly never been a fan of Melissa McCarthy but this interview changed my mind she’s hilarious kind and insightful
I am obsessed with Hot Ones, Thank you for bringing joy to my mornings ♥
“I would be Melissa McCarthy.” - Mo’nique
19:33 😂😂😂
I laughed  so hard .😂
She lost it, but I'm here for her!!! Boy, did she come prepared, though! I'm like "Where the bread come from"?! 😄😄😄
This was my favorite episode lol
I wouldn't bring anything cuz I love spicy stuff I don't even care that I have acid reflux
lol her, she’s got such a great personality!
Too 5 movie soundtracks of the world? Sean buddy, it was famously horrible. Like, it did not do well at all.
She is the funniest woman alive, Imho
You know what? Good on you Melissa tossing him a piece of bread.  That was a solid move!
Oh Melissa you’re the hottest sauce ever 🥰well done doll! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
21:24
😮 oh.. 🙂 I like the picture of you all in Adidas uniforms. 😏 With the Nike shoes. 🤭 Now that's comedy!
Sean, studies show anticipation makes pain worse. Don't warn the guests.
Melissa I love you so much ❤ 😊
Guinness !
Has this show ever had a repeat guest or are they completly thrown off after their first appearance?
She is so beautiful. Well done Melissa. 👍
Otherwise use natural raw honey it will also work.
The best thing for spicy foods specially very hot food is dark chocolate let it melt push it around your tongue.
SIU in Carbondale is my local college and ngl it is cool af that she went there, honestly praying she comes to a sporting event sometime there so I can meet her. Also, she is by far my favorite actress. The heat is the funniest movie I’ve ever seen. If you haven’t seen it, definitely check it out. I hope she sees this😂
the fact that the crew members were laughing shows how hilarious Melissa is...
"Oh this is an application moment". 😂😂😂😅
she’s a very beautiful woman and her smile 😍✨
Imo, funniest hot ones ever! ❤
I absolutely LOVE Melissa! She took it like a champ!
so happy to see some fellow illinoisians thriving
We gotta stop eating animals!
Awesome
Drinking water  A set up for sure  lol
🤌🏾🥰😍😘Melissa🥰😘😍😘🥰😘😍😘🥰😘😍😘🥰😘😍😘🥰😘😍😘🥰😘😍😘🥰😘😍😘🥰😘😍🫴🏾👑👸 One of The G.o.a.t. 💐💐💐💐💐💐🌺🌸🌼
Line she sayed between 12-14 min . Shes a great person
Ms. McCarthy, if you ever read this, I just want to say thank you. Your views on comedy and your very professional approach to comedy is admirable. Thank you for giving me laughter and the will to keep living...
She just makes me feel good.
Melissa McCarthy is def the closest I’ve seen a guest come to having a medical emergency during an episode.
I love her 😅😅😅
Melissa McCarthy comedy the best😀
Oh just take some CBD cannabis oil ❤
I hope they talk about SPY. Its her best and funniest movie
Here because of Monique
Melissa, your so pretty, and you got funny on top of it
her because of club shay shay.
What a beautiful person she is!
🤣 😅 I LOVE HER
Glad to know Disney still lets white people play villains.
There are the same words again......the herniated disc sciatica pain exclamation. 😅
She reminds me of my high school girlfriend who is still hilarious to me 40 years later. Yes, we're still friends.
I’m loving that she keeps bringing things out. That baguette 🥖was amazing!!
like 20 secs in and Im IN.
I live near Plainfield. That whole area is overrun with poverty, homelessness, criminals. Joliet, Romeoville, the whole area is terrifying.
I wish he could have asked her or brought up her role as Suki St. James on Gilmore Girls.  I thought she done a great job on that show. That where I first saw her acting
You do not have the host’s name anywhere and I want to know his name.  Atleast credits belong in the description box. Plzzzzz
💋 Melissa
Incredible as Ursula. Truly wonderful talent, and what a great woman. Mad respect. ❤
Please invite her again. She's so funny
Haha I’ve never seen a guest bring sooooo many helpers and I’m here for it. Also never heard a guest make the crew laugh so much, like couldn’t edit it out
I just cried when she talked about Chris Farley
The fact that he still tries to interview them while they’re vulnerable and falling apart makes this the only true interview show. Guards and facades and characters are destroyed!
i love her soo much, i love every movie shes in including ghostbusters. it was a good movie people decided it was a bad movie before it even came out... anyway i really love her.
"Maybe go to the spray?!"🤣🤣🤣
This is so funny I’m in tears 😂😂😂
"Whats so funny about Peace Love and understanding."..Elvis costello and also "Look for the Helpers"..Fred Rogers .Two of my favorite humans
C'mon Sookie, you got this!
I love how Hot Ones gives us glimpse into new parts of people's personalities. ❤
I think comedies are the most important, but also requires quality writing talent
Where's Tommy Wiseau?
Bring matpat on 😔😔😔
When she said “till my last breath, which will be in about 4 more wings” I bursted out laughing.   She’s very likable. And that story about the lightning strike is crazy😟
Melissa did better than dj khalid. Hahahahahhaah
Jonathan Tyner Tries Not To Cry While Eating Spicy Wings | Hot Ones
Mark Weins would be awesome to have on. Seems like he can take the heat!!
Sean!  I’m from Crystal Lake too!  My kids went to South.  Love Melissa so much!
She is so down to earth and such a great actress and very funny just love her to death. What a sweetheart.👍🏼🤩🫡❤️
pretty sure she turned into Kathleen Turner for a sec on that last one. 🤣
I love Melissa McCarthy
Every time I see an experience like this I’m just reminded of how big of a baby Shaq is. If Melissa Mccarthy can die and soldier through them so can a 7’ 300 lb. athlete.
❤I love her .where can I buy this..
We all love her ❤
I've never laughed so much at an episode 😂
Ummm watching this, with no wings, no hot sauce.  my eye itched and i legit panicked for a second thinking id rubbed pain into my eyeball.
She’s awesome and I wanna see that movie now
That was fun to watch YOU go thru that, Melissa.  Lol
She's such a G.  Even though she prefaced with she doesn't do spicy.
She lasted longer than every other person I've seen dawg . Shes an OG
The way she reschin for everything and pops out with bread😅
I love her. The milk in the spray bottle 😅
she no funny. never.
I would bring a knife
I think this is my favourite episode of them all 😁
I am really not that far away from those places in IL.
Love her!!
Poor baby her eyes just make me go awe and her little I don’t know if it works
Melissa is the best and this was truly hilarious and enjoyable to watch over and over.
I absolutely loved this interview. Mr. Sterling K Brown was funny, articulate, and entertaining. Can watch it over and over. Thank you Mr. Brown and Sean.  Great job to you both.
Love her 👍🏽❤️👍🏽
Mads next!
"It's fun in the kind of way like when you break your leg and then you're like, oh will everyone sign my cast?!"  I can't 🤣🤣
I perished from laughing when she said "Oh, that's helpful!" After pouring the milk into the ice 😂
"You try to breathe in, to live..." 😂😂😂
yawl knew dave,.... im Brian,.... the real1,....
she is so adorable <3 its impossible not loving her such a chubby bear <3
She is my favorite
Love this show ! So wondering how to play an at home episode with a season box  of sauces and like invite friends over to challenge each sauce with random questions  lol Sorry dont mean to sound lame but i think it be a fun party card game
Her truest superpower is honesty. Ms. McCarthy is an amazing actress, and if what we see here is truly her, an amazingly beautiful soul.
Melissa McCarthy and Sean Evans have been to Carbondale! When I say I'm from near there most people have no idea what I'm talking about.
I love that Melissa showed up with all those potential heat fixes that she just randomly pulls out lol. Melissa is so awesome.
🦹🏾‍♀️ Feeling this episode.
Buon anno melissa ❤❤❤
“You’ve gotta have lawyers around the CLOCK” 😂😂😂 had me dead
I blasted through the small at home challenge, but I'd love to try the full challenge. I wish you had an average Joe/ Gal next door challenge. To meet and eat with you would just be a burning blast
She was on Gilmore girls I think she can handle anything
She’s one of my favorite comedic actors for sure. She seems like such a kind, genuine, and warm person. I always laugh so hard at her movies, and her improvised outtakes in some of her movies made me cry laughing. Her version of the song from Pocahantas on Jimmy Fallon was so funny, too.
Anyone else here because of the SNL episode? 😂
She looks like a dragon at the end 🤣🤣
i would give Sean a run for his $ on this show..
I had to look up her playing Chris Farley she did amazing!!! It takes a lot to play him and she NAILED IT 🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂
when Lady Gaga?🔥🔥🔥
invite @kallmekris and @celinaspookyboo please🔥
😢😢😢no, I'm not so moved that my eyes got teary.That piece of advice      is both powerful and protective!
The best😂😂😂😂
Kudos Melissa. I absolutely love your sitcom & movies. You are a real trooper to be on Hot Ones.
She is one of the best guests
She is so cute
She is a truly funny woman. I loved her in Gilmore girls.
Mellissa   is so funny and enjoyed the ep and wish there were more r rated comedy moives for a good laugh for a bit and forget
Just love her 😂
Melissa's reaction to 'Da Bomb' , is by FAR the BEST reaction EVER on Hot Ones!! 🤣😂🤣
For u Gorgeous of Melissa Mac Carthy😘😘😘
Good one.... I enjoyed the trip
u guys…reptilian eyes at 10:28
yah need to get the Rock, Adele, Mark Wahlberg, george Lopez and Sandra Bullock
Audio conquest fabricated rated Costa bag I got my bag I smoke steam too
Retired from kevin
The water looks so good and COLD 😩😩😩
Melissa McCarthy is an absolute amazing person. Plus, she name dropped SIUC!!!
I just love her!!
Best episode ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why don't you have Milk or Yogurt to rid of the heat??? Ice water doesn't help.
You are the real guy
I really thought he’d have a Gilmore girls questions😭😭
How interesting that you grew up in Crystal  Lake. I grew up in Carpentersville Illinois
SOMEONE GET HER ICE CREAM 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🥵🥵🥵🥵🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦
by far the best hot ones!!
I love Sean’s interviewing skills so much! It’s unmatched
She was incredible in the little mermaid
Man do I love Melissa McCarthy! I can not handle any spicy foods. Props to her for going all the way! I can only imagine what this will do to your stomach. I laughed so hard I almost peed myself. I love everything I’ve ever seen her do. Great host for this terrible adventure! 🤣❤️
This is my favorite one 😂
First We Feast can we get Kelly Clarkson on Hot Ones ?? I feel like she would make another amazing episode!
No Gilmore girl talk 💔
What is your legal situation like! 😂🤣
She seems like she would be the coolest Aunt ever.
😢I almost cried when she was talking Chris R I.P he took over you that's why you flew in the galaxy 😂😂❤❤
I watch a boatload of these and she is Absolutely Freaking Hilarious!!! I'm freaking dying!🤣🤣🤣
LOL poor Sean its like when he interviews girls its like he is the doc delivering the bebe!
"... I will fight till my last breath ... till four more wings "...:D
The real US interviewer for anyone.  No joke interviewer.
Need to do the truth or dab all the time bro.. way more interesting
I wholeheartedly share Melissa McCarthy's sentiment on comedy - bad comedies and bad movies don't work, but when done properly a comedy easily becomes a favourite. The Superhero fatigue is real, the movies might still be good but we've all seen it 50 times and need something different to appreciate what we have. I really hate that Hollywood has been putting their eggs into one basket for such a long time
She is so beautiful
she came for the free food
I thought u were suppose to eat bread after u eat hot peppets!
charcuterie board is HILARIOUS
I hope Sean can still taste women don’t burn those buds
I actually added a few dabs of Apollo to my chili while watching this and I totally get it. Full-sensory explosion. It's really hot, but the flavor is worth it if you can take it.
Hilarious ¡😂
Love Melissa! You rocked it girl!❤
my mouth is on fire if i eat hot cheetos so i would die if i did this
I frigging adore her.
Doing a binge today. How did I not know that Sean is from Crystal Lake?! I'm from 20 mins up the road in Woodstock.
I want to trademark a sauce called spicey kitten
I love Melissa so much 😂😂😂
I absolutely LOVE her!!! Da bomb I have and itssssss ruthless!! I put it in my chili tho and love it lol
Love this show ...the questions are thoughtful ..the guests are so interesting ...the reactions from the guests are funny ..etc
😂😂😂 she is hilarious
I would not go there, because I eat plantbased and because I can‘t digest milk. I would rely on cold water and bread. I would find it much more interesting to taste all kinds of peperonies in a dish. Black mole from Oaxaca and so on. (This is no cooked mole. 😀But it has pork and lard…..and many different kinds of peperoni and mexican chocolate.) New blends of spices…. but I know it started out as a hoax and you have to show a little courage. It’s funny.
The little mermaid is a fairytale about true love and it has a sad ending. Andersen created such wonderful a world in the ocean, that it became my favourite fairytale. It’s not for small children. The times must have been moralistic and bigoted, but there is a lot of wisdom in the tale.
She's suffered, but only while she was eating. Afterwards she was fine. Just fine lol
Can i say...u ruined that movie!
Such a pretty lady
I love her😂
She's so right about the dark side of television amd movies these days. Ive had to rewatch shows and movies multiple times lately because everthings so grim.
A comedic legend.
Oh my gosh! What a sweety pie! First actress I've  seen to be humble and real!
Comedy is not dead.  I watched 'Da Bomb' five times.
When she said, "darker, darker, darker...", all I could hear was the marionette terrorists in Team America: World Police.
I’ve never heard the stage hands laughing so audibly on one of these.  She’s just naturally hilarious.
Love her... funny, pushes social limits, attractive, owns it, and she eats real wings, not cauliflower vegan wing's.
Was a little sad Sean didn't ask any questions about Gilmore Girls! Haha
My stagefright helped me realize how nervous i can be to perform, even in conversation. Hearing Melissas story about wanting to play a chris farley role and be respectful, and doing it while being so unsure but faithful in the skit and herself, made me so happy ❤
“I’m not a hero— I still have feelings” 😂
I love this woman!
she will always be sookie saint james to me my baby
09:30 wow
I want someone to go on there and switch wings with him 😂
One of the funniest Da Bomb moments I’ve ever seen lol laughed sooo hard
It is surprising how many weaklings go all the way and add a last dab. I think something about thinking to answer the interview questions must distract them from the pain and make it more bearable. I bet the pain doesn't really plateau until after they leave and have nothing to distract them from the burn.
The questions are top notch, seriously the time they take to truly find memories and nostalgia is amazing. I love that in this interview, they're enjoying actual sit down lunch with a friend vibe conversation.
I absolutely LOVE  her❤
Love this one but the music over her interview is too much.
This is SUCH a good one.  Now I like MM even more than I did before.
She is my FAVORITE ❤
I love her!
God she’s so unfunny
I love her in Gilmore girls
She is so beautiful. Love you Melissa.
That tornado story scared the Be Jesus out of it.  It was so real and she told it so well.
❤😂I absolutely love her. She's great! Wonderful talent
Just now watching this one. I have never had much respect for her than in this episode. When you see somebody struggling and she willing share the bread with him before he asked. You can tell somebody who has a good heart. I salute you!
🌹🇮🇱🤍‌‬⁬💙🇺🇸🇺🇦❤‌‬⁬🤍💙💛‌‬⁬
There are so many layers to Melisa and all of them are wonderful
Awesome lady... too bad she is shilling a garbage movie.
Melissa is very funny! Disney destroyed the little mermaid........with their WOKE nonsense.
Shoutout bread guy
@firstwefeast Way too many ad breaks!
It's going through my like hot lava!!!
Imagine what their livers stomachs and gallbladders are thinking once they’re left to deal with it.
"No hes not doing any press" "No I'm gonna speak to Amelia!" 🥺 You are some of my fav people on this app, your shows are so distinct and every guest you have seems so genuinely interested in being there and you treat them with the same enthusiasm. I know these aren't the same as tv talk shows but I've never seen so many guests consistently be excited to sit down with both of you and I don't get nearly this consistently amped to watch an interview or date week after week bc I'm not just there for my fav talent I'm there for you (and to see how many ppl keep up the bit with Amelia) and this crossover episode is literally the highlight of my month I can already tell.
It's like the Bridesmaids scene agsin.. hot lava is pouring out meeeeee 😂
I'm yelling at the video, "TAKE SMALL BITES! TAKE SMALL BITES!!!!"  Noooooo, too big of a bite, spit it out!!! 😂
I'm still an Illinois resident. I lived in Plainfield for 26 years before moving to Bolingbrook. I was 4 and in preschool when the 1990 tornado happened.
She is so funny 🤣
GOAT!
Love this!  Is the background music throwing anyone else for a loop?
her da bomb reaction is legendary lol
she's right. Comedy is sooo important. It connects everybody and allows us to reflect on the absurdities of life
I remember watching the 40th. Maybe she was channeling Chris... she said she felt almost like she wasn't in control, makes sense in an odd way
She’s one of the funnier female actresses haha
My elderly father is obsessed with Melissa. A national treasure!
This girl squirting milk in her mouth I love me some Melissa McCarthy😆
So I’ve always used a *plain* carb for cooling down after eating something spicy… Like plain rice, plain tortilla chips, plain bread. 🔥🔥🔥❤️💕
she's absolutely lovely, this was entertaining
get daVE MUSTAINE
This show disarms them in a way that truly shows their natural, human, qualities. So refreshing and revealing at times. An intimate and emotional glimpse.
So good episode! I wanted to hit the like button so many times 😂❤
I feel like they just trauma bonded so hard.
She is so talented. I SEE the potential. She needs serious roles
She seems so lovely
To her comments about comedy, laughter is the best medicine.
What a treasure!  Funny, cute, relatable - she's awesome!
She the best 👍👍👍👍👍😎
…there were some funny episodes, but Melissa McCarthy was by far the FUNNIEST!  😭😭😭😭😭
Megan must’ve channeled through her afterwards and made whatever was in her come out of her like lava! 😂
I like when Sean gets paranoid lol
She is the embodiment of midwestern warmth. Comfortable, honest, a bit self deprecating and at the same time playfully insulting out of respect. I didn't know she was so self aware and wholesome.
I watched this video after I found out about the CRT pushed in the new Little Mermaid movie. I boycotted the movie along with Dwayne Johnson, Oprah and anything related to the democratic party. Sorry I will never watch a hot ones video with a liberal on it.
She is like me when she started, I don't do spicy!
I Love Melissa so much
17:38 XD
Melissa McCarthy as Ursula is the best part of the movie.  She did an incredible job.
My favorite sauce is El Yucateco green habanero sauce it's gotta good flavor and it's plenty warm, I'd love to go on Hot one's
I just love Melissa! She did a great job!
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
She cracks me up. Now i wanna go watch Tammy again
She was in many of the best comedies of the past 15 years or so right?
16:30❤😂❤
Im crying laughing at bread out if nowhere 😂 🤣🤣🤣
I will fight til my last breath which will be in about 4 more wings that comedies are important... She is so naturally funny and amazing with words. Love her!!! 13:28
Melissa is charming and fun. Great guest
His stomach lining has to be something else!
Ursula!!
This was great!
Melissa ❤ I love her, she's so incredible! Amazing actress & so fun ❤
*Casually bites out of a loaf of bread* “somebody said it helps I don’t know” 😭😂
You should do Quentin Tarantino!!! That would be epic 😂🤍
what a gorgeous, hilarious woman.
Will Ramos or anyone from the metal community
Title is wrong, it's supposed to read "Melissa McCarthy IS THE WORST!"
“My glotaglopis?”😂
Quick question: what do they do with the sauces after every episodes ? Because every time the sauces are not open
Sean’s gonna need serious help from a gastroenterologist
i love her so much 🥰🥰
Little mermaid remake was awful. Like your going to remake than make it amazing or equal to the first. Disney, stop doing live action. It's not good. Make new movies. Do not remake. New stories new characters ECT.
I love that even when she's suffering terribly she's still absolutely hilarious 😂❤
She reminds me of my mother, very similar. I also grew up in Crest hill / Joliet, must be something in the air 🌪️
Lol Whats your legal situation ?!!!!!????? Hahahahahahah lol hahaha
I've watched several of these, this was probably one of the best out of all of them. 👍👍👍
❤ Such a total fan of Melissa McCarthy - such an artist and pro - laughter is the best medicine.  You are a true gem!
Her smile is infectious.
Melissa McCarthy is an American treasure. I love her
Gotta say, the music is quite annoying.  Great show, but annoying musc
Mind blown. I would never think the loud mouth from Deadwood is responsible for Mccarthy's success.
Love Melissa McCarthy!!!  Great sport and so funny!
gets flips off then it cuts to "what gets you fired up.." hahaha
BTw I loved her Ursula She was awesome and she made it her own. I'm proud of her 😊 👏👏 👏
I really like Melissa. She seems like a person that I could actually be friends with. She's so relatable and I  love all her shows and watch all her movies. Watching her shows kind of helps me with my Depression. I myself is a robust lady lol. so I relate to her in that sense and I truly wish That I could meet her or speak with her to see how she handles problems with weight and other issues. But u know It's probably never going to happen but I think about her and pray for her and wish her well u know. I enjoyed this video :)
Just to think that this channel started with interviewing influencers on social media to now interviewing celebrities is wild! The questions are always so different from what anything any other interviewer would ask and really make the interviewee think while their mouth is on FIRE but the answers always provide an insight on their life that the public would never know were it not for this interview. I'm so happy for the growth of this channel (and I bless Sean's poor taste buds after all these takes lol) and look forward to watching more hilarious and insightful interviews. Cheers!
Super intelligent, super funny and brave af. You rock Melissa.
Melissa you are Beautiful! ❤️
LOVED HOW SHE HANDLED HER TORTURE BLESSED!!!
Melissa is my favorite! thanks for bringing her on the show, she did a wonderful job ❤
I love her!!😂😂 one of my favorite actors
It's for EVERYBODY-WE CAN SIT SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH STRANGERS & ENJOY THE MOVIE/Etc. We ALL Laughed@ Her Pain.
😂
😂😂😂😂😂🔥🤪
The baguette 😂😂😂
When she pulled out the bread 😂😂😂😂
Sean ever heared of wipes for thr guest
I Love her❤️❤️❤️❤️
Melissa is amazing, you actually see the heat hit her yet she soldiers on delightfully. And of course Sean is always engaging, polite and relatable.
She said when you try to breathe in to live 😂😂😂😂it gets worst
I love Melissa Mcarthy
I love her in Tammy.
I never really payed attention to the music playing when the guests eat da bomb . But it makes me feels like I’m there and I’m dealing with the hot sauce 😂 I’m over here stressing trying to find a way to clear the heat 😂😂
I love it that the celebrities get really honest and real on this show.  Who knew hot sauce could bring out the genuine quality in people?
🥰🥰💵💵💵💵🤣🤣👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑💵💵
She's very brave and strong!!
Hello Melissa, first we feast, yeah that's true. ❤
i love the laughing in the background, i think it makes it so much more authentic. But i saw the Diablo 4 promo....
I love Melissa and is Virgo all the way. I love her in every movie she does. We are realistic people and we are amazing people too and down to earth.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤love her
*isn’t the goal to be good?* 😂😂😂😂😂
It's the fact that everyone could not hold in they laugh 😅😅😂😂😂
I guess you are kinda funny. Sorry
The worst I ever had was in a Mexican Restaurant in South Africa, a double shot of tequila tasted like sunflower oil ......., just for reference I do my own Fermented Carolina Reaper Hot sauce, so not scared of the spice but stuff me...
16:30 That's an RIP!
You have gotta Love her🫶🏻🙏🏼🤗
After the video she was caught yelling "it's coming out of me like lava!!!!!!" while running to the toilet
I actually love her 😭
Fun fact shes the cousin of Jennifer McCarthy
Melissa McCarthy is someone that just thinking about her or seeing her instantly brings a smile to your face. Love her.
I love Melissa McCarthy, I will always love Melissa McCarthy 😭 She's amazing 🥺
She is my favorite actress. That Ghost Buster movie was awesome.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love her, great show Sean.
This is indeed my favorite  episode I absolutely LOVE her she ate those like a champ
I think her role as Ursula in the little mermaid was the only best performance ❤❤❤❤❤ Plus. I love spice and eating spicy fire 🔥  I love this show ❤
want to see like marks where they eat the next and the next...
Favorite one so far
Hahaha her pulling out the bread loaf had me in stitches. 😅 and the whip cream?!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
love her
Grabs the pitcher and gulps. Best moment
She is just so enjoyable to watch. One of my fave actresses.
Lmao she literally turned a blush of pink with that 1 when she blew her nose😂😅
After watching her in Ghostbusters i disliked her acting
I didn't get the legal question on minute 18:28?
I grew up in Melrose Park, and lived in Romeoville, Illinois by Plainfield. Now, I am a city girl in Pilsen, Chicago. Wow, I didn't know both were from Illinois. I am new to the channel so forgive me if I sound ignorant. My first episode was with Gordon Ramsey, this is my second.
When I saw her react to the first wing I was terrified for what was to come.
Melissa McCarthy did an amazing job in The Little Mermaid.
Funny thing is, when it comes to overall character, Melissa McCarthy is my favorite actress.
I like to hit my party guests with a dab of Hot Licks Aftershock or Da Bomb Ground Zero (which is hotter than Beyond insanity). I've been doing it for years, but, like Sean says, you never really get used to it.
❤
Eat Chile, the one behind will pay.
Melissa really took those hot sauces like a champion YO GO GIRL❤
What’s your legal situation😂😅
I've watched three episodes today and now I'm craving hot wings oops
My favorite actress.  I'm going to go watch SPY NOW 😂❤❤❤
Only brave enough to say this here bc they mentioned Carbondale, but I’m a hairstylist from So. IL and I have a client who knew Sean in college and it blew my mind. Shout out Sarah🤣
When she gave him the finger 😂😂😂
Loved the part about how Mel was worried about playing Chris Farley's bit on SNL, says a lot about her as a person, what a legend !
The worst part about this ,is that it's going come out the other end like lava😂😂😂
I love her
😂😂😂 I don’t know if I would survive
Gotta love her. She's super sweet and nice but also absolutely hilarious.  People don't mention actresses like her enough I feel like. Her sense of humor sets her apart from a lot of other actresses in my opinion. Gotta love the ones that give you a good laugh 😆👍
She's not even funny or relevant anymore. Ghost busters killed her career. Thank goodness
Thank you Sean thank you beautiful Melissa for this moment. My depression was actually gone for the entire time I watched this. So thank you 🙏 ❤
This is the most I have seen you connect with a celebrity. Both of you together have a great vibe! I smiled the whole time
I have always loved Melissa McCarthy, this is a great life with her and even better that she did hot ones.
Melissa McCarthy whippets and hotwings a legendary interview for the books
You’re right Melissa McCartney. Variety does bring Families together and Groups of Friends, Clubs of like minded and cliques, everyone can watch Variety and Comedy with a single aim and that is relief from the crudity of normality and brings us levity for the Human Spirit.
She is seriously such an incredible person. Thanks for all the laughs!
I enjoyed this one
She is so awesome!! And her eyes are gorgeous!!
I will never understand why people want to eat food that causes extreme pain. Its so ridiculous, food is supposed to be pleasurable not painful 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Melissa is definitely a VIBE! Thank you for the giggles.
I was laughing so hard I was crying. Then when I went to wipe away the tears, I found that I was afraid my eyes were going to burn! I must have been really invested in this video!  LOL
I just love her 😄
I've been subscribed to this channel over I think a year and 1⁄2 and all I can think about is the host intestines they gotta be burnt to a crisp by now
She is the best ❤😂
I lost it when Melissa asked, "what's your legal situation?!" . Melissa’s take on the importance of comedy… amazing..
she says bad films dont work... and most of her latests works of comedy are BAD
Now do Matt Mercer
What is your ~~legal~~ situation....?
I absolutely love this woman
She had me rolling on the floor. Love MM.
Well done Melissa! For someone who is not good with spices, she managed to get to the finish line. 🔥 🔥 🔥
Pooph😂😂😂😂😂
i love melissa so much😘
"We're in a lot of trouble if it all becomes cops and capes and horror and grim...."  That segment really moved me, and I'm glad she spoke on it.
She’s my favourite female comedian actress!!! She made me laugh so much in the heat and identity theft 😂
To her point about the importance of comedy; Blazing Saddles and Airplane were two of the funniest movies ever produced.  They were made in an era when people could still laugh at the fact that the joke was actually making fun of the very thing that so many people are actually offended by today.  It is profoundly sad that so many people today can’t see the utter hilarious nature of mankind.  Oops, my bad,,, ‘humankind’.
17:38 17:46 23:03
I am in love with her
I freaking love her.
I Adore Melissa! She's So Lovely Person! 😂🥰
Bring back Mike and Molly!!!!!!!!!!!!
Have any stars ever went to the emergency room from eating something too hot on this show.  It can be dangerous.
At 15:42 is she talking about Kangol?
Nice, she mastered the wings. A very humble person, indeed
Melissa is so funny 😂
sookieee
Why does the host look like Neil Patrick Harris to me? Anyone else?! 😂
when she start to swear, thats where i fall off my chair
I never noticed how beautiful her eyes are
Ive never seen such a violent reaction to a chicken wing before 😂
GET COLD ONES ON HOT ONES
Been in Jail for the last 2yrs so I'ma have the best Binge on Hot one's right now 😂😂😂 missed so much good content
My fellow North Illinois Native! Crystal Lake nice!!
Of all the female comedians/comics this woman is the funniest hands down.
Melissa is my favorite!
She is just so dang likable!! ❤
I loved this interview and can't wait to watch her as Ursula!
Why are you so far away from each other? Are we really doing this again?
Do y’all believe his be hot ??? His nose dnt even run
Honey takes away the hot
I ❤️ Melissa‼️‼️‼️
Melissa has such a great balance within her personality. She can be SO funny, but is also empathetic and very well-spoken. I also think she would just as down to earth in person as she is on screen.
ah Mellissa seems like such a beautiful sou, like her smile is genuine 😩💕😩💕
😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂 18:24
Melissa McCarthy is a national treasure and one of the goats of comedic acting. I would LOVE to see her and Jack Black team up on a film 🎥🤞🏾
Comedy is important I watch her movies and comedy movies period. Laughter is good for the soul. I love Identity Theft
Oh yeah she did the whole movie in Hollywood the Ghostbusters girls in happytime murders so great in Spanish horror movie
I love her!!!
I wouldnt say Da Bomb is the hottest. I've had one called The End, which comes in a much smaller bottle and is 6M scoville. But I will say Da Bomb is the absolute most disgusting hot sauce I've ever tasted.
"When i breathe in, to live"😂😂😂
"When you try to breath in to live, it gets worse"
Shes so wholesome i love her
She was hilarious loved it
15:51 I wish I was that glass.
Ayran and yogurt
I love Melissa...great interview, so fun!
I love Melissa ❤️ she is amaizing fun great actress  Awesome personality . And love your shows Sean . Gretings from Utah ❤
😂😂😂u got ur eye lift 😂😂
I like her voice for the Ursula part. Fixed the spelling.
"what's your legal situation?" gets me every time😂
LOVE HER!! 💜🌹💜🌹💜🌹💜🌹💜🌹💜🌹💜🌹🤘
She's hilarious 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
She literally turned into Meg from Bridesmaids immediately after eating Da Bomb LOLLL and she pulls the bread out of NOWHERE 😂😂😂
“Drop your armor”. My new motto for anything I do to put my heart into it. Melissa is a phenomenal artist!!!!!!
i am really sad for the guests. 99% of them do not want anything to do with hot wings. They just do it for promotion. It's literally prostitution. Painful (and hopefully lucrative!) prostitution!
Why is this woman famous? She is vile
Melissa McCarthy is hands down one of the funniest, most entertaining women I've seen on camera and not just a pair of adorable eyes.
it's the first time I hear her voice, I always watched dubbed stuff of her and the Italian voice actress is actually really really really close my god I'm shocked
Melissa is a funniest girl I discover then I see her in movies sometimes I rewatch her movies bc is so funny and hilarious at same time a
I remember da bomb used to be middle of the 10, but now it's top 3.
I think Melissa is gorgeous. ❤😊
Did they extend the tables because of covid?
Sweet lady. The only good thing about GB 2016 was her.
love her !!!
It’s comin outta me like lava!
I’m fully convinced Sean is pretending it’s hot. He don’t feel ish.
😂😂😂😂😂 are y’all rolling on the floor too?!
I love her so much. She's a national treasure ❤
This is the first episode I've ever seen, and I just finished the Kristen Bell episode.  Kristen took it like a CHAMP with barely a sip of water or watery eye, so I just had to watch poor wonderful Melissa back to back to gauge the different reactions.  Kristen truly has a gut of steel and zero taste buds left! And Melissa is just charmingly in pain
Melissa could have used big squeezable jar of cool ranch dressing.   Missed opportunity!
good but music was to loud in the video.
Love this.
Not for the spice but completed the whole challenge!! Legendary 👏🏽 DJ Khaled could never
She did it!!  ❤
On the first wing, Sean's like, "we're in for one today"...😂😂
Ursula came out with the Bomb haha
Of all the people, she is the best!!!!😂😂😂😂
Melissa is right. Comedy movies need to exist. Keep fighting Melissa
I love this woman so much. Whenever I do only see her, I have a smile on my lips. She is basically the funniest woman that I have ever seen and also has such a great personality.
It's kinda satisfying to see this wannabe comedian suffer a little.
❤
She really suffered, much respect Melissa for pushing through ❤
Lemon cleans your hands
Hey ill do a show with all the sauces ya ever made in the show life  Same show  🦾🦾🦾🦾
God bless gher and you
If you eat chili, and you feel very hot, my advice is that you drink hot water, not cold water, because if you drink cold water, especially if you use ice, it will make it worse.✌️
Daz Black should do this
Her smile is so wholesome
You should have one of your subscribers come onto the show. Pay a little tribute to your watchers. Maybe a regular everyday person that everyone can connect with.
I love when she accidentally huffed whipped cream 🤣🤣
When she went to her Ursula voice, I thought Sean was dead for sure
I don't know her that much, but I can feel she's a great real person, even off cam.
“What a lovely, warm charcuterie board” 🤣 she is so naturally funny, I laughed out loud the whole video
Not Melissa accidentally doing whippets on Hot Ones 😂
Thank God for uncle Bob! Saving this precious man who just knows that we need to all love one another!!! Simple as that
Aaaaww how could they do this to her 😢😊
My favourite ever actress, Jim carrey favourite ever actor 😊
I'm a huge Metallica fan. I would love to see James Hetfield on here.
"...it had a vapor to it." "...is this an application moment." This woman keeps giving! One of my favorite episodes!😆
I Love You Melissa! Queen! You have way more guts than I do in doing this! 🥵❤❤👏👏
My favorite thing about this interview is how she gradually turns into a Melissa McCarthy character as she unravels
Milk spray, whipped cream... Yeah she went prepared for action
Fellow Illinoisan here! St. Charles girl who worked in Joliet and Elgin. Love you guys. No better sense of humor than these here parts, we are some hardy folks.
Love her! She's so naturally funny and seems like such a wonderful person. We need more Melissa McCarthy's in the World!
After seeing all this episode, I think Sean Evans does not have a soul. He doesn't even blink of cough ones. 😂😂😂
I freakin love her even more
Ive never seen anyone with milk in a spray bottle
Damn...I'm crazy in love with her heart!!!!so full of real love and joy!!! WoW
She is HELLA ADORABLE!!??
Improv actors are the best! I love Melissa, Tina, Amy, Steve, Jason, etc!! ❤️
I lived in Joliet (and Waukegan) aaaayye!! 🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💙
I love ❤️her!! So funny!!
She sounded like the original Ursula when she at Da Bomb lol
I love her!!!!! She's sooooo Auntie like
in 2018 I lost pretty much everything I owned in a tornado. I am also from Illinois in tornado alley
Huh, why does this video have 12k dislikes?
Tom Cruise, Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth.
Please please please Kathy Bates or Kate Beckinsale!! My dream actors to have at my dinner table
Coloca um goiano para fazer esse programa! Será suave ❤🇧🇷
“I know I know” 😂😂
I love Melissa and I love Hot Ones, but I sure would’ve loved less questions about Disney’s Little Mermaid and more of her career as a whole… she’s done some great work - LOVED her as Sookie on Gilmore Girls, LOVED her as Molly on Mike and Molly.  Was kinda let down by no questions about more of her career.
Hilarious 😂
Loved it. Love her!!!
LUV HER!
Lovely to see her point of view 🫡
She came prepared
Melissa McCarthy accidentally doing a whippet
*DaBomb* gets EVERYONE! They always wanna know he can fight, or has security, or legal status. Lol
Melissia McCarthy's personality makes her so beautiful.🎉
She has beautiful eyes
She is so funny to me … 🔥🔥 I love this episode
CAMPBELL SOUP!
When she shares her bread even though she’s in pain, you can tell she’s a wonderful mother. ❤
Please invite Ina Garten from Barefoot Contessa. Or Martha Stewart.
Hilarious
Rose Byrne mom  live food please  later
Eat the whole wing you coward.
I know I’m late but dude saying “IDK who yo bread guy is but… CLUTCH”  FUKIN SENT ME MATE
She's amazingggggggg
So I'm new the channel - though subbed already - but I feel like part of te routine from what I've seen so far is to keep them talking as a distraction (which makes a ton of sense to me actually), but I feel like you didn't do that as much as you have in the past. Albeit I've only seen half a dozen so far, all comedians though. Segura, Kreischer, Hart, a couple others. But you I swear, talked or asked them questions without pausing after they had tried a ridiculously hot sauce and here you pause which gives her time to process the agony! What gives?! Love the channel. Not ill well meant.
When she flipped him off and everyone behind the camera laughed I lost it
Chloraseptic spray would probly help lol
Get Allen iverson on the show
I've always liked Melissa and this interview just increased that tenfold
Love her!
How many top-notch lawyers do ya have on retainer, Sean? 😅✌🏻❤️🥂
Geeze, I absolutely adore MM!
I love Melissa McCarthy. Despite being in distress, I don't know why she is still funny.
Sean needs get interviewed by the person that did the best on the show
Love this episode the most, you go MM🎉
cool water make it worse, u should drink hot water yooo..., im asia, i know!
As a high tolerant spice food eater I want to be a celebrity only to come on this show and see how far I can go.
Said nothing about bridesmaids!
15:00- 19:56 best part of the show
That’s not the hottest hot sauce. Wiltshire Chilli does one called Regret, which is about 12mil scovilles !
Thank you Sean for bringing this wonderful soul to the show,
I love to laugh first
😂 hit the shark with the cow 😂
The tornado story is wild
She's a really good actor, she can deadpan anything. It's like talking to Don Rickles
melissa is always hilarious! haha :D
Freakin champ!!  Get it Melissa!!!
I love her best actress in the world
I love this woman.
Melissa did an amazing job as Ursula that is one heck of a big set of shoes to fill your reprising a roll in live action of a Disney animation classic.
I get some Lego then 👏🏻👍👍😂
Hearing Sean grew up in the town my college is in and where I hang out quite often BLEW MY MIND
This is hilarious 💀💀 Melissa is just HILARIOUS
The loaf of bread😂
And I love that Melissa brought her own stuff
Tell Melissa I watched all Gilmore girls and so so good
Melissa McCarthy is a sweetheart
I just keep skipping to Da Bomb on all these videos xD
"my glettagopus" 😂😂😂😂 I think she meant "epiglottis" lololol she's so adorably funny
Watch "The Nines" with Melissa McCarthy and Ryan Reynolds.
Hahaha she is so effortlessly funny
She's the best... please bring her again Sean 😂🎉❤
Rip Pat Carroll!!!
Lots of crushed ice to eat.  No water just the crushed ice on stand by for so many parts of my body lol
a baby bird wouldnt even be full.. with the pathetic bites ya take
I didnt know she was Ursula.  What a fun person, seems like the real deal.
I truly Believe Keanu Reeves would be a great guest on hot ones
Just great...love the show
When she pulled out the bread I lost it!! Melissa is so hilarious!
I live in Carbondale, IL. the famous Tri-state tornado
My favorite actress
GOD I love her so much
Best interview show on the Internet
Do they use the same sauces everytime?
I could not agree MORE with Melissa about lack of modern day comedy films - sad thing is so many are so precious and militant and PC - sadly true funny sarcastic wacky out there movies - are going to be a thing of the past. 😥
You need to get Josh Allen on the show. It would be amazing.
Amazing guest 😂🔥🤟
Melissa you are the best, funniest, i love everything you have done. This was so funny, hope you felt better quickly.
Celebrities I'd love to see on Hot Ones (assuming they haven't already): Mark Ruffalo Steve Carell Amy Poehler Kate Winslet  Andy Samberg Ryan Reynolds John Oliver
A female that acts is called an actress not actor
12:35 😂😂😂😂
I love love love EVERYTHING ABOUT MELISSA!!!!❤ Sean you ROCK interviewing! I love watching these!
small world, I'm from Illinois and I went to SIU Carbondale
Shoutout to the editors 🎉🎉🎉 theyre the unsung heroes of this show ❤
I love Melissa, so proud of her taking on this challenge with poise & humor loved every minute!!!
College of Lake County for me
This was the best show yet!
Love Melissa! She’s adorable 🥰
has anyone noticed how Sean always remains completely unaffected by the spice? I sometimes wonder if his chicken wings don't have any spice just normal fried chicken.
I can't stand Melissa McCarthy
“I get that people like spicy, but I don’t get it” 😂
The spray bottle of milk was a new level of hilarity 😂
The FU sign gets me
I would love you do one with the "Korean Englishman" duo Josh and Ollie! Super neat people that need to be shared. I think you'd have good chemistry with.
Is the ghost pepper sauce in there?
This is so refreshing because I have no tolerance to spicy
She is a very funny woman, love her!!!
I love how she keeps bringing more items 😂🤣
she's soooo funny when she doesn't have a script in front of her. she should be cast in more roles where she can truly be herself instead of how hollywood wants to type-cast her
She is a national treasure
It's so unfortunate that Disney keeps ruining all the classics we once loved. Disney completely ruined itself. Never go woke. Woke destroys everything.
I just love Melissa she is such a modest and reserved woman. She has morals and values. She is just lovely. She has her such orignal way with everything. There is definetly her essence in what she does and that is a rare and dear quality.
Melissa is amazing.
I LOVE MELISSA MCARTHYYYY
favorite hot ones episode to this day
😂 I love Melissa 💜
Melissa always makes me laugh... 😅
Gorgeous !
The new lil mermaids should of never happened. Everyone knows it. Aint no white person gonna play pocahontas
Melissa’s take on the importance of comedy… amazing.. I lost it when Melissa asked, "what's your legal situation?!" .
She’s amazing in every since of the word 👏🏻👏🏻
Bread in your mouth
"What's your legal situation?"   Gold
Dj Khaled practically walked out. He was such a frigging baby 😂😂
Honestly, Melissa McCarthy is so talented.  I know she is in so many light hearted movies, many of them brought me lots of joy.  But movies like The 9 give so much opportunity for her to express her range.  Love the interview and I'm glad she persevered.
Hot wings hotter than Syrian devil kicking moon rocks.
Doesn't water make it worse????
Melissa with all the options... bread idk if it helps but get that bread guy on deck. Just in case and the lawyer. Just in case
This whole show is so weird. Sean is clearly one of the most insightful and incisive interviewers out there (and shout-out to his amazing support staff, particularly the researchers!), but apart from lowering their guard somewhat, what does the sadistic element actually do?  Or, to put it another way, how many terrific interviews are you missing out on because this program is unnecessarily daunting to those who don't want to enflame their ulcers?  I get that it was the gimmick that got you off the ground, but surely there's a way to branch out from here....(?)  Don't get me wrong! I love it. But ... Schadenfreude is the least of its pleasures. The true gems are, for example, hearing Melissa McCarthy get serious about the vital importance of comedy as a way to bring people together.
What happened with Bear Grylls?
☝️ Promo>SM
Hilarious. I love this show.
Just saw little mermaid and I had no idea who Melissa McCarthy was so I YouTube'd her and clicked on the first video and here we are! 😊
18:32 cold sweet bread works the absolute best! I found out after a few superhot peppers, honey buns are what you need! ❤
This cracked me up so hard I love Melissa 😂
I really felt when she talked about how comedy should bring is together and that without making people laugh, the world is an even scarier place 😭
I love the show, but there's so much meat left on those bones.
😂😂😂😂 12:15 😅😅😅💀💀💀
Not picking on Melissa McCarthy, but i wish it was expected that guests would eat the entire wing, not just take a tiny nibble.   Love the show anyway!
Wasn’t a fan of her, but now I am.
WHERE IS THE OUTRO MUSIC!?  I feel betrayed. 😢
What's your legal situation?!!😂
This is it. The show has peaked. Can't get any better than this.  Thank you Hot Ones and specially Melissa McCarthy for showing us what peak means.
She's the best!
Da Bomb turned her back into Ursula @16:25. Those echoing coughs had me dying., then she bit the bread.😂
She makes me die crying, and I think she is a very authentic person.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT HAVING THAT 64OZ RANCH DRESSING BOTTLE UP THERE FOR HER 😂😂😂😂 IYKYK
Pulls out an entire chiabatta and I lost it 😂🤣
I love that lady, she is such a natural beautiful person, totally glad she survived the show😅
She sounded like a real hero when speaking of the importance of comedy. I adore this woman. ❤
What. A. Great. Interview!  I (discovered and) Fell in love with Melissa as Sookie in GILMORE GIRLS.
My favorite person ever! You need a new post Malone hot ones vid
Lauren Graham would be life on this 🙌🏻
this is the best one ever
The best one I have seen so far.
She's such a beautiful soul
I just love her so much. Great actress, comedian, human being. And to me she is one of the most attractive actresses in Hollywood bc she has ton loads of charisma and presence. And I second everything she says about Hollywood going darker.
Love her ❤
Most wholesome moment when she flips him off but then offers some bread out of solidarity 💖
I love that she brought her own bread !!
I love how the blur the whip cream label like we dont know its ready whip
This one is one of my favorites I really like all her movies super funny 😂😂👏👏❤️❤️❤️
She sounds like Ursula. She should have play her
Absolutely love this woman
Born and raised in Jerseyville, Illinois.. So good to know we have great people from home
Absolutely fantastic 🔥🔥🔥
How cool would it be to make a Hot ones restaurant for people to enjoy this experience together then purchase their favourite hot sauce if they want.
Gummy bears and gummy worms help
I just love how he speak about people’s accomplishments and he’s so nice to them that’s so amazing but in the chill way
I love this woman!!!! I just..... meh..... if she was thin......NO! I would still marry her!
This was top tier. Next to eddie huang,shaq, and idris
She sounds like Ursula when she had some of those wings is that how she got into character then also I would bring a ton of milkshakes with me
I love her❤❤❤ may I say ur outfit is beautiful....and u are drop dead gorgeous ❤❤❤❤
She isn't always in the best movies,  I don't even think she the funniest woman in Hollywood..... But I like her. I always find comedians to be very smart
i prefer the french version, it's more like friends talking, here, it's a real real interview, and he even looks at the camera while asking the question :(
We must protect her at all costs.
Love her!
She is truly the best 😂❤
Her underwear prepared for the worst.
“Well now everyone gets to sign my cast” 😭😭😭
I freaking love Melissa!! 😂🤣🤣😂
“As you try to breath in, to live.       ‘It gets worse.”  She is funny. Let’s see how she finishes off.
One of the funniest guests ever
Gonna say this is probably one of the worst guests ever been on this show.
Did I miss any mike and Molly questions or did was I just distracted with my adhd?
Sean is so hot
I could never be someone who works behind the camera on this show. I'd be literally squealing with laughter and they'd have to kick me out of the room everytime they hit "the bomb".
Haha so funny!
simply one of the greatest people walking the world...aside from my kids...you are stunning
EGGNOG
Melissa is a National Treasure!
Should try and get Jim Carey on here!
I love Melissa she's a great comedian and actress id love to be in a movie with her
@FirstWeFeast you should invite those influencers who does those spicy challenges... Let's see their reactions...😂
I love that you got my mother on the show !
What’s your legal situation 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭🙌🏽 she had me dying 😆
The way I would freak out seeing their reactions as if they’re dying not able to breath 😭 😂
I felt that hiccup in my glattigloppus. Oh she was DELIGHTFUL!
Please do Taylor swift
What, no Sean Spicey question?
Comedy brings People together is so true and really important. Keep Laughing and Smiling 🥰
Sean always matching the attitude in the room. Always makes it fun
I laughed so much I cried
What's your legal situation 😂😂😂
The milk spray. I'm dying
Really think she is one of the best
Im always amazed that they all drink water. We spice eaters know not to do this. Raita, yoghurt cucumber mix
Please get Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes on together : )
I'm not famous but I would love to eat n try the flavors of those sauce's on wings they look bomb 💣
That tornado story got me.
From self awareness to 16:34 😂
Love these videos but the background music is soooo loud I can’t hear the interview!! Please turn it down!
Can we petition to get Taylor Swift on Hot Ones!
Why does no one bow out because of the heat anymore?
This is how I am with spicy food. The first one I'd be like, OH NO.
We know where she is going to be the rest of the day. Bless her heart.
she didnt do too bad for someone with no tolerance lol. also acidic thing are supposedly supposed to help heat
I never felt sorry for any celebrity that ate da bomb but, when Melissa McCarthy did my heart sank bc, she is so humble, down to earth and she doesn't think she is better than anyone else like most celebrities!!!!
I love melissa! She is hilarious! And a great actress! She seems really down to earth!
One day I hope to be on this show 😎
I love the soul leaving her body when the heat kicks in 😂
The laughter in the background makes it even better
Haha love this one 😂❤
So why did they make that iconic character black then? I find that really weird.
Definitely Jersey 🇯🇪 cows milk and yoghurt, Greek style, and some 23000000 scovil chilli 🌶 sauce and dare everyone to have a whole wing apparently a bottle lasts a lifetime!!!!😢
Please stop warning them on da i love how she starts pulling random objects from her purse & starts going in 😂😅
Melissa is so naturally funny.
What a f****** champ 😅😅😅 💪 💪 💪
The quasi Vine Booms are hilarious LOL
20:02 “aahhhhh, y’okay” *eats it* I felt that
That’s actually the best job
Get some ice cream and ice on set !!!!! Lol
Im afraid to watch her Ursula performance! Lol I love her and i love ursula i know it will be great but idk
Dude I love her so much she’s my favorite 🥰🥰🥰
I am still watching GilmoreGirls and really love her🥺🫶🏻
She’s amazing, i love her
I love the edit at the end where they used her hiccup voice clip
Laughter ,fun ,Good water 💦
Great actress makes me laugh ,comedy is great to have
She is just a queen!
Great job. Loved your song on Ursula tonight. Great job singing. Go with those hot wings girl. You got it!
Melissa: *pulls out a spray bottle w milk*  2 wings later: *Pulls out whipped cream*   Da bomb: *Pulls out bread* 😂😂
"If you try to breathe in to live" 🤣🤣
I am in tears laughing at this. Melissa, you’re a national treasure!
My favorite actress and comedian of all time love her she is so down to earth ,she is beautiful  in all shapes and form (soul ,body ,..)
OLIVES HELP!
I fully giggled to the point of tears streaming down my face - I LOVE MELISSA!
I wonder if anyone ever called  the show the next day screaming from the toilet 😂😅😅
I always wondered why no one out I've in the milk. Now someone finally did it
Literally one of the BEST guests on this show! Love her!❤
17:43 That laugh by Sean was sooo spontaneous hahahaha, a true highlight
Also native Illinois and also have a feae of tornadoes now
Loveee queen Melissa!! ❤❤ so happy she was on the show!
She’s clearly acting.
No more animation cutaways. I want to see the guests.
The way he act when they eat the boom i feel like somone is going to hit him or did him him before 😂
Love love love her
I can't believe how adorable she is!
I just love her💙💙💙
For anyone who doesn’t like heat, there is still plenty of flavour to be found without the scotch bonnet pepper. I’ve done similar recipes with bell peppers (wife can’t handle heat) and it still came out delicious.
When I breath in to live 🤣🤣🤣
Da bomb strikes again boys lol
Melissa’s take on the importance of comedy… amazing.. Melissa just casually flipping him off is one of my favorite things..
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE HER!!!!
god, that woman is the most loveable icon ever..... i love her!
Loved this lady since Identity thief and Heat. She’s not even trying to be funny but has me cracking up😂
I love that they don't totally edit out people laughing in the background even if it's just like one or two people just losing it. It's amazing!
Melissa is an absolute treat to watch. <3
my fav part of these interviews are the soun affects or the enhanced sounds made by the interviewees. HILARIOUS
For someone who doesn’t do well with spice she did amazing and you can tell she had a great time!
She’s so awesome! 😂
I love comedy movies
i had the craziest idea (Nardwuar the Human Serviette X hot ones) show could be a killer ??? no...?
Melissa is the sweetest ❤ phenomenal interview
16:30 🤌👌priceless She seems legitimately hurt by the end of this
Ok we need to start making a follow up video mandatory for those who make it to the end. Like, the next morning aftermath 😂😂
as time goes on their eyes get more n more glazed over....looks like they've been smokin'!!😂
Yessss Melissa we love uuuuu
She’s so naturally funny 😂! So glad she was on hot ones! Such a great episode !!!
“Isn’t the goal to be good?!” I feel that deep down in my soul! I love spice and heat but it has to be flavorful.
The day they pull Jack Black on this show is the day I go to heaven. 😂
She was solid!
She was feeling it at #1 so I knew it would end bad for her.
Love Melissa! ❤ She definitely doesn't take herself or anything seriously. She seems like a lovely lady too.
Milk is the only think that takes the sting outta hot spices..
Okay but what is actually in the spray bottle
Has Jimmy Cohan joined your show?
Did she even have any of the sauces on her wings? They all looked hella dry to me
Please bring the Wayne brothers!!!
I hope for one day that they will do someone from critical roll
Melissa's Spy movie with Jason Statham is my favorite movie of hers I've watched
To be honest spicey has heslth benefits in moderation...or if you born into it
Being in thailand host you build a tolerance for spicey over time...but i love your support to the victim loooool.
She bomb ❤❤❤
😂 I really love Melissa McCarthy 💖
Wow, she did great. 👍
Spray bottle milk seems actually like a great idea
Spicy shark……😂❤
Fire the music guy
THAT MUSIIIIIICCCK!!! 😵‍💫
OH MY GOD the music !
The music….omfg
KANGOL. BABYGIRL. KANGOL. 😂
Wow, I grew up in STC IL and I remember the Plainfield tornado. I was 4th grade and we had a kid move to our district after the tornado destroyed his house and buried him and his family.
The way she talked about Farley was really cool.
You should interview nardwar :)
The score on this episode is doing toooooo much 😂
Love her. 💜 Yes beautiful eyes, smart and funny.
I just adore her.
Melissa McCarthy is NOT funny, her acting is cringe inducing
12:40 Spot on Melissa, please keep making great comedies.
ANT BITES MELISSA , ANT BITES!!!
she is so funny, and you can't feel after burning your taste buds off the last thousand episodes
the kanga part 😭
get Steve Carell on this show, pleaaaasseeee
Ahhhh she soooo beautiful not only her soul but the way she talks and she is! 😍☺️❤
I used to watch ever episode.  I stopped watching a bit ago because of guests like this.  Lizard people.
She is THE BEST !!!!
she's so naturally funny but her on-screen humor... not my cup of tea. i do love her as a person tho.
Please have Jungkook from BTS!! He’s releasing a single this July 14th and an album soon. He’s a foodie and would be great to interview him like this. 🙏🙏
The background music was distracting and took away from the interview.
Poor thing was in for the struggle since the first wing smh lol
I LOVE HERRR SO MUCHH!😂💖
Yeah, this one's in the top 3 best for sure. 🌟
How did los caliantis go from 4 to 5. And next seadon you have to make it tougher like the early seasons and keep dabomb but get 9 all new sauses please love show but miss the old ones when it was harder
LOVE YOU MELISSA
Imagine Melissa mcarthy being your mum
The spray bottle and the whipped cream might be the best I've seen. Da bomb is smoking hot...
Sean, throw that shirt away. It's giving me a headache lol it's no good for video
What I would have going on for myself would be a trip to the hospital!!!
Purse ciabatta. I can dig it.
17:37 I 🤣
Iam confedence at 50 and selfaware is low ha. We would be best friends
PSA: Ladies, cut your raptor claws before you eat wings on the internet.
You poor unfortunate soul😂
Crystal Lake, Illinois! My mom's from there and my uncle inherited the family home. She has very fond memories of her childhood there.
I wanna see at least 1 cast member from the umbrella academy on this show
Please someone make it a meme 17:39 😂😂😂
Love this show and all the amazing guests! Well made and extremely entertaining!
I love how Americans can live 90 minutes drive away and say they come from the same place like its nothing. In the UK thats a whole different accent, different way of life! Crazy how big America is
Why the background music though
I love this woman! She's such an amazing actress💕
Is that milk in a spray bottle?
Melissa was fantastic.  Her nostrils turned pink, i saw inside of her eýes change!
Get Nardwuar on the show.
Would have loved to hear about her Charlies Angels experience lol
The music is just too loud 😞
This is the greatest interview format ever
oh my god, dying laughing at the response to The Bomb "I hate you so much" ...
She is adorable and beautiful all rolled into one. She did an AMAZING job!!
She's the kind of aunt you would love to visit every chance you get ❤
Love everything about this!!! ✌
You're one of the best hosts ever - so sweet
You have to announce the Scoville of appalo
It’s crazy because I too am from Plainfield
eh, hard pass for me to watch this guest
Great videos!! Well done
She's my moms favorite actor and has all her movies
“Hit the spray Milk. hit the spray milk.” I love this man😂
Conspiracy theorists will forever wonder what she had in the Milk Mister😂
the bread! she had whipped cream and spray milk! what else is in her arsenal!
i would need two fans. a mister and fan would cool. me too!
you know the iced baby pacifier ring. for teeth babies. i would need that. maybe the ice would numb me to eat this
So funny
Good Job Melissa 👏 👍 👌
Loved her in bridesmaids!
I am a Melissa, and I would never do this.
"I can't even get to the water" lol
I just love her! I will literally watch anything if she is in it!!!
Finally, someone used bread!
I’d probably tap out after the first one! 😂 🥵
shouts out to bill
Why do you have a failed actress on your show bro? Tell her to robot dance for crying out loud!
I was really hoping for some Gilmore girls questions.
I've never laughed at an episode as much at this
“hit the cow” had me wheezing
Wing 1 1:38 Wing 2 3:22 Wing 3 4:47 Wing 4 6:50 Wing 5 9:45 Wing 6 12:00 Wing 7 13:54 Da Bomb 16:14 Wing 9 19:36 Wing 10 21:57
Oooo get Daniel from why don’t we to come on!!!!❤
I grew up in Illinois and Melissa reminds me so much of the funny and kindhearted women in my family.
I so wanted her to say, "It's like a bee sting that stung me on that thingy-a-la thing on the back my throat"..😂😂🤣 Why am I like this😂🙄
Her Da Bomb sauce reaction was literally Ursula! 😂
The "I don't know what to do" moment shows how naturally funny Melissa is.
I swear I love her 😂 ❤ the bread 🥖 was it!
I love how she mentions wanting to honor chris farley. I never got into his comedy but always feel the love and loss when others that loved him, bring him up.
Yes Melissa, you do make some bad choices. I love your acting ability, watched just about everything you have done and you are probably the funniest comedienne on  screen or television. But ! Your amateur hooking up with Meghan Markle the Z list actress, and allowing yourself to be pulled into her nasty world of spite, and revenege against   The Queen of England,  was pathetic and unnecessary.  I am not a royalst, but I have some respect for a woman who reigned seventy years with wisdom and was, and still is, loved. Seems to me, you are not the nice lady I thought you were, which goes to prove what a good actress you are.
Love her!
I love how she brought her own stuff to try to fight the spice😭
The whipcream!! 😂
She took a huge bite from the Da Bomb.
I wish he asked about gilmore girls 😭😭
I was waiting for her to yell, "IT'S COMING OUT OF ME LIKE LAVA!"
I built a set for her in Boston filming The Heat! I built the FBI office what goes around comes around
She is one of my favorite actors
I love you Melissa, you rock❣️
Man I dont know why Ive always insisted in not liking her but she is an awesome person. She has a new fan today
His interviewing abilities are truly unmatched. Every single interview is exciting, and he asks the best questions.
didn't expect to see melissa mccarthy do a whippit today
Why is the Da Bomb so bad when it’s not even the number ten and less scovilles?
That spicy shark is so good. I got a bottle in Catalina Island. That one isn't even their hottest one!
Aaaand, now I'm a subscriber. Hilarious!
😂😂😂😂❤
She killed it! 💪🏼💪🏼
I love you beautiful queen ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤infinity
My Dad and l just love Melissa she is hilariously funny and beautiful?!!🌹♥️😇😍
❤
What a warm lovely Hot Ones.  I sure hope Sam Rockwell is in season 21!
i cant find an updanted version of these for EU... is there one?
Oh my God, the fact that she took classes from Micheal Harney is even better
So effortlessly funny, Melissa is
Melissa you rock!!!
im watching this at SIU Edwardsville !!
12:10
Best episode
Love herrrrrr
❤😂
She should have hit a whip it
someone get this woman some ranch dressing!
I wish he wouldn't keep saying I know, I know, I know, I get it, with every guest.
I love her... she is so genuine
I live in Crystal Lake now, and man it is so cool to have something in connection to Sean. Wild.
This was such a fun one lol. I have loved this woman since I was 10 years old when she was Sookie on Gilmore Girls.
That tornado story was shocking
She and Jen Lawrence did ir
Why does she look like Lorelei Gilmore a little. Like watch the first three minutes, and truly tell me she doesn’t resemble her. Could’ve been expressions.. but!
This is the first one I’ve watched all the way through I LOVE HERRRR
She's the best ❤
I agree with her about comedy. She is the coolest 😎.
The props that she pulled out of nowhere like a clown got me cry laughing throughout!
"I'll fight to my last breath... which will be in about 4 more wings..." 😅
Get Jennifer Coolidge on the show!❤
Please have Mariana Hargitay on!!!!!!
a good one! Loved it!
I’m cryiiiiiiiing 🤣🤣🤣. Truly love this woman 😂
she's her own comment section
I adore this woman. She’s too epic. The only celebrity I would like to be friends with 😊
I love you Melissa and you rock !!!! So does this show !!!
She's going to have the same episode on Brides Maids lol
This is probably the top 3 funniest ones yet!
"It's just fun though, like when you break your leg and you're like 'Well now everybody gets to sign my cast.' " Absolutely outstanding description of the Hot Ones experience!
Atleast they stuck to one character with thr original in the little mermaid and didnt make Ursula some Chinese trans penguin.
Melissa is my favorite person in the world!!!!
The way she kept pulling tricks out of her bag!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love her!
Hilarious!
This was the best hot ones in my opinion!  Hilarious
Melissa is so right, Real laughter is the best Medicine. There is a season for dark, but the only way it can truly be appreciated is by letting Light shine and Melissa is Definitely a Shining Light.
Awesome episode.
What’s your legal situation? Exposed. 😂😂😂
Best DaBomb reaction ever!😂😂😂
What a funny fuuny lady.
Shes so great
Melissa: cough cough. My background: Thunder! Me: Remembers Netflix and 😂😂😂
Pink lemonade
"What's your legal situation? Ima find out" 😄 🤣
Nothing against Melissa but Ursula should have been played by Artemis Pebdani.
You mentioned Carbondale. About 30 miles from me
She is amazing ❤❤
I love her so much 😂
No Gilmore girls questions i cry!
yeah, I feel that there's. more to ursula than being the evil sea witch. Like even Maleficient, the Red Queen and Cruella have a good side backstory. I wanna see ursula's
@FirstWeFeast Melissa McCarthy, her humor saves me every time.
Few people make me giggle in the very specific, consistent way that Melissa does. As I get older, natural cynicism and apathy tend to prevent me from "busting up" more and more which is really sad tbh, I used to laugh so much. But Melissa ALWAYS makes me laugh,
Love Melissa McCarthy and Ursula, but that makeup was ROUGH. A true diva like Ursula would never go out with uneven and incomplete makeup like that. Wish they brought a makeup artist in who knew what they were doing when it comes to drag makeup.
I didn't know Melissa was also an Illinois native!
I wonder if adding lard to your tongue would help or just trap in the heat.
Love THIS so much!! Thank you ! 🙏💯❤️😉🌞😎
Can u do Zendaya? 😂
Sookieee ♥️
"Like when you try to breathe... To live!? -"  - Melissa
The girl giggling in the background is making me laugh so hard.
Melissa's face after the Bomb was both heartbreaking and hilarious 😅😅😅😅
She handled it better than Gordon Ramsey.
I loved watching all Melissa's strategies for dealing with the heat. I really hope you do get Mat Pat on one day as I'd love to see him go through all his ideas for coping with the spice to see if they make a difference,  or his wife Steph as she hate the spice and would be a lot of fun lol  Another great episode, I have no idea how these people cope with such heat lol
GENIUS!!!! And I'm a long time spicy food vet. I eat Pure-bred Idiot sauce straight.
I have a friend that was within easy sight of the Joplin tornado. I'm 2 hours north. It was a pretty scary night, even so far away.
first time i've heard ppl laughing in the background lol
Melissa would bring her own reinforcements and pass them out like the true GOAT Mom all of us need
i absolutely love melissa mccarthy
"I still feel everything." oh Sean....
this was one of the funniest hot ones i’ve ever seen😂 i laughed so hard through this whole video 🤣🤣
This may be my favorite episode!!! Amazing woman
She's right about Comedies.
“I can’t even get to the water HOLY SHI” I died for those few seconds
I just love her!
Has Guy done this show yet? Imagine the sound bites.
I LOVE YOU MELISSA !
this is easily one of the best episodes of hot ones i've ever seen.
Melissa is adorable.
I love her this is the best one ever I laughed the whole time..
I LOVE HER ! And yea idk know but her movies and shows speak to me !
Poor Melissa.  I love you.
Her saying something along the lines of Galapagos when she meant epiglottis is everything bahahaha
"It's like when you break your leg, and then you're like 'Well, now everyone gets to sign my cast'"  😂😂😂
Can we get the last dab intro rolled back into the show?  I feel like it fell off at some point and it's an important part.  Cheers!
You should have call me Kris on your show
Wings & whippets, love to see it!
Melissa: shorts are never a good idea! Me “looks down”
I’ve yet to see someone mourning in pain on this show like Melissa was. What a champ she is for seeing it through to the end 🔥👏
“It’s coming out of me like LAVA!!” 🤣🤣🤣 that’s all I can hear   We so need some AFTER stories lol I know these people gotta be dyin after
I think I might need to go back and watch the episode with Bear because I have watched it but I would like to know what he means about it being an instance where they were a little worried about the security of their lawyers (or however he put it lol). I dont remember what he means by that... so I think Im going to give that a second watch to catch what I may have missed or at least have a refresher!
I love Melissa McCarthy so freaking much. I have and always will watch anything she is and will be in. There arent many performers that I will say that about because Im very picky about what I watch and what can hold my attention..... but she is one person that could hold my attention in a one person show about watching grass grow and I would love every second of it!
Melissa seems to me as one of the most adorable humans, not only how she looks but her personality as well. She is so warm and kind, and this is by far the most graceful way a person has acted on Hot Ones imo while trying to handle the heat. And to top it all, especially one who has no spice tolerance. Also such a natural comedian.
The person laughing in the back😅 Woulda been me too
Why not Alexander Skarsgård?
is it unsafe to eat the whole wing or no?😭
💙
❤
The filter they put on this season is too much, and distracting. Everyone looks like they have skin made of milk. Point of this show is to show the reality and the beads of sweat and so far its been perfectly filtered skin. Lame
This was for sure my favourite episode. Absolutely love her, everything is from the heart.🥰
She is not funny
He didn't ask anything about Gilmore girls 😭😭😭💔💔💔💔
She is so naturally funny. Sometimes she just makes a face and I bust out laughing. Her eating these wings looks hilarious and painful at the same time.
She’s the best.   Our family loves her   ❤️🥰
My new highest goal, above getting an Oscar, is being interviewed on Hot Ones.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LOOOOVE HER!!! Great episode!
Y’all should get twenty one pilots on hot ones
She did a great job in the little mermaid ❤❤❤
Melissa McCarthy doing whippets on hot ones 😂
“not a singer” whattt she was amazing in the little mermaid i loved her!!
I adore her 🤍
Melissa u need to do a disney villian live action film. Be the best film
God i love Melissa. A national treasure
3:25 “🦉“
You should at least provide her with a towel.
We had a Hot Ones party. My husband almost died. Ended up with his entire head in the sink with us hosing him down. 10/10 would do it again.
Missed opportunity for her to scream "IT'S COMING OUT OF ME LIKE LAVA!" from Bridesmaids
“I will fight till my last breath; which is like 4 wings from now” 😂😂😂😂😂
I remember the carnage of the Plainfields tornado. It was devastating... it flattened what was already flat ... wow. This episode took me back.
Great job Melissa you are great
The milk spray bottle is so funny!! Melissa we love you. You are so right comedy unites us and makes everything okay. ❤❤
Melissa is awesome in all the ways, starting from her humanity❤
im always amazed how sean handle this interviews, its like hes directing every flow from every reply of his guest. great job my dude
I love her take on stories getting darker and darker and the lack of variety or just good comedy movies.
Melissa had those (unseen) ppl rolling🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ...which made me LOL that much more!!
I really like Melissa she is great
Best episode! Melissa McCarthy is an inspiration. Queen! She makes me want to be a better person ❤️ Sean was at his best too! Xo
She makes everyone around her laugh!
Love her!
Her body took a screenshot with Da Bomb 😂
Why do they have the hottest sauce at number 8 and not the last one
That thing in the back of her throat, the “GLADAGOPOUS?” 😂 golden
I expected a cameo of her husband like in everything she normally does. Would have been great
Oh Michael ✌🏾🤣
Goodness she is a gift. 🎉 A gift to us all
I have literally seen this episode 5 times already. Best Hot Ones ever! And Melissa is a delight!
I love her green eyes
"You know what, we're already dead" was iconic
My grandpa was really great friends with melissa mccarthys parents. We're from Plainfield/joliet. My grandpa met melissa several times and im sad i never got to :/ i did meet ber parents though. the Plainfield tornado messed up our town for sure lol
I love her ! She is amazing actress!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Melissa speaks the truth for us all - Live life like we're only four wings away from our death.
Sean is the most empathetic host i've ever witnessed, always making the other feel at home, safe, and not alone in the torture. this truly is a safe space. a spicy one.
Does else wanna just pinch her cheekbones when she talking
So proud of Melissa McCarthy for getting thru this!!!
f'n love her even more than i already did !
Melissa is always great!
I am literally crying 😂 love her ❤
Hahahahaha
6:55 got me howling! 🤣 Great editing 👏
dude, what is going on with the background music?
She’s such a beautiful beautiful person in and out ❤
Ain’t no way he’s eating them too
In case people missed it: Sean knows. :)
she is such a beautiful soul
6ft apart lol....
HILARIOUS
LOVE HER LOL
7:08  my glotaglopis 😂
Of course Melissa brought PROPS 😂 I love her
A lesson well taught by a white girl.  I congratulate you, Melissa McCarthy!
Need to see Kathy Bates, Katey Sagal, Ed O’Neil and Ed Harris
Lol "I hate you so much!"
She was boring and lame...I'm indifferent with her.   Her reactions hilarious though.
I agree comedy brings people together.
Finally someone good I love watching
She is definitely one of my favorites ❤
Sean is by far the best interviewer. He keeps the tempo, he doesn’t interrupt, he makes it feel like a conversation rather than an interrogation and he really makes the person he’s interviewing feel like a person. By far my favorite show and show host.
I always fast forward to the bomb.
McCarthy ❤❤❤
American people must be the richest of rich. They keep rebuilding houses pretty much every year. Tornadoes seem to not bother American.. American- rich! Everyone else would've moved. But not Hamerican..
Putting milk in the ice is a GENIUS move!! I hope Sean will recommend it to other guests!
She makes me watch the mermaid just for her.
the tornado story made me sad so quickly, i wanted to hug her and her friend thanks for fighting for comedies, they keep me going  finally! someone eating bread to help!
U should try and get Michelle Obama on
😂 love her
The Little Mermaid is a dumpster-fire.  Race-swapping IS RACIST!
Did you really Dipper fingers in the cup of ice water and then drink out of that same cup
I like her.
SOOKIE FROM GILMORE GIRLSS
"You're a genius" "well, I put milk in a bottle..."
Can you get Halle on here as well?❤
I would be such a baby doing this, I'd have bread and crackers and milkshakes and still cry haha
As a Chicagoan (fellow Illinoisan) just jumped on here to say Jewel’s wings are the best wings ever! 😊
A brave and lovely lady.
The little mermaid was awesome . Ppl saying that because Haley is black it's an issue is ridiculous.
Isn’t Crystal Lake where the Halloween series takes place
She's effortlessly hilarious. They're dying in the background.
I use to go to Plainfield south!! Did your parents tell you not to shower during a storm?!? Might get struck by ⚡
She is so funny!!! x'D
It’s pretty amazing how many people are more badass than DJ Khaled.
For the Instagram questions,  can't you put a large tv in background
Gosh I love this woman. She is such an inspiration. Bless you Melissa.
Why is it that every time I watch this show I want wings??
Absolutely love her!!!!!
GET MATPAT IN HERE!
Great job she made it through, sounded like a smoker at the end 😅
Why didn't Melissa bring some Hidden Valley Ranch to cut the heat?
She came with her own supplies i love it 😂❤️
Anything CITRIC can delude the spicy. I almost had to go to the hospital for eating a Coraline reaper I grew.  Lime & lemon juice girl!!
Love, love love this show…..Sean, everyone’s best bud, thoughtful and smart. Melissa great job, Truely a great and funny human. Sweet…Day made! Cheers.
Loved it! Melissa is a rare gem. Love watching her shows and movies. She is one of my faves.
Honestyl, Melissa pulling off Ursula was what won me over to watch the live action The Little Mermaid.
Get back to making gross out comedy films. Stop with the woke trash 🗑
I am not even done with this and I had to comment mid-episode that this one is so so so good. What amazing stories.
She is such a naturally, funny woman. So quick witted. Proof of her intelligence.
Dang, y'all almost killed Melissa 😅 she did great though 👏🏿 👏🏿👏🏿 her Ursula was gorgeous and she was so dope❤
Please bring Brennan Lee Mulligan from dimension 20 onto the show!!
I'd like to state Ursula had a sister she never reached out to while in the palace or out of it!
I have watched a ton of these and this is by far the best one I have seen
I've never understood why they use wings instead of just using strips,
She did better than Gordon Ramsey. I wonder if they give different guests different heat levels.
I think everyone should be required to eat the entire wing before moving on to the next stage.
Love Melissa. We all a clone of her as a best friend.
The most real moment in the history of Hot Ones. 17:38
7:46  Yea best you didn't finish that sentence lol
🥒 For me the best suiting cooling side dish with hot spicy food is cucumber—I’m baffled that still to this day nobody on this show has tried that… 🌶️🥒
At the risk of Melissa McCarthy dying I really wish this episode was longer. Best interview yet.
I love you all. That is all.❤
I love that she got less views then others …makes me happy
How have I never noticed how beautiful her eyes are? I know she was dying at da bomb but it made her eyes really pop 😂
Gal whips out the squirty cream 😭💀🤣
When she pulled out the bread. I lost it 😂😂😂😭😭
I love her so much!!!! Everything she does is completely funny
Melissa is such a trooper ! Such a fresh breath of air🖤✨
So I was super curious. He would have been exactly 2 years older than me if he had been born 2 weeks earlier lol
LET'S GO MAYA RUDOLPH YOU'RE UP!!
That would be magic to hang out with Melissa McCarthy , Tina Fey, and Amy Poehler, throw Kristen Wiig in the mix and … no words.
Maybe get Kleenex as a sponsor for a "weeping" moment?
Melissa is so funny, I love her 😂
This is definitely a contender for #1 best Hot Ones episode ever!
Her just pulling random stuff out of her bag 😂😂😂
Go girl!
16:32 the fear in her voice
I can’t stop laughing
2 TABLES.......FOKOFF
I hate the one biters
Get Jamie Lee Curtis on the show!!
Her struggling with da bomb had me in tearssss
“I hate you so much”. She is priceless
The interview as always was amazing, and the cartoon retelling was very well done.
That was delightful. Melissa is one of my most favourite funny people! 😁 Congratulations on getting such great guests, Sean. ❤
LOVE HER!!
It's when she broke out the bread tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shes a GOAT
I don’t know what to do 🤣🤣🤣
I wonder what Sean & Bear Grills spoke about that made them feel exposed 👀
I love her so much💕
Melissa is a natural comedian. I was laughing along w the crew the entire episode haha
She reminds me 100% like my aunt.
I get so worried when I see comedians in interviews because sometimes they are rude or they try too hard and Melissa was so kind in this! She is naturally funny
For someone who was shaky eating the first wing, Melissa powered through. Respect 🫡
I love what she said about comedy💯
How come that Da'Bomb is so bad when it is not even the strongest on the scoville scale. I mean the last two sauces is like 500.000+ and Da'Bomb is "only like 131,000
16:05 da'bomb
Who brings whipped cream? I love Melissa so much. 🤣🤣🤣
I love her so much omfg
You should try to get UFC'S Dana White
Imagine a Cross country road trip with her 😂😂😂
Later on, she’s gonna say “it’s coming out like lava!!” 😂😂
I feel in love with her as Sookie from Gilmore Girls. I actually named my daughter Lorelai. Her as the Villian in my favorite Disney movie ever just made her better!! Which i took my daughter "Lorelai" too :) its all full circle@
Yhis was so funny 😂😂
"hit the cow" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 an idiom for drinking milk
I get compared to you a lot.  I'm just a server but I know when someone says you are, it's Melissa. Thank you, I'm glad for the comparison.  Edit,  I love you!
One of my personal favorites now. This one was really surprisingly good. Maybe it's because she's a comedian maybe not.
She was in spys the movie it was so funny
please invite Lauren Graham
Literally live a few mins from Crystal Lake - hahaha didn’t know he was from there!! Weird listening to them talk about where we live 😂 I still hate IL but that’s okay 😂
Please do Jamie from vat19 🥺
Greek yogurt helps with the heat.
Where is Christian Bale? o.O heheheheh
There's never any follow-up of 24 hours later on the spiciness of the chicken wing exit.
She's so funny and kind. Love her!
That's hot ones not all ones, again sometimes voice text works and sometimes it doesn't. Training us to proofread before sending.
M M C you are awesome in all walks of life!!! Thank you all ones!
Her pulling out these random things to help 😅 😂😂😂
Melissa McCarthy is so cool and funny !!! You can just tell she is a nice person !!!
I LOVE MELISSA MCCARTHY
Hearing "Carbondale" was a shocker for me. I live 30min from there. Crazy!
I love Melissa but I ain’t gon lie that da bomb reaction was HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂
I want to see vin diesel on here for some reason
How is she still so elegant and dignified?!....  .. and cute!!!!!
I just love her 💕 she is amazing
Don't get the 10k dislikes (06/23) she is a gem! Funny episode! (102k likes)
She's so funny and beautiful and just brightens up the room! She was amazing as Ursula and definitely the highlight of the movie
Comedies are important needs to go on her tombstone
she's so funny!
Let’s get Guga foods on hot ones
She is really funny, why no one can find her a good script that let her be this funny
"Gladygopus" or esophagus?  Hahaha so funny.
I hope she knows she is 1 of the funniest women out there.
The one thing about Melissa is she is ALWAYS game and, when she commits to a bit or anything, will go to the nth degree. I love her for that.
😂 I almost died laughing 😂😅
Did he say he’s from crystal lake? 😅
I love how once in a while the camera turns and Melissa whips out something new seemingly out of thin air.
Yogurt helps a lot to deal with spicy.
I was a casual fan of Mrs. McCarthy before. But now I see her differently.  What an amazingly sweet person.
You mean to tell me that the host, Melissa, and myself were all in the same area in that tornado! Wow 😮 it’s such a small freakin world.
I love her so much
I absolutely love her
When I heard them talk about her doing Chris Farley on the 40th anniversary show, I stopped this video to head to SNL. I LOVEEEEE Chris Farley. I shed some tears for Chris and came back here. She did an amazing job, much respect to them both
I don't know if I've ever seen someone answer the question that follows Da'Bomb and it was such a good question this time.
She looks so good throughout all of this trauma
Sometimes I feel like they’ve rigged this show and they actually don’t even put the sauce on the sauce anymore
I loved thissss i laughed a lot it was infectious
I love Melisa ❤️❤️❤️😍😒
Yo yo
“As you try to breath in, to live, it gets worse” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀
She was actually breezing through it until the Insanity hit.
All I could think was oh my god she is gonna die on dabomb
I think she will break the hunger games record of joy today :)
I adore Melissa, but it would have been great to see her AND Ben doing this. They are a wonderful funny couple.. :o)
What a great guest
I lost it when Melissa asked, "what's your legal situation?!" 😂😂😂
I lost it when Melissa asked, "ehat's your legal situation?!" 😂😂😂
Dark Chocolate is the key
She's so funny and sweet. I'm happy she was on the show.  :) Ursula has always been my favorite Disney Villain. Hands down.
Sookie you did a great job
I live in Plainfield IL 😑
Amo a esta mujer!!!! Hermosa, inteligente y te hace reír como nadie!!!
I love her. She just seems like such a wonderful person.
I LOVE MELISSA SOOOOO MUCH 🔥🔥
Well she lived through it.  I guess we all suffer now.
16:03
Melissa is genuinely one of the most naturally funny people in Hollywood. She is so down to earth and hysterical! You just want to hang out with her!
She is not funny and never was
I have not full body laughed so hard in a while. Great job Ms. McCarthy, you should be so proud. I don't know how you made it to the last dab but you deserve a crown.
“As you try to breath in to live “ 11:58 😂
"I will fight for it until my last breath,which is in about  4 wings" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did she know this comes out well after the Little Mermaid was released? Poor Melissa
When she brings out the bread, I started cackling 😂😂😂
“I sound like Ursula!” 😂🤣
I've always wondered, is it just me who finds it weird ,also funny but weird, that Sean always says the guests' full name?
SOOOKIEEEE ST JAMESSSSSS MY BEST FRIEND 💗
There is only one cure that actually works. It's super sweet lemonade.
THE DA BOMB IS ALWAYS THE FUNNIEST
I have been such a massive fan of Melissa's work since her early days.  No woman(and very few men) can make me laugh as hard as she can. I love everything she's done, but Bridesmaids has a special place in my heart. I don't think ANYONE could have pulled off that character as well as Melissa! I have to add how she answered the question about dark/violent/hostile movie's and how HW is pushing away comedies now really ticks me off. The whole world is SO ANGRY and violent now. HW needs to get their heads out of their butts and put greatly written comedies with the great comical actors and actresses. Covid ruined alot of people. Families, careers, people lost their homes/apartments and on the streets now. Addiction if worse then its ever been, you know why? WE NEED TO LAUGH AND BE IN A REAL HAPPY ENVIRONMENT! People are so desperate to smile.  If Hollywood won't try to bring in the laughter, or even just a few smiles, we really are done. People underestimate how healthy it is TO LAUGH!!!! Endorphins, serotonin and dopamine levels have clearly vanished the past few years. Everyone is just so hostile and aggressive. It saddens me. So many people self medicate with drink, drug and prescription SSRI's just to try and cope. Melissa hit the nail on the head with her answer. Share the laughs and the love folks! 💕 from 🇨🇦  ✌️  🌈
I know this sounds cheesy, but Melissa is so down to earth & relatable that I feel like she could be a member of my family. She's genuine & it's so beautiful. 🤗
What happens to the open bottles of sauces after they are used in every episode?
Happy to see the science has changed to in person interviews. Btw the stupidest thing this show has done so far 😊
I love that Hot Ones has become a stop on the talk-show circuit. We're getting people on the show who have no business around spicy food just to promote their project...and it makes it that much better.
I really needed a laugh/ smile.  Thank you
Awesome show 😂
I watched this hoping that I would like her as a person since I don't really care for her movies and that's exactly what happened.  She seems like a genuinely good person.  Her talking about how we need comedy is so true.  I'll definitely be watching her in a different light going forward.
I love her in this. She is such a genuinely nice person with a great sense of humour. She must be fantastic at a bbq with a few beers just kicking back.
She did so well! When she said she can’t handle spicy at the beginning I was concerned for her but she was a champ and went all the way! 🎉 Also cracked me up when she pulled out her own foods throughout (milk spray, whipped cream, bread)
I've always loved milk and ice
She's such a delightful human being, I can just watch her talk and be herself for hours and not get tired of it. I love her energy
Hot Ones is where agents take their clients as a payback 😂. You can always heard them enjoying in the background
Joliet baby
I just love her.
She’s so good in the role. I saw this after I saw the movie and it’s true
Melissa has "funny bones"! Love her to bits
Did I do it? 😂
does anyone else think this hot wing guy is like... really hot. Like no joke.
The realization of it having to come out the other end hasn't hit her ye.. 😂😂
Love her😂❤🎉
Da bomb wing was funny 😂😂🎉
Throwing the bread across the table had me crying 😂😭 God I just love her ❤ One of my favourite actresses ❤
Props to Melissa for doing an accidental whippet on that whipped cream 😂 😂 🤤
Now I’d love to see Chloe and Halle on Hot Ones
I love you Melissa, I laughed with you through this process. Great job😃
Funniest one to date 😂. 🖕🏻
I love Melissa
i never knew she was from plainfield!!! i'm 30 minutes north !
Lost it when she just busted out that loaf of bread 😂
❤❤❤
This show really makes it clear how white celebrities’ teeth are. I mean, of course they are, but you don’t usually get to look at them like this.
That’s crazy she came in prepared 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My GLADAGLOPPIS -- please 🤣
Maybe I shouldn't be drinking coffee while watching this. When she brought out the spray bottle nearly had me choking
It's fun! In the kind of way when you break a leg and everyone gets to sign your cast 🤣👌🏼
Bill Hader is a Hot Ones holy grail, a hill yall should die on. He hates press junkets, he's not a huge fan of being interviewed on camera in general. I think Sean and the team would actually make an interview a good experience for him. I think he'd have fun knowing the platform.
Awsome
When, when will Smokin Ed be on the show??? Pepper X is OUT💅🏻
"Oh this is an application moment" was so funny to me hahaha
That tornado was scary. My dad's cousin died in it. He was on his paper route that day.
We need to send the last bottle. For anything she to cry on scene for.😂
20:25 Da Bomb isn't for anyone, love. It's fire and agony, no matter who you are.
she is so funny 😂
I absolutely love this woman. She is iconic 😍 ❤
Melissa was perfect in this part!
What a genuine person she is.
This may just be your best guest ever & that’s saying something. What a delight she is
Da bomb sauce should be last dab bcuz everyone breaks down a bunch on that one... 😂😂😂
AYYYYEEEEE PLAINFIELD REPRESENT 😤😤😤😂
Adidas track suit. Nike shoes. Style.
You guys need to get Mike Rowe on here, "Dirtiest Jobs"
What season is it now? Why haven't anyone tried hot milk or tea? Cold stuff does not work for spicy food, do hot or warm and it will hurt you more but after that the pain is gone.
I have always loved Melissa, sooo pretty and sooo funny. I first saw her in Mike and Molly and fell in love with her, then her film with Sandra, who I also love cemented it :)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 love this woman
One for the top ten!
I liked her in Mike and Molly. 👍😀
So much respect for a person like this who has a tough time and gets slammed by Da Bomb but still finishes the board and does a Last Dab. Props to Melissa for that. Great episode, she's so funny and charming.
please remove the back ground music for future episodes. please
Finally someone who brought bread. I've always heard the bread helps.
She is looking phenomenal. Funniest episode! Well done!
Does each season actually have it's own set of hot one's hot sauce?
I have never laughed at one of the reactions to hot sauce on here but her reaction to Da Bomb had me losing it.
Sooooo funny! & you did it! 🙂👍🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵😋
Can you PLEASE get Joseph Quinn? I feel like he would be hilarious at this
Her on Da Bomb is me on Tabasco 😭 I literally die from the smallest amount of spice. I would die on that chair in front of him as soon as one single atom of Da Bomb hits me anywhere on my body
He grew up in Crystal Lake? Does he by any chance walk around with a hockey mask and a machete when he’s bored?
My WC4EVER
The wings always look cold and dry.
The hiccup-gulp replayed in the last second took me out 🤣☠️☠️☠️☠️
Melissa McCarthy is a national treasure
IL Crystal lake squad way to rep!!
Finally! Bread! The only thing that helps. Melissa is so down to earth. I love her. And she was also born in 1970. Gooood year. ♫
Ugh I love her
I actually started crying from laughter at this. She is so effortlessly funny
The yellow woman was Madalina ghenea
I love her!!! Loved her from Gilmore Girls!!! Sooki!!!! But I guess they didn’t talk about it here
sean supporting her with the “yeah we’re getting up there a little bit” on the first one, was adorable😂
Can we switch the music a lil bit please 🙏
She flicked the bird 😂😂😂
I wish he asked her about Gilmore Girls!! 😭 I love her
Do Mathew Steve Rife please 🥺
Hey its that lady from the horrible Ghostbusters 2016 remake
It’s the kindest show but not the kindest show. 😅
Love her ❤❤❤❤
“if you try to breath in (TO LIVE)… it gets worst” 😭😂😭😂
Had to watch this. I absolutely love her.
This is one of my favourite episodes ever. Love love LOVE Melissa McCarthy 😭❤️
I was born in Illinois, but moved to NY around 69-71, long time ago,lol. But I always remembered what a tornado sky looked like. In '80, i was outside w my baby and looked up, grabbed him, heading for the basement,yelling for my husband to join us. He INSISTED NY did NOT get tornados. Well, a village about 30 mins from us got hit pretty bad. He trusted me after that! But then, even though i had never been in 1 before, i told him when the 2 small earthquakes hit 😂 gotta love NY, no safer than anywhere else😢
I love this one 😊😢❤
🖤🖤🖤
I'd like to make a request 🙂 can you invite justin bieber? Only him 💀
I'm from Fox lake, IL, Sean!!!
Hahahahahaha “what’s your legal situation?” Hit me hahaha 😂😂😂
Love her even more now !❤
My uncle always drinks milk with ice
Love her.
Hahaha love this human ❤❤
really funny episode, i love melissa
I freaking love Melissa ❤️ she is so funny and sweet
Did she really just say galapagapos
Please have Tim Robinson on
We need the Rock on hot ones!
She is funny.
Sean lived 5 minutes from me....I worked near Melissa's cousin and her famous Hubby's house....sometimes I love IL lol
SHE IS TOOO FUNNY AHHHH 🤣😭 i love her so so much, my beautiful virgo queeeen 💅🏽✨
“As you try to breathe in… to live… it gets worse.” ☠️☠️
The moment I found out that Sean was from Crystal Lake, I think I heard some echoed “ch” and “ah” noises…  (If you know my intentional joke and watched some of the classic horror movies, you know.)
It's quaint that 1 is spicy for her. I would probably be the same way. I literally can't eat minimal levels of spicy foods.
Cool Whip does the trick
(Illinois in da HOUSE!!!)
i love melissa
Melissa’s take on the importance of comedy… amazing.
Not even a question about Gilmore girls??
Melissa is one of my most favorite ladies in the world. Shes so awesome to watch.
When she eats the 1st wing 😂😂😂
It hurts so much to smile 😅😅
I absolutely love her! Thank you for having her on here!
First to Hit a whip-it on hot hot ones.
im laughing so hard ahahaahahahahah
Water does not help. Never ever.
Is it cheating to wear lipstick?
The background laughs really does it for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I grew up in Plainfield/Joliet Ill anybody that was in that storm will never forget it! I know I never will… RIP to the 29 lives lost on that day❤️🙏🏻
those poor, unfortunate, souls...
If everyone here bought a ticket to her last movie it wouldn't have bombed so badly
God!!!!!! I just love her more and more and more and more. I want MORE Melissa!
Join the crowd Missy.  No tolerance.  I would probably need recessed after these wings.  Love you girl!
Loved this episode to DEATH!!!!!!!! Love Melissa, love her reaction, loved her responses to her questions. Gold. Will watch again with some friends.
*Melissa McCarthy:* Oh, my God. I sound like Ursula. *Me:* No, honey. You don't sound like Ursula. It's just a character.
The best episode ever ❤
23:14 That's half full. (clears throat)
Everything she does is epic! Come on Queen! ❤
She is soooo funny... 🤣
BRING JACK CHAMPION
What, you're from Crystal Lake? I lived in Fox Lake for many years and had several friends in Crystal Lake.
when eating hot spicy food don't drink water  it makes it worse, drink milk it really helps
The music reminds me of Narnia: the lion the witch and the wardrobe
This was the best episode EVER!!!!
I ❤ iced milk❤😂😂😂
14:55 (inhales, puffs cheeks)
14:28 That's whipped cream.
I think we're gonna work... I think it's a world of trouble. I think when, and I love... (clears throat) all types of movies and shows and books every time.
Melissa McCarthy is literally the same age as my mom. she is 4 months younger then my mom. i found that out and was so amazed because i thought she was in her late 30s, good for her for looking younger then she is. i hope i look as good as she does at her age. she is never gonna forget when she first blew her nose on camera. its for sure gonna be a core memory being on this video. she is such a good team player.
I had a pc game of mermaid❤
oh god, i love this woman! <3
Melissa McCarthy I totally love her acting and her personality. The whole time I watched this I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. I also seen the little Mermaid  with my friend .It is a really good movie.And Sean he was taking it like like a champ .Like it wasn't even bothering him. God bless you and your family ❤
Fun fact: when Melissa was on Bridesmaids Pat Carol who was the original Ursula was an extra. 🤯
i like melissa mccarthy as an actress, as a person, but the movies she was in did not really catch me…  she should really be the bad guy more often. it is really great.
antidote? i would just take something fatty, because now i have an excuse to eat or drink it 😂🤗
Loved Melissa giving him the finger 😂
The sound at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥😄
And yet EVERYONE has done better than Fukboi DJ Khaled....
Love Melissa ❤ and her spray milk bottle 😂
she may get casted in so many mediocre movies, but i otherwise like Melissa's acting energy. i first seen her as Sookie in Gilmore Girls, and she fit into that character so well. i will say that i did enjoy that one puppet one, The Happytime Murders.. don't get me wrong, it wasn't a good movie, but if you have some sense for immaturity and like ridiculous tonal contrast to the point of self-parody, it's a wonderful trainwreck of a movie that i found fairly amusing to watch.
I had the bomb on a tortilla chip, a whole scoop of it. It tastes very bitter and while it’s spicy, based off my experience with that I think I could do the wing challenge fairly well
Some of these quests make this seem VERY dangerous!
"I don't know what to do" "Maybe go for the spray" Omfg I lost it. Shaun low key trollin to get that good content. 10/10
I'd like some heat and Kleenex
I'm weeping....
She by far my favorite actress. She is so talented and beautiful.  What a role model 😊
7:34 (Melissa) Yup. Yup.
Dying laughing at this episode, love you Melissa!
8:03 (clears throat)
6:59 (clears throat)
Aloe juice
Love her ❤ even more now in the Little Mermaid as Ursula and that she sings awesome! 😘 crying for you Melissa eating those hot wings lol I'm a fan
5:37 (clears throat)
Wow. I didn't know Melissa could pour milk in a spray bottle.
I felt so bad for her at the first wing KNOWING da' bomb was coming and I just watched Jennifer Lawrence's video where she was crying at da' bomb lol so I knew Melissa was in for a rough one
13:00 so true if Netflix produced all comedy’s for 6 months straight the whole worlds mindset will become so positive
I love that Shawn tries to be empathetic and relatable to the guest but this is a bit much with all the pretending. Man you're not really feeling all that heat
She did not just pull out a spray bottle filled with milk.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I could t imagine the torture of the porcelain the next day for each new guest.  I’d imagine by now that Sean has developed and iron stomach and iron intestines.
I been waiting for her to do this . I love her down she one of my Fav actors. Then I love this show so it’s a perfect blend for me ❤
DA BOMB 16:05 ! ! !
Why do people drink water or milk? If something in your mouth is spicy, eat pure sugar. Puts the fire out
She’s so adorable 😂😂
"We're in for one today"  Love when Sean says what everyone is thinking
This was so funny😂
Vulnerability😂. Again, I thank you
The way she chucks that crust at him 😂
Not gona lie. Really happy for these guys for getting these amazing guests on the show. Its clear how popular this has gotten
I thought j-Law's reaction to Da Bomb was hilarious... Then I saw Melissa flipping the bird for it... She WON! 😂😂😂😂
if you haven't seen it already - search for her SNL skit "hidden valley ranch dressing"
I never thought I could love this woman more than I already did! I loved what she said at the end about sharing the experience of a film and all it's emotions with an entire room of people.... just an amazing woman!
I love mermaid's ❤ 🧜🏼‍♀️ I really enjoy that movie 🎥🍿😊
best episode so far 😂😂😂😂😂
Wait did Melissa just do an 80's whipit?
According to the Mythbusters episode about Capsaicin and their conclusion was that carbs (bread or rice, etc.) seem to be the most effective at cancelling it out.
God i love melissa shes the best
She is so naturally funny and I am here for it
17:38😂
I love her what a trooper she was! I have to know more about the colorful rings she was wearing on her left hand 😍
Love her❤and she was incredible as Ursula!
Love her. She seems to be so genuine 😊
THE BEST EPISODE EVER! Melissa is amazing... It feels like when she has one of those funny disgusting things that are great.
This was hilarious!! Great Da Bomb reaction!
Was nice to have small town Illinois talk in this. Makes it so relatable
She is brilliant and hilarious. Well done for getting Melissa on the show. Love it!
Poor Melissa 😂 but its relatable to see someone have a strong reaction to this insane spice!
Melissa McCarthy is an absolute legend ,her films are absolutely amazing ,I have laughed my heart out every movie she has made, we need more of her she makes people come alive with laughter  ,we need this in the world we live in now ,my favourite was spy …haha love her laugh even thinking or talking about her  ❤️❤️🥰👍
Question can you compare the pacqui chip to a level of sauce?
😂❤️ I love Melissa
i love her so much, she is absolutely amazing
That line where she is like if you try to breath in to live killed me 😂
I love her had me in tears laughing
Would love to see this combined with Kevin Harts ice tubs! What a range of sensations for the body!
I really love her! Besides I’ve been dubbing her for LATAM ❤ really love her ❤❤❤
I would just bring water or some type of juice. Don’t really need an antidote, just something to drink while I eat!
Plz have Brittany Broski on@
Although I am not a massive fan of Melissa McCarthy I enjoyed this episode very much! :) I prefer her real life humor than the one in the movies ;D
I was already worried after the first one 😶Her sense of humor is too vibrant for mediocre responses to the spiciness 😂😂
Every time  I'm feeling depressed  lonely  scared  I watch one of Mellisa  movies and I just start laughing  😂 she really  lifts my spirits  🤟🤣😉❤️❣️❤️❤️
Best Da Bomb reaction I've seen yet 😂
Sean's murdering her with Da Bomb and she says sorry for kleenex work 🥺
She and I have red eyes from two different reasons.
I love her so much ugh 🩷
Chocolate kisses are supposed to help take heat away 😅😅😢😂
Probably the funniest person on SNL in 20 years
Idea for next season. Figure out how to make sure you serve the wings hot. Use a slow cooker or those sterno burners on a tray. I know they're small little things and cool off quickly, but it would be epic to keep em warm and have Gordon Ramsay back on the show.
I love when you hear the crew laughing that’s how you know a guest is hilarious I love Melissa McCarthy
Loved her since her always scene-stealing role in Gilmore Girls, the show of my childhood. This was great!
Eats 'Da Bomb, gives Sean da bird! 💀  Also, spray bottle of milk!
P.S... Melissa If U Ever Get Tired Of Ben..😏 Please Call Me!!😁😁
Melissa's FLAWLESS!! So Natural To Fall For Her..To Take In EVERRYTHING She Does!! 💋💋💋💋💋 Da Best Melissa!
Bahahaha - I just watched her eat "da bomb" - the best!!
I’ve never laughed so much at an episode ❤
can we finally get Arnold Schwarzenegger on here
I love Melissa! she’s the best 😭
Poor Melissa!!!!!♥♥ ♥ ♥ ♥
This was the best one yet.  I couldn't stop laughing and I love Melissa McCarthy.  She's a GREAT and AWESOME Actress!!!
For someone who makes one of the hotest pico de gayo's in my 50yrs. Im telling you to eat a fresh tomato!!! it kills the spice!
Give her 100 wings & she still wouldn't be full
“What’s your legal situation?” When i tell you i died laughing 😂💀
Why doesn't anyone ever try tomato juice???? I swear it helps better than anything else, including milk. It's science. Capsaicin is alkaline, you need something acidic to counteract.
I’m cryingggg 😂😂😂 when she whipped out the baguette! She’s so funny!
Sean, you should invite Andrew Tate for your next episode
Citrus fruit is the only thing that will dissolve the hot sauce oils and prevent them from overwhelming you.
How do you guys not have a alcohol wet wipe sponsorship?
She did such an amazing job,We love you girl,Hmmm there Is a hot sauce made with the infamous Chocolate Bhutlah called the chocolate plague,Maybe put that on the roster once.
What a star
The best ever, what a great episode.
Can we get some of the UK Comedians?
She is so amazing and it was so much fun to watch her struggle through and her wonderful comedic way. I sat here and tried the season new sauces while watching.   , I always love yalls the best, but for the new ones… #1- jalapenochico #2 (tie) alchemy and the lemon pepper #3- Chile language de diego  I am really not a coconut fan so la pimenterie and the spicy shark not “my cup of tea”  You guys always pick some awesome ones.
Please interview Madonna again for her tour! You did great for her Rebel Heart Tour.
16:54 i know i know outta control hahaha
We need Linus Tech Tips next!!
Great episode! I would like to see Johnny Deep. I think he has great stories to tell.
Love Melissa so much.
Why is the bomb different in the line up in the sauces that are for sale? ..i am doubting the authenticity of the sauces for sale now....
I love you Mrs. McCarthy. You are such a beautiful human, and I respect you so much.
Would love to see Conan O Brien here!
I'd love to see Tobias Forge from Ghost on this show!!!
I find it so funny that Sean always mirrors his guests. If they are suffering he looks like he is as well. And when he is interviewing someone who can handle spice, he can too. Best actor ever!!
Right on!!! I believe you're so right about needing more comedy. I'm not saying let's forget about what happened bad in the past but let's get through it and move forward!!!
i love watching her. she may think she didnt do well with the wings but i have seen many others do much worse lol
My God, she is so goooooooorgeous!! And she looks so cute strugling with tears and bugers. I love her so much!
Sookie!
I love her congrats 🎉
I need to see the Kardashians on this show
😅😂 That moment in my life where I say, "I'm so lucky I'm a no one so I know without a doubt I'll never have the pressure of thinking should I so the show or not?" 😅😂 I have NO threshold for heat PERIOD 😅😂 She handled these wings like the boss lady she is!  So gracefully yet hilarious 😂 😅 I enjoy every single movie 🎬 Melissa is in ❤ RESPECT 😊  She's called her legal team before she even left the building 😅😂
Love her!
My favorite Hot Ones interview so far. Melissa McCarthy is smart and funny, and still somehow relatable.
Melissa is an American treasure.
She is so hot. I've had a crush on her for years. Spy is my favorite movie but Bridesmaids is what made me love her. I felt the heat come off that under carriage. "Movie reference"
Do u guys have any hungry hippo tips for a lil ol gal like me
She looks like Melissa nccsarthy
Oh GOD, she's sooo lovely and funny. I loved this episode...especially with the smart Diablo IV ad. xD
AVP  my fault / clever /haaa / haaa/ but hey /   oh yeah ,../  my  fault 🤣😶‍🌫🤣//
Melissa is so awesome.  Still watch reruns of mike and molly over and over again.
she ate that 🔥
Her eyes are SO BEAUTIFUL. She has always been my favorite host on SNL. She always did her own thing off script, and she is genuinely SOOOOO FUNNY. LOVE YOU MELISSA!
Crystal lake....... Camp blood!!!!
Best Hot Ones I ever watched! Real. Funny, and I thought she done a great job !
I looooove her!!!!!❤
Melissa looks so beautiful
One of these days you gotta use Melinda's Ghost Pepper or Skorpion Pepper sauce. :)
Shout out to SIU Carbondale!
Melissa is the greatest
This new fad of trying to find ways to associate or understand villains is beyond me.
I just love Melissa McCarthy!  She is always SO funny!!!
Love her!! Such a beautiful soul and of course you also Sean
Wow. I never thought I would be able to say I had a favorite guest but she is the best ever. I love everything about her. Such a treasure of a soul.
ITS COMIN OUT OF ME LIKE LAVA
Please please please get Josh Allen on here
Her reaction to da bomb had me HOWLING
😂❤ what a good sport, a queen always. Also another great interview! Love how the questions bring out guests true energy every time ✨️
Funniest reaction of all time.....  I don't know what to do...... lol!
Her and Pedro pascal are my two favorite episodes 😅💜
Now I want wings
I love Melissa Mc Carthy. Love everything about her!!!!
“Nothing really straightens up a throat like whole milk” 😂😂
I remember the days when Sean was not so 'I know, I know' I prefer his silence to just let them exist in torture.
I lost it when she ate the Da Bomb and said “I don’t know what to do.” 🤣🤣
Love Melissa McCarthy- just so warm, hilarious, and delightful! Brave
"As you try to breathe in to live" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that cracked me up
She's amazing,  couldn't stop laughing 😆 🤣
I loved her performance as Ursula on the little mermaid, she nailed that character!! I liked she gave her own small twists to Ursula’s character but she gave me goosebumps when I saw her 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼.
love her
She is EXACTLY the reaction I fully expect from this experience. Mad respect!
"As you try to breathe in to live it gets worse" 🤣
Is anyone else watching this getting excited for da bomb 😂
Melissa is the best!!!❤❤❤
Bro!!! You gotta bring back asking the questions before the guest has the chance to fully digest being assaulted by a chicken wing! I know the guests hate it, but for us it's comedy GOLD!!! 🤣
HOT COFFEE is the ONLY thing that works. It melts/dissipates the capsaicin oils.
She better not mess with those eyes. She has the prettiest eyes in Hollywood after Debi Mazar.
Why are you sitting so far apart?!🤔
you can see melissa is such a beautiful person inside and out i love her
She's so awesome, I laughed so hard when she ate da bomb, haha
Melissa McCarthy is a treasure.  I really love her.  God bless you, woman.
Melissa is sooooo coool
It's going to be coming out of Melissa like lava 🤣she is such a funny lady, love her so much!
That lawyer question was way  too funny than it was supposed to be😂😂😂
la pimenterie! Quebec <3 merci Shaune
My 1st thought is when she was in bride's maids and she pooped in the sink and she said it was like lava 😂😂
Thank You Melissa McCarthy for all the laughs and joy you have given me You are AMAZING! I am a fan of yours You are beautiful for all that you do inside and out! Stay awesomely wonderful being the joyful person that makes you You! You are a living legend in my mind and I am so grateful to be able to watch you do what you do in so many movies I am so thankful for you because I love to laugh Nobody can compare to you You do good work and put smiles on the faces of so so many around the world and to me That is a special  thing that not many people can do I am proud to live in a life that has you on my TV and that makes me grateful Thank you for being such an Idol to not only me but to so many people You are ICONIC!

What a funny Chick!!!  Love her, such a good sport!!!  🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
Funniest episode ever lol
Always enjoy her interviews. Fun energy
Melissa was charming, articulate, funny and as beautiful as ever.  Sean is so supportive and kind.  I loved 😍 this episode.
Melissa is the best 😄🤍
ayy shoutout plainfield
Love it! I literally 😂😂😂😂😂 she is awesome! 😊
the way yall included those eyebrows... but this was hilarious
Shannon from Try not to eat should totally be here! ❤
She is just so effortlessly feel good funny. Love you melissa!
Finally snagged some dabomb, find it quite tasty, immediately went out and grabbed a second bottle.
They should use the spray milk for the next interview 😂 That is so genius
I love Melissa. She is so pretty too, great smile.
Peanut butter is what I use for heat! It surprisingly works way better than ice and milk and ice cream!
One of my favorite episodes yet. I love Melissa. Huge fan!!
bring blackpinkkkkkkkkkk
Gawd, I love that human. She’s great. Also, we got a set of the sauces a few years ago. My youngest two were about 7 and 9. They liked the last dab Apollo sauce. One just liked to try it, the other used it as his regular hot sauce on his food. But he’s also the one who would ask for spoonfuls of Texas Pete and Franks Red Hot since he was a toddler.
She just seems like the most naturally awesome person
Do you have sample or mini size lineup sauce sets? That’d be 💣 if you did. 🥁🥁🥁 But fr? …
"This bread's actually working for me by the way." As Sean is talking around the bread in his mouth. Classic.
Is it possible she had no control of her legs and had an out of body experience because Chris was taking over and was happy to take center stage?...🙄
The funniest hot ones I've seen thus far. Melissa McCarthy is a gift!
I would have to wear gloves😮‍💨 I’d be the one to get it in my eye🤦🏾‍♀️
One of the best I’ve ever seen!! Congrats Melissa!!!
This is giving Maya Rudolf on SNL as Beyonce on Hot Ones. Loved every minute
She is a national treasure. The best hot ones ever (and that's saying something)
THEO VON NEXT PLSSSSSSS
I've been watching since month 1 and check you guys out now!  Hard work and ingenuity really paid off.  From one Chicagoan to another... YOU ROCK!!
Comedies ARE important, and we love you, Melissa.
I remember that tornado like it was yesterday.  It was August 28, 1990. I was sitting on my porch and the sky turned green. I remember grabbing my 1 year old son and going inside. It was horrible. A girl I went to school with and who was also my neighbors granddaughter died in it along with her 3 month old daughter. Word has it she was still holding her baby when thru doing her. Her granddad my neighbor had just dropped her off at home. It was a sad day in Joliet, Crest Hill, and Plainfield.
Love love love MM!! ❤️
You are one of many women who did the wings with grace. Congratulations!  I loved your Ursula!
Oswego native! Live u guys!😂
The soundtrack for dabomb XD
Actors should now include a no HOT Ones show ups in their contracts,
I want her to be remembered as THE URSALA. Like until the end of time. You have to be brave to take on a role like that.
Get Halle Bailey on here
😂😂😂😂
Not Melissa McCarthy doing whip it’s on hot ones 😂🥰
lol shawn playing up the pain when his guests are struggling.
lol is Diablo actually a sponsor?
"I'm no superhero" should mean a tequila shot for the Hot Ones drinking game.
She made spit out my juice
It just occurred to me that this is fake
"Is this the one you'll revert ..you'll die immediately"
Big ups to you Mrs Melissa I love you soooo ❤❤❤❤❤
I hate how he's trying to "validate" them the whole time...
Why didn't you bring up Gilmore girls 😭
The spray milk is hilarious
Easily one of my favorite people outside of my own family...lol. I love her much.
I love Melissa as a person. She’s truly amazing and hilarious.
Are these people insured?
She is naturally funny ❤ glad she was on the show 😊
You can do this Melissa,  I know you can....
Melissa gives "hilarious Aunt at the family get together" vibes and I love it. She's so funny.
wow he made Melissa McCarthy laugh! well done 🙌
Love her ❤😂
As much as I love her my kids will never see another disney movie again until they return to having morals.
I love her so much,  she's my cousin in my head!! 😂💖❤️‍🔥
YOGURT!!! Use yogurt, freeze it and it always works for the heat.
She got mad at the shark one 😂😂😂
I could never do this. My throat would be jacked up for weeks
She will always be Sookie to me and the reason why my passion for cooking bloomed
Best guest EVER,  I love her <3 <3 <3
"oh my God I sound like Ursula" ! Melissa you are hilarious!
Best guest ever!  ❤Melissa McCarthy ❤
This is the best hot ones episode I've seen yet. Melissa McCarthy is just absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂
Did they reverse the order? I thought it was from left to right.
17:39  😂😂 I LOVE HER
I like any Melissa content prior to watching the content. End of topic.
Oh I know later on it was coming out of her like lava 😅
2 northern Illinois people! so much fun!
She is amazing!!  I love her!!
I,m sitting here rocking, like Noooooooooo Milissa
Mad respect for continuing past Da' Bomb Melissa! Very entertaining and informative interview, thank you. Also, you did a great Matt Foley.
Melissa is a perfect Ursula. I believed she was the same character from the animated movie.
Love this woman. She is effortless funny. She is correct about comedy. Heat and Mike & Molly are my go tos for hard times!💯💯 (⁠•⁠‿⁠•⁠)
She did absolutely great!
Love this show and all of the guests Sean. Truly awesome. Not sure if you take requests for guests… but I bet you would have a blast with the Kelce brothers together. After watching their podcast and your show I think that you are destined to do this show together lol
My favorite movie from her was Tammy, I love Melissa McCarthy! ❤️ This was awesome to see haha
I love her lol
one of the best
I love her!!! she seems like someone that would be so great to hang out with. side note, when I drive up to chicago, I always stop in Plainfield omw home to get Giordanos!  So awesome that shes from there.
I think she's just amazing ❤
Why do the still sit so far away from each other?
Now THAT was enjoyable episode!  Melissa was SO much fun to watch!
Lol... It's not hot until literally ur ear drums feel on fire!.. that's when it's hot enough ❤
i grew up in cary illinois!! not far away from crystal lake
U should try to get Roma downy from touched by angel to do and episode of hot ones
Well that was just delightful 😊
Ahhh I love her so much!!!!! Still so hilarious and lovely and professional while being “tortured” hahaha
I live 20 minutes from Carbondale illinois.
This is going to be epic 😂
I love her so much!!! ❤
You to try to breathe in to live....lol
Melissa McCarthy is one of the best ppl
Melissa just casually flipping him off is one of my favorite things.
Plainfield lol that’s wild
She’s really something special!!!!!😂😂😂 The first one where I was dying laughing
Not level 1 being spicy lol. I'm of the light skin persuasion too but i love spice and seasonings. My mom can't even eat black pepper 😂. *Edit... Ok i need that zesty lemon pepper sauce. That looks delicious.
idk about 120$ 😂😂😂😂
When she was talking about bridesmaids did she really say I think I need a kanga.   Lol.  It's Kangol and never heard it pronounced like that before
I had to watch this 😂
I love this show and her what a badass
Rather watch the amazing Melissa over the annoying Rosalia any day! 🤣
I love Melissa, she is so funny 🤣🤣
She did an awesome job, but no thanks to bread from the snotty hands!  Pass!
WOOOW, that bit 12:51 - 13:41. I've never heard her speak like that before, and that was some wisdom!
She did so well!!! She was able to lucid talk through everything for so long, what a good sport. I can't beleive she made it to the last dab after her first wing.
My favorite line: 'and your trying to breath in to live '.😂😂😂
I’d love to see the current F1 drivers participate in this - Lewis Hamilton, George Russell, Charles Leclerc, Landó Norris, Daniel Ricciardo, Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz, etc.
I think I saw her spirit leave her body.   Love her she is great.
SEANNNN! For no apparent reason, you need to get Amy Lee on the show.
I love her!!  ❤
Omgosh that poor woman why in gods green earth would u torture her like that??? Bless her heart for doing this interview. She powers through because she is such a beautiful powerhouse.
Way to go Melissa👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This episode is right up there with Ramsay. If I was going to show someone this show for the first time, this would be one of my go-to episodes.
I love her.😀
I love her!
WHEN SHE PULLED OUT THE BREAD I LOST IT 😭🤚
I BEYONDDDD LOVE YOU, @MELISSAMCCARTHY  !🥰🫠😎
She must be one of the funniest people ever!
I laughed so much! 😂😂 Thank you!
i stopped to give my like but i cant stand her acting
This was one of the best to date. Love Melissa McCarthy. Fun fact: There is a compound in chillies that fools the brain into thinking eating them causes pain when in fact there isn't actually any 'burning pain'.
wow i legit have a new respect an love for Melissa McCarthy, she is a delight an really funny. handled it like a champ!
Wait until it exits the body……ouch
She just had prop after prop after prop. GOAT.
😂😂 its always funny when the topic of suing comes up, but in reality everyone would HATE the person who did it. Yes, a money come up, but career suicide 😂😂😂😂
Way to go Melissa for someone who cant handle spice she did good
AVP  .. no   your  were /  you were scared / they were ...  after you ,. this time /  the  snictch g I=thing...even  by 205 .  was  way  diffent thant hen  90's/   yep /
My daughter used to half jalapeno peppers and wipe the seeds out and eat them whole. Well she wiped her eye lids before I could stop her. You can imagine how she reacts, after googling for help to stop the burning. It turns out Olive oil saved the day. Lol she hasn't touched jalapeno peppers since.
I Stan Melissa!  She’s just a true pure soul! ❤️🙌🏼
Sadly I could not make it through this one...
Love Melissa.... She's not afraid to be herself.
Love love love her!!!
The show definitely lost something when it went to the Hollywood guests. Just seem like another stop on the promo circuit now.
I think Michelle Obama gonna Rock this challenge !! 🤭😎
Get Marc Mckee!
So good! 🤣
I Love this Woman! She is so beautiful inside and out. ❤❤❤
😂
❤
❤❤❤
This is the worst reaction to Da Bomb. I was legit worried for her!
I thought she was an actress.
She's such a hoot. Great episode
I found myself smiling the whole show🔥♥️I really love her... And her energy is so dope
Da Bomb is the worst
I love Melissa, but I will not be watching The Little Mermaid which I've renamed The Underwater Live of Sid.
She did that better than most men!
This was such a great episode, she's a delight!
I’m a mexicant!!😅😅
I’m Hispanic and I would never do this challenge!😂😂😂
Great interview. The background music is really irritating however, and quite distracting/overpowering. Can't we just hear you both talk without a peculiar soundtrack?
This is how its done dj khalid
Love her!!  Great thoughts on the power of film
“I’ve never blown my nose on camera before.”  Woman, you shat in a sink in one of the funniest scenes I’ve ever watched!
How can you NOT absolutely love Melissa McCarthy!
Really love Melissa McCarthy - enjoy Hot Ones, nice combination. 🙂
The funniest show I've seen... LOL... TY...
I was in tears at 26:08😂😂😂
Please someone get Nardwuar in the hot seat.
The bread 👍🤣
She is so dang funny and delightful.
Melissa you are so  awesome
I’m pretty culturally inept but I know these two share the same love for portillos as I do. 🥲 grew up in pville, I get so excited when she talks about the suburbs too or Sean about the city 😂 I clicked only for that moment
I just love Melissa, such a talented and funny woman. She handled that like such a polite trooper. ❤
And just like that McCarthy sky-rockets into first place as my (and everyone's) favourite guest on Hot Ones. What a legend.
😂😂😂😂
My mouth hurts a lot Hurts a lot  Ur su la
This was one of the most entertaining, funny and anxiety filled episodes
She did quite well😂 I was expecting her to stop after the bomb but she didn’t and  that’s a feat on its own 🙌🏼 😂
I find bottled Beetroot works the best for me...
This is the perfect show for her.
She is soooooo loveable..❤
I've been a fan for years. But how hand fed has this become? Barely any sauce, barely any bites, telling people the 8th sauce is the worst. So why the last 2?. Not deep as deep questions. Let's kick it up!
I really hope the next guest would be Sasha Calle
I just want to know what HGTV design choices she screams at. Is it painted trim? It’s painted trim, isn’t it?
I love  Melissa I enjoy her movies and the tv show Mike and Molly❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
+1   vanilla milkshake and a slurpee machine with three flavors - coca cola, watermelon & pina colada
Loved this so much! From laughing and crying at the same time, I love Melissa McCarthy!  She is hilarious and beautiful inside and out.  🥰❤❤
I LOVED her as Ursula!
She is so funny! ❤
I love the spray milk! 😂
I want Terri Joe on hot ones
I just love her!!  Melissa oozes love of comedy!  One of my most favorite comedic actors/actresses.
Sean needs to get Joe Santagato on here. Plus plug his own hot sauce.
To all celebs.. baby teething tabs helped more than anything after I did a large dab of maddog357
Any 90’s kids think her voice sounds exactly like Delilah that did the Radio Station 🥹🤍 such a beautiful and peaceful person. You Did Great In This Show!
There's probably more people who watched this than the new Little Mermaid...
I figured this would be awesome. It did not disappoint.
Queen, comedy does bring people together
please contact bretman rock i wanna see what questions ull ask and how well hes gonna take the spice. day one of asking and probably the last day bc im bad at consistency but rlly want u guys to interview bret <3
Girl, you did it!!!!!!!!!!
You did great Melissa!
She nailed this interview, great episode!
I have not laughed this hard at an episode.  Excellent work on both sides of the table.
I love her😂😂😂
Melissa McCarthy ROCKS everything she does! What a delightfully wonderful person!
“If you try to breathe in to live, it gets worse”
sad day on first we feast
I adore Melissa.
not even  close ot the hottest sauce in the world
I was 14 and lived through the same Plainfield tornado. Crazy to hear her story. I loved this interview. Melissa is the best
i wanna see mark weins here 😁
Melissa wait till it comes out the other end lol
Her point about needing more light,, not only dark, in tv and movies, is a good one. I wish her show God's Favorite Idiot had continued. Main character was so genuine, and the message so positive.  An antidote to so much negativity, greed, and violence all around us these days.
Ill never understand how burning your entire mouth and throat enhances food.😐
I love her
gotta be the funniest hot ones i've seen
Yesssss.
Lord I ask yu today, to protect your people.. for god is coming soon; he loves you and amen 💕.
This was great and it was very hilarious
Mads mikkelsen should definitely be on here!
Nothing straightens up a throat like whole milk 😂😂😂😂
This is hands down my favorite episode of all time.
Pedowood filled with satanists, the truth will come out. Disgusting.
I want to avenge her after da bomb. 😂
Everything thing she does is magic.
I loved this one❣️
she sounds like trump towards the end lol
I just love all Melissa McCarthy movies ❤😊
I absolutely loved her playing ursela ❤️
Oh My Goodness 😲 I don't believe She did That 😮 I Love Watching all of Your Movie's and TV Show's 🥰🥰
I've had that Apollo one... I will tell you it takes your freaking breath away! I've never had something so hot and I've eaten reaper powder and everything. It bites back and keeps coming! Peanut butter is what helped me.
Please get Andrew tate on here
When's Hot Ones going to stop having Covid? 2 tables?
She’s such a gem! ❤ She did amazing for someone who doesn’t like/can’t handle spice! 👏🏻
What if she sues 😂😂😂
I've never heard so much giggling and laughter from the crew of Hot Ones than I did in this interview. Melissa McCarthy always kills! 😂
What’s ur legal situation 😂😂💀
I love her she is the best
We need Jefferey Dean Morgan back for a regular episode 😭😭🙏
“I get that people like spice… which I don’t get” 😂
I rarely laugh outload. Melissa is one of the few people that can do that. This my favorite episode and I have seen them all.
As someone who's from plainfield and currently lives, it was awesome to hear about the tornado story. Always heard my mom be freaked out about it because she was here for it so it hit home
Can't help but love Melissa❤
13:05 all I could think was Team America Durkah Durkah hahaha
i think we have a new world's best da bomb reaction!  :D
Best opening!  There we go, no actually I think you might be a natural. I can see it in your eyes. 😅
Hilarious idea to just leave but then Sean's questions would be unanswered and we would lose the joy of listening Melissa.
The spray bottle of milk has me rollinh
Melissa McCarthy - you are a Rockstar! You had me cringing and laughing! You’re such a delight! It’s so apparent why you’re so admired and loved!
Hey try warm or hot water
18:28 “What’s your legal situation?”, she asked him. Is she gonna sue him?? She consented to doing this! She could have opted out of this madness.
I can’t believe she actually put milk inside a spray bottle. 😂
Thank you
Love her, excellent actress 🥰🌷😎
What’s your legal situation? Bahahaha!! LOVED THIS EPISODE!
Melissa McCarthy, I LOVE YOU!  This was one of my absolute favorite Hot Ones videos!  YOU ARE A GODDESS!  I hope to see you for many, many, many more years/videos and, I don't know, maybe a run for president?  😇I'd vote for you in a heartbeat!  Thank you so much for making life better!  You rock!!
Come on guys sit them in the same table !!!
I had the 1st one. I was eating it by itself it's so good
Definitely one of the best episodes
Melissa is funny without trying to be funny. Her normal every day conversations and interactions are just so bubbly and anecdotal, and you can tell she doesn’t do it purposefully. I loved her when I was a kid watching Gilmore girls, I loved her during all her comedy movies, and now I love her as Ursula
She sooooooooo qute😍😍
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🙃🙃🙃
I love Melissa she’s funny and blunt ❤
If i could meet 1 celebrrity in my life, it would be her!
Shes so wholesome and adorable.  I love her!
She is the best!!!!! ❤
Hiw could you torture the comedy queen??? How dare you! 😢
I love her so much!!!❤❤❤
They need put chocolate on the table as well.
If I see Melissa and Jill Scott I'm going all out...TNP
Why can't we have villains anymore that are just evil for the sake of being evil. Why must they all be misunderstood with some glimmer of decency? I think it's far more satisfying for the hero to destroy a villain that deserves it
this could be a p*rn title 🤣 no disrespect to melissa tho
13:07 "Mohammed Jihad"
Love her ❤
So many possible thumbnails yet each time they use one before all the suffering…respect
I appreciate him walking her through the spice levels, like that's so kind ❤
You should bring on MatPat from Film/food/game theory
Eating
She is absolutely my favorite human!!!!
the sound bite at the end absolutely cracked me up
I fkin love her shess so funny
I lived through thatTornado. Hit neighborhoods of friends and family. A kid from my high school and his mom and sister were killed in it.  Bad day. Born and raised in Joliet.
A full Midwestern thing: Sean, Bob Odenkirk, and Melissa from Northern Illinois, Farley from Madison
Crazy hearing her story of the 1990 tornado. I remember that day, and damage, well. Didn’t know she was still in town then. Love that she was Chris Farley, I always thought of her as the female Chris Farley. Love her❤
What ever happened to the Jennifer Aniston episode??
Day 1 of asking for Nuardwuar to interview Sean & get interviewed
LOL, I LOVE YOU MELISSA!!!!!
Is it wrong to enjoy seeing others in such pain.  I was laughing.  But she is funny.
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love her allot.  Lovely human!!!
Two legends together, what an amazing treat. ❤❤ Love them both. ❤❤
Oohh, How Very Brave R-U- Melissa! I Am a happy Fan of you, & Your Natural Gift of Laughter! 😂! ❤-Everything Iv'e seen you in.  GBU.,SM.,NZ.,✌♥️😁☺️👍😎🙏
❤
I love her❤. Hysterical ,Talented and beautiful .
plsss invite timothee chalamet plssss
This was a very enjoyable episode!
when she tried to say esophagus 😂😭 i absolutely lost it “glataglopigus” 😭
I love her so much this made my day amazing, her comment on comedy bringing people together is so true! What a beautiful woman 💖💖💖💖
I just really love this lady.  She is so incredible.
What a great way to start my day! Melissa was hysterical! And I know the feeling of being scared of tornados being from Chicago originally. They scare me so much that I have gotten sick I was so terrified as a little kid. And the ice in the milk my ex used to do that and he is the only person who I had ever seen do that with their milk! Until Melissa now....she just cracks me up! What a great show!.
Ive been in Joliet and plainfield for some crazy lightning n tornadoes…. They are a force to behold for sure and how sudden is another crazy part of them….
The way she talks about Chris actually made me tear up a bit. She’s such a genuine person.
Melissa is still one of a kind. That woman makes you smile as soon as you see her, and then she opens her mouth, and you cant help but start laughing.
Sean^ respect.
I just love her!
Pineapple helps
Can somebody please tell  me WHY WHY WHY Lemons are not supplied?????
I absolutely love her and everything she does such a beautiful person inside and out❤❤
“As you try to breath in, to live, it hits.”  So funny
Melissa  love   and  hugs     xooxoxoxxooxoxoxooxox
I love her
One word. Ursula!!!!!
I love Sean's silver top. Where can we purchase it?
Could she be any more delightful?
She has to be a top ten funniest reactions.
How 2 run for the first woman 👩 president???!!!! Seriously funny 😆!!!!!!
I’ve loved her since Gilmore girls! Such a gem and so funny!
My god the background music is killing me.
I love her so muchhhhhh 🤍🤍🤍
The least funny person on the planet, great...
i love her, but wont watch the stolen mermaid
My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE guest I’ve seen here on Hot Ones. Awesome awesome awesome. 💯(:
Havent watched a hot ones episode in years but melissa mccarthy❤️❤️❤️ funniest person alive and such a good human being
Ahhh I love her!!!
Woke group lol
she is soo beautiful..please come to Denmark and marry me :)
"this one wants to be thinner, that one wants to be the girl, Do I help them? Yes indeed"
I respectfully do not see the excitement with her......
So Little Mermaid is black and Ursula is White….I love it
I love her!
“What’s your legal situation?” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Always the last is TBA, does that stand for To Be Announced? if so where and when
I love this woman lol.
I love her
i love comedies so much
At least this video was better than Melissa's newest movie
so my mother loves iowa so she moved back to where she was basically born. after i had turned 18... one year a tornado swept through and took our the whole house right across the street... and a couple on the street over..... i dont think anyone died somehow... its weird when i visit seeing a whole new house there.... floods are super bad there tooo i live an hour away in mn but  i live on top of a hill
i would like to switch black charters with white ones and see if thats ok like they did to white people just for context im native American
LOL this is the first time I hysterically laughed out loud watching someone eat DaBomb!
GOATED episode
Melissa is so nice and polite ❤
Please invite Jimin from BTS  next 🙏🏻he's an amazing person
I adore melissa❤😂
Best yet ❤
Plainfield, IL isn't a bastion of hot sauces, since my wife is from there and I love hot sauces. Decent bites knowing full well that hot isn't in her repertoire. As usual can't wait for Da Bomb and it didn't fail to deliver. Love the hot sauce high. Sean certainly appeared to enjoy himself while explaining how the hot sauces will attack her mouth. Nitrous high from the whipped cream.
She is adorable 😍😍😍😍 true to herself ❤❤❤
This has now become my favorite hot ones ever. I love Melissa. <3
Wow, she’s brave. One bite of that would put me in the hospital. I’m so allergic to spices.
The crazy thing is - there was barely a difference in her reaction from beginning to end!
Was there a camp crystal lake? 😅
she is funny without trying
love how you can hear everyone else in the room laugh
Melissa is so wonderful and SUCH an Amazing actress. She can spin cirles around anyone.  (She can do anything. So beautiful and multi talented) I love and Appreciate and Adore her so so much. I haven't seen the new little mermaid yet. I plan on it. Melissa I love you!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤   Ps. I. From northen IL too.
Melissa you are a legend- I luv all your movies that you have done & still more in your future & ours as well.  Stay strong Melissa your a beautiful lady.❤😂
She is from the Midwest. Poor thing. Who from the south ate wings him? We love Lissa!❤
Oh Melissa....your a boss.
One of my favorite actors.
I love Melissa! 😂❤
Anytime I see someone struggling in the first 3-4, I truly begin to pity them knowing that Da Bomb is in front of them.....
Suggestion, Get markiplier on the show. Or Jacksepticeye. would be amazing, to watch.
First episode to hold me til the end! Melissa McCarthy, major! The questions & answers, fulfilling and enticing! 10/10
I don't understand why anyone would choose to live in a Tornado zone 😕 I love you, Melissa❤
Couldnt agree with her more about comedy movies!!!! The world would be so sad if we didnt have good comedies!
This is what you get with one of the funniest humans and one of the greatest interviewers alive. I will watch this repeatedly. When she brought out the bread i wanted to die i was laughing so hard. This was EPIC for me
I love her so much lol
I tried da bomb sauce and everyone’s response to it is STILL better than mine. I was DESTROYED for about 45 mins
Love her, love her , love her. Thanks Chris for this great show.
Fantastic episode!  I was cracking up the whole time!
"As you try to breathe in to live." 😂😂
The complete opposite of DJ Khaled in every way.
I love her
"Comedies are important and they will bring people together." - Melissa McCarthy  So true! Love you Melissa!
Idk her fr but I think she's an awesome person!
Melissa McCarthy is so fun to follow as a comedienne and actor.  This video is another reason I adore her outlook on things that resonate on a HUMAN level.
L😂L!....."I hate you!" 🥵
You could really tell from the tears that the spice was really getting to Melissa but I am shocked at how she never stumbled on answering the questions.  Usually the heat is so overwhelming that the guest have a hard time answering the questions but she didn't at all.  Well done!
At the risk of sounding like Donald Downer; but doesn't eating extremely hot/spicy foods cause ulcers?🥴 (Wonk! Wonk!!!)
Is it just me or are her eyes always that clear and bright?
I want Gaga on here so baddddddd
Melissa McCarthy made this my favorite episode! <3
Best episode in ages!!! Loooove it 🎉
Forget fiber, hot stuff will keep you regular!
Whose idea was it for Sean to wear black socks with white shoes?
This is the best hot wings I have seen ever kudos to Melissa McCarthy. Absolutely love her. Absolutely love the show.❤
Melissa, she is my cousin… this is hilarious to watch! We have met a long time ago at a family wedding in Burbank, Illinois… we do stay in touch once a year…she is always working but makes the time to call her favorite aunt…my mom… and she always sends a nice note for my birthday.
Melissa is a genius. She is so effortlessly funny. Literally every time she opened her mouth I was laughing
Melissa McCarthy is just as important to me and my childhood as Jim Carey
I've always loved Melissa McCarthy. Especially in gilmore girls. This made me love her even more. She was a champ. This was my favorite episode. Also, when she said the whipping cream still had gas in it, I imagined her saying "sure! Let's ignite real flames in my mouth!! Bring on the gas!!"😂
Comedy comes so smooth from her. She is the whole package. Beautiful and funny!
She was giving FULL “take off my wig” 😂😂😂😂
I adore Melissa. I would love to have the chance to hang out with her. I would be laughing so hard. Laughter is the best medicine. That is so true. 😂❤
Keep fighting for comedies Melissa, I agree with you !!
This better than bridesmaids🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hearing the crew in the background cracking up is awesome
I love her work 😂
Hello love her talented and her love for laughter in Life love in Mike and Molly show.and others movie.May god keep all under the blood of Jesus Christ.❤😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🌻😍
DJ Khaled has the record.....I believe...if I'm right....he left on the 3rd wing....supposedly tough big man....and he instantly gave up on wing number 3 😂😂😂😂😂
The chibata bread 😂
Love her, always have but adding "I think it's a world of trouble" if movie industry focuses too much on producing dark films with dark endings - I wholly agree! People need comedy!!!
Has anyone ever made a 24hr later video after the wings have run their course? Fully expect it to be a comedian.
She had full panic eyes! So very brave to me❤
Ursula that can't sing, Ariel that can't act and shuttle raps... instant classic
Me a. My family r from Bushnell and Macomb Illinois! I now live in ohio
Melissa is by far my favorite 😅 I'm  now curious how Amy Poehler would do?🤔
The best interview yet
I love Melissa! She is funny while being miserable!
She’s so naturally amazing!!❤❤
No questions about Suki 🥺
Melissa is a delight and you r such a good interviewer.  Thank you.💕
Great .. Melissa was great.
I loved Melissa in her Oscar nominated role, Can You Ever Forgive Me. She was great and now I really see her in a different light. She should do more dramas
❤❤❤❤❤
I absolutely ADORE Melissa.. she is the best. ❤😊
"PLEASE DON'T BE THE MAYOR FROM JAW'S"
😂im laughing already, we all make bad choices sometimes even though we may not admit it ❣️stick it out lovely
Mellisa McCarthy is a champ, I would have given up after da bomb lol
This  Sean guy, does his wings spicy? Because he does all these interviews and eat all the wings and never get hot ??????
One of my favorites of all time. Melissa is a gem and I love her so much ❤❤❤❤
And you try to breath in to live it gets worse
I love melissa McCarthy 😂she's so funny and one of my favorite actresses ❤❤
I can't believe they got Sean Spicer to be on Hot Ones
Making my ulcer hurt just watching this.
Sooooo funny.....best episode ever!
hey i lived in Carbondale for a bit. very cool you know the area too.😉
It's so great seeing someone so kind and talented outright say they don't like spice and then completely smash this. Lookin at you, Gervais. 👀
Why doesnt anyone ever ask her about her early career on a famous daytime soap opera?
Melissa McCarthy is a G
The absolute GREATEST one of all time !!
Massive respect to Melissa! Taking big bites despite the pain, and still managing to be hilarious and charming. She is one of my favorite actors. Loved her as Ursula❤ Great interview, Sean!
God his questions are amazing
Thats crazy she from plainfield and ges from crystal lake😱 you know how close to ke that is?! Holy molly im from streamwood
She is just naturally hilarious. Her energy is incredible!
Yes!!!!! Melissa!!!
I never expected to hear an interview question that started with "After walking a mile in her tentacles..." 😂
Melissa McCarthy is so kind, real, and fun. I had no reason to doubt this fact, but I'd never seen her interviewed before... and she is a delightful human!
I was crying laughing the entire time. Love her!! She is my fav
She's so great.  I just love Melissa!
Do one with the rock
I’m convinced Sean could guide you through a bad trip even if it’s your first time meeting him
Melissa McCarthy is a legend! Like so many of the comedy greats (Robin Williams comes to mind, and man if he were here and guested on Hot Ones!) she is just a quintessentially hilarious person. Like Robin, directors just give her the floor and let her do her thing, and it’s more than likely going to be better and funnier than what they had in mind in the screenplay. I love when guests get asked a deep-cut right after ingesting Da Bomb and they always give him that incredulous look, like, “Are you seriously expecting me to think, let alone answer you?!” Such a great concept for an interview show, both the hot wings, friendly, laid-back atmosphere and the dedicated research the team puts in for each guest, setting it apart from late night and most other interview shows. Bravo, to the show and to Melissa!
From Crystal Lake and lived in Romeoville, pretty much across the street from Plainfield. Plainfield is no joke with storms in the spring. Crystal Lake used to get horrible also.
DANNY. BROWN.
She is such an amazing lady!!❤
DA’BOMB;Beyond Insanity!Was really frocking 😁 when she brought out the loaf 🍞 😝 😅🗣️🦍💯🔥
Anytime and every time I hear the name Crystal Lake I think of Camp Crystal Lake and Jason Voorhees!
12:16 “if you try to breathe in… to live”😭😭😭😭😭
this was a good one 😂😂😂
Shes so beautiful
Cherry icee
Great video 😊
Did anyone offer her maybe a healthier option?
Her bomb reaction was the best one ever! I had to immediately rewatch it!  So hilarious
Why did he bring up the little mermaid so many times?
How do you not love this woman ❤
I love her so much
Joliet Illinois! represent🤣
Love Melissa!!!❤️❤️❤️
I love Melissa McCarthy, my favorite actress!
I'm gonna be saying "HIT THE COW" as often as I can.  First accidental whippet in Hot Ones, btw.
I have never laughed so hard while watching this show 😂😂😂
who is she?
MIKE ROWE ON HOT ONES?
She is sooo cute. ❤❤❤😂
I so love Melissa! She’s such a trooper especially when she said that she doesn’t do spicy food! Watching her video of putting on Ursula’s make up, in one area she channeled the late great Vivian Vance!
“I’m right here with ya” - says the guy who has no taste buds left after repeatedly burning them off.
She is wonderful.
That water look so good 😭😂
I love her 😂❤😂❤
20:14 hey there have been people in the Hall of Shame.  This is like the mama bear lifting a car to protect her cubs
17:49 sorry but this about took me out just had no prep for her nervously nibbling on that random bread  Sweet she gave some to Sean tho :)
17:03 This is the first time I’ve watched and been genuinely concerned if the guest is gonna be okay
12:23 reminds me a lot of my brother’s reaction to trying the last Dab.  The way her face twitched and she almost looks like “Sean help me”   We love you mama Mac
You do get the beast guests and you do abuse them horribly.  what I have found, as a photographer, is that the more intelligent and talented an celebratey is, the more willing they are to work and take on a difficult job
Hollywood is very sinister but u get a couple actors like her that leave some hope
Ay Diablo IV on Hot Ones! Melissa was a fantastic guest, love how down to earth she is and her reaction to da bomb was... da bomb😂
i love the way sean does interviews. he clearly does his research on the guest, and he doesnt ask the same old generic questions every other interviewer does. he goes above and beyond and i couldnt picture hot ones with any other host
oh you poor unfortunate soul hahahahaha
This was a fun video. Melissa has done very well for herself because she has worked so hard at her craft. She has an excellent management team that has directed her to movies that have gotten her to other movies. I don't think we've seen her best performance yet and that's pretty exciting. But getting a momentum in your career is very hard to do and Melissa has excelled at that. She did great here and actually took some big bites and suffered accordingly but she was very funny and honest too. And that's the thing about Melissa. Either you like her as she is, or you don't. She straight up don't give a blank to change for anyone. That's why I respect her.
12:06 the look of betrayal on Melissa's face almost took me out.
6:26 dang that was the perfect question to get an amazing story
Hands down the best Da' Bomb reaction, ever!!😅
My favorite current comedic actress.
She took me out with the spray bottle full of milk💀💀💀😭😭😭
she has beautiful eyes, i love her
I love Melissa McCarthy. Such a beautiful woman inside and out. Very funny.
this is the coolest lineup of sauces they've ever had
She is such a awesome actor. Her personality is awesome. She did a good job.
refuse to watch the woke mermaid when they keep making movies with the protagonist black and the villains white. Im not buyin what theyer sellin
I'm of Norwegian/English descent. I LOVE pepper sauces and flavors, but they LIGHT ME UP like a Christmas tree!!!!! Melissa, you are a TROOPER!!!
First viewing experience with Melissa McCarthy was with her character Sookie St. James on Gilmore Girls. She’s absolutely amazing
JENSEN ACKLES AND JARED PADELECKI WANTS TO DO HOT ONES. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16:05 "This is the hottest sauce in the world. It is crazy." 😂
I just love you Melissa!! And I must say I have not laughed so hard to these episodes as I did with this one!! Love this show!!!!!!!!!
I can die happy now. Been waiting for Melissa to appear on here from the start! As for Ursula she’s my favorite over Ariel any day! I’ve always been drawn to the villains😈
I don't know if you guys have ever heard of Spontaneous Combustion, but it is a GREAT hot sauce... about the same heat as Insanity, but it actually tastes good.
WELL DONE McCARTHY!!  You survived!!  Don’t EVER do that again…
We need The Rock next!!!😂
Why this heffer all up in everything  Sick of it
She's a breath of fresh air 😊
This is my favorite episode yet! Not only do I just LOVE Melissa but as someone who doesn’t really do spicy stuff, this is the most real and relatable episode to me! 😂😂
We need Tobias Forge from the band Ghost on here ASAP
I was in a tornado in Tuscaloosa, AL in 2011. I lived in a three floor apartment on the third floor. We ran across the parking lot to a friends first floor apartment. When we walked out after the tornado hit my whole apartment building was gone. Just pipes in the ground. My car was found 4:2 miles from where I parked it. Never been the same 😂
Soooo, was trying to watch this late last night and I kid you not tornado weather came through and now I have no power and my neighborhood is full of trees that fell on cars/houses. Watching it now and when they got to the tornado part I felt weird.
I so agree with her about losing comedies. Also, romance movies and coming of age movies are almost gone as well. Everything is just death and gloom and the end of the world in movies now and it is a terrible thing.
I have never seen a man in tighter pants 😂🤟🤟
I saw Melissa was the guest and never clicked on a link faster. She's just amazing and this did not disappoint. The arsenal of items she brought with her to help her through. The constant jokes she is still able to pull out when she's struggling to even breathe. She's such a gem. We need a million more Melissas in this world! ❤
Disclaimer first but...Apple-cider vinager shooter! It's like tooo much chlorine in the pool so you counter it w/ACV. You have to "already" understand how it effects breathing and practice first. It operates like anti-mosquito spray (itch). Had to use several times and works great. Note: If you get "olio-capsasum cream" prescribed, immediately get ACV!!! Have it ready by the tub/shower. Milk don't work! (tried), then... "liberal" splash-wash w ACV...1min...NO issues :) It should be at all Mil/LEO trng sites! etc...
I’ve never cracked up so much to someone eat Da Bomb 🤣 that was awesome
I've lost all respect for sellout fans,you're too skinny 😔, you're too big 😢kiss it!😊
This woman is so cute and so hilarious.
Melissa you are a beautiful hilarious soul. Thank you for everything. . .
SHE is the moment!
Too funny, love her!
What is it about Illinoisans having the best humor/banter
Get Chelcie Lynn (AKA Trailer Trash Tammy) on here!
Absolutely Amazing . Having eaten Da Bomb i know your pain. never laughed so much or cried so much watching your show . Well done and thank you . makes me want to get f'd up on chilli sauces. Tim a Chef from UK.
Honesty hurts too. Lol
I have loved Melissa since her days on Gilmore Girls and she’s the deciding factor on why I’m going to see the Little Mermaid. Lol
Dawn soapy water works best
I had the respect for you from all you shows and movies… now I’m convinced you’re gangster.
I agree with Melissa, how can people enjoy spicy food?!?!
LOVE LOVE LOVE 😀🤣❤🙏🇨🇦🇺🇸🌍🖖
I absolutely love Melissa McCarthy.  Such a beautiful person❤
Need to write this.... at 13:30ish, Melissa made the comment about comedies bringing people together - I would actually like to quote that on my dissertation, along with the previous comment about dark and depressing movies..... I don't know if Hot Wings and First We Feast has ever been in a dissertation but you will be now ;)
Cool to know yal from Illinois watching this from Yorkville IL
No questions about Gilmore Girls? Sookie was my favorite, makes me Kinda sad…
Best Hot Ones ever
this is a  p e r f e c t  Hot Ones episode 👏😂
What's your legal situation? 😅🤣
Lol the almost eye gouging with spicy fingers!! 😂😂
I love her so much 😂😂😂😂
We all know Sean Evans no longer feels the da bomb as he should.
One of the best Da Bomb reactions!
Now my favorite Hot Ones!!!
I love this episode!!! Poor Melissa... this is so brave of her. Without any hot food experience!
I am a huge fan of Melissa's work! Sending lots of love from Jamaica 🥰🍀
You should get Tim Kennedy on this show!
God she is hilarious xD
this is prob the first interview in here that both of them seemed really calm lol
She is so charming. I love her.
How many bots there must be in these comments. Did ya'll forget how poisonous this woman is professionally?
I just love Melissa so much! She is so funny. I wonder how close her and her cousin, Jenny, are? They're both so cool and down to earth.
I love Melissa, she is adorable, brillant , thoughtful etc. She's on the very short list of people I wouldn't mind actually meeting😘
I love this so much. You guys always ask the best questions!
This was hilarious 😂😂😂
Pleeeaase get Cam'ron & Mase on the show!! Lol
Left a comment on another Hot One’s video about this and can’t remember which one it was but I stand firm on the SHU of Da Bomb making no sense what so ever. I’ve eaten hot sauce my whole life and that is easily top 3 so how it has that rating is beyond me.
I absolutely love her! Genuinely lovely and super funny human being❤
She is the best,  how could you not love her. 👍🍀
Love this woman ❤😊
Oh my GOD BWAJAHAHAHSBDUSJSKS 🤣🤣🤣 When she said next week she would be sitting in his chair in his polo with his job i bust our laughing. So good!
The way I almost die laughing 😂 😂
"If you try to breathe in.. to live.. It gets worse" 😮😂😂😂
This was so awesome to watch. I so love Melissa McCarthy , and she was great doing this.
Cameras off  Melissa: I NEED THE TOILET! I NEED THE TOILET! I NEED THE TOILET!
i've never heard sean genuinely giggle before, this was so sweet and wholesome i love her 😍
Why is Da Bomb not in the sets??
The funniest episode I have seen on Hot Ones
Almost makes up for the female ghostbusters
Y’all should do lance 210
She’s so funny 😂😂😭😭😭
I freaking love Melissa and this interview highlights why 💕😂
She is just so funny! I was crying because i laughed so hard!
My FAV. comedian ❤😂. Melissa Mcarthy
This is the funniest one I've watched 😂😂😂 she is hilarious
I love Melissa SO MUCH. She’s so funny and Sean makes this a great interview 🤣🤣
One of the only females that are actually funny to me
Dab that ish. DAB IT!!!
This is the most HILARIOUS reaction to DaBomb I'm IN TEARS!!!!
That tornado story is giving me flashbacks.  I was five, and we lived near Plainfield.  We were at a bowling alley during that tornado, and the doors which opened only out, were swinging in.  I'll never forget how terrifying that was.
She is so beautiful.  I enjoyed thus, her reactions were adorable.  And she made me laugh
I love Melissa McCartney she is so down to earth and super hilarious. I can say I have seen 100% everything she has done. Plus her smile just lights up a room and I hope one day I can have a smile to do the same. Good for you to take on that challenge I mean I eat the spicy ramen but I do like half the of the spicy sauce and I have my potato chips along with me that helps or macaroni salad works too.
🤣🤣
Only McCarthy can make me laugh with joy and cry relatable tears of fml at the same time
first episode I laughed out loud! Melissa is a TROOPER! and I can bet she wanted to hit him with that bread :))
Great episode, my favorite at the end. “It’s like when you break your leg. Everyone gets to sign my cast!”
It's the best episode yet! Melissa is the funniest and, of course,  Shawn was amazing as always. ❤
Can you interview Narduwar?
Great episode
Love Melissa!!
Great job Melissa and Chris! When those get so hot where it is that uncomfortable to eat, I'm not sure why someone would want to put themselves through that. Maybe the more severe heat enhances the health benefits 😄
When her eye twitched in the little mermaid my sistar and I literally screamed in the movie theater of laughter 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She did a whip it 😂
Joliet IL!!!
You did great Melissa
I love her so much😂😂😂
I love ❤ her she is beautiful amazing and so funny 🎉love from Australia
I was looking for a loved it button so ❤❤❤. My favorite one yet! Loved her in the Little Mermaid and this episode of Hot Ones! 😍
You should interview Alex Turner
Enjoyed her as Ursula. Haters gonna hate.
Letthat have been anybody else dipping chicken fingers in their water and then drink it back That's how I know I have true love for her cause it really didn't even faze me but I did notice it lol
When She ate the Bomb, I can't stop laughing. 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣 dang, I admire Melissa.. I love spicy food but with allergies i relieve my  nose get hit the best/worst way… 😂😂😂 🥵🥵
How is it that the hottest sauce in the world isn't the final one on the table?
She didn’t even answer the question about home shows! 😂
In a way, consuming all that spice and water is cleaning for the body. 😂
“Why don’t I feel anything?”  😂❤
Get Halle or Cholë on here ❤
It's funny lol. He's never AS affected by the wings as the guest is Lol. It's like he's immune to 'em at this point
She is the funniest person you had on this show
We need Lewis Hamilton or max verstappen on this show
legenda em Português Brasil,por favooooor!
I love her, she fricking hilarious!  I feel like she wanted to hit him, lol
The bread works if you take a big piece & let it soak the heat up, then spit it out and get another piece if be needed.  You don't eat it, you just let it soak up the heat.
I don't need movies to make me cry. I do that myself. I don't need movies to make me anxious. The world does that for me. I need movies that make me laugh and give me hope. Well said Melissa. I've loved you since Gilmore girls. Thank you for being yourself
I love Melissa McCarthy.
You need to make a video for First We Feast with Mr Beast and a priest and they eat yeast.
😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
20:16 had me CACKLING 🤣
I love Melissa McCarthy so much!!!!! Hilarious
I need to be on this show.
I love her!!! By far one of my fav actresses these days, she’s so funny. Glad to see her burning her mouth off 😂
I Love Melissa McCarthy!!!  I think she is so honest and such an indescribable person.  She is just really a wonderful person and actress.
She's absolutely DYING, snot coming out of her nose and all, and Sean's just like "I know, I'm right there with ya. Hey! What gets you fired up about home renovation TV shows?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
I’d bring bread and ice cubes
Love love love love love her
Such a joy to watch! Absolutely adore her❤
I absolutely love Melissa, she's so cute and funny and warm 🥵 really warm now LoL. She's so brave to do that. I would have said sorry and left 😂.... Melissa did a phenomenal job on that hot wing challenge..❤
I LOVE Melissa so much!!🥹🥹🥹😍😍🥰🥰🥰😂😂😂🤗🤗🤗🤗
She is the best 😂
What's your legal situation? 😂
You know it's gonna be good when they call the first one hot
She is an absolute delight.
She's to funny 😂😂 feel bad for her but she did great!!
Such a cornucopia of delight.
She did absolutely great for someone that can't handle spicy food.
I’ve never cried so much from laughing. I LOVE these two!!!
Mother Mollins ❤❤❤❤❤❤
To think she would have died if her friend hadn’t acted so quickly to the shift in weather!
I love her
She was a delight … when da bomb came up I was like “no don’t do it Melissa” I didn’t want to see her hurting more she seems too nice.. but great episode
I wish Blackpink would do this 😢
Da Bomb brought Ursula back out!
Love her
This episode is creeping into my top 10 favorites.
One of the best reactions to dabomb 😂
Thank you both for this Sunday morning giggles...😂😂😂
@firstwefeast An extra bottle of Apollo for every wing.
I don’t think I’ve ever been prouder of someone I don’t know before. Firstly, this may be the funniest episode ever where Melissa and Sean had amazing chemistry but she took some pretty decent bites on every wing. And she hated them from the very first wing. She seems like such a wonderful, warm human who throws herself into things with her all.
Love Melissa McCarthy!
No. Just no. 🙄
I laughed so hard! This woman is hilarious and I knew she was going to act a fool when tried Da bomb. One of the funniest ones.
Love Melissa! She's literally channeling me eating anything remotely spicy! And amazing job she did with Ursula! :)
This woman is garbage. NEXT!
"What's your legal situation like?" will ever be hilarious
I have so much to say! But she is amazing! I was laugh crying! She is amazing, and I’m totally gonna try wings and whipped cream! And bread! With a Jay! I love her so much!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️you’re amazing Sweetie!
OH MELISSA, LOOOOOOOVE LOOOOOOOOOVE LOOOOOOOOOVE YOU, AND YOURE SOOOOOOOO BRAVE TO PUT YOURSELF THROUGH SUCH TORTURE 😊😊😊😊😊
Honey milk bread together has always been my go to and has always worked
I've loved her since Gilmore Girls and the love just keeps growing. She's a true gem 💎
I love how sweet Melissa personally attacks Sean! 😅
Hilarious 💀 💀 💀 top 3 episode of all time. Put this one in the hall of fame. Thank you 🙏
Man I love Melissa McCarthy.
Love Melissa!!! She is the Best.
BEST EPIDOE EVER!
After all the episodes in this show , this is the crown jewel . Congratulations.
Molly from Mike and Molly getin spicy! 👍🙏🇺🇸
Melissa's dying! Someone save her! 😅
She's an ICON!!!!
She was more of a diva than I expected.  Didn't her kids or someone tell her about this show??!!
get Fran Drescher and some wasabiiiiii
Yo! Melissa McCarthy was a "G" in the Little Mermaid live action REMAKE that film is ACTUALLY now 30. My absolute FAVORITE M.M. film of ALL-TIME (for me) is "Identity Thief" (with Melissa McCarthy as the SOMEWHAT antagonistic co-star) (Spoiler Identity Thief was ACTUALLY better than the Little Mermaid remake). Walt Disney & its OWN studio of behind-the-scenes CREW members really DESTROYED that film! For me, watching The Little Mermaid (2023 was somehow VERY similar to the film; ANTZ, ANTZ was ACTUALLY way MORE humorous (Sorry, Melissa) than the Little Mermaid. You were INCREDIBLE in Thunder Force.
Brittany Howard would've made a great Ursula
Just wow❤lil mermaid 2023
Daaaannggggg.....massive props to Melissa for seeing it through. She is ridiculously funny...its unreal.
I would guess that I jave watched 84-88% of these episodes, and this one is definitely in the top 3. Thank you MM.
Melissa has a great comic timing even in irl. That's what I love about her the most. The second saw her in the thumbnail, I had to click. Love her!
Poor Melissa. She is a true warrior
She such an amzing actress and she definitely seems like a down to earth person. Shes 100 right when she says comedies are important
Love from Plainfield IL ❤❤❤ so crazy to have such a successful and funny actress from my town
It’s almost 5am and I’ve been dying at this episode the whole time. 😂😭 I love her!!
dream girl. I dont care if you dont agree, shes so cute.
I would love to hang out with Melissa! She's so genuine and so hilarious!
The episode that I’ve laughed the most!!!
This is how all celebrities should be interview.
I wanted to help her so bad 😂😂😂 I know her bag is full of stuff!!!
I love Melissa McCarthy.  My first thought at the beginning was her kids suggested this.
Why is she so dang cute!
Sookie ❤️
"I get people like spice, which I don't get". 😆 😆 20:04
She's one of my fav gal comedians ❤❤❤
i absolutely adore her. her energy bounces off of sean’s seamlessly!
Meh. I knew she would be mid but I didn't expect her to be about as entertaining as the 2016 Ghostbusters movie.
"Yeah, I'm real unsteady..." LIFE MOOD.
So funny. That would be me. I wonder what happened when she went home
I am so mad at myself, because when I heard "Spicey shark" I immediately followed with "Spicey Shark doo doo doo doo doo doo doo...."
I want to help her lmbo
Why is this set to a Marvel score
Really well done and very enjoyable. Thanks!
"This would be one of my worst choices in life and I make kind of bad choices..."  Never related to anything more. When people ask me, "Who hurt you?" my response is, "It's me. I'm the problem. It's me."
She handled it so well for someone who doesn’t like spice and can’t handle it what a woman
Sugar
Loved her Gram story about her track suit and tennies!
“Comedies are important”
What's your legal situation 😂
When she pulled out the bread stick 😂
😸
Sugar cubes and cheese cubes
Lol I love her
After doing the 2023 Paqui One Chip Challenge, and having eaten a variety of hot sauces (my friend picked up some of the featured Hot One's recommendations) I found clamato juice has worked for easing the heat for me.
Most hilarious episodes hall of fame inductee...by we, the people.
One of the most interesting things on Hot Ones is the friends of the guest in the background. Melissa has a great group.
How much do the celebs get paid to do this show?
I’m not impressed with Disney live action and didnt care to watch it…until i just found out she’s Ursula. You are awesome!
We watch her movies because they hit me in the heart.....I smile... I laugh...I cry... she will.always be a favorite ❤
nice
Comedies are a pillar in human society....end quote
Instant classic. Melissa is a amazing and so naturally so sharp and funny.
to bad they tried to remake but instead ruined the little mermaid, couldnt just make a new movie could they .  everyone hates it so just give it up. it was a joke to all the people it was supposed to be for,
I want JLaw to do this while promoting NO HARD FEELINGS!!!!
love her, but umm hearing she was involved with the new joke of a mermaid just truly saddens my soul.  sell-out
Why does it appear to Ben that all of the guests are lefties? Do conservatives not eat hot wings??
Melissa as Ursela was incredible.
Melissa!! What a delight! 🎉😂😂
This is gotta be the best one yet
I don’t think I’ve laughed this much in awhile!!!!😂
melissa mccarthy is charming
Bring mat pat on the show!! Dudes been wanting it for years and deserves it lol
God bless her.  She is the first person I had moments of legitimate concern for.  I'd be RIGHT with her.  I'm terrible with spice!
4:41 i literally thought they had an overlay on her chicken wing 😂😂 it looks like a screaming man on the end 😂
She is such a gift.  I love her thoughts on the importance of laughter.  Good on her for braving the heat!
Bro😂😂😂😂
Melissa=Joy
Melissa love you & your work! You have kept us laughing through some real challenges! Thank you! Laughter; your craft is so important, needed & chersihed by many! blessings to you & yours! xoxo
I loved her in the Little Mermaid.   I watch anything she is in
Two of the most amazing people in the world. Watching this made my brain happy
One of the best episodes I've seen in a while.
I love 💕 Melissa so much through and through!!! What a trooper♥️She has a  warming ,loving presence!! I agree we NEED to keep comedy, especially right now in life!!
as you try to breath in to live 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I laughed SO MUCH when she bit into Da Bomb hahahhahahahahahaha I love her. ❤
I would love to see Sean Patirick Flanery and Norman Reedus, take a deep dive, If they dare.😅
She's amazing ❤
Currently watching this while hunkered down in my Kansas basement as the tornado sirens are going off 👀 Glad the two of you are ok from living in tornado alley
MAH.....MEH...MELISSA!!!!!! YES
LOVE YOU, MELISSA! We have a farm in Stonefort, Illinois.
I would bring orange juice or v8 but NO WATER!
I have her two cooking classes at my former work at Flora Farms and she does not eat spicy at all, so I had the chance to make her very spiced first! 🎉 she is the nicest person.
I love her so much
thats my wife
Sean Evans I'm from Crystal Lake, il as well. I went to Crystal Lake Central. Did you go there? If so what year did you graduate?
Favorite moments 24:02 "Here is my milk." 25:09 That's some Tolstoy logic right there
I love her so much ❤
Get Druski on here!!!
I LOVE HER
ONE OF MY FAVORITES
Her eyes are beautiful
Good god - I love her! :) :)
Shoutout Carbondale. Go Dawgs!
No gilmore girls questions ! :(((( Otherwise such  a great interview , great job as always.
😂🤣🤣🤣💖🎵🎶✌✌🤙
Spicy? 😂
Warm tea is your BFF! The tea dissolves the oils in the peppers.... trust
I absolutely love Melissa. Shes one of the funniest women ever
She's so delightful even throughout barely surviving the gauntlet.  This is the polar opposite of how DJ Khaled handled the interview.
I have new respect for Melissa.   I couldn’t do that so she’s braver than me!
Oh I love Melissa Mccarthy ❤ she seems so genuine and is favorite aunty material 😅
Oh God  I'm in tears 😂😂😂😂
Please have American idol 2023 finalist Colin Stough on here I bet he would do amazing ❤
Mike & Molly goat
Oh my goodness...I love her 😂😂😂
Great episode, but a little disappointed there wasn't a Gilmore Girls question. I mean as a throwback to chef sooki st James on a hot wings show would have been great
Melissa McCarthy is so lovely, i enjoyed this interview thoroughly.  Is Sean sponsored by Pepcid or something?  He has to be.
Not one mention of gilmore girls
Carrots. They cool the mouth well.
you gotta interview Peso Pluma!!!
Shouldn't May promos come out in March or April, rather than June?
She is THE Queen
can you get a compilation of all the gust who ask about the "legal situation" lol
I can't believe you did that to Melissa. She did not deserve Da Bomb.
Melissa McCarthy was this new iteration of Little mermaid trust me that would be the only reason I go to watch the movie. Nobody's happy with the race swapping of Little mermaid it's quite simple you can see the box office numbers
Melissa is one of my top fave celebrities! I love her! Thank you for having her on the show.
What a trooper! Melissa was clearly struggling, but quitting wasn't even an option! Speaking of which, it's been a long time since anyone quit.
I will not watch Little mermaid because you know why oh I guess I got to say it because a f****** social justice Jesus Christ...😮😮 but I will watch Melissa McCarthy because she's hilarious
You go to Central South or Preppy ridge ??!?!?!?!! Crystal Lake BABY LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Melissa McCarthy is one of my favorite actresses and man you could just see her being who she is that's who she is she is her character and that makes me so happy and makes me smile and I don't think I've seen the movie she's been in that doesn't make me smile😂😂😂😂😂
She’s one of my favorites! Whenever she is in a movie I’m watching it lol
Poor honey!!😊😊😊
I would have to bring Gordon Ramsey with me for moral support if I were ever invited to the show… ❤… invite me to the show 😊
It was the cough for me at 12:06 for me 😂😂😂 she had to rethink life
I love how they change up the sauces, but Da Bomb is consistent.😂. She was still more composed than Gordon Ramsay. 🤣
I’ve come up with an idea.. the red hot sauce in the buldak noodles packet, infused with a wing! Please do it 😮🎉
Eeeeeek 🎉❤😊
really felt bad when she ate the Bomb....she didn't deserve this
I love you Melissa! ❤
Legitimately funny women.
Ugh
I love that she brought her DYI hacks to help the hotness.
Hahahhahaha the way she flipped him off😂
Big fan of Melissa 💞🔥
I can see her pooping in the sink on Bridesmaids
I adore her. Hearing her talk about Chris Farley and doing her part to give his legacy justice on SNL made me swoon. She's legit ya'll.
I think people have too much of an idea about what Melissa is. And they don't actually take the time to look at her and see that she's actually a very pretty woman.
I think this is the best episode of hot ones I’ve ever seen 🤣 that is how I would be!!
I have to have comedy .I feel like they even are taking the best sitcoms off tv !
Oh my gosh !! The best hot ones ever !! Melissa is a soldier !!  I love her !! Yayy !!🎉❤
I just love her❣️🥰 She's Soo funny 😂🤣
Melissa Mccarthy is my all time favorite female actress.  ❤ from pnw oregon
So when does Luke come in and offer r2d2 and c3po as gifts?
Well done Melissa!!! 🎉
Hilarious! Great episode.
The best one yet!❤
"I've never blown my nose on camera." And yet, you've displayed the heat of your "undercarriage" in a movie. lol
My most favorite episode ever!
Best one yet! I laughed so much ❤ Good job Melissa!!
THE BREAD IM DYINGGG
i love this woman. she is a gift
I got a good business plan. Barb Kilner, Wing Eater.
Please get Sandra Bullock on 😅
She is the best💜
So we ever gonna have DJ Khaled do a redemption arc? Bet if you tell him all these other stars who cried on the first wing still did better than him he'd try again. LOL
Would you guys ever consider having Andy Samberg on the show
Are you serious? Still distancing?! laugh out loud
If anyone gonna act like Chris Farley it’s gonna be her and I’m not a huge fan of a lot of female comedians but she is the female Farley
Little Mermaid was fantastic!
I Am Melissa Mcarthy!!!
I love Melissa but F THIS "challenge" 😂
I love her flipping Sean the bird. She is so amazing, loved her in The Heat.
I know Melissa. Those Midwest tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, are amazing and terrifying.
I love her so much! ♥️
No “Mike and Molly” questions I was looking forward to those lol
McCarthy is a legend. funnest one in a while....
That was hilarious!! Melissa is such a trooper.
Sean is such a BS'er. He tells them I'm right there with them. But you don't see him LOL and a big smile he hides!!!
Love Melissa and everything she does. We need a new SPY movie. BTW-a spoon of sugar cuts the heat of chili, how come no one uses it.
Hot Ones needs to be memorialized in a big screen hit movie. Just a thought. It could integrate well into many scripts and should still be shot improv.
LOVE THIS EPISODE!!
Holy moly. Melissa is getting crushed by the heat and being so up about it 😂
Not Melissa hittin' the nos. 😅
Bring back Mike & Molly ❤
Wow. I was actually laughing out loud several times throughout this. Melissa is truly timeless
I love this lady so much. I secretly wish her hubby was on with her because the two of them are magic to watch together. Sooo gooood. Great interview. Thank you!! ❤ side note: my antidote = Curried Goat Roti and cold Solo soda. ❤
Absolutely excellent.
😅
I felt so bad for her. What a legend. ❤
Water Makes It  Worse.
Hitt the Cow 😂😂🥛
Why would someone with no tolerance for spicy food even consider to be on this show? Even seasoned chili heads would have a hard time running these gauntlets of fire.
Melissa:  "I hate you so much!" Sean:  "I get it-I get it."  Hope you're feeling better soon, Melissa. The laughter will outlast your pain.  Maybe.
I was just in Crystal lake Illinois last week!!
❤
Has anyone ever asked Sean if his heat gets better or worse depending on how the guest is reacting?  Like if they are dying he might feel he needs to hang on better to keep the wheels on.  I mean he’s always a professional but just curious.
Love Melissa and how naturally funny she is. Her and her husband are the best couple ever and so talented. I really appreciate the humor she brings in her movies. If I had to pick a celebrity to meet, it would be her. She is so versatile in her acting abilities and the characters remind me of some people I have met in my life.   Working in the human service fields with addiction and homelessness as a therapist student is really eye opening and to have the ability to laugh after a hard week is a gift. It keeps me going and recharges my battery.   I can't do hot anymore so hats off to both of you and you survived.
How about featuring Chris Pratt, Gina Carano, Tim Allen, Roseanne Barr, or Kevin Sorbo? All you seem to care about is promoting America-hating Marxists and defenders of the LGBTQ+ MinorAttractedPederast community.
Every time I hear the intro I just think how they missed the opportunity to say “it’s the show with hot questions and even hotter guests”
Melissa is a classicly hilarious human and had me in stitches watching this ❤
I haven’t laughed this much on this show! LOL
The best one yet😂 Melissa McCarthy is one of my favourite people ever. She is so humble, funny, genuine, sweet and kind person ❤
Is it just me or is every Hot Ones Music, Audio Que just always on point. Awesome Job!   THE PLACEMENT OF THE DIABLO IV AD WAS GREAT!!!
She is such a queen.
Gotta love that woman, she's amazing
Love her
I couldn't wait to see melissa try the Dabomb  hot sauce. I wanted to see the reaction from that hot sauce the most.
she should be eating salad
He was so worried for her from the very first wing
This is great !!! And who else agrees we should get a bloopers or deleted scenes compilation
She is absolutely amazing! So effortlessly funny and charismatic! 🥰🥰
❤💕
I love Melissa! She’s my favorite actress
It’s borderline unfair how great of a person she seems to be.
❤MM❤
****Sean.. dude.. There's convention footage from today with Jensen Ackles saying he WANTS to be on hot ones!  AmberDreams channel- first 7 minutes. He & Jared both.  He was jealous of JDM  being on during  the lockdowns. Please make it happen.
❤
theyre gonna HAVE to make a whole Ursula film now!!!
I have never laughed this hard during any other hot ones episode.
She's so precious she lights up the mood where ever she is
Melissa giving him the finger is hilarious!!!
When in trouble, and in doubt - run in circles, scream and shout.
Funniest person in the world. Best episode. ❤️
Please have Jensen Ackles on the show!
25:19 hhhh love Meslissa Great episode !!
I haven’t laughed like this in a looonngg time, I love her!
I think she handled it pretty well, I love her, one of the best comedians I've ever seen. I watch every movie or show she does
Love her so much! ,
shes the best. shes the only reason i checked out the little mermaid.
Presented by Diablo 4, Nice!!!
He needs to bring in David Goggins 😅
she is such a virgo lol. extra prepared 😂
Dry crackers, seriously. I hate spicy food. Wet things do not help.
I’ve never laughed so hard at an episode! My favorite so far! From her telling him he has the shitties job in the world to flipping him off!! LOVE YOU QUEEN!!!!!
She was a great guest
Love her, nonstop laughing probably the best episode yet 🤣 😂 😆 😄 😅
Thank you Melissa for representing us mere mortals on this show! 😂
AVP   yep  claiming as their own / cool /  they  can keep  the credit / I  want my  money /
😅I finally know what I would look like on this show! Melissa was wonderfully horrified and mystified by even a little bit of spice. Normal and hilarious😂
Have a couple aunts that had lived in or near Plainfield. And I remember the tornado, we were there the day after to visit them.
When she flipped you off I laughed so hard because that is exactly what i would expect and that is exactly what i would've done 😂
we need bill hader !
Love Melissa ❤ she rocked this challenge!!!
Such a hilarious, beautiful, just a ray of sunshine woman!!!!! ❤🎉❤ God bless Melissa
Sugar and water helps, like a table spoon and a few drops like a gulp, good day tah
this is gold
This feels like the "episodes" with Maya Rudolph IRL!
Loved this so much
No Gilmore Girls questions??
Nah let’s be real here the new version was Effin wack asf
Funniest person 😅 ever love Mrs mc carthy
I love her and she is so right about us needing to keep comedy in movies . To much dark now a days for sure .
Poor people to have no home. That's sad Melisa.
This has got to be one of the funnier episodes! Love her!😅
Stop playing the background guitar. Seriously.
I had to listen to the tornado story twice, it came out of nowhere and I had to pause and rewind it again. So heavy. And on a different note, people laughing off camera, barely audible, that continues to be a cute ingredient of the show. They didn't laugh during the tornado story, obviously. I wonder if they're the guest's people who come along or if they're Hot Ones' crew. Either way, I like it.
Get Jason Mamoa on the show !! 🔥
Dip the bread in the milk and then hold it in your mouth without swallowing it for a minute. lol.
I absolutely love this lady, and she is so right about comedy we need to laugh together. What a great show well done my friend.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wtg Melissa!!!! Respect! I’d go see little mermaid just for her. She is my favorite.
"what is it? my glotigloppis?" 😂
Melissa is just so clearly Den Mother Lovely. Like, she's a walking safe space. Warm, hilarious... And just brilliant. Success could have not come to a better person. So glad she survived Hot Ones with minimal trauma 😎
I believe that sugar binds to the same receptors as spices. So, sugar is supposed to somewhat nullify the effects of spicy foods. But from what I’ve seen, it’s very limited. So, adding a little sugar to the water (instead of plain water) might be beneficial to staving off the effects.
She’s so great
My fave episode….Melissa was the perfect guest!!!!
I LOVE HER SO MUCH ❤
I love this show!  BUT….it would be soooooo much better without the terrible music playing throughout the entire episode.  It’s unnecessary and weird and doesn’t match the ambiance of the moment.
Im in stitches this lady is hilarious. Im fkn crying😂😂😂😂
I'm a bit dissapointed there wasn't a Gilmore Girls story. :/
Adore this woman and her husband literally fffff sweet and funny as f. X
This was so enjoyable to watch I love her personality and her reactions 😂😂😂 I NEED KEANU ON THIS MANIFESTING IT WITH ALL MY MIGHT
My fav actress. I love all of her movies. She's pretty, cute, funny, good at acting and good personality. What else to say. Love her ❤️
Delighted to see someone from Plainfield…coming from Plainfield in NJ
The spray bottle actually seems like it'd be extra refreshing
I don't think enough people talk about how good SPY was. Took me by complete surprise. Hilarious comedy and her chemistry with Statham was  great.
Are the wings custom prepared before the sauce or does a vendor provide them? Some of us may want to replicate the Wings of Death... and want to make sure the wings are accurate!
Everytime I watch this I always go to wingstop after.
I love Melissa she is hilarious and always fun to watch 😂 you both are great
She is such a good lady I just love her
God I love her so much
You guys should get P!NK on!! She would love this
"What's your legal situation?".  🤣😆🥰😂 My face hurts watching this one.   🫶🫶
She was a trooper for sure!
Antidote!!  Sean, hear me out on this.  50/50 mix of 2% milk and olive oil.  Why?  It works.  Why again?  Capsaicin is hydrophobic, so it doesn’t really get washed away by the milk.  The olive oil washes out the capsaicin, and the milk helps sooth while masking the flavor/texture of the oil.
Petition to get MatPatt and Stephanie from the theorist channels on Hot Ones! 🔥
I enjoy this show. Big fan. He's a bears fan lol. Me too. Melissa is one of the best.
12:51 💯 i love comedies. The only movies I'd give the time of day.
I love Melissa. She is so funny, charming, smart, and beautiful.
Could be be the first interview with her without a Gilmore girls question. I honestly dont know how i feel about it. On one hand i was hoping to hear what inventive question he would come up with about GG. On the other hand i am sure she is tired of GG questions.  On watch number 42 of the whole series lol. 🎉 i love you Sookie ST James. 😊
Best one yet. Period. Thx FWF! 😂
Great episode! Melissa was hilarious and insightful.  Do you think you can get Ke Huy Quan? I think it would be very interesting to see hm take on the Hot One challenge.
!
What an awesome episode… Sweet Jesus what a raw and painful experience. I’m over here wanting to send Melissa a truckload of ice cream. Wow!!! Riveting!!!
PLEASE get Nikola Jokic on the show!!!
''Jesus Christ, you're terrible at this...''  - Melissa McCarthy
One of those always on...dogshit
I love her outfit! It's beautiful and looks so comfortable! Melissa is a guest that I didn't know I needed to see do this interview until I saw the thumbnail!
The best guest yet. She powered through it and didn't give up even though she was struggling from the first wing 😂 bring her back in future
...and get Keanu Reeves on FFS
Geez, stop simping & make 'em clean the wings FFS 🙄
She was already my favourite actor, now I just love her more ❤😂 this and stone cold were my favourites
she's such a gem, a natural comedian
The way she thought to toss him the other half of the bread as she’s actively falling apart is the sweetest thing 😂💙🩵🩷💜
this feels like the first natural reaction to the bomb on the show ever, lol
I love the mermaid even more with Melissa being Ursula ‼️and she actually looked at so good to be Ursula . I definitely wouldn't support It the movie 2x 3D and standard😂😂 great work
She made a great Ursula.
Matpat is gonna be next right sean???
She delivers every f'n time. Love love!
How can you not love her!!! She is beautiful inside and out!  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
First thing... I love her! Always have. There's never been someone so sensitive to spice that it hurt the skin on their fingertips. Good for her for getting through it with humor intact. It's exactly why this show is hilarious. Giving Sean the finger and asking if he was lawyered up was such a great mix of physical and thoughtful comedy. She makes me laugh and I suspect she could make me cry as easily. What a sincere, lovely person and great actress.
She’s so awesome!!
😂🤣...I love her!! She is genuinely Hilarious! Her reaction to her misery had me 😅😅😅😂😂
We want Nardwuar!
God i luv her lol!!!
Best way I’ve found to get over the heat is following up by taking a small spoon full of peanut butter and honey. 🥜🍯
I think we all just watched Melissa McCarthy's soul leave her body a few times😂😂😂😂 an ego death on camera
She is awesome actress and even better woman.
"As you try to breathe in......to live....it gets worse."  -Melissa McCarthy  Brilliant.
"bad choices in life " insert- little mermaid
Lol the can of whipped cream 😂
Dude, you straight up nearly killed Melissa 😬😬😬🥵
So upset how they wanted her to do farleys iconic character
It’s like when you break your leg but now everybody gets to sign my cast I’m screaming 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
First question should have had an answer like “oh we destroyed the soundtrack in this movie…have you hear awkwafinas song? And how we changed the lyrics to kiss the girl? Yea we woke up in herrr”
Great interview questions and love hot wings, what's not to love.
get rid of the email and phone number sign up as I couldn't find the X to close it and it was almost the tipping point to make me get away from the page to order. That is the worst to force someone to sign up...
She's just the last of her kind so likeable so honest so naturally hilarious she's a gift for real
Yeaaaas Queen 😂🎉
Gratitude
Love this woman!
***NO REACTION***
80dollars for a hoodie r u guys crazy
Love her!
The long sleeve polo wit the full button up!? Tell me you out here f***in wit out tellin me you out here f***in lol
meanwhile Lorde: mmm delicious
Good job Melissa 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Best one yet 😂😂😂😅😅😊
Great outro McCarthy!
I love her!
She’s still famous? Whaaat
Never liked her, still don't
We need Danny McBride!
The editor needs a raise for cutting to Melissa having a loaf of bread out of nowhere haha.
She's cool
Hilarious she brought her own props to help with the pain 😂😂😂
Love heeeerrr ❤❤❤
How can she say she isn’t a singer ?   Barbara Streisand asked her to sing with her !!
Knew this was going to be amazing !! She is classic and so expressive …
About killed my girl
Melissa is so hilarious!  Best Hot Ones Ever!!!
She is a horrible interview. It was not funny at all. Actually, I have never thought she was funny.
The collab I never knew I needed
It’s when she says  “When you try to breathe in to live, it gets worse” 🤣
Melissa is funny, gorgeous and a national treasure
This video is my new fave of all your vids. Melissa, you are a true genius.
Best one yet!!!!😂😂😂😂
Melissa McCarthy is GREAT!!!   (I always enjoy her.)
Can we get the Terminator on the show?! I wanna see Arnold Schwarzenegger to take on the wings of death.!!!
So funny how they play emotional music over her misery 😆
I  was singing poor unfortunate soul while watching this 😂
YOU SHOULD DO HARRY STYLESS!!
Im distracted, because I really want to know where Melissa got that jumpsuit from 😍
I hope you could invite Halle and Jonah 🥹💖
Best women - no - best person to ever walk the red carpet I stg
If Amy Schumer was actually funny
Ian,Runkle Of the bailey, as a guest would be very interesting.
LA BEAST
Great interview, but I had hoped for a Sookie Gilmore Girls question
I always watch for the moment the facade drops, the moment where the real person appears. Often you can see it in their eyes. this time it was right after da bomb.   it is the combination of hot sauce and really good questions. and a humour that is not always centered around the camera (like most talkshows).
try a hooks i want it for science
I agree with all the comments. And yes, I too was laughing out loud 🔊 😂
The love I have for Melissa, she is amazing and never seen someone struggling and still be amazing ❤ I would love Javier Bardem on hot ones ♥️
She's hilarious, adorable and so brave. Some guests handled their spice better, but took way less in one bite. Props to her. Thx for serving ❤
Im so sick of that commercial of hers... "AS LONG AS THEY HAVE CHILD CAAARE"
She was the only good thing in that terrible Little Mermaid movie, and was a boss here
Hollywood stopped caring about making the audience laugh when they brought Melissa onto the scene.
SEAN! Here’s an idea for a show, have a line up of comedians telling jokes one at a time and if they laugh at their own joke they have to eat a Da Bomb or Last Dab wing each time. And after all of them have taken a turn the next round would be similar but with rules or modifiers that inflict more antics/ mouths on fire..
It's beyond annoying how Sean CONSTANTLY  keeps repeating "I know, I know, I know"...
Bread definitely works. It’s my go to 😂 🍞
Melissa McCarthy is an absolute goddess. ❤
Please invite Rita Ora! She’s in several films that are coming out this week, and her third album is coming out next month ❤
Melissa, congrats on trying all of them. I seriously doubt I would get passed the first one!!! 😊
She's right that we need comedy in our lives, and stories that make us laugh, cry, angry, moved, hopeful, yeah all of the above. I love her outlook on the subject.
Gosh, I adore her❤❤❤
I happened across these videos somehow and am now firmly addicted! I am truly amazed at the people you've gotten on your show. It's great fun, surprisingly interesting and has to be one of the more unique interview formats. Blown away over how many seasons, and grateful I have so much to catch up on. Thanks for fantastic content! 👍
where's the HVR when you need it I think I remember someone bringing blue cheese
I love her so much, she's an absolute delight 😊
Ill be honest. I wasnt ecstatic when they announced her as ursula. But boy was i proven wrong!
I live Melissa McCarthy ❤ she is wonderful
She will always be Sookie, to me. Melissa was TV perfection on Gilmore Girls.
I love her so much 😂 she's just a natural person and so down to earth. Very few people like this nowadays. ❤
Great guest, I saw the live action little mermaid and it's actually really good, especially for a remake. Melissa was great as Ursula
Love the show and absolutely love Melissa McCarthy..!!
I agree with her 1000%, comedies do bring people together!!!!!
Funniest episode by far🤣🤣🤣
When she's already feeling the heat at 36k Scoville, I can't wait to see her to get to the Bomb.
that was a crazy tornado story.
😂😂😂😂😂😂    Sean: I know, I know, I know…  Melissa: Zap sign  Classic🤣🤣🤣🤣
biting those wings like squidward bit his 1st krabby patty
One of the best 😂.
im 100% convinced the only reason DA BOMB is still in production is this show right here :D
I've never seen him laugh forreal forreal like this 17:45 😂😂😂
Please invite Mindy Kaling 🙏😭❤️
Luv her!
I kind of hate more than love how she states every drag queens life, then proceeds to not say anything about a trans person.
Been a while since i cry-laughed ! Thank you Hot Ones !
Mad respect for Melissa! She is beyond amazing!
Two people who would've been the best together  Melissa McCarthy and Chris Farley. Dude couldn't take any more
Representing Illinois!!!🌺
I had no clue she was a ventriloquist. One of the best ones ever! I love her.
Why Ms Melissa brought out whip cream?! 😂😂😂
ew
I just love her and this was collectively humorous and entertaining. Loved it
Just love her ❤
I LOVE her, im so glad she's on the series!!
I really don’t know how all these celebs eat these. My nose waters from just smelling jalapeños from 6’ away.
This made me laugh so hard, I don't think anyone has been so terribly funny while actively dying. 😂  Honestly, my throat hurts from choking back laughter and tears. Melissa was my favorite guest yet!! 👏 🌶
I really use to admire her on Mike n Molly..It was a laugh out loud,witty sitcom..Another Lorre production..A true genius!     One decent kinda funny movie and then became Hollywood woketard!  She only did this show because her publicist said it’s hip and cool. It’ll keep you relevant. You can tell she doesn’t want to be there..
I have never laughed so hard at this show. My eyes were running as much as hers. Melissa is a queen! :D
I think Melissa McCarthy might be someone who reads these comments after the show.    In case this is true,.. Hi Melissa!! 👋 😀
😂😂😂😂
I really want to see David Goggins take on the Hot Ones.
Love love love
The episode length told me she would make it but the whole time I still had doubt. Nice job.
WORST episode ever!...Including  season 1... Dude, you're starting to slip
She’s a cracka. 👍🇦🇺❤️
I wish they didn't add the "epic" music and sound effects
I just love her more every time I see her❣️
I'm only two wings in and already so scared for her!
so they eating chicken right chicken is bird and birds are descendants from dinosaurs and so basically they are just sitting eating dinosaurs and laughing
The gilmore girls erasure!!!!!!!!!!!! 😠
Bought the Apollo...perfect hot sauce...gonna stay stocked with it!
Please please please Kelly Clarkson... new album promo time ;) and entertaining as heck :)
😂😂😂 She will never not be just cute af
I used to be a dive instructor. I never seen that make up face except underwater at 10 ft with a left sided boobie   hanging
When y’all gonna go back to the one table?
Great episode!
Love this, but for the love of god - lower the volume of the background music!
really enjoyed her and love her humility and natural humor. Complete 180 from last female comedian
❤❤ love Melissa❤❤
I have rewatched her reaction to the bomb at least 5 times now and every time I can’t stop laughing. She’s awesome.
Melissa McCarthy is the female Robin Williams
Hot ones is back!  What a great interview. I started to lose faith in hot ones but this has restored my faith.
I reckon after da bomb. They should put a timer up for how long it took until they did the next wing. I could imagine for Melissa it would have been like 10min before she did wing 9
Carbondale feeling the appreciation
"you try to breath in, to live!" 😂😂
Thank you
Have to admit, when she felt the first wing was spicy. I did not expect her to last. She did though.
I didnt think she was going to make it when she reacted to the second wing
I have been so waiting for a guest who unashamedly has a snot waterfall. The one thing that I have always wondered about this show: are there editing breaks where the crew is slipping the guest handfuls of tissues? 😤
great guest!
Best Hot Ones of all time! Bested even Charlize!
I also grew up in Plainfield! That's wild I had no idea!
"It's coming outta me like lava" 😂
I love Melissa McCarthy so much. 🔥😭🙌🏽
I've always wondered what the point of blurring names is when everyone clearly knows what it is anyway?
fight or flight kicked in hawd at tha bomb got me worried for a minute but moma handled it
No way
Melissa McCarthy is pure "Fun Aunt" energy.
She’s adorable! It’s been a while since anyone tapped out early, so glad she made it thru!!
Her rinsing her fingers in her drinking water is so amazing
❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Can you get fall out boy on the show or mrbeast
…” so you try to breathe in to live “  oh no I peed myself a little
God I love her off the cuff do what ever I want,,,,man that is like a bronxo ya wanna ride
I like here analogy of comedy,,,it hit me,,all jokes are mean but if you know how to make the other person laugh too and not cry,,,yeah that is funny and NO not everyone is gonna get it as usuall with ANYTHING in LIFE
Melissa McCarthy 😂💪🏾👑💕
FINALLY... someone ELSE from my list! She was GREAT!!!
Love Melissa, she's so funny. Great Soul!😀
BEST
Her performance of Chris was SPOT ON
thank you I needed that and didnt even know it
My favorite episode of all!!!! She is so delightful, funny, charming, real, truly unique, and awesome! I absolutely love her!
Who are your lawyers you got them around the clock 😂
Mellissa rocked the role
Melissa one of my favorites
“Somebody said it helped, I don’t know”
I would love to know how some like Jenna Ortega can do this without flinching and others are close to asphyxiation.
😂😂😂😂
It’s impossible to dislike Melissa McCarthy. What a truly lovely person.
Pls do one with Gaga and Joaquin for Joker: Folie à Deux
What was with the cartoon interruption??? I’ve never seen that in these videos lol
"whats your legal situation...im gonna find out" Never in the history of ever has a threat sounded so fun
GAHD I LOVE THIS WOMAN!!!!!!!!
Funniest ever    Missed so much because laughing so hard have to watch again
How can you not love her???
As she was blowing her nose crying from the heat, I was blowing my nose crying from laughing. L. O. V. E.  her
This was the best! Laughed so hard!!
Lol at "I'm gonna find out" 😂😂😂😂😂
Talk about Gilmore Girls!!!
She is one of my favorite actresses.
Well Done Melissa 🥇💋🔥✨💕 You did, so proud. I enjoyed watching this is one of the most hardest and fun-est interviews style to do. Thank you 🙏🏽 Hot One’s.  She’s a Beautiful talent woman.  Good person. 😊
Love the Midwest measurement of distance with time.
Nobody: Sean: Guy Fieti
Comedy movies are the only movies that truly matter today with all this darkness in the world
Love me some Melissa she is such an amazing funny humble human and you are so loved with all the work, love and amazing spirit you have for us to enjoy ❤❤❤❤
“When you breathe in to live”
i was just thinking about her yesterday 😁
Once again Da Bomb steals the show…
I just love her
I love her. She is so genuinely funny and entertaining.
That was an all time great.
Rebel Wilson is cooler
She is #1 best guest of all time
SOOKKEEE!!!!! I love that the tech and camera crew keep chuckling/giggling in the background. So endearing!
Great episode, Melissa is an American treasure lol
Love her, she's naturally hilarious!
Day 524344 of asking for Jared and Jensen from supernatural!
I didn't know Melissa McCarthy was a practitioner of the Hammerspace arts.  Seriously, where did the bread and whipped cream even COME from!??!
I love Melissa and I love this episode! R.E.S.P.E.C.T!!! 😂
Please have guest that will eat the wings I can’t watch the guest interviews when I see them take little bites
My late mother loved Melissa, she once said Melissa was hated by people because she's awesome lol
I still watch Bridesmaids and Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig still make me laugh uncontrollably. I also quote that movie to this day.
She flipped him off 🤣😂😆 This interview really cracked me up!!
I am not a spicy person AT ALL. My mom gave me a bottle of that lemon pepper hot sauce. It sat in my pantry forever, until I just threw it out because it expired. While dumping it out, I was curious and took a whiff. It took a second, but then I felt pepper hit the back of my throat and I had a cough attack! This is precisely why I dont do spice, lol!
Love that she brought a prop gag!
17:45 Hahaha! That loaf of bread.
Melissa McCarthy is a national treasure! What a master class in how to do an interview!  👏
16:28 the moment he broke Melissa McCarthy😮
Petition for a couples interview with Deadpool and Wolverine. Ryan Reynolds in full getup and Hugh Jackman with prosthetic Wolverine claws. Ryan can't take the mask off and Hugh tries to make it thru the interview without losing an eye. We believe in you Sean
I've watched so many of these and can honestly say that this was the one I laughed watching the most (and not at you, but with you).   Thank you Melissa!!   You are one of the finest comedic actresses ever, and that might be due to you not faking it...
You gotta tip your hat to someone who so clearly suffered through this. Stronger than I anticipated. Good job! Sean was clutch, as usual.
I have been waiting for this moment!!!!!!! I love this woman so much, watching her definitely saved my life. Loved Mike and Molly and the heat is my favorite movie.
This is honestly the best one I have ever seen. I needed a laugh and wow.. I’ve never cackled so hard in my life!! And the commentary ❤🥹🥹 I love you both so much 🫂 Thank you for bringing so much joy to my life.
The cut to her eating bread was genius 😂
Love the southern Illinois representation in this
Those green eyes
Absolutely the funniest Da Bomb reaction ever.
16:22 "Da Bomb" 🔥
I’m obsessed with you Melissa! ❤
My ribs hurt from laughing
some dem wings looked kinda....... dry. just sayin
Only 2 things i dislike. 1) guests that take the smallest bite and dont eat the whole wing! 2) seans acting when he tries to sympathize with what the guest is going through! Cut it out.
Sookie❤
She's a national treasure.
You should have Bailey Pain on sometime.
Por qué quiero a mis favoritos en este programa 🤣🤣 Yo no tolero el picante, pero me gusta este formato.
Omfg!!!! I love her so much!
I just love Melissa so much!!!
I absolzadore Melissa, she's such an exceptionally gifted actress. I LOVED her on Hells Kitchen. ❤️
Her playing Ursula was the only good thing about The Little Mermaid
I love Melissa, she’s a treasure 😊
after The Bomb - oh my god!! (hiccup) OH MY GOD!!!!!         one of the funnier moments
Melissa: “What’s your legal situation?”  Sean: Uh…
Crystal Lake? Well that makes both Jason and Michael Myers from Illinois.
I love how you can hear all the camera people laughing behind the camera 😂
she slays
She’s such a beautiful soul. Played a big hand in my personality & humour today for sure.
The guest i have been waiting for
I would have to say. This was my favorite episode. I mean, Melissa had every crew laughing. Like that was hilarious. I feel so bad for her. She was really tearing up and was burning up inside. But she did it! Great job Melissa! 👍
Aaaaand…like 16 minutes in she profanes the holy name of Jesus…
that tornado story is wild tho
Hahaha she cracked me tf up! Thx girl, I needed it. PS, you’re so gorgeous! I would
The spray milk is hee-haw-larious but also pretty genius!
Should’ve given her leftover pizza, cause she’s “The Pizza Eater!”
Best woman out there keep it up girl!
I’m stone cold sober and have never laughed so hard and cried so many tears from laughing. Pure joy. Thank you for this 🙌
Why does every sauce reaction from her seems like a Da' Bomb reaction lol
One of my favorite episodes she is my favorite actress very funny woman
Melissa doesn't disappoint, suddenly giving Sean the finger had me tearing up laughing.  Love this lady.
I would love to see Ryan Reynolds here
I like her.
Can't they get a better table situation or like put a sign between them so it's not just so blank and open and it could look better idk sry
Dax Shepard returns please!!!!🎉
Please do Lil Wayne!!!!
THERE SHOULD BE BUTTER ON THAT BREAD
I ❤ Melissa McCarthy!  She’s braver than me, that’s for sure! And still managed to find humor it it all
Anyone can tell me where she got her shirt and trousers from though ? Please ! Love them
Anyone notice Sean narrowly avoiding putting his foot in his mouth at 7:48? 😂
This ep of Mermaid was sponsored by the Bomb
can we see Lauren Graham next PLEASE??!!?!?!!
Melissa McCarthy was one of the funniest guests on the show.
Melissa McCarthy is my newest CRUSH💗💖💝
I do not think she was the right choice for Ursula at all......in a complimentary way
I love this woman!!! She is an amazing person has a great personality
Hands down the absolute hot ones interview ever. Melissa is absolutely hilarious!
Oh Michael ✌🏾👁️👁️🤣🤣🤣🤣
Melissa is a legend... never not funny.
BROWN SUGAR HELPS SPICE
Born in Crystal lake 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔💀💀💀
Gorden Ramsay  Is the bread guy
From Pekin Illinois here. Grew up around South Pekin, Green Valley, Manito area. Yes the tornadoes and storms around Illinois are crazy pants. Melissa is so awesome and beautiful ❤ I love here!!!!
BEST DABOMB REACTION EVER! Thank you for your sacrifice for comedy Melissa.
even she got the last dab... unlike Shaquit
My favourite reaction to Da Bomb, ever.
She is so funny I wish that she was on another tv show.
god i love her. this was fantastic
I saw the bottle marked 'Milk' and thought why not ranch dressing 😂 "That's Jacktastic"
I loveeee Melissa 😂 she is too funny
THe bird flip was the best part.   lol
This was the most relatable episode I have ever seen
This is easily one of my favorite episodes yet! Melissa had me (and the entire crew apparently) CRACKING UP.👏🏼
I thought she was just going to do a whippet there for a second and was like "ok. you go girl!"
One of the best ones
crystal lake i knew u looked familar. cary
This is a cool person, The last couple was totally uninteresting
I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HER!!!!!! even in this kind of programs she is the best!!!
Someone build this man an actual table for this show!
Melissa has the most beautiful smile. Lovely personality, and wicked great talent. Love her.
I’ve never seen him laugh so much, she’s so lovely.  Just love her!!
I would now like to see Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel
Just don't 💩 in the sink after this lol
Love Melissa McCarthy!! She's so funny the milk squirt bottle and whipped cream is legendary 😂
I love how she has a squirt bottle filled with milk! 😂😂😂
May 26th promo, uploaded 6/16, kinda late
FYI, in case you didn't know, Melissa and Jenny McCarthy (Mark Wahlberg's sister-in-law and also one of The Masked Singers' judge) are cousins
Has anyone else noticed that when Melissa McCarthy stifles a hiccup, it sounds like Yoshi eating a mushroom? Just me?
this was one of the funniest DaBomb reax ever
Chocolate melting in the mouth helps.
Melissa McCarthy won an Emmy for her portrayal of Sean Spicer. Now she's killing it with another Sean spice-r.
I can’t remember the last time I’ve laughed this hard. Best reaction yet. Bless her heart.
BEST GUEST EVER
That was such a hoot!!!
Why was this released on June 16 when the movie has been out for weeks? She’s on here to promote it! 🙃
Melissa McCarthy is the BEST! This was such a great episode! So funny
The music is killing...it's all over the place and super distracting.
My girl. What a treasure 😂😂😂
My Favvvv I just love her so much and I laugh too much  XD
One of the best guests ever, thank you Melissa ♥️
Love her so much. Such a humble Queen.
I adore her so much.
“We’re in for one today” hahaha
Comic genius, and super warm and down to earth, probably has something to do with her Midwest origins. Very classy lady‼️😂🤣
she is a sweetheart
Nailed it. Well done Melissa
I love her so much lol this made me so happy to see her on here
My Queeeeeeen.
She's just the best!!!
"I don't know who your bread guy is" 😂😂😂. This is one of best episodes ever.
Love me Some Melissa Mccarthy 💕  Love from Montreal, Canada 💕
My husband and I watched the little mermaid 3-D last Tuesday. We enjoyed it very much and I think that she did an amazing job
She is so beautiful inside and out.
I fkn love you Melissa. Your my energy
Definitely my favorite actress. She’s amazing. Much love from France ❤
Nothing about Gilmore Girls?  Sad.
Can't wait to see The Little Mermaid
1:45 "We're in for one today" Sean said after the first wing. I though so too. Nek minnit, she's doing the dab. Melissa nailed it.
17:03  She needed a priest, a rabbi, shaman, and an exorcism!!
One of my favorite actors!
I've never laugh so hard at other people's misfortune
16:20 da bomb  21:40 last dab
If Melissa was a thin woman she would be Kaley Cuoco😂🎉
Lol I love how much she made Sean laugh 😂
Respect for Melissa.
First time I've seen Sean with cheat notes.  He usually goes by memory it seems. Side note: Mike & Molly is still one of me and my wife's favorites.
I love Melissa, she is so sweet, very beautiful and outstandingly funny. I started watching her on Mike and Molly I wish she would have made more. I think i have seen everything she has done.
Love her !... really nice interview !
Best interview 😂😂
She's the absolute BEST!
This is the most I’ve laughed in hot ones I think ever 😂😂
I had a chance to try Da Bomb and milk works well to quench the fire, actually
“I don’t know who your bread guy is but…clutch.” IM WHEEZING
Dear lord this show is spiraling out of control. 😢 This is really bad
Melissa was brilliant, I'm a fan and would have been really disappointed if she'd have dropped out.
Disappointed. Saw 5.8k dislikes and went to comment section to see what's up before watching. It's filled with bots praising her. Not a single negative thing said. That is statistically impossible lol. Come on, Sean
Melissa is just wonderful, I love her
😂 She’s hilarious. I would be the same way. Actually, worst. I’m so bad with spicy food.
I'd love it if you could get Chloe Moretz on here.
I just watched this whole thing and i totally spaced out the entire time.
Proud of her for following through!!
I laughed so hard, I love her...she is so funny and she is a very good person too!
so...matpat when?
This is the funniest episode to me and there has been a lot of funny guests before. The whole sequence after Da bomb is comedy gold 😅. What a trooper 🙌
idk about y all but ik her as sookie the most ik thats bad cause theres so many other shows shes done but still 🥲
Keep doing what you're doing Melissa McCarthy, you shiny diamond!
Melissa’s reaction to the spicy heat of the wings made this one of my favorite episodes. Congratulations on surviving the wings Melissa!
spinoff idea! one whipit per question
Uh oh from wing one I can tell Melissa gonna have a fun time lol
Hahaha when she flips him off 😂😂 what a great episode 😂😂
I lost it when she brought out of the bread out of nowhere
Melissa's Matt Foley/Chris Farley impression was impressive. Be proud girl!❤
Brilliant❤
I just neeeeed to see Jensen Ackles on this show 😭😭
Why is there so much scoring in an interview show? Sounds totally unnecessary to me.
Melissa could do no wrong!! I love this woman ❤
Nailed it
She is so hilarious, love her ❤
When Ursula eats
I l❤️‍🔥VE Melissa McCarthy, and I will see the Little Mermaid, but I am not goi g into a movie theatre in texas. No, thank you. Too many guns…too many hateful, evil, racist and misogynist maga freaks. Sorry.
What a poor unfortunate soul.
Melissa McCarthy gives me LIFE! I loved her as Ursula! I love her in everything that she does!
Ursula is evil and that's fine. No need to find redemption for villains all the time.
Aww shes great!
Usually actors give a vibe of beautiful or funny or weird or interesting when going on interview and else. Melissa gives me this Paul Rudd vibe of being and incredibly down to earth person just a pleasure to spend time with.
Admitted to zero spicypain threshold - Moves through every wing anyway without one mention of quitting.  Badass. Also, her stories were super interesting; especially that one about the storm.
Melissa is definitely one if the most funniest person 😂🤣 not to mention such a sweet and very humble person 💓💓💓💓 So happy to see how her talent , dedication and hard work put over the years - known her since "Girlmore girls" are finally recognized and she is making even Disney movies 😊😊😊 Such a diamond 💎💎💎 Btw, that gorgeous wiman in the yellow 🟡💛 dress is a model and actress - Mădălina Ghenea ❤ "This is an application moment?" 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅
"What's your legal situation? You gotta have lawyers 'round the clock" made me laugh SO HARD. 🤣🤣🤣
How can you not love Melissa McCarthy, she's so great.
Can the team try getting Nicki Minaj on the show👏🔥...
16:35 Da Bomb is giving “Life Of The Party” flashbacks when she had to give her speech in front of the class
Is something in her teeth
This was better than the movie 🍿
Sean makes the girls cry😂
I love Melissa McCarthy! She's such a beautiful woman.
NARDUAR NEXT
At this point, they should just rename 'Da Bomb' to 'Da Wall' - because everyone seems to hit the wall on that one.
Hot Ones & Melissa McCarthy? Yes! Live action disney remakes? NO. I'm not wasting my money to watch them butcher the classics. Melissa McCarthy was a treat to watch this episode, that tornado story was wild.
y'all should go back to 1 table.
Props she made it all the way through when she thought the first one was hot! I’m impressed! One of my favorites, hilarious
17:39 she’s actually adorable 😭
“All terrible in their own different way” 🤣🤣
She was the perfect Ursala to Bailey's Mermaid! This had me rolling!
I love Melissa so much, she is totally amazing, beautiful and funny as heck ❤️ please keep the funny movies coming. You are the queen of comedy ❤
Im sad he didnt ask her anything about Gilmore Girls (Sookie)
What's your legal situation? I'm going to find OUT.  HAHAHAHAHA!
You almost killed her! 😂
me finding out he’s from crystal lake while i’m at work 15 min from there 😐
Her Ursula voice came out more and more as it got hotter lol.
“I think bad comedies don’t work, and I I think bad movies don’t work” was a phenomenal quote I wasn’t expecting from this interview
I love mellisa and this was a cool episode with her on
"& you try to breathe in to live" rofllll
I have been waiting on this since i seen tammy LOVE YOU TAMMY!!!!
This woman is a nation treasure, and we should protect her at all costs.
Are you gonna post berleezys one
Illinois love ❤
I agree with Melissa, comedy movies are important.  Good comedy movies can be played on repeat over and over and over, and I'll never get tired of them.  Its a playlist that puts me to sleep, watch when i eat, and playing when i wake up.
I'm going to be honest, I thought she might stop at 3.. Well done.
She's hilarious!!
That was literally knee slapping hilarious! ❤😂 How she maintains her composure and answers your question was amazing!
Hilarious 🤣 the funniest episode 😂😂😂
spiiiicceeeeyyy shark do do do do AAHHHHHHHHHH
Sean, you almost killed Melissa McCarthy! 😅
I haven’t laughed as hard as I just did in ages 😂. I was crying from laughing so hard.
I remember that tornado was notable because it hit the high school. And after that we had tornado drills in school a lot more!
Pls do Matt rife!
A little disappointed that the mastermind behind The HEAT couldn't stand it ;)
This was amazing, you should get Katya and Trixie on here, love Melissa this made me laugh so much
this episode was so good 😂
Love Melissa!!  Want some more Spicey?  Check her out as Sean Spicer, SNL cold open.  Absolutely hilarious!!  ❤🎉❤🎉❤
🤠👍
I just looooooove her.
Melissa doing whip its on accident haha
Bromelain! Pineapples and Pineapple juice will break down the mucus you build up while eating spicy wings and drinking milk! Keep your airways open! How after 21 seasons has no one done this yet??? Try pineapple juice shots before each wing!
Fine….I’ll go watch Bridesmaids for the 100th time!
I'm laughing so hard, my nose is running!
Jennifer Aniston please 🥹
I love her, she always seems like someone I wish was a legit real life friend of mine. Lol
If she was in a movie where she was to have a dramatic crying scene, she would win an Oscar, and melt the hearts of every viewer.
love this show. but 99% of people only take one tiny bite. so much foodwaste. kind of gets to me because it's meat too... maybe they should serve mini nuggets instead.
The whipped cream looked habitual.
First movie I ever saw her in was "bridesmaids" and I've loved her ever since
Best reaction to da bomb on this show. I was like wait for it! Hahahha excellent
by far my favorite Da Bomb reaction.  Sorry Melissa
At times, it looked like she was in pain, and the next moment, she was answering questions. I'm not dissing her. I think she did great. Many quests do the same. I'm just curious: What was the actual time from the first wing until the last?
I love that woman
YES I NEED MORE COMEDY
Sean mentioned that he grew up in Crystal Lake and a bad tornado gave him an intense fear of them (lilapsophobia). I remember being with friends in Johnsburg (about 14 miles from Crystal Lake) when the most traumatic experience of my life up to that time occurred. In 1989 a tornado ripped through a small park adjacent to my friend's backyard. It bent solid metal swingsets, sent the tilt-o-whirl flying into the woods, and tore out the chain link fence like it was a row of toothpicks. From that moment on and for the next five years, I had a panic attack any time the weather looked a little bleak. Living in McHenry County will do that to you.
I laughed through this whole episode. She’s freaking hilarious! Even when not trying to be obviously funny.
If she slimmed down, she would be ridiculously hot.
She’s amazing. I love how she pulled the bread out of no where 😂
My ribs hurt, I could not stop laughing!!! 😂😂
Sean almost killed Melissa McCarthy lol
Sookie would've been so disappointed at the spice threshold hahaha
Would love to see Isaiah Rashad 👀
I've seen her movie Spy probably 15 times and I still laugh. Great Bond style parody!
"When you break your leg and now everybody gets to sign my cast" 😂😂
I knew from the first bite that she was going to die on this episode haha
“And then you breathe in to live and it gets worse” 12:17
She is hilarious
Oh nice I had no idea both of them are from Illinois! I’m from Aurora
Ugh I love herrrrrr 😂
Melissa...you're a gem!! You are loved the world over! And I highly doubt there's one person with even one nasty word about you or for you!! And btw, for someone who doesn't do spice....you made this look easier than what some others have. Congrats my lovely!!!💝💋 🥰👏👌
As someone that just broke an ankle, her describing this as fun like when you break a leg is HYSTERICAL
Why can Melissa McCarthy ever talk about Gilmore girls again. It seems all her interviews since then - just "zip". What's that about?
Oh my gosh I have never laughed so hard at a Hot Ones episode. She is absolutely delightful.
I hate when bad things happen to people I really like. That said, I suffered with Melissa. Sean: still the best interviewer since Mike Wallace!
I often feel bad that amazing, wonderful and personal actors like this (not to mention a wonderful person) have to make their money in the big stuff for horrible companies. They take a lot of shots from us in the public, but there's a studio and a director behind everything that made the whole thing happen. She did a job and she did it as well as she could in terms of direction and time constraints. We all know she's a good actor and she can't be faulted by how badly the new little mermaid was made.
Someone get Mark Wiens on this show
Melissa McCarthy looks like the love child of Ray Liotta and Bill Murray.  I love her, she’s hilarious
"You must have been like ... " We done Sean. That was the EXACT time to NOT complete that sentence. Wise, wise man.
🤣Melissa is the BEST!  After DaBomb:  "I don't know what to do!?"  Props to her for bringing 'spray bottle milk', Readi Whip, and loaf of bread! 🙌🤣
Melissa McCarthy is a f'ing warrior and I adore her!!! Will watch this numerous times for pure joy and laughs ty Sean and MELLISA!!!!!!!
When she turns on me like ...... i hope she never does! 🏴‍☠♥
My favorite line of hers from a movie.. "What are you, a F....N Kenyan?
You know, for whatever reason I dont think I liked Melissa McCarthy very much prior to watching this episode... but I think i've been won over now :D
I would definitely watch a movie where Melissa McCarthy runs an elaborate con that lands her on the Lakers starting five
Now we need Ben on!!!!
As I am currently sitting in Plainfield, IL to watch this vid.
If you didn’t love Melissa McCarthy boy do you now. ❤
Get someone or all cast from the bob bugers
Hes from Crystal lake?.I wonder if there's a camp there..lol 😂
@NobodyEpic "Iced milk" joel
I love Melissa!! What a funny guest 😂
Shouldn't this have come out before the movie?🤔
I would die and go to heaven if you guys get Jennifer Lopez and Sandra Bullock on this show!!!
One of the best Hot Ones ever!!! Melissa McCarthy is amazing in every way!!! Absolutely love Her!!!
Next they need Hailey and Bailey
This show has a crazy way of making me love every guest. Great interview and great editing.
I love her outfit! And she seems nervous - very appealing.
“What’s your legal situation?” 🤣 🤣 💀
Sean. For once please get a guest who finishes the wing.
Best freaking show!  Thanks Sean and Gang!  Great as always!
I have never heard the staff laugh so much. Absolute Gem of a Person.
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Sean-my family has lived in Crystal Lake,Illinois for75+yrs
Hearing the other people in the room off camera laughing and enjoying the interview is sooo amazing! I felt like I was there. What a great human she is and I love how genuine Sean’s smile was the whole time ❤
Sean I love this show and I love what you get out of your guests. Your questions are always great and the guests seem to enjoy them. I was hoping; however, for a question to Melissa about that blooper reel from "This is 40" with Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann in the principals office. Her rant in that scene is some of the funniest stuff I have ever heard and I wonder if that is a real look in to the soul of MM. Keep it up!
Oh your god, I can die happy 💗 Seriously my top 3 favorite interviews 😅
Melissa McCarthy! Really made me think about the lack of comedy in my show binging... I appreciate how awesome she is!
Melissa’s eyes are INSANE. Literally just staring at them this whole video.
dying you go queen !!!!
Worst hot ones because of the guest. Mr. Evens is always a pro. Who is this woman? I don't like her speech.
Her rendition of Poor Unfortunate Souls was amazing!!!! I adore Melissa
She was amazing as Ursula
She is such a beautiful person inside out
That’s right! Comedy is the most important thing we have as humanity aside from love and compassion.
Just two midwesterners eating scolding poultry. Gotta love it
That's the best reaction to Da bomb
Still socially distanced tables huh? JFC
Probably my favorite besides the Queen Latifah herself ❤
Melissa McCarthy dying off of Da Bomb, and still cracking me up. 😂😂😂 Even involuntarily. She is so funny. I’m surprised she went through it all. Hats off.
😂🤣
Okay, okay, how awesome is Melissa M!!! It's cool to be able to handle the heat, and have a reaction to it. However, it is awesome to see someone struggle with the heat, suffer immensely, but still choose to continue on. Huge recognition to this woman, surely nothing can stop her. Love her work, she's made me laugh, think, and cry.
What is the music that is played in the background ?
The music in the background is really annoying! But great show
I like her at least 3 times more after this. She'd be a blast to hang out with I think.
Holy 💩 I am laughing so much it hurts, 🤣 😂. Best guest ever.
One of the best "da' bomb" reactions
I have a neat da-bomb story: years ago I ordered Da-Bomb the final answer (1.5 mil scoville units) and brought it to work. A co-worker reached his hand out and without looking put a huge blob on his finger and ate it. 3 seconds later he totally gagged and said to another co-worker in a whisper "that's good!"
one of the best episodes in a long time! so bad around spicy food, but she did it like a champ and was hilarious doing so.
the best episode yet
The milk spray bottle 😂😂😂😂
Bless her cottons x
Oh man…. From the excellent stories, to the whipped cream and the milk in the squirt bottle, I laughed so much.
This was so beautiful and effortless (seemed). Melissa has such a wonderful beautiful energy. Sean is always great ❤
A bunch of firsts in her interview- spray milk, whipped cream and bread.  All excellent soothing ideas and physical comedy gold.
I loved this
I love her so much
Reminds me of the scene from the movie "bridesmaids"😂😂
I feel so bad for her. But loved this nonetheless
For awhile I wondered if maybe the sauces weren't as hot as in earlier seasons because some of the guests were like "no problem".... especially when they eat the other options than wings.... while I felt for her - this, was comedy gold.  Thanks Melissa for suffering for the art!
I love Melissa 😂. She always makes me laugh. For the first time in a while I feel like someone reacted to the sauces the way I did. The tears, the snot, the hiccups, all of it. She's the best.
I love hearing the producers in the background just cracking up 😂😂
I really hate when white Americans say ‘im a ______ native’  Nah you ain’t man.
Melissa is the s@#*! National treasure and as genuine as can be, especially given her well deserved success. Sean, you're pretty good too 😊 Honestly, dude, you're the best interviewer ever. You always have excellent questions
Way to go Melissa! ❤
She looked like she was dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like Sean  is like a typical father at every baby delivery, holding everyone's hands and withstanding verbal abuse from his guests. 😂
Can we have MatPat on next? Or at least soon?
This woman is fantastic, she doesn't get enough props. I love Sean for having different folks on.
I love her!!!
Love this one!! Please bring India Amarteifio on this show!!
I love that she just pulls out other bottles lol
Whoever scores these episodes does a really good job.
Dear god, you almost killed Melissa McCarthy…
What a trooper! Funny from the first time I saw her.
Can we get a Trixie and Katya episode? PLEASE?!
Melissa was FIGHTING for her life 😂😂😂 so funny
Really disappointed there were no questions about Gilmore Girls
.....Bear Grylls tried to sue you guys?????
The truth is comedies are dead because of PC/cancel culture/wokeism whatever you want to call it. Nobody will ever make a film like Ace Ventura these days. Or even The Mask. Too many people to "hurt". You can't make fun of anyone, and you can't risk insulting anyone, so comedy films are doomed to be "dumb white woman misunderstands situations".
Pls put ishowspeed in your next episode
Nice how Sean mimics his guest’s reactions to try and put them at ease while they are getting their taste buds cauterized!
When I see a celebrity eat just one bite per wing, I quit watching.
I really appreciate McCarthy's willingness to be vulnerable and authentic for this interview.
That was a FUN episode. Love Melissa
This has to be one of the ones I've laughed the most at!!!
Man what a show. After the first wing I didn’t think she’d make it but what a pro
Melissa McCarthy is wonderful. Though they were brief, I loved her cameos as Darla McGuckian in Central Intelligence and as an Asgardian actress playing Hela in Thor 4: Love & Thunder  She pulled a page from Gordon Ramsay’s Hot Ones episode and brought a milk sprayer, whipped cream and bread
😂😂🔥🔥
ILLINOIS BADDIES LIKE MAH COMMENT
I've loved Melissa since Bridemaids. ♥
6:56 CRACKED ME UP HAHAAHAHAHA
Soo goood!!
Great to see an old school reaction to the wings. The last 5 seasons have been people barely feeling the less powerful sauces. Bring back old school Hot Ones!!
I absolutely love her!!!!!!!
My god do I love Melissa McCarthy 😂❤❤
After this episode I've realized this show much have first responders in the wings here.
This is the funniest by far 😂😂
Melissa can tell a story and I love it! 🧡
Great lady
The look on her face when Sean said "there has to be some comfort in that" was priceless
Melissa never disappoints. ❤️Even when her mouth is on FIRE her delivery and timing is spot on!🔥 Absolute perfection! 💋
Love Melissa so much! What a delightfully funny woman. I'm sad there were no Gilmore Girls questions :(
Love her so much!! She’s such a champ!
You know I think I figured it out the reason girls don't react as bad as guys to the hot stuff is because guys know how to be in the moment presently and girls are always thinking about what's next and what they should talk about so their mind is always somewhere else rather than at the present moment
This might be the first time I actually felt sorry for the guest but she was a good sport lol
Best part of any hot ones episode is when a guest gets mad at Sean
i love her so much
I’ve never clicked a hot ones faster
i adore her so so much. The little mermaid was fantastic and she’s now my favorite Ursula. she KILLED that role.  (also the gulp at the end of the video sent me 😭😭😂😂)
Good interview.. she is such a great, funny actress. Scary story with the tornado 😮
Off topic: Melissa's nails and jewelry is so pretty 😍 ✨️
Love Melissa <3
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR HER TO BE ON THIS SHOW!!!!!!!
Great job on this one!
One of the best can't wait to see her come back again
Ice in my milk is the only way I can drink it. Has to literally be ice cold!
Melissa is super fantastic!
Imo.. we are enjoying darker media because life is hard right now. Politics are terrifying. We are the poorest most educated Americans in history and we see no hope. We already cry lol We don't need all the emotional shiii Melissa is lacking in life. Ty
Female ghost buster hahahahaha
No joke I almost peed myself laughing during Da Bomb. Melissa is hilarious and she's always such a joy to watch in interviews
LOVE HER!!!!
I love Sean's ability to adapt with the guest. But its almost Jimmy Fallon levels of like lying sometimes haha. He says like "oh yeah this first one is a little rough" when he ALWAYS says "this first one is easy". Then whenever a guest says its a delayed reaction he goes "oh yeah this one sneaks up on you" about every single one haha. I'm torn between liking his adaptability but hating the over catering haha.
class act, love her
It's funny to bemoan the lack of humor in Hollywood the year that a comedy wins the best picture Oscar for the first time since Annie Hall in the '70's
She brought props!  It was like a Carrot Top routine
I still don’t understand why they have water it spreads the oils.  I once ate something spicy at a place drank some water and it made it so much worse.
Melissa McCarthy does not disappoint. She's got the timing, she's got the banter, she's got the right amount of rage and enjoyment. Loved the whole episode, it felt too short!
Naw when she tried eating the whipped cream and just sprayed compressed air in her mouth😂💀😂💀
still got 100% pain as background.  That used to be the threshold. Auto-tune saved her performance in a good way(Little Mermaid).  I enjoyed the movie and suggested it to friends.
Little Mermaid top 5.... let us be honest...
Love her, she had me tearing up laughing.
My favorite actress, she is hilarious 😂
Love this woman lol 😂
Chilling tornado story!
Had no idea she was cast as Ursula now I gotta see it!
Haha! It’s June! This was filmed awhile ago!
Sean is still the best, but he just lost a lot of points for not asking a single question about Gilmore Girls XD
13:28 - 13:37  She's so funny 😂😂😂
This by far my favorite hot ones! Melissa flipping him off 😂😂
love melissa mccarthy to the bonesss!! 🥺💖
Loved this, but not so much the background music.
She is my favorite person ever
I would love to see a Hot Ones Olympic Gold Medalists season of hot ones. I would love to see how athletes handle spice.
Melissa McCarthy is positively delightful 😊
I love seeing her just answer questions, doesn’t have to be in character or funny. First saw her in The Nines and loved her in that.
Imagine if Sean interviewed Melissa and her husband together 😆 it would be like a simple play on how he always cameos for a few mins in her movies. Also would be interesting to see how a couple would  journey through this together.
The bomb is not on the line up anymore😮
People might not like Melissa all that much, but this episode certainly humanized her
This was my most favorite Hot Ones episode 😅
Can we get Ricky Gervais back on for a redemption arc after he failed the wings first time please!
That numbing spray is super bad and should not be ingested and it’s 5 spray max
I love her so much
😂❤
This is the BEST episode!!! ❤😂
Best. Ep. Ever.
This is one of the funniest episodes I’ve seen. I stopped watching for a bit with some of the woke people coming on and turning the show into their stage for playing victim as a millionaire actor or whatever lol  But this is too tier Hot Ones back on stage. 😂
From her reaction to the first wing i did not expect her to be auch a trooper!
She handled them better than alot of people..
Still hasn't finished the episode but - since the first episode that I've seen of the show I was like... why no one is eating bread to stop the heat? xDxD  Finally someone did it! :D
Poor thing looked like she just been sobbing for days by wing 6..
i was ready to give this a shot and then you had to mention the trash that is little mermaid
The way she said “whole milk” makes me think that wasn’t milk at all 😂
What a champ! Suffering visibly, but still going in. Showperson to the max.
MASSIVE props to Melissa for not only eating all the wings but even doing the last dab when she knew she was not good with spice. LOVE HER!
When she flipped him off LOL
When did wings become so delicious?
😂 wow people actually think shes funny and her movies are good!?
Love her so much! Congrats Melissa! ♥️🥳
Melissa is the funniest woman I've seen. She stole the movie The Heat from Sandra Bullock. The only funny women movie.
Love her
It’s so nice to see someone having a hard time on this - it’s hot sauce after all - she did amazing ❤
Aww she really is just such a delight.
Why is DA BOMB!! not last???
Sean is such a great host.
Couldn't help but shout "Mohammed Jihad" @ 13:07 Team America forever lives in my mind. 🤣
That tornado story was NO JOKE! Crazy. I'm imagining going through that, and I don't think I'd recover. Great interview... hilarious reactions to the heat.
If I ever watch the new little mermaid movie, this talented funny charming woman is the reason :)
I never cried so much of laughter than seeing this 😹😹😹😹
This was awesome!
SEAN, YOUR PHSYNCTER MUST BE DESTROYED AFTER ALL THOSE SAUCES😢👀‼️
I'm feeling sorry for her, but that's one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.
One of the best da bomb moments
It's painful to watch Melissa going through all that! But the amount of love I have for her is unbelievable... Love this woman ever since her movie Spy!! Been a fan and supported her work until now. I hope she will do more big roles in the near future!
I'm here to remind everyone DJ Khaled quit on the third wing
It's always more interesting when someone really suffers through it, but can stand there proudly at the end, having fought their way through it.
She’s so great
I'm probably one of the very few people who absolutely hates lemon on food haha i love lemons, just not on my food, it ruins the taste IMO tried lemon pepper on chicken one time and almost threw up lol so gross. I hate it on fish too.
Fatty keeping large by spraying that whipped cream straight into her mouth🤣‼️
Love her haha
What  a champ!  Well done Melissa McCarthy
Da Bomb should be the last sauce it looks way hotter than the last dab
I may not love all her films, but I always love her. Her Sean Spicer was one of the funniest things on SNL ever.
She is taking good bites, there has been many quests who just nibble.
Two of my most favorite people together❤, what gas!  And I can tell you are both Illinoisans.
hit the cow :))))
Great episode
17:38 🤣
Her face looks like its about to fall off.
I was super excited to see this lovely Legend to be a guest of the show, she is so amazing much love for her❤
My favourite by far. good job Melissa
Haha Melissa is such a funny person this was a pleasure to watch
Love Melissa McCarthy ❤
She’s treasure! Great episode!
I’ve watched dozens and dozens of these and she’s #1.  I was crying laughing the whole way through.
She’s so me
Have MatPat on hot ones!!!!!!
I LOVE HER SOOOO MUCH!
Am I the only one who watched the whole thing then watched it again?
The episode I didn't know I needed 😍
I have an idea for a sponsored show by my company that I want to discuss with you and Sean. Can you DM me to discuss?
Saw this today June 16 on my birthday and I'm sobbing this episode is soo funny soo good.
Crushed it!!!!!
never seen milk consumed like that before...
Melissa is naturally comical and that is so awesome. Protect this woman
She’s so funny but like not doing ott antics you know? One of my fave eps now!
She's right about making a lot of bad choices. I've seen her Netflix movies.
i love her oh my gosh 😭
SEAN. STOP THE CAP. 😂😂😂 "I know. Im right there with ya." SIR 😅😅😅
I miss the one table videos, matches the intensity and intimacy better
First one I actually LAUGHED OUT LOUD 😅😅
Melissa is awesome and such a joy! ❤
Melissa and shean break bread and talk about stuff... using 'enhanced integration' 😅
Sean. I think its time to bring a guy in your show thats just a regular dude! Im ready! Take me. I feel like sugared peanuts would help with the heat. Sugar and a sense of chunky texture can make you forget a bit of the heat?
She seems like a very genuine person.
Finally!! A reaction to the wings that I can relate to. Honestly, I would be weeping too after Da Bomb. And, I know I would also find the very first sauce spicy 🔥.
Not only was this wildly entertaining with so many parts that I genuinely laughed out loud to, it was such a lovely and interesting interview to watch! What a wonderful woman
Best hot ones ever!!! Love her! And each "Ooo!" was so stinkin' adorable!
Daveed Diggs should be on here
Amen Sis! We need to feel joy, pain, love, laugh, suspense, and despair. You don’t know where you are if you don’t know where you have been!
another top notch episode! She's awesome
she survived better than a lot lol
This show is good but I feel bad for Shawn having to destroy his innards every week. Can’t he just have a nice talk show or something where instead of downing hot sauce the guests share a glass of wine or something? Lol
Love her ❤
Solid bites Melissa.  YWTWOD.
If Melissa McCarthy is the best part of your movie you're in serious trouble.
She is just genuinely funny, she doesn’t even try! 😂 love her.  On another note, as someone who has seen the original Little mermaid moet times than I care to admit to: Ursula is not the villain! She is a brilliant business woman who was done wrong by many. 😂
I love love Melissa McCarthy.  She's so sweet, kind and loving.  I wish I could meet her and tell her how amazing she is.  My first view of her was with my grandmother watching the Gilmore Girls at my grandmother's house.  Ever since then, I would watch it every year and talk about it to my grandma about the show and even the Netflix Series that came out.  Unfortunately, I can't watch it atm again because my grandmother passed away and it was a special bond I had with her.  Going to take time to watch it again, but I have to say seeing her in that show and all of the other movies she's done I love the work she has done.
Melissa is my absolute favorite actress. She is so funny. And she's right, Comedies are necessary. And so important. I love a good comedy and I watch them.over and over. Horror, thrillers, drama I tend to only watch once or twice.
Comedies for the win Melissa!!! Laughter is the best medicine and I live for it. She's right, bad comedies don't work but we have so many marvellous comedy movies, there's still more to come! Love you ❤
vow she is so intelligent... vow
❤ Melissa! ❤
Yo......Crystal Lake!!!...what up Jason Voorhees 😮
Her the Bomb reaction i think is the best one ever
One of the best episodes, so good
Such a fan of the show; Melissa is your best guest ever!!!
Instant classic
And another one who did better than DJ Khalid.🤣👍🏼
ive never noticed the color of her eyes, unique color.
I LOVE Melissa McCarthy! She is so charming, smart, and hilarious!
why did this take so long to come out?
Out of the hundreds of Hot Ones episodes I've seen, I don't think I've ever laughed this much. Her energy is so inviting and her humor is contagious. Such a gem!
Good god she is just so charming!
Having Melissa’s little burp/hiccup as the final noise of the video is absolutely hilarious.
She’s just so gorgeous 😭I love everything about her !!!!
Spy and identity theft are hands down hilarious the first time I watched them , I used to put on the spy movie just to fall asleep to it lol
So happy Melissa came to the table!!!! One of my favorites of all time!🎉🎉🎉
Comedy is the spice of life. Everyone has a different tolerance, but funny is still funny, regardless.
He did not just say Joliet like that…
Sooooookie❤❤❤❤❤
I just loved her!!!! ❤
L
Melissa you are so amazing ❤
I would simply pass away if y’all got Trixie & Katya on here
Lol I love her. Great job Melissa 👏🏽
She handled it better than Gordon Ramsey 😅
Great episode. Love her!
I have been waiting for THIS episode! Melissa is such a gem! 🥰🥰🥰
Wow, Melissa battled some demons there. You go, girl!
20:06 hahaa "I get people like spice, which I don't get"
My favorite Hot Ones episode EVER! !!!!!!
Funny you should mention ‘pie’…
Awesome
They almost killed Melissa McCarthy! 😂
That might be the best Bomb reaction to Da Bomb Sauce of the season, maybe last 2 seasons right there!
Best one ever
20:00 Professor " Philodophy of Spice ?
Not watched, will never watch this one. Immediate downvote.
So awesome
No Gilmore girls¿
Melissa is my Hot Ones Avatar. That’s exactly how I'd react.
At 10 seconds in I predict she will make it through  Every female has....AMAZING!!!
Yo. She is so funny. Such an amazing person. I'd love to sit down and chat with her and just hang out with her. Funny and amazing. BTW. Little Mermaid was great
the important question is are her eyebrows even here?😆
She is incredible
I cry laughed when Melissa gave Shawn the finger.
Sookie 4ever 💕
Luv her❤
She is so hilarious and sweet.
🤣🤣🤣 now that's the reaction to Da Bomb we've been waiting for
Melissa is one of my favorite actors and famous people in general she is such a gem. Bless her for finishing the board cuz she was SUFFERING but brava!!👏
Sean Evens i want to be on your show if that is allowed i am not a Star or a Musician or famous sports star
The reason he has never seen anyone dump the milk into the ice carafe is because most of his victims are men not MOMS! You go girl! 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
clicked it right away as soon i saw the thumbnail!!!!!
ENOUGH with the two tables distance, the gig is up, how many boosters are you at now? sit down
I love her!
So enjoyable because she's so animated. Most people seem to try to put on a face and muscle through.  she was no way able to do that at all.  I loved watching this.
I like the laughs in the background but some of them do seem a bit forced
She is Best ever. Omgosh she's so funny. "I've never blown my nose on camera" and " I don't know what to do" she was so miserable, but I couldn't stop laughing.💗💗💗😂😂😂
Melissa was the best😀
She was hilarious, she had me tearing up with laughter 😂  I thinking she’s my #1 and then comes Shaq
Sookie ❤️
She messed up when she picked that glass😂 and took a drink she couldn't get through😂😂😂😂no good 🥵👇
Nice!
I love how she threw loaf of bread to Sean😂
It really gets you when you breathe in to live…😂😂😂😂. Love her ❤
“It was fun.. in like you break you leg kind of way, and everyone gets to sign your cast.”
I love her so much! She can't do a thing i wouldn't love.
I love Melissa!!
She did amazingly for having no spice tolerance.
She is funny!   Not often do you see Sean bust up laughing.   One of the better episodes for sure.
“Oh no When you breathe….  to live” 😅😅😅😅😅
It's wholesome to watch them die together
First thought with her reaction to 1 was uh oh...
Bridesmaids bathroom scene is a must after seeing this 🤣😂🤪😋😝
"As you try to breathe in to live" 😂😂
when she takes out the bread i lost it LOLLLLL
she was AWESOME.
Unsub
First L on this show L guest L episode
18:24
sean. spicer. 🙂
I haven't wheeze laughed this hard in a while. Poor Melissa. Honestly surprised no one has brought watermelon. Cold watermelon works wonders.
Melissa has beautiful eyes!
Don't waste your money, watch the original animated Little Mermaid it's 1000% better!
She pulled a Gordon Ramsey, bringing different foods to combat the heat! 😆 She's amazing and this was such a great interview!
Something refreshing seeing someone suffer in such a delightful way like this💯💯💯💓
Love her. Favourite actress. She handled this with grace even in pain.
I feel bad for finding Melissa’s suffering to be so hilarious. I couldn’t help rewinding a couple times, just so I could keep laughing.
Please have your guest watch hot ones before they come on 😂 she had no clue what was going to happen
I love that they made animations for her tornado story.
I love her vibe
The only other person that came this prepared was Gordon Ramsey! Well done M. McCarthy!!
that hiccup soundbite belongs on a beat.
Hot Ones probably asked Rebel Wilson, she must've said no .😒
Petition to have the ‘last dab’ renamed to ‘application moment’
Presidential race next year, let's get a candidate on here.
wow !! Melissa sayin comedy is important is the best thing iv'e heard in a long time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Melissa so much. She never fails to make me laugh uncontrollably
Best episode ever! I'm in tears 😂😂😂 Melissa rocks!!!
She probably re-enacted the meghan bathroom scene after this 😂
I would love to see her reaction the next day😂😂
She's in tears 😢!
please only take guests who are wiliing to do this,  these kind of interviews make me feel so bad and kinda wish she didn't go there even tho shes so funny.
Fantastic segment ! Who doesn't love Melissa 💕 Now we need a part two with her husband.  Great show as always .☠️☠️☠️
She came prepared with all the tricks! Reminded me of Gordon Ramsey! 😂
this is like ... i feel bad for her.. like I don't feel like laughing. .. like its bad
Total respect here. Melissa was in real pain with Da Bomb and yet didn't get angry about it. She could have been a celebrity diva, complained and stopped there, but instead she was a good sport about it and kept going. She seems like a pretty down to earth, nice person.
I clicked so fast
Hello neighbors! I'm from  Crest Hill/ Joliet ... I didn't realize you guys were from my area! How cool! And what a scary tornado story... My cousin's live in Plainfield!
Re watching orange is new black and here she is talking about Michael ❤ coincidence I think not
This one is by far the best!  😂😂😂😂
My very favorite comedian by far🎉 way to go Melissa
Start using “The Source” after da bomb on Hot Ones. You certainly have the budget
She did SO good!!! 😂😂😂❤
Oh Melissa - what a good sport!  I think that she’s one of the nicest people in the world!
Melissa really did Ursula justice she was great 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"what's your legal situation?" greatest question ever in response to da bomb hahaha
Ugh she is so pretty and funny and clever and I just want to be her best friend!!!! 💚🩵💙💜
Comedy IS dead. Every funny movie/show you can think of emits a reaction of "oh you couldnt make that joke today" So everything funny is off limits. So comedy is dead.
Did Olivia Coleman and Melissa McCarthy do the DBZ fusion dance?
“What’s your legal situation” 😂😂
The bread 🥖😂
whoever is saying comedies dont work.. any seth rogen movie. will ferrell. TED for heavens sake
I wish she was my mom, what a kind, insightful and hilarious lady
She reacted exactly as I would. I love a bit of spice but I would hate love the experience. 😅
Can someone answer why they still have the covid two table set up and haven’t gone back to the one table set up like it used to be
SIU, the flats, had some fun times there!
I’m obsessed with her. What a lovely human!
Loved what she said at 13 mins
The music makes it hard to focus on what the guests are saying.
I just woke the house up LOLing
Oh Sookie I guess it’s zucchinis only for you
Breathe in nose, out mouth. No breathin in through mouth.
I love her❤
Madonna next!! So we can watch her face melt live on camera!!
Love her❣️
She is so great!  What a great episode!
I have never laughed so hard in my life😂😂
Please have Matt Rife on here!!
i would love to see an episode where dude doesnt constantly mirror
Tiny bites, even when mild, because it builds.
We need Nico Leonard on!!!!
She was so fantastic! I genuinely felt bad for her but she did such a great job. I love her so much. Fantastic guest!
My face hurts from smiling
Gladigoptus= esophagus 😂❤
I love Melissa since her time as Sookie on Gilmore Girls so it's hard not to notice the cigs on  her voice she must have smoked to get that Ursula sound XD.
What a great job Melissa
Love the shoutout to Plainfield IL
Melissa is so natural and real, especially in this interview, enjoyed watching this one start to finish. And as a lifelong Carbondale resident, awesome to hear SIU and Carbondale get the shout out from both Melissa and Sean.
Ok Sean in this top tho 👀👀👀
Thought she was faking because she was too composed after each wing but then she had Da Bomb. No faking there.
That was an incredible episode!!!!!
Queen 👑👑👑
I love her outfit and want it
Lets clear my throat out with Whole Milk got me laughing. I know that feeling.
She’s the best! 💜
She’s a legend, love her.
I love Melissa but Pat Carroll’s Ursula was fabulously over the top which matched the animation while Melissa’s Ursula is like everything else these days… Watered down (pun intended) and too safe.   I know Disney would rather torch Cinderella’s castle before offending someone (corporate speak for losing a dollar in profits) but Ursula was modeled after the most outtageous drag queen in history (Divine) and Melissa’s take doesn’t come close.
He could help you have a baby  I’m right here with you breathe
this episode is long over due
The editing on this one is top tier!
The Plainfield tornado one of two most powerful tornadoes to hit Illinois. Ever. No warnings. This tornado finally got the Doppler radars installed nationwide. With Doppler radars this tornado could have been warned 10-15 minutes.
This is, by far, my favorite Hot Ones interview!
“My uvula? No, I think that’s lower…” freaking hilarious😂
THIS A ALL TIMER
Melissa what a queen
Love her very much...  & rinsing with whole milk helps a lot. Don't Swallow..
PLEASE BRING STEVE CARELL HOT ONES
Kudos to Melissa for making it to the end! I thought for sure she was gonna tap out 😂 I WANT CHLOE BAILEY NEXT! and arsema from Queen Charlotte
Airplane wings maybe.
Lol @ djkhaled
What would Sookie say?
I love her! 🥰
Say what you will about any particular role or character she's played over the years, but McCarthy is just a genuinely funny person in general. Great sense of humor, and quick-witted. Gotta love that lady. This was a fun episode. She did good for someone who obviously didn't enjoy a single second after the classic.👍
I did not know she is Ursula in the new Little Mermaid movie! I love her 🫶🏻 can’t wait to see it now
One of my most favorite episodes in ALL the seasons!  I used to like Melissa McCarthy. Now I absolutely LOVE Melissa McCarthy.  Ok, sure, it was a hot mess... but it was a fun ride all the way!!! What a great show, and my thanks to Melissa for agreeing to come on.  Also... milk in a spray bottle?  GENIUS.
I am just constantly amazed at the way Sean adapts to his guests experience - meeting them exactly where they are at with their spicy feelings ❤
I love Melissa McCarthy so funny and a great Actor and im excited to watch this episode !!
Poor woman, she really does not have any tolerance for spicy food!
Aayyyee Illinois gang 🤛🏾
She was prepared and yet not lol the whole time I was like oh..she's going to die at da bomb
She's so naturally funny and gives such a positive vibe, I LOVE her.
Absolutely love Mellisa, from Gilmore Girls, to Ghost Busters. Such a great actress and beautiful woman. Love her so much. Great to see her on here just based on how she was on Gilmore Girls.
I love Melissa!!!!❤
I love Melissa  she's just badass in any way
FYI, Da Bomb now has a version called Evolution that they claim has actual taste, not just heat. They didn't use it in this episode, but I saw it was part of the sampler pack promoted at the end. I'm curious if it's actually worth getting for real food - or if it's still just a challenge/prank sauce.
She’s just so precious
So stoked about this episode, I adore  her so much
"What is your legal situation? I'm gonna' find out." LOL. I really enjoyed this interview. Melissa is so thoughtful and articulate. I didn't know that she survived the Plainview (IL) F5 tornado; that was quite a story.
She is a gem! I laughed out loud many times! Thank you Sean and Melissa!
Yoghurt or mango lassie
'When i breathe in, to live, it gets worse.' I really felt that Melissa, felt that.
She is one of the best guests! And you will continue it be the BEST interviewer 🌶️
I was looking for Melissa’s episode after Little Mermaid came out, I’m so happy she was finally on your show! Her interview was hilarious! 😂
Best episode.
She literally never fails to make me laugh😂💀
It’s 12:26.. and I’ve decided to stop the video… I can see this heading into torture mode for her… I can’t imagine seeing her eat the bomb wing.. so Im stopping, love the show.. will watch the next one full. ;)
LOVE YOUR COMEDIES
She’s a wonderful guest and an awesome human being. 🫶
she is such a sweet heart... love her movies and comedy
She’s so sweet, I love how she reflects on all the funny, beautiful stories she’s been a part of throughout her career
16:18 This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I'm so sorry, Melissa.
I love her - she's got a ton of great movies and definitely commands the stage.
the second she was like “this is one?” i knew it was gonna be a very interesting episode
Am sorry but it throw me off when a guest doesn’t finish there wing 😅
I love her more than ever!
I've NEVER laughed so hard at this show lol 😂 love her ❤️
MM reaction after eating Da Bomb was absolutely hilarious!!🤣❤
This one is fun to watch!
I love her even more now lol
She is by far one of my favourite actresses she is amazing
16:42 I’m dying laughing 🤣
So good! Such a fan of your show! Thank you!!
As someone who has tried Da Bomb hot sauce, it’s really no joke. It’s still hilarious watching anyone try it. Only had one drop on a pita chip and my ear was ringing
Anybody else expecting her to pull out hidden valley ranch?
Man  that woman 😂😂😂 she’s fkg hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Comedy does bring people together!❤
McCarthy is absolutley brilliant!
I’ve been waiting for her to come on ☠️☠️💜
When she was eating spicy shark and having that reaction, I felt so bad for her! 😂😭 such an amazing woman
Melissa is the type of person that nails everything she does. Dramatic, humorous, tv, movie, writing, acting… doesn’t matter. She nails it all. Mad respect for her.
Literally the best guest ever. I adore her ❤
“Oh god is this an application moment” 🤣🤣😂
I liked her before this, I think I love her now.
That legs thing is me every morning for me with MS. But they go straight . This has to be another record of scared at the first wing to straight Queen?
As a renowned chef, proud of Sookie for pushing her palate and holding her own!
Melissa is my favorite!!!  I binge watch her movies all the time!
what a coup getting Ms. McCarthy!  LUV her!
I LOOOOVE HER lololol I’m crying😂
Delightful.
Thank goodness she’s on!!! Immediately watching and one of the funniest people alive😂
Thank you Melissa!! I love that you mentioned Pat Carrol in your preperation... You are the best!!
Learning that both of yall are from IL (very close to me too!!) I have so much more hope that I too can make it to the big leagues and make a name of myself 🥹🫶🏼
I like how Sean always tries to tell them it's over at the end when the worst is yet to come xD
I wonder how Sean’s toilet bowl looks after these episodes?
What did she mean by “what’s your legal situation?” And him replying “I think I’m exposed”. It went way over my head
I like that she took bites. Not rub it on her teeth like most
She is so funny and real. I wish they would do a Mike and Molly reunion show.
Just sitting down and eating some hot wings with the Spice Lord himself would be honor enough. She killed it for having spice aversion. It's nice to see famous people humble and down-to-earth Edit: "ya know, we're already dead." -Hot Ones, 2023
Who convinced Melissa to do this? She is the last person that should be doing this
why are they still doing the 2 table thing? covid…?
@13:39 Well said, queen.
Hahaha, she shat in a sink for Bridesmaids but never blown her nose on camera? Amazing!
On the Scoville Likability Scale, Melissa is 1,000,000,000,000,000 ❤😊😂❤
you should do a regular viewer. someone whos in in lobe wirh the show and host
Love Melissa McCarthy! She doesn’t take herself too seriously and is down to Earth!
I really wish we got the old Mellisa uncensored and over the top! Lol I feel like she is more refined. JK
I am smiling ear to ear
"we're in for one today"
There's a hidden valley ranch party in MY mouth!
Hands down the FUNNIEST Hot Ones. I was on edge with what she was going to pull out next 😂😂
I need the brand of her mascara
She is so funny especially when she brought out the props: spray bottle, can of whipped cream, ciabatta loaf.
I felt shockingly worried for her a few times.  I've never seen her in an interview because I live under a rock, not unlike Ursula myself.  She is warm and lovely and funny.
She is so perfect for the Ursula part  I’m astonished
Her reactions are PERFECT!!!
This has to be the best lineup this season...all my favorites celebs
Honestly. One of the best reactions in recent memories. Loved Melissa’s reaction to da bomb. I’m sure she didn’t feel the same though. Genuine fear in that one.
She brought whipped cream LOLOL
This is one of the best interviews this season!
“I guess there’s something for everyone.” (Looks at camera)
what a great gal, i'm in love since The Heat... one of my favorite "buddy" movies
I like that transparent colors are coming back
Absolutely love Melissa M!  This is my favorite episode yet, she’s just so fun and kind.  I’ve never seen anything she’s done that I didn’t love.
This is the first time I was actually worried about the guest at one point, but I was still laughing the entire time 😂 especially when she pulled out the bread
I love Melissa McCarthy
This is the best yet!!! She was so soooooo funny!!!
I’m so glad she didn’t give up😂😂😂
Melissa has the best, funniest and most genuine reactions 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
i love her!! she's so goofy and chill 😭
Eternal shoutout to Sean for rallying with every guest, and I believe Melissa is one of the first guests to try to alleviate his pain… Mad props all around 🔥🤌👑
Can someone show me how much the sales of “Da Bomb” have gone up since this show started?
I didn’t think I could like Melissa McCarthy more. I was crying along with her. What a trooper.
She's the light skinned Lizzo. And that isn't a compliment...😂
I enjoy so much how comfortably conversational these interviews are… so wonderful.
❤ 😀, i loved this one, this was so genuine and real and heart warming. Most of the time they are not like this. I enjoyed this one alot.
Wow, she is such a prize.
I've never seen anyone in such completely preventable misery in my life
The momentum/novelty of hot ones finally beginning to wain. These are simply not that entertaining anymore. The end is in sight. Wild ride tho.
Great job Melissa! And you're the whole reason I'm going to watch the little mermaid movie.
i didnt think shed hang
Geez,give her a break to recover before the next question.
I always love seeing people powering through these wings, and remembering DJ Khaled quitting at # 2 and claiming he never takes an L.
This episode of Hot Ones, is definitely the most funniest one I’ve seen yet!!
I love her SO much that I felt terrible watching her cry....you took it like a champ!!!
This interview is making the top of the best Hot Ones interviews for me. I mean, Melissa Mccarthy just knocked it out of the ballpark. Even when she suffered, she threw funny lines, answered the questions, rounded out her answers with more funny quips. She’s a natural. Had a blast watching this one.
Melissa doing a Whippet accidentally is pure gold
Maybe dill pickle juice?
I think this is one of my favorite episodes,  aside from Shia LaBeouf. She was so engaging and relatable.  Really enjoyed this one.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Despite how "The Little Mermaid" is being panned, I may still watch it, just for Melissa's performance.
clicked so fast
Not ashamed to admit I got a little misty when Melissa spoke about the Matt Foley bit... I love her and Farley both so much... she wanted so bad to honour him. Such good souls.
“…what’s your legal situation?” 😂😂
Southern Illinois represent
“As you try to breathe in… to live it gets worse” 😂
I love this episode. My favorite by far
I love Melissa so much!  I was coughing just watching them at the 20 minute mark.
Andy samberg?
I don't think I have laughed so much at someone totally failing to handle the heat!  She is so willing to show her    humanity!
Melissa is a legend. She brings so much joy to the world, what a lady. Bless you Melissa.
Melissa rocked it! So impressed
I need another spy movie immediately!
I'd love for you to try 'La Pimentrie' 's "Le Fruit Défendu"! It destroys worlds
Love her so much, so I was really feeling for her.  Serious pain.  Those eyes.  I felt it.
this may be my fave episode ever!
❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😢😮😅😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊😋🏳️🥰😝😛😚😙😗😘😍😌😇😇😇😇😇😉🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃😊🙂☺️😂😂😂😂😂🥹🥲🤣😆😅😁👊🏼✊🏼😄😃🤛🏼😀😃😁😆🥹😅
So funny 😂😂😂
Id love to see Matt Pat from game theory on the show
Sean I beg you to please bring her husband Ben on the Show I think that would be so Awesome 👍👍😁🥰🥰💙💙💙
Shouldn’t the episode have come out before the movie?
The music felt distracting this episode. Almost drowned her out. Am i crazy?
"Its fun. Like when you break your leg. Now everybody gets  to sign my cast"  😀
The fact that Melissa claimed she was not a spice person at all, and then SLAYED the wings of death. Bravo Melissa, bravo
She did Amazing I'm even more in love with her then I was before ❤❤
Poor thing - she made it thru - I would not make it - love her
“Thanks Mike” 👉🏼👉🏼👀 🌶️
Without a doubt this has been my favorite Hot Ones ever! Melissa you are so beautiful, hilarious & inspiring. :)
her Sean Spicer was epic! also, we're Scottish.  we don't "do" spices...
I love it when they hit Da Bomb, Sean always acts like it bothers him on the same level as the guest. I doubt he suffered as much as Melissa McCarthy. He loves this.
The loaf of bread appearing out of thin air has me 💀  The off camera laughter is so wholesome🥲
I paused at the very beginning of the video to say that I don’t really like this actress, I didn’t really like her stand up comedy, maybe this episode will turn around my thought of her like it did with Shia LaBeouf.  After the Shia LaBeouf episode I watched peanut butter falcon, then a few more of his movies, because he showed his true self.  After watching the video I’d have found a little more respect for her, as an actress, but didn’t really get to know her at her core as much as some of the other actors who have been on the show.  I think I’m gonna watch the Shia LaBeouf episode again… just for fun.
is it weird when i don't know a particular guest? she has a huge resume but i've seen....none of it? how is that even possible. kim possible.
Thank you Melissa for fighting for comedy. I love comedy movies and it uplifts my mood. Hopefully there are some funny writers out there and a society that will stop being offended by everything so we can all laugh at ourselves. ❤
100% agree, we need comedy!
I love Melissa McCarthy so much from her very first appearance and movie She brings such happiness in My life 😊😁🥰🥰💙💙
"What's your legal situation??" 😭😭😭
That's my woman rite there Melissa luv her personality and character comedy 🤗
👍👍👍❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🐔🐔🐔
Sean - "I'm right here with you!"  Everyone watching - "LIAR!"
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FINALLY!!!!!!!!! I WAS JUST POSTING HIS IN HER COMMENTS ON INSTA
Love watching Melissa, she is so funny! Please have Josh Homme on soon!!!!
Not the GULP audio at the end hahahahaha 😂
My fav person, Melissa.. always make my day 💕💕
“I’m known for making bad choices…”  Agreed.
I love Melissa Mccarthy!!
Love her, but The Little Mermaid didn’t need to be remade.
I'd love to see her do an Ursula background story.
The premise is to disarm and distract the guest from their usual conserved self that they hide away while doing talk shows, it forces them to stop performing because you just can't perform especially after Da Bomb. Between that and the expert questions and one of the best interviewers in the biz yeah it makes for an amazing watch, I think despite everything we all crave for celebrities to be more open, and less reserved, I get why they are people are overly sensitive nowadays about everything and so that means celebrities have to watch every word otherwise they could not have a career tomorrow.
Melissa a trooper lol
This was one of my favorite episodes 😂❤
21 seasons later and Sean Evans has yet to ever pronounce the 'M' in the phrase "From First we Feast"  "Hi I'm Sean Evans FruhFirst we Feast"🤣 everytime!!!
The one we didn't know we needed🙏🏼 thanks sean🎉
She answered like 4 questions 😂
I think she did good considering the second one was more than she was comfortable with, she made it to the end and even did the dab, I am proud of her she's a badass and now has the proof to show everyone.
Best hot ones yet !!!!!
as someone from the Midwest I can def relate to them Tornadoes I lived in Kansas Michigan Illinois Wisconsin Minnesota  and Kentucky and every Summer man 🌪⛈
Sookie!
She’s so brave! I would’ve stopped several wings before Melissa did. That’s sick
I kind of feel bad for laughing so hard at Melissa's pain 😂
Easily my favorite episode. MM's reactions are priceless. Ready the meme machine!
That woman is a national treasure.
Please get Bruno Mars on!!!
WHERES HALLE BAILEY!?!?
That tornado story was insane🌪️
THIS WAS THE BEST ONE!!! God it was SO funny! Melissa McCarthy, you are so funny and smart AND BRAVE <3 <3 <3
18:35 oh my gawsh @melissamccarthy I LOVED this! 😂
She never blew her nose on camera?! Girl, you had explosive diarrhea!
Episodes of Hot Ones would be 15 minutes long at the max if Sean wouldn't repeat himself all the time. Episodes of Hot Ones would be 15 minutes long at the max if Sean wouldn't repeat himself all the time.
Torture 101, fell bad for her.
Unlike some people, she took a pretty decent bite from the Da Bomb wing. Bravo to Melissa!
Anyone know if they will ever announce the last dab Scoville count?
Melissa's so funny and witty! I'd love to see D'Arcy Carden here!
Melissa, you did great. I'm a fan of most of your work (there's a few things that I 'm not), and you killed it on this ESPECIALLY not being a hot sauce fan.  Much respect for doing this.  Sean, you need to get Robert Sweet from the band STRYPER on the show. He would totally ace this!!
Da Bomb almost killed her!  I was concerned.
Absolutely love her!
I absolutely adore her and I think she would just be a blast to sit with on a patio and enjoy a drink and a laugh.
Even that can't salvedge the little mermaid allthough a vailant atempt has been maid. I wonder how the film would have been recieved if they started the add campain with Melissa from the start?
Her green eyes are pretty
I freaking love Melissa!!😂❤
Absolutely loved her in Spy.  Wish that one got a sequel.  She seems lovely.
It’d be so funny if the next interview started off with Melissa in Sean’s polo starting up the interview lol
That last wing made that Ursula voice come out.
Bring Kelly Clarkson on!😂❤️
What a wonderful, hilarious person she is. I LOVE melissa mcCarthy!!!
She is actually Cool 😊
Sean knows. He knows
Melissa killed this! The first wing got her, and she punched through... much more impressive than the people who ace it with no apparent effort. I loved what she had to say about Hollywood phasing out comedy. The day we can't find the funny is the day we are are well and truly lost.
Oh no she thinks the first one is spicy 🥺
“Uh, have any Ranch dressing??”
God.. I miss her movies.. The heat.. Idenity thief.. few other funny ones too. I wish she would come back to another comedy movies.. It feels that the comedy in movies are slowly dying.. We need that back.. Laughter is what we all need..
This is one of my most favorite episodes of this show, ever!  Her and Paul Rudd, they win for me.
No Gilmore girl’s questions?   Terrible
I wonder how Sean still has a health insurance as by now anyone would have been refused to be insuranced by blue Cross Blue shield because of the risks he goes to.
The way she reacted to Da Bomb made me think they may actually need a paramedic to step in. Didn't think she was going to get through that one.
Love her 💕🥹✨
The animated recreations are a fantastic addition!!
She’ll have me laughing all day chilling with her ❤️🔥🙏🏽🦾😉💪🏽😎
LUV MM! She is such a sweetheart...OK Sean now you guys gotta get Sarah Silverman!!
"hit the cow" 🤣🤣🤣
🙌 love you
Da bomb absolutely killed me 😂😂😂 that was hilarious
brutal.
Fricken hilarious.
I adore Melissa. This was a really great experience to watch.
That was beautiful. Comedy is important.
Poor Melissa 😂
Such a good episode. 😆😆😆
What a champ.. respect melissa
how are Sean's insides still together after all these shows?!
❤❤❤
My fav character she played is Sookie from Gimore Girls.  Melissa is awesome, I havent laughed this much in so long.
Cortez' and Adidas suit is a party foul. Come on now, throw on some shell toes.
Milk in the spray bottle 😅
Belly laughed the whole time, she's literally the best and I'm so proud she made it through
Petition for spice king!!!!
What an amazing human being...I love watching her work, and agree completely that the world needs more variety in movies.
This is definitely one of the best and funniest episodes! Other than the fact that she is genuinely amazing, I have never heard the production crew in the background laugh this loud nor this frequently. Truly a special episode that I enjoyed and laughed at a lot!
hahahahaha i have never laughed so hard in one of these episodes till today
Big huge awesome props for Melissa McCarthy. I cried laughing when she did Sean Spicer. Awesome awesome performance here.
Actress not actor
Pleaseeeeee invite Miley to do this!!! TT
That was hilarious
Clean the wing, or it doesn't count in my home.
Bring back Brett baker????
Oh bless her. She did not handle Da Bomb well at all.
Best episode!!!!!!!
Shout out illinois!!!
Great episode
She pulled that loaf of bread outta nowhere 😂
This one is very close to the Beyonce joke one. Melissa did not drop the “F-you” line but I felt it coming. “What’s your legal situation?” had me dying. This was such an enjoyable episode.
There's no small of her back
Melissa is a funny, overweight, talented actress and seemingly a wonderful person. Really enjoyed this episode.
She’s a gift. I adore her
Once again it shows why so many people love this woman.  Funny, self deprecating, and lovable.
Shout-out to the illustration team!
I hate it when the guests don't eat the whole wing. One mini bite, set it down, then pretend it's hot. Ugh.
One of my favorite movies of hers was bridesmaid’s. She was fricken funny in there 😂😂
Ranch...y'all are overthinking it 😆
Melissa McCarthy Is just wonderful. Wonderful!!!
Throw in an eyelift, lol
I have loved her since The Gilmore Girls! She’s beautiful and hilarious and a true joy to watch on screen! This interview just made me love her even more! Fantastic episode as always! Thank you for having Melissa on what a treat! Much ❤️!!
I wish uncle roger would guest here 😁
She is great!
I agree with what she said as far as the variety of movies being produced now, I’ve definitely noticed a lack of blockbuster comedies in recent years.
Crystal Lake represent!!
Best one in my opinion!!!
MMC is slept on, Bridesmaids is a classic
Definitely one of the funniest episodes of this show! When she pulls the bread out after the others, I couldn't stop laughing. Loved it
That women in yellow is Mădălina Ghenea , she's from Romania.❤
I adore her 😊
I love Melissa!
This is the best one ever! LOL
One of the best episodes.  Melissa is great!
I find her to be EXTREMELY attractive ❤
Amen, on the loss of humor.
I freaking love her!
I like watch all videos...but it’s definitely not what this show was.....change is good..this new style is bad..
I would LOVE to see Melissa do a character doing hot ones…
She’s never blown her nose on camera but portrayed sh*ting in a sink 🤣
Why does no one ever use ice chips and leave them in their mouths?
When she struggled a bit on the first one, I was wincing a little when it came to da bomb!
I loved her in The Happytime Murders
Her and Viola are my favs now
What a total delight, Melissa McCarthy!
Oh yikes, watch 16:10 at 2x speed 🤣
Sean, this is your BEST so far because you not only have managed the interview very well (as expected) but you were exceptional in keeping up with sparring with Melissa's quick wit! It's like that segment of the interview where you asked about improv. A lot of this interview was improv. Tips my kangol to you, my friend.
Yet another guest putting DJ Khalid's baby palate to shame. 💀
The Plainfield Tornado. Horrific. If you know, you know.
How can you not love Melissa McCarthy
I want to see him get Nardwuar on the show just for Nar to flip it on him and interview him back
so enjoyable. but i gotta say, julia louis dreyfus' episode was kinda lackluster...really had no flow....perhaps if she was on with will pre pandemic as a duo, the funniness and energy would have culminated pretty well. oh well.
The whole time I’m watching this I’m thinking “Don’t do that to Melissa McCarthy!!!! How dare you!”
She's a national treasure, thank you for suffering for our entertainment. Torture aside, this was a pleasant conversation with a brilliant woman
I haven't watched for a while...But where's the last dab?
one of my favorite elements of this show is when you can hear people BEHIND the camera laugh and giggle. 10/10
I just love her lol
I have absolutely adored Melissa since she played Sookie on gilmore girls and since then she has NEVER let me down. Every role, every interview, my love just grows! She's so positively and hilariously unique in everything she does
I am a huge fan of Melissa McCarthy. Saint Vincent, with her and Bill Murray, is one of my top ten of all time comedies.
Melissa you're the best! And you are correct. Comedy brings ppl together. In fact, comedy saved my life, so it really made me feel better to know you're out there on Hollywood front lines fighting for good comedy; was excellent point you made. Good comedies are rare these days (they're usually really dumb). The dumbing down of America is what's depressing AF.
Melissa: i kinda make bad choices  Also Melissa: takes part in a movie where it panders to black people and manipulates them into believing they are being represented when in reality they are being exploited Yep, sounds about right 😂
Legit the best episode ever! I laughed so many times! 😂
Finally, someone who reacts the same way I think I would to this challenge! Proud of her for making it all the way through.
Go, Melissa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why are they 2 tables apart?
Readiwhip! Genius!
Mama plss yeeees!!!! She is just the best and the beauty
"... like when you break your leg and now everybody gets to sign your cast" iconic sign off line. Good job MM!
Miss M sure got alotta equipment with her..  🤭  Betchya there's a bottomless "mom" purse somewhere.
The spray milk is quite the innovation
12:52-13:42 This needs to be discussed more publicly.
I friggin love her!!!!
Poor unfortunate soul right there
Haven't even watched it yet and already love this!
❤Melissa M.  What a great interview.  She is amazing. Great win Sean.
I've actually heard there was research that showed peanut butter is probably you're best bet for capsaicin relief. The stickiness literally pulls it off your mouth and tongue.
One of the best episodes ever! Right up there with Dave Grohl. Congratulations, you guys!
I felt so concerned for her at da bomb!
I'm sure she must have had thousands of wings in her lifetime
This would 100% be me on this show!
Ahhhhh! I love Melissa!!!
Alright I’ll go see the little mermaid
Dude she got to use Chris's stuff for the down by the river skit!!!!!!!!!! wow that is so cool!!!!!!
i love her eye colour sm
"now everyone gets to sign my cast"   LOL
This is a really good one
Bahahahaha  that was AWESOME!!! Loved it, love Melissa!
Da bomb hit her like a bomb! Her nose and eyes were so red!
Too funny I love Melissa. ❤❤
Love this one best❤
Give them a friggin' straw!
I love Melissa! Great episode!
$80 for a hoodie?! 😮
You almost ended her but she's a champ.
When melissa got that bread out of nowhere tho.🤌
Wow. I didn't know you both were from IL. Crystal Lake? I'm in Island Lake. Cool.
God, how I have Adored this Woman. She is always all-in no holds barred; commercials, movies, TV,  most importantly SNL, and now "Hot Ones". Melissa all the best for you and yours. Thank You, for making my life more fun and happy.
Melissa's respect and love for Chris Farley was so sweet
18:27 “What’s …what’s your legal situation?”🤨  🤣😂🤣‼️HAHAHAHA‼️😂🤣😂
Mis McCarthy is a national treasure!!!! Thank you!!!
this was great. she was so cute
Melissa is the most beautiful human, inside and out, on the planet.
Sean, buddy, stop doing the 90s button to the top white guy who likes rap
This was the MOST entertaining episode of Hot Ones I've seen in a while.... I couldn't stop laughing when it was DaBomb 😂😂😂
This was my favorite one. Melissa was really going through it! Lol
Melissa is the mom and best friend we all need in our lives. Love her! ❤
One of the best episodes ever! I knew Melissa would be amazing! She's a boss for making it all the way. Other people punked out. ❤😅
Melissa is one of my all-time fearless actor greats! I need her outfit!!!  actor
What’s the song that’s playing during the first wing?!? 1:29 it sounds so happy and want to hear more! Lol
For not being able to handle heat. She did pretty well 👍👍
One bad decision was working for Disney.  They burned their bridges and I will not support them!
She’s the only person I’ve ever watched an entire hot ones episode for
Shoutout Plainfield 😂 next to my hometown
I absolutely loved these two coming together for this!! ❤😂
New classic episode. Her reaction to the bomb was amazing.
Have you tried getting Harry styles on? 🙂 or Amelia dimoldenberg!
I love Melissa so much her laugh is so infectious 😂❤
i don't use the word delightful very often, but Melissa is so purely delightful- even when eating super spicy wings lol
Why???????
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE her!!!!
when she pulled out the bread 😂
It's like LAVA!!!!!
I was actually smiling in anticipation before Melissa was even introduced...I knew she would be fun!🌶🔥😂
This was gold! so good.
I've never thought of Ursula as beautiful before now!❤
😍😍😍😍😍😍
This one was hilarious
Sean is going to get esophageal cancer
Comedy queen
Yessssssssssss
She is the personification of happiness and just someone who when you look at them they make you feellll happier <3
A 100% the best thing about the pandemic, and I know there weren't many, was humans stopped being close to each other physically. I've never been happier in my life than during the pandemic for that purpose. I will never ever go back to before and being uncomfortable near strangers. Humans are just cancer to this planet!
To find out that Sean form a town I grew up in was really cool
Good stuff fo sure
Well she's like the whitest woman ever so I guess it's okay. Still love her though.
Crazy... I knew whip-its would be involved. Lol
They should rename it Spicy Shart ...
My crush crushing it in the most hilarious episode ever! I ❤ Melissa
No word of a lie...  After watching nearly every Hot Ones episodes.. this one had me laughing the most!!!!  My face and stomach hurt from how much she had me laughing.  I had to keep skipping back.. because I was missing bits from all the laughing I was doing! 🤣 Good grief.. this episode was just so much fun... and it was just Melissa being herself!!!!  Geez... she's such a gem!  Thank you so much for inviting her on the show.. this was just what I  needed today!! 🥰
She definitely came prepared. I really loved that, such a mom gentle move.
This is the greatest episode 😂❤
She needed almond milk or oat milk. Not whole milk 😅
Kudos Melissa
Unfortunately she was probably part of the last wave of good comedy movies. Everyone is too afraid of offending people these days
Shout out to my home town of Joliet and Plainfield, IL!! Woot woot! Love her 😍😍😍🤣🤣🤣 Although that tornado was terrifying! F5 one of the worst in IL history!
Every celeb that chickened out of finishing Hot Ones will never live it down.
19:30 hopps actually WORK in hot sauce? 🤨 (i gotta find me that brand.)
shes so funny 😂
Fantastic! Melissa is one of my favorite people.
One of the best feelings in the world for a teacher is a student reusing the knowledge you taught them.  I'm sure Michael's honored.
I love it when people push through to the End!!!
She is such a funny person.
So crazy to hear them talk about the Plainfield tornado.. I was 5 when that thing ripped through. Cars in trees, whole blocks of houses gone... Insane
For the first time ever, I felt truly bad for a guest having to eat Da Bomb.
Great episode! I was laughing a lot when she got to Da Bomb
Finally someone who is like me. I can't even handle black pepper 😂
BEST ONE EVER!! But I just love her so much!!! ♥️ Has Ben done it???
Yayyy Melissa on Hot Ones 🔥🔥🔥
Yo
Sookie !!!
Refuse to actually watch this cause of her uppitiness about the gilmore girls reunion. She showed her true colors then.
Idk why but I got a mean crush on this lady
I got my reasons
I have always thought that that was one of most beautiful women i have ever seen. All love❤
this is actually "Killing Melissa McCarthy | Hot Ones"
I love mid question sean laughs and then it pans to Melissa eating a whole loaf of bread... she is a lovely hilarious human being
She was amazing for a person that doesn't ever eat spice things, she killed it 😊
This was honestly the best moment EVER on here 17:39
Once of my favorite interviews thus far 😇 love her!
How sweet was it of Sean to call it a “hiccup” when we all know it was a burp? 😂 What a gentleman.
Outstanding episode! Melissa is a trooper for coming up with the zingers even with the unbearable spice.
When I was really young my friend's grandmother took us camping at Crystal Lake. I was a ways away from where we lived in Central state.  Also, at the beginning you mentioned Melissa's eyes and I noticed in the cover photo that her eyes were sparkling bright.
I thought she said “spicy shart” 😂❤
Melissa McCarthy is amazing!
The Last Dab will now be called The Application Moment.
It’s about to be coming out like lava
Her milk spray bottle and the whipped cream! 😭 love her sm lol 14:25
I love that woman!
I wanna see a Sean vs. Nardwuar journalist showdown with wings.
I would’ve rather her talked about bridesmaids the whole entire time :/
"we are in for one today"
I can feel the origin story for ursula coming soon to a theatre near you.
Hands down, my absolute favorite actor! Cheers, Melissa! And cheers, Hot Ones!
You have to love her. She doesn't give you any other choice.
the fact she is the actress of ursula made me think of azul ashengrotto and I could almost hear him going "AAAAAAAAAAA" no but more seriously she is really relatable, she seems to have the same spice tolerance as me.
Tammy
She took real bites too! She was in fear and in pain and was still taking real bites not those tiny nibbles some guests have done in past 😂 go Melissa!!
I would love to see her do an Ursula back story like they did with Maleficent! What a true comedy legend!!!
I love the milk in the spray bottle
she is my favorite guest so far
I love her!
Props to Melissa for accepting the invite. She was a great guest.
"I get people like spice,  I don't get it"
maaaaaybe one of the best Da Bomb reactions. Hilarious.
I grew up in southern illinois, right under carbondale. I witnessed a crazy tornado when i was very young. This might be the same one you've experienced. Such a small world. <3
Respect for not tapping out.
I love Melissa so much! This has to be my top episode. Such a joyful and amazing beautiful woman!! ❤
Melissa McCarthy second funniest hot ones Kevin Hart still number one
Yaaaay Melissa ❤❤
Sometimes it feels like Hot Ones will never end until one of the guests fully dies on set haha
23:05 no truer words have ever been spoken. giving someone warm milk should be cause for life in prison.  i was going to say death, but that's reserved for people that put ketchup on hotdogs
she's a genius <3
She’s a great story teller. Had no idea where Sean was going with that tornado question but that was really intense
Bro ngl, love your videos, but I cannot handle the background music for this video 😅😅 bringing back to 2005 hair styling videos lol !! No shade btw!!
Yip when someone eats the first wing and squints its a solid battle. Such a shame Melissa was involved with that abomination of a movie woke mermaid. That movie proves why America will fail horribly. Great show Sean and sorry Melissa.
I can see why she is such a great and funny actress. nothing about her reactions were fake in any way,  just the best nterview
I was worried after that first wing, but she made it. Good work
"Like when you break your leg and you're like, 'Well now everybody gets to sign my cast.'" 🤣
I have never been able to tolerate her and that hasnt changed, but it was kinda nice seeing her in pain
Go back to one table!
Did she try hot sausages yet
Melissa kept it 💯...love her movies but her performance in" Can you ever forgive me" blew me away...
🥵🥵🥵😂😂😂
I love those pj’s!
This comment section is delightful to read! ❤
I paused this once I figured out she was brought on to plug the Little Black Mermaid. Unsubbed.
What a trooper! She's awesome! Love her in all her movies and her interviews!
You suffered and made out the end big fan milissa mcarthy 👏👏
330k views in 7 hours. Good for you guys!
The only thing I would change about this wonderful show is that the entire hot-wing should be eaten. A tiny bite doesnt cut it.
She seems pretty down to earth.
I love her…. Great show
What's hotter da bomb or last dab?
This is the guest I have been waiting for!!!
i'm only ten seconds in and am already pre-emptively laughing at her da bomb reaction. edit: it was better than i hoped
When she said her mouth hurts a lot, hurts a lot kind of sounded like Ursula.
1000% correct on the Plainfield Tornado...and I used to vacation on Crystal Lake....small world ❤❤
THIS IS THE BEST GUEST I COULD IMAGINE
Just finished Mike and Molly and she nailed it😂😂
Fav actress ever!!!
She is an icon for white people. She rocks
21 savage for season 21 of hot ones ? c:
Please have Jensen and Jared on your show!!!!!
The whole time: “Po’ baby!” So sad but funny at the same time 😂😂😂
Certainly, one of the funniest episodes. Good one.
She’s adorable.. I love her 😂💓
I absolutely love her reaction to #1 but she made it all the way through ❤️❤️❤️❤️
We NEED an Ursula origins story from Disney!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was awesome she did a great job
Hazmat zoned. 😂
Melissa ftw
Whelp. Not like I needed another reason to like Melissa McCarthy but here we are.
What’s your legal situation 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 love her!
She is so fun to listen to. I love when these interviews allow guests to share anecdotes and stories about themselves.
I have been waiting for Melissa to do this!!!😊
"What a lovely warm charcuterie board" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Melissa McCarthy is Da Bomb..... in all the best ways.... she is someone I could sit and talk to for ever. Funny, talented and amazing eyes and smile. That was a really enjoyable episode.
Love her
I know I'm in the minority, but I've always found melissa a extremely beautiful woman, both in personality and in looks.
INSTANT CLASSIC 😂😂😂 what a delightful ep
I missed Da Bomb doing real damage
Melissa is amazing. She's funny & such a heartfelt person.
By far one of my favs :)  woohoo
I was trying to take a break from Diablo because and then you hit me with that ad right at the beginning. Ok, back to grinding then
Sesn Evans.  You're intervies are so great that even if the guest doesn't have a spicy food tolerance they just must fight through to hear the rest of the questions.   You're a superb host!!!
so pc you cant even call her an Actress..... smh
The way Sean nonchalantly asks the most mundane questions like, "so I hear you like home improvement shows," while his guests are fighting for their lives will never not be funny.
She did amazing at her role.  I loved her part the most in the little mermaid. 😊
The background laughter has always been good but I think it now sound a bit louder that is somehow distracting specifically the more feminine laugh, maybe turn it a bit down please? 😅
as an illinois native from schaumburg hearing them name drop their hometowns that i have friends from is surreal😂 you forget these celebrities came from somewhere not just LA
I’ve always loved her! She’s just so great. As someone who absolutely has no tolerance for heat, I totally respect her getting through this.
Chocolate is the off witch for the burning mouth"  Your welcome from RF is killing us softly!
I wish they would get rid of da bomb.
This was such an amazing episode, I laughed so hard! She's the absolute best...Midwest representing! 🥰
Why is it so entertaining to watch somebody burning their mouth  with spicy food? LOL
Absolutely love Melissa McCarthy. She’s awesome and funny and just seems so genuine and humble.
melissa is so often hated in the media and i truly do not understand why. she seems so kind and light and funny
This was the best one so far 🤣🤣
This was a solid episode 😂
I love herrrrr❤❤
But for me I waited singing a real 🐊 "Lyle Lyle Crocodile"😁🎶 💚... Someday is that now all people who hate the Blk mermaid will understand that all around the sea is one tribe home land under the sea
Ive heard she's not the nicest person but here she comes off as very likeable. Good episode!
Didn't think I could love her more... Then she goes and smashes this. Love and respect!
Melissa McCarthy is Da Bomb. You go Girl....
I love this lady!! She’s hilarious and such a talented actress
That was one of the funniest episodes. Melissa is sooo funny and so beautiful inside and out.
Finally, now she can know what it feels like to shed tears at the heat. Exactly like I did watching her in The Heat.
Reenactment of Bridesmaids in 3... 2... 1...
Always funny beautiful eyes love ya girl
Bring back Justin Timberlake lol
Spicy Shark?!?! I heard Spicy Shart...🤣
I'm surprised no one has quit in a while.
First time ever where I felt Sean was interrupting the guest or interjecting during the interview a little too much
The lady is a total trooper! 🤘
Melissa was such a good sport the whole way through!
The best interview show going. Have you ever done an man v women count? The Ladies seem to handle it better....
This 😂 might be a close contender to the best episode EVER LOL and I've been a fan for many a years.
The best guest i never knew i wanted on hot ones
Off Camera she spit it out. Man up Missy
There's a Hot Ones party in MY mouth!
Freaking LOOOOOOOVE her! Best one of the year so far! She's hilarious, let's have more comedy pros!
I lost it when she started eating the bread😂❤
I love melossa McCarthy!! Everything she is in is amazing. And ij thisni love how the cast busted out laughing s few times 😂
Mel's is a freaking soldier, warrior🫶🫶🫶🫶😎
I love her so much!!! So glad she was on here! 😅
I adore her so much
Her laugh is a national treasure.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE invite Conan to guest in your show, long time fan, love your show
First time I ever saw her I thought her whole essence reminded me of Chris Farley. Then yrs later she did the skit on SNL. Absolutely amazing. ❤
Massive respect. I felt for her.
“I took 9” 🩵
I just started watching, and Melissa is only at the first wing reaction. 😂 I’m not much past a ½ teaspoon of chili powder in a couple of recipes and my cracked pepper on a whole lot of lunch/dinners. I often wonder if I could make it past the first wing. 🤣
i love thiss woman so much the icon! the legend! the moment!!
did a hear her belly growl on or two times? lol
Melissa is your best guest ever !
Should of tried the ranch whipped cream, haha
I love this woman to death. She is so awesome.
I loved this! She was so insightful and lovely to listen to. I laughed a bit too hard at her pain. What a trooper to keep going! She also nailed it as Ursala. It is such a good movie!
ripping bread- "nobody said it helped. I don't know"
We’ve been getting the sauces at work and we’ve had the pleasure of trying them all! The Apollo almost killed us 😂
Esa mujer es lo peor que me ha pasado en la vida.
She is a National Treasure. 🎉
"As you try to breath, to live, it gets worse" - Melissa McCarthy (2023)  Edit: she's also brilliant.
Let Melissa do two episodes in Sean's polo! lol!
She’s awesome
Actually crying - she pulled out bread and cool whip bahahaha
She passes 🎉got through da bomb 💣   🍗
Melissa's friend saved her that day during the tornado! She must have so much more gratitude about life because of that moment.
One of the greatest segment ever you can't Think  of Melissa McCarthy without thinking about Tammy and Identity theft
Such a nice lady
One of my dream hot ones guests, I love Melissa!!!
David Beckham would be great on this show. He loves spicy foods.
Diablo iv??
Now We need BIG TIME RUSH, PLEASE!!!
This ep is Jacktastic!
Folks, it’s the most beautiful woman whose ever lived.
Funniest hot ones so far 🤣👏🏽
SHE THE BOSS!! SHE BROUGHT BREAD🙌🏾😂 I would do disame 😂❤
is there something stuck in the middle of her top teeth?  or is it just me seeing this?
Melissa is a national treasure! She’s one of the best!
😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌
You did great!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Da bomb is at 16:30.
The most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. ❤
Such an amazingly funny and lovely ladyhuman ❤😅
we need the creator of da bomb to come on the show and pay for his crimes against humanity.
One of the best episodes, the milk spray bottle was too funny
She is funny even when in pain.  Like her, I have zero tolerance for almost any spice level no matter how low.
You bring out the best with your guests and do truly quality interviews. I'm really glad this series has so far stood the test of time.
Is there a reason why no one ever dips the wing in ranch/bleu cheese in these?
Oh she seems so smart and kind. And she made me cackle so much on SNL that my soul was leaving my body. I think.
Melissa is a champ, love her view on the importance of variety in entertainment.
I knew this would be a blast!!! Hot ones exposes people’s ethics, She doesn’t quit…bravo!!!
Great interview as always  Sean 👍 Melissa McCarthy was a great guest funny , humble and down to earth. Keep up the great work ! 👍
Ohh my gosh, YESSSS! I’ve been waiting years to see Melissa on here!!! 😍
This episode is definitely one of the bests! ❤
when she pulled that bread out i screamed LOLOLOLOL
Her best carer choice on this show than any movie role since her TV show.
When she ripped the piece of bread and tossed it to him 😂😂😂
Little Mirmade is a flop 😂
She’s awesome.
I love Melissa Mccarthy!! Her movies have gotten me through some tough times. She is a gem and incredible all together!
17:37 🤣🤣
“It was like I had, somehow, been put on the Lakers?” She is hilarious!
😂
Loved  this one ❤
Can we get a Brett Baker return and an updated list
I live in Jonesboro, AR. We had a tornado in 2020 go through the middle of town. I have a video of it about a half mile away and it turned and kept going north. Don't ever need to see another tornado
She's so beautiful and likeable ☺
Did Melissa just have THE SINGLE GREATEST REACTION TO "DA BOMB" in the show's history?!!
BEST EPISODE EVER 🎉🎉
I've heard good things about peanut butter. What I do know is that I love Melissa McCarthy!! Comedy FOREVER 🎉😂
Aerosol whipping cream is brilliant!
She is soo Beautiful.
She is so funny!
She was great on Gilmore Girls.
I have one of the Hot Ones sauce sets and we recently discovered that fresh apple slices, especially if chilled, is IDEAL as a palette cleanser/cooler between sauces
I just watched Happy Time Murders last night. How fitting. She is hilarious.
Everyone he's had on hot ones he invites over for dinner and no one trusts him anymore so nobody eats
Top 10 episode in my book.
She’s hilarious and I love It
She did a good job. I have the bomb as a party gag, and I cannot tell you how many people have come in thinking they could handle it and then they are literally flat on their back gasping for air or sweating literal bullets. I honestly am amazed that so many people on this show have relatively mild reactions considering what I have seen from folks.
Always love that anime theme music at the beginning 😀
I only watched the little mermaid for Melissa 😤
gotta love melissa mccarthy... she has been my favourite actress for a while and probably one of the funniest people alive
Great job, Melissa! And the accompanying music made this even more thrilling! ❤
At 7:40, Chris is thinking of the 1990 tornado that killed 29 people in/around Plainfield. I was working at the Brookfield Zoo that day. Brookfield is maybe 30 miles east of Plainfield. The storm had lost steam by the time it reached Brookfield, but the clouds were solid black. It looked like clouds of smoke from a tire fire. Scary stuff.
Hitting the cow is the funniest line, GOAT list
You should try to invite chef Jet Tila
No waaaayyyyyy...I totally expected her to keep her composure 😂
*"If you try to breathe in, to live, It gets worse"* *"It feels like I inhaled spicy smoke"* 😂 Melissa is hilarious 😂
Not sure I want to watch this. I hate all her movies, she’s incredibly unfunny. Let’s see if the heat makes her bearable.
The woman in yellow is Madalina Ghenea, you re welcome.
Jason Statham!
Love this one ! I couldn’t stop laughing
I'm SHOCKED there was no Gilmore Girls questions
respect.
Wondering if Sean fasts before the show?
Diablo IV...Why?!?   I'm getting to OLD for this...
This was an instant classic. The DaBomb part made my eyes water
This is the exactly how I would react to doing this show. Lol Melissa is such a gem to watch, she handled it like a champ! She makes blowing her nose look so graceful. She is one of our generational GOATS in the biz! Absolutely adorable and laughed through this episode!❤️
Melissa McCarthy is a gem
She is so brave. Her threshold of spicy is like mine!!! Zero tolerance and I'm so proud that she pushed through. She is such a wonderful woman and actress!!!!
Loved this interview! Melissa is just so likable and sweet and funny!
Funniest yet! My fav!
Please get Josh Homme on!
Love this lady, awesome actor, super funny and so stunning.
God I love Melissa McCarthy!!!! She’s amazing!
Please get Pat McAfee on the show
One of the legit funniest people alive!
Sean evans is looking like THE only snack on the show today!
She is absolutely fantastically hilarious!🤣😂🤣
I don’t think you can quit anymore lol
I love Melissa so much!! 🙏🏾❤️❤️
YES! Finally lol
Love her🥰🥰
She gives me hope that I could do this but ik I can't 😂😂😂😂
Bill Cosby next
I love herrrr
I love this woman so much! Loved watching her as Ursula! The movie wasn't perfect (though I did like it) but she was such a thrill to watch!
Are these interviews pre-recorded cuz Melissa and Sean both said that The Little Mermaid IS COMING out on May 26th, but we're in June....🤷🏼‍♀️
Loved the dying part hahaha
i LOVE this woman. she is such an excellent actress and her energy is infectious. she’s so fuckjng funny. and she was amaaazing as ursula. every role she plays, she KILLS IT 🔥
Is it only in America you can have a connection living 1h 30m apart 🤷🏻‍♂️.  I’ve never Had a connection with someone just because they are from Scotland.    Just saying 😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💚
100% thought the one sauce was called spicy shart 🤦🏼‍♀️
I love this woman!
Please get Halle Bailey next
Five minutes in, funniest guest 🎉
When she flipped him off l died laughing 😂 bless her heart ❤️
She’s absolutely right …sometimes all I want to do is watch a well made comedy that I know is going to make me laugh and feel good
I'm here for Da Bomb reaction.
The most unfunny woman on the planet.
She is my soul sister! ♥️
Funniest Hot Ones episode ever.
I think I never laughed so much during hot ones as this time... 😂❤ And the entire Crew had a good laugh!
Please get bella ramsey
I love her so much! This is probably my 2nd fav ep after Key and Peele :)
Melissa has the same bag as Hermione and there’s so much in it. I live!!! ❤
This was the best one yet 🤣
One of my favorite episodes! She is so naturally hilarious.
Let Matt pat join you!
i'm a fairly recent addict to this show, but i've now seen most of them. and this is one of my favorites.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I missed you asking what comic's we would like to see...so here's mine Kathleen Madigan she would be fantastic
I wasn't ready for the bread or the whipped cream 😂
Her and gordan Ramsay both are my fav to watch on here hahah 😂
Melissa! Hope you see my comment. You are so dear and real!
Why is there a music thread playing behind the show. Seems to be a new commitment by media providers to prevent us from having any time to ourselves, now including the brief moments in interviews. Cut the music. Keep it real.
The way Melissa did whippets on cam made me feel alive again. ❤
Can you invite Bailey Sarian ?????? 😊😊😊😊😊 she’s hilarious ❤❤❤❤
We must protect Melissa at all costs i love her 😂😂😂😂
She was one of the funniest guests he has ever had on the show. And she was able to be funny without a bunch of f bombs or spewing a bunch of filth out of her mouth. Yeah, I know she can at times. The best comedians can make you laugh the hardest without the foul language and filth.
Please stop making movies.  For the love of god, stop
God I love her. ❤❤❤
It’s SO MUCH better when the guests REACT to the hot sauce 🙌🏻
Can we all just say that we love you Melissa McCarthy😊
She is my spirit animal
"As you try to breath in to live, it gets worst"  😂 Great comedian! She had me laughing the whoile time!
Melissa has good descriptions of what she is feeling.
She is so awesome! She got through it all! Good interview as always.
How could you talk to Melissa McCarthy and not once mention Gilmore Girls 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
I loveeeee her 🫶🏻
Melissa was a hoot, she should come on again, at least 5 times....
She took real bites... props
Wait, didn't Little Mermaid premiere three weeks before this video came out???
One of the best Da Bomb reactions in a minute for sure.
Her sean spicer is legendary.
What? She DIDN'T fall down/do a prat fall? That's not the real Melissa McCarthy!
*National Treasure Melissa McCarthy
Really good episode. Melissa powered through the whole thing even if she clearly has low tolerance to spice. Making puns and jokes even at the end of the road. Great guest!
AVP  nevermind /  haaa / sweet / no alot going on /   if you can  investigate / /without makeing   ,..  things  come unglued / then  yeh  that
But whts her answer to the design qquestionnnnnnn😅
The production value may have progressed too far as the mic now picks up too much chewing noise, and it's horribly off-putting.
I love this woman.
Was never a fan of this lady. I’m still not a fan.
I would like you to get mark wiens on your show. Hot is his thing.
Oh good, she put down the pig's leg to shovel in some dead chickens. Love people who think nothing of murdering animals. Such conscience and class!
I love how Sean stays as cool as the guest or empathizes and exaggerates his reaction depending on the guests reception to the sauces
This poor mother of two!
First time I see one of the guests eating bread to ease down the spiciness!!! it was about time!!! hahaha
Melissa and chicken great combination...... Lovely
I’ve never laughed so hard in a hot ones episodes I loved it !! Love her!!
She has been the best guest EVER!
I started laughing out loud really hard when you said “I kind of feel for Ursula with no one to hang out with…. Except her Eels” 😂😂😂😂😂
IM CRYING🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this will be one of the best episodes this season  Well, now everybody gets to sign my cast🤣🤣🤣🤣 was really the cherry on top i love the laughter from the crew it really makes the show everytime
Spray milk!!!!😂. Awesome
I am even more obsessed with her now.
i love that in this one u can hear the whole crew laughing it’s so cute
She is great
I was so worried she was gonna tap out, so happy she didn't
Identity Thief is my favorite.Instant classic
This is the best one I’ve ever seen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOVE HER she's hilarious
Melissa is a beautiful woman and a super cool lady... luv u <3
Never heard of or seen her before. Now I know why.
She is one of the best SNL hosts ever.
One of my favorite people in the world. She is hilarious 😊
“You didn’t get picked.  We don’t like you.  …but you did a good job…” 💣 As someone who is neurodivergent, I felt this.    I adore Melissa 🥰
Crazy that Bert's wife knew her
I absolutely love this woman! Shes of the funniest women in Hollywood
my new favorite episode
She's hilarious
She’s one of the coolest people in Hollywood 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💥💥💥💥🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I love her
I clicked right away, I live this woman! ❤ I just love everything she does she’s a natural goofball ❤
Sean would be a great doula "I'm right here with you, you're gonna be okay"
I loved her last comment. Comparing the show to being fun like breaking your leg because then people can sign your cast...lol
16:05 for Da Bomb.
Hahahahahahahaha him feeling like he hurt our mother!!!!! It's OK it's OK hahahaha this is the best
That loaf of bread TOOK ME OUTTT😂😂😂😂
YAYYYYYY!! Can’t wait to watch this. I love her 😍
Melissa is delightful and entertaining every single time. But I appreciate when she gets deep and sentimental too. What she said about comedy and humanity was so on point. Much respect for fighting to keep the world laughing and feeling hopeful!
💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 finally
she's about to have that 'Bridesmaids' sh*t i the sink scene happening to her in real life
I like when guests can’t handle spice as well as others and Shaun feels like he can safely unmask and actually react to the wings to comfort the guests
I’m surprised that Hot Ones hasn’t had Joe Rogan yet.
I feel so bad for her after she tastes “DA BOMB”
She was way more brave than i expected, great episode!
She´s always going to be Suki for me. Gilmore Girls FTW. Love from Sweden.
Nice sponsor you got for DaBomb.
Way to bring up childhood trauma by asking her about the tornado taking half her house 😂
Love her soo much! Spy is my feel good, need to laugh movie
Everytime I see her I smile. She is one of my all time favorites.
Shoutout to all my fellow Crystal Lake natives!!! 🤍
she’s one of guests on this show that I feel like I want to protect 😭 like why are you hurting her 😭
I just love her so much. Top ten hot ones for sure!
I cant stop laughing.
Super pumped FWF got Melissa McCarthy on!! She is a joy to see, even in pain 😂 (sorry). what a champ she is! This was fun to watch
Shoulda brought a bucket of Ranch dressing. (SNL)
By far my favorite episode
Sean is like a parent talking everyone through a spice tantrum.
id love to see M.J. Fox, and Tarentino
By far the funniest one for a long time 😂👏
Melissa McCarthy is a gift to humanity. Like if you agree!
The baguette bit had me in tears! 😂
I absolutely LOVE her!!!!! She’s hilarious!!!
I literally LOVE Melissa so much
“What’s your legal situation?”  😂😂
Great job Melissa! Stronger than I could be. Also, what eye makeup is that as not budging?
IS IT POSSIBLE SEAN IS GETTING SYMPATHETICALLY ANNOYING? "I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW".
She is the best! respect, one of the best human beings around,
Love you, Melissa! You are hilarious! Good to see you made it through this episode! 😂😂❤
Been quite a while since Sean murdered someone.
Man, she is hilarious without even trying 😂
In this show, you get to see the real person behind the artist and Melissa is as sweet and funny as she seems. A true star! 🥰
I love this woman
Sean every 20 seconds  👁️👄👁️ I know, I know 👁️👄👁️
*_Melissa_* , *you* *are* *a* *_fuc𖧱☄︎ng_* *_champ_*  getting through this ~ absolutely hilarious! I really had so much fun laughing, thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed!(as with all your work). You have such a bright light within you. Lol you may not be, but I am so very glad you made the -poor- decision to be on hot ones. Thank you for all the laughs!  P.s. you have the most beautiful green eyes!
She reacted strongly to the first wing, this is going to be a roller coaster.
PLAINFIELD LETS GOOOOOOOOO
If you're not putting ice in your milk what are you even doing?
Shoutout Joliet and Plainfield!
“As you try to breather in to live” just made me cackle for some reason
Sean (is always) but particularly in this video looking extra beautiful idk why 😍🥵 lol
I laughed out loud so many times. She is adorable!
There's something fun about watching the more rotund of us eating. Feels so natural. Like you're watching Einstein read a physics book.
Came for the hot sauce, stayed for Melissa. Genuinely funny
Once again Sean and his OCD tick for repeating everything.  "You're telling me!  You're telling me!"  "I'm right there with you.  I'm right there with you."
She’s so funny even out of character I love her 😂
Hey! Someone tweet Khaled and remind him what a total meow meow he was on this show.
Great interview with hilarious physical comedy, albeit perhaps not fully intended 😂
I agree with Melissa 100% about comedies. I love all types of movies and all types of movies have their place. Comedies are essential and bring people together. The movies that I tend to watch over and over again, are the comedies.
I feel bad she was part of that Disney train wreck .
Her after a couple hours “IT’S COMING OUTTA ME LIKE LAVA!”
Their humour blends well together, another really good one
“How’s your lawyer situation? I’m gonna FIND OUT” 😂😂
She is just adorable!!!  😂 Love her!!!
I keep thinking back to the episode when somebody brought peanut butter, and it seemed to work. Do the guests just not watch the show?
This was such a great episode to watch! @melissamccarthy you are a champ! 💪🏼🫶🏼
Good job, Melissa. Really entertaining!
Ah Melissa, my celebrity crush 😍🔥❤️
Melissa seems just as lovely and sharp as you'd expect!
Well, somehow Sean went the whole interview without inquiring about her role in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, but yeah, if you've never seen it, make it your business to do so. She should have won Best Actress for that.
That’s why the Stooges will never get old.
I love her, woman crush forever😍
Luv she’s actually eating the wings some of the men are trash these past few episodes
Were you guys affected by the writer's strike? Why is this coming out promoting her movie almost a month after it's been released? Long time viewer/subscriber, first time commenting.
I love Melissa McCarthy! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I JUST LOVE MELISSA MCCARTHY! 🥰🥰 I'm so happy you had her on your show she is one of the people I hope to meet one day!
I love Melissa going all in on Sean,
“Then, when you try to breathe in… to live… it gets worse!” ❤
I mean, if the guest says ,"hey this first one, wow I can feel some heat".  You might want to audible at that point.
Good actress bad movie
Possibly, the funniest Hot Ones ever.
<3 <3 <3
I respect her, because those weren’t little baby bites.
Oh no is Melissa a white woman who doesn’t season her food 😮 say it ain’t sooo😢😂😂jk
Awesome job Melissa! You make so many proud. Just goes to show you that humbleness will always beat arrogance (ahem, DJ “who cried, whined and quit” after a few wings… lol)
Our Grand Marshall at WeHo Pride! 👏👏👏
Did I miss an answer during the bomb question?
Top guest!
Ok I see how you do, Hot Ones. Every celebrity BUT Keanu Reeves.   I see you. 😠
Sean, the best spice mountain Sherpa anyone could ask for.
Curious…Who do the celebrities bring with them “usually”? From full posse, to just an assistant, to a partner/spouse/whatevs…what is common??
novocain
What a credit to what this show has become in that, even big name actors that don't like spice feel the need to go participate. You guys have become THE place to go to pitch your latest project. Congratulations!
She is just delightful !
I'm here for this!! So funny and witty thru dying a little bit!! Great job, Melissa‼️‼️
finally, excited to watch Melissa
God she is great. If ever I am in a disaster, I hope she is with me for it. She weathered the storm literally and figuratively.
😍
I'm going to keep testifying that Apollo is a special kind of evil hot sauce. I know Da Bomb has its reputation, but Apollo is indeed like licking the sun.
That tornado happened on my first or second day of 5th grade. I’m from a town just north of Plainfield and we were all crouched down in our hallway at school with the sirens going off. We didn’t get hit though. Very memorable day.
I love her so much, I was so excited for this video❤️❤️❤️
I doubted she would make it to the end based on the reaction of the first sauce. Mad respect to her for pushing through and finishing strong! Hilarious too!
Great episode!
The spicy shark sauce is dope. First time I have seen them use a sauce I know and own already.
One of the best episodes!! Thx 🙏🏻💯😂
Love Melissa....best guest ever!
YASSSSSS to Melissa McCarthy it's about time!!!
Melissa McCarthy not liking spice but also not taking super dainty bites! Ya know - Props!
needs neck lipo and a personal trainer
What a fukin LEGEND! MelissaMcCarthy is a Queen and we don’t deserve her
I just love Melissa ❤️...
Idk who your bread guy is but.. clutch. Hahha I cracked up!
I mean the casting for Ursula went well this time unlike .... well i like her as Ursula that was the thing i tried to say
The spice is not better than the ham 😂
She’s right. Laughing is more valuable than people acknowledge. If it wasn’t for humor, I sincerely wouldn’t want to be alive.
😍her
Let's watch her overact on wings now!, no thanks.
@18:00 when your face is melting, that is how you know it's working.
M Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold would be awesome on here!! Show off the new album Life Is But A Dream…
First time in a long time I was genuinely afraid for the guest.
Please get Mandy Moore
This is the first time i’ve ever commented on YouTube. I just wanna say, long live hot ones, long live Melissa McCarthy. Such a good mmhmm
Just Great!
For her not to like spicy, Bravo Melissa 👏👏👏
She's always fun
Where can I sign a petition to get Nardwar on the show?
test
Of all the people who deserve to suffer for The Little Mermaid, poor Melissa is the least of them.
I dont know. Sean is really cool and always perfect question but the worst acting to make them feel a little less bad.. it just ... not to fun to look at. Just be yourself all the time. They know you ate it milion times.
One of the best guests to date … legit couldn’t control my laughter once she ate Da Bomb!! 😂😂😂😂
You know what? We're already dead  💀
Bring in the spice king from YouTube!
He didn't ask her about Gilmore Girls
Who would love to see Melissa and Ben together on Hot Ones?
I’ve had this experience of not being able to control my body right before I walked down the aisle at my wedding. It was surreal.
Sean, you really should warn people that coughing just makes it worse.
Sean talks so fast when he’s feeling the heat
Finally someone brought some bread! Poor Melissa, she clearly suffered, but as always she made me laugh!
I love her so much.
One of the best ones!!! 😂
great episode!
I want to be famous JUST to be on this show
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This was epic! I’ve been watching for years and love dozens of guests who’ve been on. But this was so great! I was just thinking last night how much I’d love to see her on, and then I saw her face on here!
Ah can’t get away from tornado stories much in the Midwest
Another amazing Hot Ones! The spice took over the Q & A, but I could have watched an hour + of this interview
I love her so much! I feel guilty for laughing so hard!
Yayy!!
Respect to Melissa she's a legend 💪 i was kinda hoping she'll finish with a nice cuss but she's a lady 💞
I laughed more during this episode than any other 🙂
Sean, I don’t know if this has been asked in the past… but why haven’t comedy movies been really recognized at the Oscars? If it hasn’t been asked, plz ask the next comedian great that comes on ur show. Thanks !
I just love this woman so much!!! 🩷 I rewatch Bridesmaids multiple times a month because of her. She did one of my favorite comedic performances ever in that movie.
Presented by Diablo 4?! Jeez, this show is for real.
Sean has echo
I‘ve been watching this show for ages and because of Melissa I‘m asking myself for the first time how they prepare the wings. I‘m always astonished how all the celebrities handle everything above 50.000 Scoville.
I think that Melissa did quite well, laughing her way through the pain.
I love her yay!!! 💙
my ex got me to watch mike and molly, great show
Much respect.  She's awesome.
Really loved this episode.
I feel like DJ Khaled was the only guest that tried to sue Sean Evans and Hot ones because he couldn't handle the first few wings. That being said, I love this interview.
I have never laughed so much watching someone "suffer"! Melissa is AMAZING!!
Love her, she is awesome
Melissa is so intelligent and enjoyable with her work. Such an incredible actress that’s so relatable. Laughed out loud so much. Loved this.
0:36  Sean: Melissa Mccarthy, Welcome to the show 😊 Melissa: Thank you, See you tomorrow 😉  That gets me 🤣🤣
That tornado story was WILD. She and her friend were real lucky to get out of that unharmed.
"They're all terrible in their own different way" This is the best episode ever!!! <3 I love her!
Just picked up a bottle of the classic yesterday at my local grocery store it's delicious
She’s incredible! I loved her
Being zendaya on here now!!!!
What a trooper!! She was great! In fact….i the history of the show, i do believe every single lady that has ever come on, completed the gauntlet. ❤️🙌🏽
Loved it. Thanks Melissa.
One of the best ones
Amazing episode! Was worried for her after the first wing but she is a champ!!
when she pulled out the bread I died LOL
She mad boring, she only entertains when she is getting abused in movies
Bro.. you killed Mellissa McCarthy... haha
Melissa is very brave to finish when she thought even the first one was hot!
I wonder what it's like for Sean to have to lie to all the guests these days and pretend he's feeling literally anything at all.
The thing is, when you get the right people, they show the absolute best of themselves and it makes for the very best entertainment, let alone interviews. The further into the wings Melissa got, the more we see the best of her. And more of the person that has brought her characters to life. She's fantastic.
Lol rotfl😂
She said my threshold, and I'm talking like I've never eaten before. Within the first two😂
That was the best, most honest reaction to da bomb 😂
Ah, yes.
Maybe the best reaction to Da Bomb ever? Top ten for sure :))
I have nothing but love for Melissa. She's the best <3
She doesn't look much older than in her older movies, amazing!
Came to see if she was more likable in an earnest interview... nope.
Frankly, there’s no pathology in having a fear of tornadoes.
She’s so amazing! Always hilarious and gracious.
You ate more wings than some rappers and DJs.
She is amazingly comedic and calm all altogether. It's like subtle humor and mild manner.
Very nice to see Melissa again.
I love her ❤
Whippets and wings, hummm
I am calling it now, this interview will have 1 billion views.
I love her , she did her best to not go off lol.
I'm so glad to have seen M M on Hot Ones. I have gained enormous respect for her authenticity.
It's refreshing to see someone who has no tolerance for spice doing this. V relatable for me 😂
i laughed so much! thank you Melissa ❣you guys are a perfect combo😂
Love Melissa McCarthy!!! Been watching her since Gilmore Girls lol. Love most of her movies too ^_^ she was excellent on this show haha.
For somebody that was getting blown out so bad, she actually took real bites! lol
I've always liked her, she seems so genuine. Hopefully not falling for a Cosby. Love her "realness", she just stands out because her success in Hollywood is an unexpected, pleasant change from the norm.
I don't know if this is insensitive since her eyes are red and crying but Melissa's eyes are so pretty today
Yeah, that's how normal people react to Da Bomb :D She's hilarious, one of the best episodes. I'm guessing 15 min later it was the bathroom scene from the Bridesmaids
finally. real pain on this show
Antidote? A cooling chamber, that got progressive cooler. Mild anesthetics for the mouth. Running hot water and soap to keep the fingers clean after each wing.
BEST ONE EVER
Like Melissa, I have no tolerance at all for spicey foods. I can't believe how brave she was to do that. I would never have been able to do that.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
nobody wants to see this byatch
We havent seen anyone 🤮 or 💩 themselves in awhile Sean! Heck! Nobody has even quit before the end, in a long time! Lets step it up a notch!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🥵🤢🤮
She is so right about movies. We Al have been stuck in a loop of superhero’s and humorless movies for too long.
hands down, the best "da bomb" reaction alongside shaq! what a funny one!
Great job
16:22 If you don't like Melissa McCarthy this is either where than reverses or you really enjoy the suffering...I close the former.  Sweet suffering...GOOD JOB GIRL!
We never heard her response to the home design shows!! 😩
I would bring white vinegar, a little dab helps
What a Great Woman ❤
One of the finest eps ever.
this woman is a treasure
You could tell that Sean was feeling for her when he gave her a warning about how bad Da Bomb was going to be. She was really going through it. But she did it! I'm so proud.
I can imagine her integrating this experience into a comedy.
Invite MatPat from food theory as a guest!!!
I was so excited to see this one!
Sean how in the heck did you keep together while watching her gag😂😂
She was awesome in the little mermaid! She is what made the movie excellent! I didn’t really like the rest of the characters but I looooved Ursula
I love seeing Melissa bangin' Whippits during the show!!😂😂😂😂
Not a single Gilmore girls question? A travesty.
"oh Jesus, oh this is an application moment"
I love how sean tries to commiserate 😂
This is the best bday gift! Love Melissa ❤❤❤
Sometimes a forget blowing up your nose in public is bad manners in north america
She is a riot.  Definitely one of the funniest episodes.
❤❤❤
Sending Love to Sean and team! Hats off to you sir. It seems you've found a unique niche where you shine as a gentleman and scholar in your own special way! Love the show, the guests, the insightful conversation all on an unorthodox premise. Melissa, you are a gem! God Bless you all!
Who elsr can you get? Reach for the stars!!! Who hasnt done Hot Ones yet?? Sandra Bullock? Jennifer Lawrence? Ryan Reynolds? Chris Pine? Christina Ricci? or maybe Juliette Lewis???
My favorite movie that she was in, 2018 the Happytime murders is so underrated❤
“You gotta have lawyers around the clock.”😂😂😂
I have never laughed so hard with Hot Ones🤣🤣🤣
Immediately clicked on this one grrrrrrrr😊
What incident are they talking about with the lightning?
17:12 😂
This is one of my favorites now. She's so cool and funny at the same time. ❤️❤️❤️
We need a Hot Ones vs Nardwuar!
Ok! Now lets see you get Kat Dennings on Hot Ones!!!😮😮😮
Where are the Gilmour Girls questions??? Still a great interview!
I love her so much! She is the funny sweet auntie i never had 😅 she is so delightful
If you only saw the tears of joy in my eyes when I saw Melissa McCarthy in the thumbnail. This woman brings so much joy in her work and to see her on Hot Ones is a real treat. Thanks Sean and First We Feast!!!
God I loved her in "Identity Theft" ❤️❤️❤️
What a treasure.
I´ve waiting so long for a sequel for Spy. A totally underrated legendary comedy.
Best one in a really long time. She is the queen of comedy and seeing it just happening has made me extremely happy😊😊
I want to hear what she says after all is said and done, also I want to watch Mr. Falcone watch with her😂
America’s ANGEL! (& I love Melissa too!)
Imagine the reaper chicken from Dave’s Hot Chicken (tenders or slider) with the Apollo sauce…
Refreshing to see someone with negative, realistic reactions to this and be able to laugh about it. Her reactions are what most average peeps  would be I think. I know mine would be similar. Love her!!!!
What's up with the channel's background music? 😬
"We're already dead" 🤠
I knew at some point they are going to bring her thank you i always hoping that can happen and this brings flackbacks to bridesmaids❤😂😂😂
Sean is hands down the best interviewer of our time. Highly underrated.
Never touched on Gilmore Girls or Sean Spencer.
Love her so much!
I think she could pull off a misery remake as kathy Bates
I literally salivate when I watch this show. I LOVE HOT FOOD
"I make kind of bad choices." We're all aware of Ghostbusters, but forgive you anyway.
Wow! You are getting the A-LIST celebs now Sean!!!!
She gives off cool mom vibes
Ugh. How could anyone not LOVE this lady. ❤
Her green eyes are so beautiful! What a champ!
I have watched multiple episodes. I am truly a fan! I have seen guests bring rice, lemon, milk, yogurt, bread, etc…. But has anyone thought of bringing wet wipes to clean the hands from the spice🤔?!  🫶✌️
she is da drama queen. that sauce got her more then all the bad things she has said.. .
Loved this episode. Melissa is an awesome trooper❤
Along with the Gordon Ramsay episode, this one is an instant classic! Good job Melissa !
Ok first Sean is amazing at this second you were terrible in that Ghostbusters movie (that whole movie was so bad they had to make another to be fair). This was a pretty good show though. 🤔👌
Melissa McCarthy is such a lovable person.
BEST reaction to Da Bomb EVER!
she is so funny, it's so sad that her scripts are always that bad in her movies. I think letting her improv would be so much better.
Can't win 'em all when it comes to guests...
Bring any shoemer next please
Gonna be hard to top this one 😂
I wonder if anyone has thrown up on this show, and then they made Hot Ones pull the episode because they didn't want them literally puking their guts out on the internet...
We need Leslie Jones on this!!
Guys seriously, Tom Grossi! Make it happen! His 30-in-30 would benefit so much for the added exposure (while he already has plenty of that). All for a good cause and so on.  MAKE IT HAPPEN!
Is there a reason you don't just use a rectangular table ? The 2 circular tables is getting unusual
Wait....did Melissa bring a baguette? Im rolling!
That shirt Sean has on is very stylish.
🔥
After so many episodes of guests acting not that bothered by the heat, this was really refreshing and entertaining. This is what I think I would be doing!!
Great job Melissa!! Thanks for keeping the humour throughout your pain! 💕😂
The off-camera giggling had me in stitches.  Great episode.  And I agree with needing good, positive, hopeful comedies!
This was truly the best episode. Especially because she came on the show knowing she couldn’t take the heat, and yet she pushed through. The bread was the perfect touch😂
❤️❤️❤️
I can die happy now
She’s amazing as Ursula 🙌🏽🫧🐠🦀
Greatest Da Bomb reaction EVAR!
I loved seeing that she made it to the end!!!  What a wild ride.
2 Amazing people coming together to create such wonderful conversations, which we fortunately get to see. So grateful for this show! Melissa is my favourite guest for sure, such a wonderful human being! Thank you for giving us all such joy Hot Ones!
I love Melissa 😂😂😂
I stop to watch at 50000000000000th I know. Man it’s just annoying. Lololol😂
She’s so awesome. Great you had her on.
I have to find the sauces and try them
Sean Spicy from SNL is by far my most favorite Melissa McCarthy character.
I can’t get that food poisoning / bathroom sink scene out of my head when I know this is explosive on the stomach.
not even 5 minutes and im already almost moved to tears.
i love melissa
Gladagoppas 😂😂😂😂 i love her so much
One of the best episodes hands down.
Gonna be spicy😂
Love Melissa mccartney. She did such a good job
I LOVE HER 😭😭😭😭😭
Hey just a heads up.  I have a really high end sound system connected to my computer and the right channel was distorting something awful during the music after the initial intro.  It isn't my equipment I checked so there seems to be something quite wrong with your mix and it could adversely affect users.  You should look in to .
Sean Evans you are destroying aunty Melissa McCarthy on a sly. You \re a terror-first-we-feast agent. You deserve a triple dab on this one.
Anyone knows the brand of Seanˋs Shirt? Been looking for something like that
you know it's a good one when you can hear the crew laughing in the background. Melissa is gold
Crystal Lake is the best midwest town hands down.
Melissa McCarthy deserves every ounce of the success she is getting from The Little Mermaid! She is such a humble being, so emotive and affected by the world but still maintains such a collected chaos of self-control. Thoroughly enjoyed her. ❤
Crystal Lake....central, south or prairie ridge and did I beat you in soccer?
I think shes the best physical comedian  among women and has an arguement for one of the best in general. She's an absolute force on SNL
Im from plainfield, hometown hero right here.
Good to see some genuine reactions. Wish they showed a bit more after the Da Bomb each time, footage is always clipped but i can speak from experience, it takes a good while before you're ready to put anything else spicy in your mouth. The milk does nothing against it. And then just when you think youre over the worst of it, it finds its second wind and comes roaring back 😂
She’s the greatest 😂👏👏👏👏
God I love her. 😉
Huge respect for Melissa. Absolutely genius actress and master of comedic timing. Late wife loved her, so her amazing laugh would be a constant presence in the house.
She makes a beautiful Ursula
Best ... show ... ever !!! Soooo funny.
I’ve been begging for this one!!!!!! I’m so happy I freaking love her so much
Nothing bro, I would just sit there and tuff it out. Peace to you Shaun, and miss McCarthy, a fellow native from Chicago (900 N. Laramie )🤚🏿💪🏾👍🏿🙅🏾‍♂️ 26:08
She is just a magical person! Great episode!
Weird edit
Kangol sweetheart 😂
Melissa is exactly how I think I would be specially eating the bomb one but her reaction to it is by far the best reaction so far 😂😂😂 she did really good tho
I’d do anything for an ice mouth to kiss
she shouldn't be eating any food with the lard on her. somebody stop her
"God help me. Is this the one that you're like, 'you'll revert—you'll die immediately'?"  "You know what? We're already dead" *Laughs maniacally* - Me, every morning before I get out of bed
“I hate you so much!”  “I know. I get it.”   😂😂😂
God I love this woman !
Melissa McCarthy is such a trooper, and a great actress to boot.
This is the hardest I’ve laughed at one of these episodes in a while. Pure gold.
Her hiccup as the outro is truly peak gold production
LOLOL Yo I Cackled during this episode! Amazing! PLEASE get KELLY CLARKSON on this show!
she's so funny
She did so well and it went so bad for her at the same time. What a laugh 😂😂😂
Shaun kills me with his relief comments while the guests are going through excrutiating pain😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think this is my favourite episode
Love you Melissa!!!
spraybottle of milk feels so unhinged
I love her so much, I can’t stop laughing
You should have Trixie and Katya on this show!! It would be so fun!
Love her. Little Mermaid was a treat.
i was terrified that y'all had killed America's Treasure, Melissa McCarthy.
Poor Melissa, but oh my gosh that’s the best reaction to da bomb I’ve ever seen 😂
Melissa McCarthy is harder than Pusha-T confirmed.
I think this might have been the worst I've ever seen someone react to Da' Bomb lol
Say some point the wings transform her into Ursula haha
I can’t believe you got her Sean, I love that I was here from the beginning, I’ve told so many people about how awesome an interviewer you are, Melissa is so great, you’re great to Sean, love this show
"i'm not a singer" and then goes to literally sing "Poor Unfortunate Souls" FLAWLESSLY????
SHE....is such a saint.....truly a national treasure....her performance in Bridesmaids STILL kills me!  What a talent.....thanks for sharing!
Plainfield native!  Loved hearing those names!
try lemonade
DJ Khalid left after eating 1 wing
I love how you can hear the people in the studio constantly laughing. Melissa is such a delight. She’s a comedic genius.
She is the best guest ever!  The milk spray bottle, and threatening his legal team.... Tops!
First We Feast nearly killed Melissa McCarthy... 😳
i love her ❤
This is my favorite episode ever hands down literally crying laughing rn
I think I laughed more during this interview than any others 😂 Melissa is a gem!
I love her so much!!! Lol best episode yet!
If the whole lineup was actually there (why is da bomb missing???) I feel like id have no choice to get that, but being missing beyond insanity, is crazy beyond insanity.
Plainfield represent!
If this show had a Rotten Tomatoes score, it would be down roughly 25% now.
This one is by far my favorite Hot Ones episode!!
I can't believe she made it. Well done!
She's really likable! That's what's so great about this show, you get a more authentic look at these people than you ever otherwise would. God bless Hot Ones.
What a trooper. She did great!
This woman is the absolute worst, watching her suffer is great.
Never underestimate the gift of comedy x
This would be me - 10000% the most relatable reaction I’ve seen😂 I lost it when she pulled out the squirty cream and the bread out of nowhere😭
Long Live Melissa 🥰 the kindest most hilarious comedian
Just brilliant!!
17:39 😂😂😂😅 straight lit her up 🔥🔥🔥🖕😢🔥🔥🔥
Melissa  awesome  thank you for hot one's  you all are soooo great:)
So much braver than weird AL and goldblum.
I love Melissa but she has never made me laugh harder than now
I haven’t laughed harder. Lover her so much.
You should have Tia & Tamera on at the same time. It would be so funny to see how they both react to the wings since they seem to be psychically linked.
I love all of the off camera laughing. She just seems like such a lovely genuine person. Well done her for pushing through and taking such decent size bites!!
The interview nobody has been waiting for!
Mrs.McCarthy you make a good point about comedy, b/c if we can't laugh we can't see a future. The problem with the reality of what is happening today in The US, it's hard for us to laugh. 80+ Countries have dropped The US Petrol Dollar for oil trade/world reserve currency. Our inflation b/c of that is sky rocketing b/c the only thing that gives The Petrol Dollar any worth is when it's being used in The Oil Trade. The reason? Well countries are tired of The US Invading, supporting genocidal regimes/states, and being sanctioned. So mam, you are hilarious and I do want to see the movie were you played a role with Muppets, but the fact of the matter is, it's hard for people to close their eyes to the fact that The 1% of The US own 99% of the wealth and we 99% have been and are continually suffering under the slavery of this Plutocratic Oligarchy backed up by a Fascist State.
I adore this woman and love that she gets the crew to giggle.
Bring back the bomb
“Doo doodoop doopdoo…where’s the ranch?”
The bread!!! 😂😂
Now we need Zach Galifianakis on this show
This wasn't good. Love her though
that woman is nice. all the best
that tornado story is literally straight out of a movie! It gave me chills. Loved the animation too, such a cool visual!
DaBomb Beyond Insanity delivers yet again 🤣🤣🤣
After how many seasons of hosting this show..aren't you concerned about ulcers? I mean those sauces are pure acid. Thoughts?
This. Was. Amazing.  I laughed so hard. Thank you!
I don't know if the general public loves or hates her, but I think she's usually just fun to watch.  Her husband seems also like just a funny regular dude even though we don't often get to see him in extensive roles.
Her and Paris did good Sasha to
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
living for the Carbondale shout outs! Go Dawgs!
Is she talking about kanga coolers or is she pronouncing kangol wrong?
One of the best episodes so far.  Love her!
We need Obama on here
I love how Sean tried to save her from Da Bomb 😂
There are not enough words to express how much I love Melissa McCarthy, and after this incredible interview my respect and love for her increased a thousand times. Great episode! Fabulous work as always, my dear Sean!
She’s a diamond 💎
I feel its been a hot minute since we got someone hurting to their core here so many have just come in and been mostly good but the bomb defeats most. Good change a pace and man would have laughed if this turned into 2 episode her say hey thanks cya than a day later the rest of this drops.
Besides the fact that this is the worst Little Mermaid version ever! The wrong Little Mermaid for sure Melissa McCarthy rocked it though
I love it... Sean: I know..I know.. Melissa: 🖕  HAHAHAHAAH
Yeah, gonna sit this one out.
I love this woman so much. She literally has me in tears 😂
One of my favorite actresses. Loved every bit of this 💕
I love the way Sean pretended to be suffering with her, he is an excellent host!
Melissa is a delight! Bridesmaids, the heat, Tammy, spy, and identify thief are genuinely some of my all time favourite movies!
Sean gives of big vet trying to soothe a dog who he has to give a couple of shots to, to get better vibes.
Love Melissa McCarthy and Sean always has great in-depth interview questions. But can Sean stop saying EVERYTHING TWICE, Everything TWICE!
When she whipped out the loaf of bread, I lost it. 😆
Loved it, and at the same time was uncomfortable.
She had absolutely NO confidence, and we see why.
What a lovely guest Melissa was.
DJ Khaled has gotta be SO embarassed by now
She will always be Sookie St. James to me
Gosh I love this show and Melissa McCarthy so freaking much!!!!!
I love Melissa McCarthy. Bridesmaids is a go to for a laugh.
Impossible not to love her
I can't get over how great these interviews are. She and Sean were awesome!
Comedians are the best guests
there's a hidden valley ranch party in HER mouth!
Melissa you are so beautiful, but when you mix your personality and humor it makes you absolutely gorgeous and rare, I wish you a lifetime of happiness with your husband
Never seen someone struggle so much and still slay so hard. 😂 Also the "I'm kidding but am I really kidding" threat was 👌
You need to get Mike Rowe.
The way her voice and nasal passages betrayed her was crazy to watch. I was thinking "Sean, you broke her!" 😂
Da'Bomb makes everyone honest.
She is sooo wonderful! ❤
they probably have to sign a waiver---no way they shouldn't....asking about allergies, etc....
I love Melissa, she was funny and in pain at the same time. Love how she gives the finger with tears in her eyes. Kudos for even going thru with this Melissa.
Bridesmaids is one of my favorite movies! Great show!
👎thanks but no, thanks  This and the Brie Larson one are your only bumps.
McCarthy made that interview very funny. i was crying laughing by the end.
Yes, Melissa, we want to laugh with you!  Thank you!
Can we get some metal guys on here? Lorna shore, or Metallica, or something. I like the rap stuff and celebs, but where is the metal?
I feel like I’m in the Midwest lovefest❤❤❤❤❤❤
Top five guests I’d like to see on Hot Ones:  1. Lars Ulrich 2. CM Punk 3. Stewart Copeland 4. Dave Lombardo 5. Jimmy Butler
I've finally seen someone react to spice how I react to spice
Melissa always cracks me up and I enjoyed watching her struggle through these wings 😂.
Whoever boosted the gain so we could hear the crew giggling, YOU are the real MVP 😂
His reaction to that giant piece of bread in her mouth, the best 🤣🤣
She is a top 5 GOAT. End of story. Amazing person!
I know the sauces are sort of the gimmick that gets people's attention.  but Sean is really an incredible interviwer and host that really pulls the show together. I truly believe without him they would never get the incredible guest that they get to come one this show.
No Gilmore Girls questions made me sad.
My mom is literally a Melissa clone my mom even has her humor, watching this is like watching my mom and its hilarious.
Anna Torv and Melissa Fumero please!
I'm CACKLING at her Da Bomb reaction 😂😂😂😂
Seeing 2 Illinois goats makes me happy and I don’t know why
Kathleen Madigan
The bread is a great idea actually. It scrapes and absorbs the hot sauce to a degree.
Following her since her Mile and Molly days. She is such a great humble actress and person. Love she has her husband in each of her films. Such a funny wholesome person.
When I did the Paqui One Chip Challenge, I found Orange Juice Helped the most.
I didn't think it would be possible for me to love and adore Melissa McCarthy more, but wow, I do. She was so impressive during this episode. I didn't think she'd make it all the way to the end, especially when she thought the FIRST wing was hot, but she did!
Melissa McCarthy is one of the most lovely, entertaining, watchable  person. This was one of the best episodes of Hot Ones
I love when people struggle but fight through. Mad respect.  I love her so much!
Thought she lost weight...
I love her so much, she's so hilarious
Poor, unfortunate soul
she is such the perfect guest, she is amazing.. love the show shawn, makes me go get wings every episode..
I love her so much 😭
GAH I LOVE THIS WOMAN SO MUCH.  QUEEN 👑
She really handled that like a champ😂 I love her even more than I did before.
This looks like it really hurt, I felt bad for her.
Wow she got wrecked by that. So funny.
Oh man it's been a while since a hot one episode made me chuckle this much😅
I've been watching Gilmore Girls and I can't help but see Sookie
Sean: How are you around spicy food Melissa McCarthy? Melissa: I have no tolerance for spice, I don't eat spicy food. Sean: hou.hou.hou. this is going to be a good one
DaBomb wrecked her.
Her reaction to wing #1 had me worried! Glad she made it through it!
What a gem!! Seriously this was such a dope side to see of her! She’s always been down to earth but this was so so good! So representative of why the show is so amazing and creative! Love it!!
I have ADHD & find it impossible to watch any show but I will sit & watch Melissa every time. I love & respect her. ❤
She’s so real for this.
What a trooper hahaha
DaBomb did it's job 🤣🤣
Phenomenal guest, she was perfect for this show!
Beautiful Job Melissa! And Sean, I didn't clock you, but never heard I know and I'm With you more 😂😂😂😂😂
I love the little giggles in the background. She's hysterical
Last question was truly wonderful and so was the answer. Good episode!
Props for finishing. Made of funny and tough stuff.
She's a sweetheart. Kudos
She's savage sat there and did it
like instantly!!! Melissa is awesome!!!
Props for finishing. Made of funny and tough stuff.
Melissa is a comedy legend. Her role in Bridesmaids is amazing. I particularly love her when she is a guest in SNL, she is a genius.
I haven't had that many laughter tears in a long time! 😂
I wanna know if any actors have used Da Bomb for an emotional scene since doing the show
Sean is so casual and relaxed around Melissa McCarthy, just goes to show her vibes are the best
Sean, when you run out of celebrities to interview ( prob never ) you could pick a random fan from the comment line and do the show business as usual. Eghem  pick me ! Lol Great show as always thank you
I absolutely love Melissa Mccarthy!  She was phenomenal!!!
This is the best episode out of all them! She showed the tolerance and reaction, then still used her comedic self and pushed through it!!  She is the best ever!!
Sean Evans is on course to becomming an all time great interviewer.
Best episode!
SALUKIS!!
When she pulls out the bread and just desperately says, "NOBODY SAID IT WOULD HELP, BUT...I DON'T KNOW???" XD  She came prepared for all eventualities.
The giggles in the background are KILLING me. 🤣
I have a newfound respect for her now. She’s the first guest I’ve seen react as I think I would when eating spicy sauces like that. Always relatable
Melissa is such an icon! I love her she is so naturally funny. Glad to hear she is also from Illinois!❤️
One of the best interviews.
SEAN SPICY
I hope we get a sequel to Spy
Random comment for the YouTube algorithm.
Anybody else notice that this episode got WAY pushed because of how badly Little Mermaid did? The FWF team must have seen the preview of the movie and been like..."oooooh, we should probably just push that upload a little bit".
Plainfield represent!
I adore her so much 😭
She eating hot wings got her hotter then da bomb yeah I simp for her
Come on she's an actor shouldn't she be better at pretending pathetic
She should've been on forever ago!
one hour later,  " its coming out of me like lava!"
Can someone do the right thing and time stamp da bomb on every video, top comment. I have spoken
Melissa McCarthy is one of the most wholesome people there is,, she's funny she's graceful, and commendable she represents the Midwest to its fullest. I laughed I cried and I also felt her pain in this episode. Only on first we feast are moments like this possible. Love it
When the first was hot I knew this was going to be special lol
Melissa is the perfect actress to portray Irsula. She is beautiful, and funny, and talented, and all around amazing. Not to mention, she is way tougher than DJ Khaled! She's a boss. Loved it.
So good!!
How nice of you to have my best friend on your show. Get it BESTIE!!!
I hope she doesn't have a BRIDESMAIDS reenactment on the sink?!?!?!
Love the show, but I think they need to work on guest lighting. I've noticed that guest's makeup comes off as pretty cakey in these lights. Noticed the same thing with the JLD episode.
That was HYSTERICAL. I’m dying at the bomb 😂
I have always liked Melissa Mccarthy. I feel like she is one of few real actresses in hollywood. Like she is an A list actress that i dont even want to put on A list weirdly because she has always seemed so personal and honest.
Thanks melissa!!  Still love ya!
Amazing episode.  An instant classic.
Oh Melissa was absolutely delightful! So many of the recent guests have come prepared and not wanted to show a kink in their armor lol  Thank you Melissa!
I'm just here to beg for a Spy sequel
The episode I never knew I wanted and needed to see!!  I love her!!!
She did great ❤
I love when the guest is so out of it that the "tell us what you have going on with your life" gets an actual "my life" answer without promoting the thing they are here to promote
One of the best episodes! 👍🏼 Poor Melissa but she made laugh so much 😂  She's awesome! 👏🏼🔥❤️
Only time, citrus, and will, will defeat the spicy Captain Sayson.
loved it so much shes awesome
Cant wait to see Keanu Reeves here ❤❤❤❤
As someone whose tolerance for anything spicy is completely nonexistent, Melissa’s reaction is prolly close to how worse I am with spicy food. I couldn’t believe I could love Melissa more than I already do. She’s just a treat to watch.
We need Billy Gardell on here now❗
That is the most visceral response to Da Bomb that I've ever seen. She looked traumatized.
Lemonade!
What a lovely loveable funny lady. Been watching her since Gilmore girls
I love her!!❤
I have a love/hate relationship with Melissa McCarthy's movie roles.
I am Samuel and i love U sooo much..   U r an amazing soul.   U r the best
I grew up watching Gilmore girls and her character was such a good role model for me. I’m glad she’s gone past that role and into something more. I wish she would talk about it more, but I also get it too. Just glad she’s still doing well.
The unfortunate thing is that there are even hotter versions of the bomb. There is no flavor....just hot burning A$$. 😥
her flipping him off was oddly adorable 😂😂
Ah, she's amazing!
It honestly makes me laugh how robotic Sean sound at this point when setting up "Explain that Gram". It's like when you have to follow scripts at a call center job
how does this have almost 20% dislikes?
I AM SCREEAAAMMMING IN EXCITEMENT! Perfect guest!! Still requesting Ryan Reynolds after a year though!
Who can hate this woman? I love her
Stop with the 2 tables already!!!!
This show is bull's eyes
Best episode in a minute. Melissa is so so awesome, amazing reactions
never in my life did i think my hometown would get mentioned on a talk show
One of the best episodes ever. So fun and funny.
Melissa McCarthy: *reaches for Da Bomb*  Me: You poor, unfortunate soul…  ~_~
Such a beautiful and wonderfilled person! Love you Melissa
This has to be one of the best epsidoes to date!
i like this one....melissa seems genuinly down to earth :)
Me in tears watching Melissa go through Da Bomb and questioning her life choices 😂😂😂 I’ve been there girl brings back the sting all over again 😂❤
Her and Kevin Nealon would be an amazing duo 10:00
OH my god, this is the funniest episode yet. Melissa McCarthy is amazing.
Sean is from CRYSTAL LAKE?? It is official then - he is the Jason of Hot Sauce
I gotta say as much as I'm not a fan of Melissa McCarthy, this was a pretty good episode where Sean was very natural and appeared equal. Very nice!
She suffered but what a good sport. I saw her in the series "Mike & Molly" and loved it.
She TRUELY is the QUEEN OF EVERYTHING!  Such a good soul.
So sad there were no Gilmore girls questions 😭😭
When she flipped him the bird.   lol,  her face was priceless. 😂😂
Not the bread!!!! 😂😂
Da Bomb Slaying guests as usual
Way to go Melissa.  😎😎👍👍 You did better than shaq
Please can you get the Always Sunny in Philadelphia guys on please please please
Joliet acknowledgment 🔥
One of the funniest Hot Ones episodes of ALL TIME
One of my fave guests on here! She is awesome.
17:48 the spontaneous cut to her eating bread😂
Not a single mention of Gilmore Girls? Shame! A lot of love for Sookie!
I'd sign her cast, it'd say, "F*ck you for wearing the track suit!". 😉
Love her and love this show! Great combo. Continued great work everyone!!
Great episode!  If the guest doesn't go through some pain it's not as entertaining.  Also I love Melissa.
"you try to breathe in to live and it gets worse." 😂
melissa went full🦉each time she had a wing🤣
I do hope Melissa doesn't experience the same bathroom situation that she acted in Bridesmaid in the aftermath of doing hot ones
Melissa McCarthy is a baddie. Full stop.
She's soo overrated it's unbelievable.
She needs that big bottle of ranch from that Hidden Valley Ranch SNL sketch.
I died when she brought out the loaf of bread 😂
Im excited for this movie😊
I absolutely love her. She is genuinely amazing!
I love her, she is the best ❤❤❤
I am sorry I am late but I am here, Love Melissa 😍
They aired this late af if this was supposed to come out before Little Mermaid😂
Sean Evans should bring Halle Bailey on the show
Funny !!!
Long shot, but I’d like to see one of the MST3K (now Rifftrax) guys on here.
The more people that do this show the sadder DJ Khaleds performance is
Guest Suggestion: Josh Homme, singer for Queens of the Stone Age.  Literally the last man standing in rock n' roll.
i actually like her! she s real
Melissa is the best!!
I’ve never felt protective for any suffering guest before but with Melissa the protectiveness kicked in. 😅
Remember how we said capsaicin is an alkaline molecule? Balancing it with an acid can help neutralize the molecule's activity. This means drinking or eating something acidic — such as lemonade, limeade, orange juice or a tomato-based food item or drink — may also help cool your mouth down.
One of the funniest episodes
I can't stress how great of an interviewer he is!! The way he mirrors his guests to help make them feel more at ease in the suffering is amazing
love this series...but i also gotta say...i freakin have the hots for sean. :*
Hooray for getting Melissa!
The heat hits my glottagoppis pretty hard too. 🤣
No antidote is the best antidote. The pain passes quicker if you just ride it out. Play it as the mental strength exercise it is designed for and ride that hot pepper buzz until it bucks you!
Didn’t know she was in team America 13:07 😂
This is easily the greatest hot ones episode EVER . (Ps it hasn’t even started it I’m still watching the second ad)
Careful. She might go off on how Hot One’s doesn’t have a female host or some other nonsense.
Melissa McCarthy is such a treasure
The Finger says it all !!😂🤣😆👍💯🔥
She is thee most beautiful woman that has ever been on Hot Ones. ❤😍 I Don't think I'll ever get over how hot she is.
Why are these being released after their movie has been released??
The guests just keep getting better and better.  So happy to see Melissa on the show.
Go turkey wings. Now Renaissance now a turkey leg. Wenches
I would 100% react like Melissa!! FINALLY A CELEBRITY THAT I CAN RELATE TO WITH THIS SHOW
Go Melissa always a big fan of your work . AWESOME Job tackling the wings
I think that was my favorite episode in quite a while. Incredible performance by Melissa!
Hands down the best episode ever. So real and entertaining. Plus I totally agree about the darkness and despair that is so prevalent in today's entertainment. We need way more love and happy thoughts.  😅
I LOVE this woman. Such a great episode.
That Da' Bomb sauce is no joke. I had some couldn't quit hiccuping for an hour
my favorite da bomb reaction of all time
Hack
after the bomb she looked like a puppy that just got a spanking and was so sad and mad.... Awesome.
I love spice mine comes form my Spanish background 💁‍♂️
I love her, even under torture she's funny and lovely ❤❤❤❤
The happytime murders is one of my favorite movies she has done. Very underrated in my opinion.
She seems so genuine, love her
My Girl 🤣
Melissa McCarthy, you are a national and global treasure!!
are the 15% thumbs down because people don't like that little mermaid changed up a little? That's insane.
This was legit one of the funniest Hot Ones episodes in a while.
I just love her. She seems so relatable and genuine and just an all-around good person. I’ve never heard any actor that she’s worked with give a negative comment about her.
“I know, its bad, I’m right here with you”  “I hate you”  “I know, I understand it’s fine”
The whipcream gas inhale made me lol!
This will be the first one I watch again!
If you try to breathe in to live, it gets worse 😂
Nitrogen
Keep honey on hand it helps the best
Love this lady
I didnt know that Melissa McCarthy is from Southern Illinois?!? Im a native St. Louisan. I'm a fan of her comedy 💯💯💯💯
ok, that whipped cream.... so smart!!! Melissa is awesome!
Cool whip
There must be like, 1000 bottles of the last dab with 1 tablespoon missing from it...what happens to the left overs?
Melissa mccarthey being believable now i've seen everything
I laughed as soon as I saw Melissa on the thumbnail. 😂
She will always be Suki to me
The suddenly serious “😐 ok but to be real, this is the hottest sauce in the world” killed me
poor her 😂😂😂❤❤❤
QUEEEEEEEEEEN
She is an amazing storyteller.  She has an anecdote for everything.
I was concerned when she thought the first wing was a bit hot, but Melissa pushed through to the end.  This show does break down the walls and Melissa showed herself to be a delight.  Much respect.
I laughed so hard. Awesome interview.
The spray bottle 😂
I have more respect for someone gutting through difficulty like this, than for someone who seems blase and unaffected.
Melissa is the female John Wick.  Melissa is a woman of focus, commitment, sheer will...  she actually finished all the wings even though she stumbled on the first one.
Love her accidentally doing a whip it.
Melissa McCarthy is just a national treasure. She handled the wings like a champ, even bringing her spray bottled milk and loaf of bread. 😂 I love her!! 💜
Greatest hot ones of all time.
Poor thing, she really struggled but tbh I missed seeing someone having a natural reaction to the spice. It's been a while since we had a guest really struggled throughout the gauntlet. Thank you Melissa 😊😊
I was worried she was gonna choke the whole time
I saw her face. SCREAMED, “YES!”  She is a true gem!
Melissa McCarthy is awesome. Even just the movie "Spy" is a sign that she's great. She was great in Gilmore Girls too, obviously.
100% the episode I laughed the most on.  Love her so much ❤
Melissa was terrific!  She comes across as playful, funny, yet deep thinking and real - the kind of person any sane individual would love to have as their neighbor.  She would bring credibility to anything she would associate herself with.
Scared my coworkers in the break room absolutely CACKLING at this interview. 10/10
How much (in grams or drops) of Da Bomb is on the wings?
This is what this show is all about textbook! My favorite female guest of all time! She is hilarious!
The hot ones is becoming like a right of passage for celebrities now. I love it
She is juat so awesome. Generally funny and makes the room warm. Congratulations for making it and I hope you have a good life girl
Not my fav actress. Put to the test😜🤯
She is one of my favorite humans
Too bad no one will see this movie
You should have food theory on the show.
why so many dislikes?
I died while she was dieing from the The Bomb! 😂
SPICY SHARK!!!!
We need to see more comedians on here.
Sean is not kidding about that Plainfield tornado it was a cat 5 that came out of nowhere.
I really should feel bad laughing so hard at someone else's pain, but I don't.  😃
I would drop the mic and end the show!  She is incredible!
Bottom of the celeb barrel now
11:35 – 13:45 🔥  Not the spicy/hot fire but the like— cool fire
Melissa McCarthy is fun to watch. In movies she can be too Melissa McCarthy with her characters, but I love seeing her as herself being herself. If that makes sense. I just love seeing the real Melissa McCarthy more than her as characters. But she was great as Ursula.
Does Sean get paid double for repeating everything twice?
There's a reason I call Da Bomb The Wall. All you need is her reaction to know why.
I love Melissa so much!!!! Like true love, but not stalker-ish!!!!
I love this woman so much! She’s always a breath of fresh air 🤍
So good. I love her so much ❤ and of course Sean
Love love love this episode 😂
How can you not absolutely LOVE and RESPECT the questions he asks and how he conducts these conversations!  🙏✌️
Great episode! ❤
the face of suffering ;)
Her throat noise at the end xD
There can't be that many bad choices with a net worth of $90 million.
This is probably my favorite episode. Didn't think I could love Melissa more!
Have on MatPat!! For food theory
She has such an eloquent way to express herself
its insane how much plainfield has grown
She is looking great, I'm happy for her. She definitely eats healthier than I do
All time classic episode! Melissa was absolutely amazing and brave, probably my favorite of the season.
GOAT guest.. I laughed the whole time. She looks like she'd be a blast to hang out with in general. Mad respect.
Her face says help me on literally every wing 😂😂
Sharon Horgan please!❤
I’m crying laughing 😂
Melissa is an icon and a national treasure.
" fun like breaking your leg "  Best line from hot ones!
Did Melissa also brought a fresh pair of jeans? 😂😂😂
I've never feel so bad....
Best one in awhile
Please put rupaul on here
Melissa Mccarthy is hilarious
She is an ICON
Two problems. No mention of Mike and Molly and her husband didn't make an appearance
Another Fun One!
Surprised they did have a bottle of Hidden Valley there for her.
YES!
I clicked just to watch the torture😂😂😂 her movies and TV shows are terrible
Melissa McCarthy is one of my most favorite humans on the planet.
Man I love her. She is awesome and funny. I wish my girlfriend had her sense of humor.
She was one of the greatest guests you’ve ever had!!!  ❤️💫❤️
When will we get to know the scoville of the last dab? 🤔😉🙂
It’s nice to see someone react the same way I would lol
She’s probably one of the funniest women out there
Might be a top 5 episode. Top 10 definitely. She killed it!
Ok so I remember I use to watch those “inside the actor studio” with that older guy with glasses and dark hair. They were really long interviews and seeing these actors and learning about them. Sean’s interviews are this way. I was excited Melisa was on because I knew I was gonna learn cool things about her as a human and it’s only because of the host and his great staff.
I love how da bomb makes everyone human lol
"Well now everyone gets to sign my cast."  Too funny!! She is so quick witted.
Melissa did a great job. I thought she was gonna quit by the 3rd or 4th but she pushed on thru 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Take that DJ Khaled
I did feel bad for laughing at her undeniably excruciating discomfort...but Jesus Christ, that was funny!!!
Spray Milk is craaazy.... I absolutely love Melissa!
Melissa McCarthy is my absolute favourite actor ever!! Love her so much and she is the one who makes me smile on a really bad day
XD
Can u interview TOM MCDONALD?
Definitely, one of my favorite episodes!!
This is officially a favorite episode of the season. Halle Next
You need to Keanu Reeves on there
I love Melissa McCarthy!!! Her comedic heart is priceless!
Top 5 Da Bomb reactions, I really felt for ya Melissa!
Great episode
finally a relatable guest who thinks the first ones are spicy😭
I love her sooo much... She can do anything and rock your world. Love miss McCarthy.( The Netherlands)
Sean acting like he still has taste buds makes him the best actor that's ever gone through Hot Ones.
Melissa taking down Da Bomb had me laughing harder than I've ever laughed on your show! Absolutely the best!!!
Love her but she needs to fire her makeup artist. Her face is a different colour from her neck.
Definitely one of the more memorable Da Bomb reactions.
Come on, please, invite JACK CHAMPION!!!!!!! people, please like my comment
Cucumber works perfect for helping get rid of the spicy taste
Melissa McCarthy is a national treasure. 😂
Great episode give Melissa some props 😂🎉
From flip off to baguette, some of the best Hot Ones ever. Love this lady.
At least she finished
Genuine voluntary suffering is hilarious 😂
If Melissa was queen and Chris Farley was king,  What a wonderful world it would be.  🙂👍👍
I would put a vanilla milk shake in a spray bottle..
The "cross pollenating" line needs to be a staple in Sean's repertoire from now on: "Be careful not to cross pollinate around your face."  This was a great interview because great stories were told through obvious pain that many of us have experienced.
Cutting to Melissa with her piece of bread 😂😂😂 I CANT!!!  Sean’s laugh as soon as he saw it says it all 😂
i love this woman
Too bad the new little mermaid is just trash
😂😂😂😂
I didn't think it was possible to love her more than i already did!  She is my absolute favorite lady!
Congratulations queen
Anything Melissa is in, I click🤍
Where’s the GILMORE GIRLS QUESTIONS!? I feel cheated 😭
I love her and loved this ep!!!
I'm excited for this. The movie
i was crying laughing. LOL. I love her!!
I've never clicked on a Hot Ones video so fast!
Yes milk is better with ice 😂😂😂😂😂
Funny and beautiful not to mention she took on the wings!!
I love my mom, I really do. Mom, I love you.  ..*but* I would truly not ever for even a jiffy complain if Melissa were to Honorarily adopt me as one of her own. Can never have enough motherly figures. uhm, that is all I wanted to  say, oh! and keep up the amazing work, FWF team, and thanks for sponsoring Diablo IV o.O Lilith lookin as spicy as the last dab, uh h k
The way she pulls out different heat extinguishers just gets me
Another great episode!
Mchenry county - Holler
Since I am a long time subscriber to the hot sauce box now, but have tasted NONE, and my spice level is 0, I find watching now like seeing familiar little friends tormenting celebrities
My girl is fecked!!😂
And once again everyone is better than DJ Khaled.  🤣
What antidote would you bring if you were a guest on Hot Ones?
Flawless
😂😂😂😂😂
Thats funny D4 is on my second monitor while I watch this episode.
This is one of the best hot ones
I love her entourage laughing at her in the background.
I felt terrible leading up to Da Bomb lol smh.
One of the funniest shows. She's hilarious, quick-witted, and so natural. Love her and love this show.
Probably one of the best "Da Bomb" reactions by far. At least top 5.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just love when the video is promoting a movie premiere, 3 weeks after the movie already premiered. 😅  👁️♥️🔥1️⃣
Suki !!!!
The first milk with ice, ladies and gents, melissa made history.
Love her
shoutout to ILLINOIS peeps (moved to FL but still showing love) :D
I bet Melissa McCarthy looks great in shorts. Cellulite and all. Lord knows I love me a thick woman
She's absolutely lovely. What a great guest!
“If you try to breathe in, to live.” 😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Let’s get Josh homme from queens of the Stone Age on here!!! That would be dope
This has to be one of the funniest episodes ever 🤣
I always feel that Melissa McCarthy is putting on a act even in interviews , until Now, we finally got to meet her on Hot Ones !!!!!!   This was fantastic .
😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
I accidentally ate something too hot. Milk didn’t work and while grasping at straws, praying to my lord capsaicin, I found strawberries. I swear it changed everything. I wish they would try this on their show. Even strawberry milk.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have NEVER seen someone so miserable in such a delightful way. Respect!
DJ Khaled needs to take notes! This was a great episode
😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was easily the funniest thing anyone has ever said on hot ones “what’s your legal situation?” as a threat.
One of the best episode
I loved Melissa in this episode and how genuine and sincere she is as a person. I love everything about this episode and you can feel how honest and true she is. Having conquered the "wings of death", she has earned all the respect in the world! Props to you Melissa McCarthy YOU ARE AN AMAZING human being and we truly love your work ! <3
Judging by the place and the age of Sean, I'm going to assume that the Tornado in this story is the 1990 Plainfield Tornado. It was an F5 tornado and the only one to have ever hit the Chicago Metro area. It killed 29 people and injured 353 more! I've never heard of this disaster until this interview. What a crazy scary thing to have lived through.
Melissa was bombed by the Da Bomb😄
Yes sean and melissa repping Illinois
I'm glad melissa was in hot ones 💪💯❤️
I have a newfound respect for her now. I'm also dying that she basically did a whip it on camera
Da Bomb is just like wrecking house
“ someone said it helped .. I don’t know” 😂
Melissa is the best. Took it like a champ. One of the funniest woman on the planet 🌎
What an amazing guest. I love Melissa, never thought she'd be a guest but look at her! Taking on the wings❤
Great episode!!
Keep fighting Melissa!  ❤❤❤ Comedies are my all time favorite classic movies!  Comedies are the best I shouldn’t have to explain why
I love to see the different things the guests brings with them to try and beat the heat. Spray milk is right up there with the best of them👍 Sunny D actually works for me🤷‍♀🤷‍♂️
What a trooper she is!
She is one of my favorite people... <3
That was great! Love Melissa! 😂😅😂😅
So she brought whipped cream to deal with it? That's an interesting antidote I can't remember if Matpat tried it
She is so true!
Loved this! So funny and heart-felt. This could have been a final it was so good.
That was hilarious. Laughed so hard I had tears😂. I think that is my favorite one!
Have never been a fan of hers. Just her role choices definitely werent targeting me.  Nothing really wrong with that.  Not everyone is for everyone. But i gotta admit i gained a bit of respect for her finishing the wing lineup.
Comedies are important, go see The Machine.
Melissa: OH MY GOD OH MY GOD literally fighting for her life   Sean: I’m right here with you I’m right here with you just chillin 😂😂😂😂😂
She is genuinely so personable and hilarious— love her!
DA BOMB EVOLUTION?!?! I will NEVER try that out. On another note, Absolutely love Melissa McCarthy
She actually did good! 👍
Actor or actress?
The day after is worse
Melissa has my threshold.  I bought #1 (the chili maple one) at Walmart and while I tasted the sweetness, my lips tingled from the heat and I wasn't interested in eating more.
I haven’t laughed this much with a hot ones episode in a while. This was so so good, Melissa is so funny!
As another fellow Illinois resident, it warms my heart to see Melissa embracing the dairy with reckless abandon; it’s the Midwest way.
She was in the movie GO!!! She had a small but very remembered role!! It's her laugh 😂😂. The movie SPY is one of the funniest movies of all time 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. The unusual combo of curse words is amazing!!!
Sean made Melissa McCarthy genuinely laugh @21:54 !! I LOVED that! One of the best guests, I'd say. I felt so at home with her
melissa is the first guest ive seen react as i think i would when eating spicy sauces like that. always so relatable. love her to bits
SUPER 🤣🤣🥳🥳
Milk on ice is delicious
MOST PURE REACTIOPNS EVER! Love Melissa as an actress , but even more because of her comedic timing even in the face of pain.
Melissa: interestingly the small of my back got hot Me: don't you hate it when that happens it's just an overall feeling of discomfort while going through spicy food
Lol the spray bottle of milk is incredible
Thanks Sean, LOOVVE Melissa! Now call Ben, he deserves input!
Bravo Melissa!!!👏👏👏
How does she still get work?   She's terrible
She’s brave for going through it regardless
Da bomb just destroyed her... But she a gem
Never been genuinely concerned for a guest's well being before haha
Did better then DJ Khalid
Probably sour cream or yogurt.
Love Melissa McCarthy she is such an awesome actress.
Melissa💙
That's actually really smart having like a spray bottle of milk cuz it gets more surface area to cool off the spice and it coats the mouth better
Great episode! Mellisa is so beautiful and talented!
I love that Sean only really breaks when they do. If the guest is being stoic and pushing through, so will he.
Isnt she the best. I love her
Joliet's very own. You love to see it
She's the Bomb beyond insanity.  Have loved her for almost forever....im 20+ years older. Truly one of the funniest people ever.😊
She's the greatest! This made me so happy
She’s the worst
HAHAHAH she had the BEST reaction to da bomb out of every single episode
I see Melissa McCarthy, I click
Yo that's crazy anecdote about tornadoes from her completely obliterated everything  including partially your friend's house. I don't know how I would feel in that situation. I'd be going through a mixture of feelings
Is the only way to take DaBomb off the line up to get sued?  Go for it Melissa!
Coolbeens
Melissa is so brave for going all the way, that’s crazy!!!
Melissa Mcarthy was made for this show!
When that second wing hit like that I was praying for this woman
watching sookie st. james eating hot wings is a dream come true
she's someone a feel unhappy people just like to hate...
It's been a good long while since any of the guests bailed. I don't know if that's because of a change in the sauces, or if the guests are more conscious now of what they're getting into, but whatever the case, it's actually nice to see.
Melissa and Sean are both American sweethearts. I love his questions which are some of the most interesting and engaging that I’ve ever seen in any interview. And I will always love her for _Bridesmaids_ and _Spy_. Really enjoyed the crew laughing in the background here.
I’m pretty sure she identifies as female.  Therefore she is not an actor, she is an actress.
Mrs. Melissa u are my favorite love u queen
A lovely warm charcuterie board 😂
im a huge fan of little mermaid I was little when the cartoon came out and Melissa you nailed Ursula!!!! i loved it! when i was really little my grandparents would let me sit in the front seat on the arm rests and pull down the visor w the mirror and every morning would listen to me tell them the story of the little mermaid. i cried in the theater watching Melissa sing, i cant even explain how happy it made me!!!!
Hasn't done a single good thing since GG
If you want to see how it’s gonna be for her in 8 hours, watch that one scene from Bridesmaids
I love her 😅❤
Her analogies are hilarious!
She said when you breathe in to live 😅
“What’s your legal situation” had me cackling 😂😂😂 the “honestly, I think exposed” was too funny 😂😂
Poor unfortunate soul
Great job Mellisa you did great w them hot sauces!
She had all her Gordon Ramsay tricks! Funny stuff!
Ghost busters really wasn't her best. She's really good.
Nah
I wish Sean asked her about Gilmore Girls.
What a funny person. I never realized.
After this she is definitely gonna recreate the bridesmaids bathroom scene.
At 20m17secs we finally find out the truth that Saturday night live had it right on point!!! They give their guest room temperature milk 🥛😮😂😮😮😂😮😂😮😮😮😮😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😂😮😂😮🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨 "I know that now you're bald b****" - Maya Rudolph acting as Beyonce 😭 Seriously no lie this is BS that they give some of these guests fake sauce so they don't have what Melissa McCarthy's happening right now 100% reaction 🤬🫨🤬🫨🌹🫨🤬🫨
Antidote -thai iced coffee
I'd wear pajamas to my last meal as well. Godspeed Melissa McCarthy 🐔🔥
Her tornado story is actually crazy. To think we may not have been blessed with this beautiful talent!!
Sean I can’t believe you lived so close to me .. I grew up in barrington and  loved going to crystal lake for Julianna’s frozen custard
Did Melissa McCarthy just do a whippit on Hot Ones?
Not good with spice but a good guest nevertheless
Truly amazing episode
I couldn’t love her more. She’s just a treasure. 💕
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sean is looking jacked! Melissa is fantastic, great guest and comedian!
why this getting dislike bombed? this isnt amy schumer
She’s so hilarious!! She was incredible in Spy, I still watch it regularly. & kudos to her for making it all the way through! I was worried since the first wing was spicy to her which I don’t think I’ve seen before lol.
She looked like she was gonna cry before she ever even tried anything lol
What? Melissa?! Aweosme
Melissa is the goat! Im so happy she came on hot ones.
Her tornado story is actually crazy. To think we may not have been blessed with this beautiful talent!!
Why do Americans call the ground floor the first floor?  1 upstairs 0 Ground -1 basement
awesome episode
She really seems like one of the most naturally likable people
every time I see someone struggle with the wings but persevere, I remember dj khaled and his epic failure 😂
One the best episod, for me. So funny and Melissa seems so authentic. Straight to the point and natural. I love her :)
Melissa is a beautiful woman ❤
She’s frickin hilarious
Melissa McCarthy is 100% fun.
So like. Why do people hate her? She's just a normal lady, what did she do?
If you put ice busts of the celebrities "crush" that they could make out with when things got too hot, I think that could add an interesting dynamic to the show. Melissa seemed primed to make out with an ice bust.
Pickle juice.
She was so prepared with her redi whip and bread, yet so so unprepared
"You have the shitties job ever"😂😂😂😂
We love you Melissa! Sean never warns his guests about da bomb he must have a ton of respect for you as well.
Watching this woman suffer brings me joy
I clicked on this so fast and pushed like right away bc I LOVE HER 😍
Melissa McCarthy flipping off Sean threw tears is gold.
she is the freakin best man! one of my fav episodes in a while! I love Spy. I think that movie is super underrated
Ursula hurts a lot.
I feel like this show should make a collab with waterproof mascara and lipstick companies for proof they last, coz it's a test EVERY SINGLE TIME 😆
Good thing this didn't end like that scene in Bridesmaids.
the best reaction to the bomb hahah😂😂
Shevis such a nice person!! naturally funny! She's great!!!
that bread catch was CRISPY!!!
Melissa McCarthy is such a wonderful human being. Hearing her be herself is always gold ☺️
The Plainfield tornado story hit me hard as a 38 yr old Will County native.
She is really funny! It’s nice to see the real person inside when watching these.  As for the the new Little Mermaid movie; Hollywood obviously has a dark side. I believe the devil is real (as a Christian), satan is the head of the movie industry and Disney. As I watched the movie, I couldn’t help but see how much more that dark side comes through. And most of all of disneys movies that come out, are always about magic powers, as if it is real. It leads people away from God and Jesus in my opinion, especially young people who it clearly targets.  Times are changing and it’s only getting worse.
Another one for the books baby she is amazing I love her she is very genuine thank you for this
Great episode.  I agree with Melissa that we need more comedies in our lives.
I love Melissa’s Mary Poppins bag of spice nullifiers lol
I CLICKED SO FAST
I literally gasped when I saw her. Yay!!!
Love Melissa!   You should consider "One Drop Pepper Sauce" from Barbados🇧🇧
For someone who found the 1st wing already spicy many many applause for her making it so bravely till the end of the lineup. 👏👏👏👏👏👈👈
She is doing well.  :-) Keep trucking.  :-) Nice work. :-) Funny and real. :-)
Love her earrings!  Sea themed
I really really love this women. She is amazing ❤ Funny, genuine, talent and heart. What a combo.  PS: Sean, 👏 ✌️ 👏
Hollywood has stopped trying to make people laugh years ago.... it's gone completely flat.
The new Little Mermaid was so bad IMBD had to change how they work out ratings so it wasn't so low
I was asking for her for a loooong time 🤣 almost spammed every video
L guest
Anyone made the spicy shart joke yet?
Ah, that's really sweet that you got Michael Che's stepmom on the show!  She's a sweetheart, for real \m/,
Just 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Such a great one!  You can tell when your guests want, and are enjoying being on the show. Kudos to Melissa McCarthy for being such a great sport!
He said Joliet and it blew my mind lol, I'm from rock island originally!!
Melissa is so gorgeous, talented, hilarious, cute and lovable. I just wanna hug her. Her SNL interpretation of Sean Spicer is comedy gold 😂❤
👏👏👏
Love Melissa!!!!!
I grew up in McHenry, which is a town over from Crystal Lake! Probably caught Shawn a few times growing up in the area at the same time.
🔥🔥🔥
You should do a Paqui one chip challenge with ten of your former guests, it would be Hilarious 🥵🔥🔥🔥
You know who is really eating da bomb hot sauce and who is not on this show and Melissa McCarthy is one-hundred-percent reacting to da bomb hot sauce!!!!!!!  At minute 18 flips off Shawn and the tears and just the snot  building up in her nose with her mouth on fire and you can obviously see all of it is one-hundred-percent reaction and I know that some of these actors in the past or guests have made them put a different sauce in there so they wouldn't be doing what Melissa McCarthy is right now which is one-hundred-percent OG reaction I love her so much❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Melissa McCarthy 🔥🔥🤤
Loooove this woman! What a gem! Got so excited when I saw this upload. And as always... excellent & brilliant questions, Sean! Beautiful to see Melissa so vulnerable and honest.
I love this, she's so funny,  great episode
mad respect for anyone that stays until the last dab.
I'm surprised they had to blur out the logo on the whipped cream
While I'm not a fan of a lot of her movies, she's always a delight in interviews.
-> Maybe We're The 1st Spiritist* Pop-Metal Or Rock Band In This World 🤔  -> ❤ But Don't Pay Much Attention To Our Neanderthal English, Ha Ha Haaa  *NOTE: -> Spiritist is who professes Spiritism, the Gospel continuation. It has began with the books by Allan Kardec and continued in the books by Francisco C. Xavier, the greatest and more important medium/prophet of spirits of the last centuries.
This has to be one of funniest episodes. Love Melissa.
Man, Melissa McCarthy just seems like the nicest person in the world.
Please get LINUS from @LTT to be a guest.  He talked about your show last week!
Oh, Melissa - you are such a treasure! And what a spice-warrior! :D
Love you Melissa! You’re the best!!!!
Commenting before watched  Wonder if her husband will make a cameo 😂😂😂
BEEN WAITING ON THIS ONE
👎
I wanna just snuggle with this woman 😍
God, she's such a knockout.
10 out of 10 I vote for at least 40 more seasons
Can you interview Matt Rife on hot ones please!!
I’ve always wanted her on here
16:58. And she doesn’t understand why her nose and eyes go haywire. LOL
I love melissa so much. This was a great one. ❤❤
Illinois resident here in good ol lasalle county
I love her so much! Best guest ever!!!!
One of my favorite comedians, Melissa is awesome ❤️
Is this what jumping the YT shark looks like?
❤Melissa McCarthy❤
"Nothing really straightens up a throat like whole milk" 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
I love her 😂😂😂😂
She is such a legend 🥹
Alright... Alright...  Of the show always loved it but I've had a conspiracy theory for a while now... I believe you have suspected it to fellow fire chicken wing eaters❤ That some of these people have a clause in the contract that they sign or make Sean sign that it won't be sweating and snorting and looking ridiculous but they won't get the real sauce on the wing they will get an exact match and color of the sauce but it would be very very low-grade and timid so they don't look like normal people do when they eat extremely hot sauce and they have their human reaction but they don't want to be put out there in the world on camera like they did the Saturday night live version with Beyonce and that's what I believe right here is going on!!! Melissa McCarthy is doing it like a straight OG champ which I respect her so much and I love her so much she's so awesome I bet a bunch of guys when reading this was like oh my God he's going to say so much horrible stuff about Melissa McCarthy know I'm going to say so much nice those because I love her and every single row she's done there's nothing wrong and like I said she's doing it like A og champ because when she literally started choking on the da bomb chicken wing unlike some of these other actors when they bit into these last five sauces had no reaction no sweating know-nothing and I think that is BS because look at Melissa McCarthy right now and then go back and check out all the other people that eat into bomb with no reaction no sweat no snotty know nothing that means that sauce was fake and they do that to save face and publicity which is BS and so not cool😮😮😮😮😮😮 if you read this long thank you very much and that is my conspiracy theory let me know you your guys's thoughts!?!?!!!!!
Poor Melissa, grew up on a farm in the Midwest. Probably the first time she's experienced real heat. Bless that woman.
One of the best episodes I've seen in a while, loved it
Loved her performance in _The Happytime Murders._ I wish they made a sequel or even a TV series. It's so underrated.
Y'know, I've somehow missed seeing all of her work, for one reason or another. So I only knew her reputation by hearing it from others. And it wasn't always positive (especially coming from men). Seeing her here, with such an open, honest attitude, showing the pain she was in but still cracking jokes and laughing about it... I respect her. Plus being a fellow northern IL resident, I gotta be on her side. Going through tornadoes is one of the scariest things, and it really shapes how you see the world, how you have to be brave in the face of almost-certain death and carry on with life as if it never happened. I can see that influence, however small, for her. For having no spice tolerance at all, she did remarkably well. I hope she feels proud to conquer this, and feels empowered to take on further challenges that maybe she never considered before. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Sookie!!!!
"I get it, but I don't get it."  That has to be the most perfect description of this show.
I wish the sauces had not changed from year to year.  It’s not really fair, and you can’t compare reactions accurately.
Cry 😂 laughing @ ive never 🤧 on camera before
IT'S COMING OUT OF ME LIKE LAVA
That made me laugh alot. Love it.
If I was coming on the show.. I would bring a hot to warm gallon of water!! Works everytime!
Pulling out the bread made me die lol
Jim Carey hasn’t been on has he ?
She’s the absolute GREATEST person EVER!!!
I lost it at the bread coming out of nowhere
Yaaaaaaaaas ❤
She is one of my favorite actresses ever 😂
Can I LIKE it for Sean Evans and DISLIKE IT for the guest? Asking for a friend
Can you imagine Mark Hamill on this show. Has da bomb and he's full on joker laughing and everything, I'd love to see that.
Her death stare lol Excellent question Sean, "i'm just fulling weeping" at the moment.😂
Melissa McCarthy is just the best.
👍🎉
Oh this is great. She’s great. I’m gonna watch bridesmaids
U r right ..comedians r the last hold for peoples faith on forgiveness on your errors to move on and lough on our selfs which is the best medicine for the soul👍, love your work..even with bad decisions hahahaahahha😂😂😂
Her vulnerability is admirable.. I adore her!
Best actress ever ❤️❤️❤️
@14:26 Whippets and Wings
I don't like her movies too much anymore, but I still think she's a real hoot. Really great interview.
She’s so funny 😂 her reaction to Da Bomb had me cracking up
One of the best episodes and actors on here! Amazing!
I love that she kept pulling out random antidotes to the spice 😂❤
Watching the panic after "Da Bomb" took me back to when I did the One Chip Challenge. The frantic scramble for help is so real
Best one yet! Love Melissa!
I DATED Missy/ melissa  when she was in high-school.  She was a tennis player . We met at a holiday inn during a state tennis tournament.
How did she not bust out a giant bottle of ranch and start chugging it? That would have been epic.
Cool
this episode warmed my heart!
I am so excited for this. Melissa is so hilarious
Continue to love this show.  After all of the seasons you’ve produced, have you ever considered curating a set with “best in slot”? That way we could do our own challenges with your favorites across the heat spectrum. Just a thought.
She's one of my favorite actresses ❤❤
Am I right in thinking this? No woman has ever tapped out on the show? I know a bunch of dudes have, but I'm fairly certain no woman has tapped out. That's awesome.
I'd be so happy to be flipped off by Melissa. It would absolutely be a life accomplishment!
I love her whenever I see her in a movie I know it's gonna be funny
Adore her ❤
na
I love her 😍🥰🤩
Funniest hot ones so far this season
This was so funny 😂
No questions about GG?? Come on Sean! 😂
What's up with the heartfelt comments from clickbait accounts?
Are you behind with episodes,, you are promoting movies witch are few weeks in theaters.?
I am not a fan of many Melissa McCarthy movies or shows, but Spy, and Thunderforce were legitimately good. she is however, a legitimately good actress and want to see her in more things, she isnt given enough credit.   HotOnes is great because it humanizes people and casts off the shell most see of them.
Yay! Fav 😍😍😍
SHE IS AMERICA'S SWEETHEART
Hear me out, will ferrel killed comedies.  People started valuing ad libbed scripts, and so the movie loses direction and unified purpose.  Comedy writers need to write the jokes and tie them into a cohesive moment unified across the film.
When she flipped you off I really lost it! Laughed so hard I scared my dogs lol !!!!
This show always makes me so hungry lol
I wonder if she has seen The Machine and her thoughts on it
Awwyeahh she's such a joy (just started the video but so excited!)
Melissa McCarthy is amazing. She, like Will Ferrell, is effortlessly funny.
Brilliant🦘🐨🦘🐨😷
That was awesome 😂
She killed it! Always one of my fav actresses to watch!
Spicy Shark....I heard spicy shart. that comes later
first time I was actually scared of a Da'Bomb reaction!
Ryan Reynolds is a MUST on this show by next year when he’s promoting DeadPool 3 - please and thank you!
I am SO happy she's the guest!  She was so brave going all the way through to the end!!!  So much love for this drop!
Da Bomb moment was great 😂
Respectfully i may have to just watch this on mute to give you the view. I cannot stand this woman in anything she is in. I dont find her funny or appealing at all.
Remember when Sean Evans killed Melissa McCarthy with hot wings??? 😂
A great episode!
As someone who loves spicy food this segment with Melissa is hilarious 😂 I love her, she’s so awesome 👏🏻
THIS is by far one of the BEST ones yet. 🤣🤣🤣 I’m such a fan and watch every episode. I love Hot Ones AND Melissa M., so this was quite a treat. I haven’t laughed out loud this hard in years!! 🤣🤣🤣 THANK YOU guys for this!!! 🙏🏼
Guess it's back to people with no talent on Hot Ones.
Best bomb reaction!!
She handled it well….. Sean, you are the BEST!!!!
I LOVE her in spy 🥹🥹🥹
The Little Mermaid movie was beyond terrible, but it wasnt because of Melissa atleast
Melissa McCarthy is the best
I feel so bad for her. We all knew it was going to be bad when she hesitated on the first wing.
I wasn't aware that she played Chris Farley's character. Totally understand her feeling of nervousness. I've done singing and I can tell you I've gotten nervous before getting on stage but imagine that but also you're trying to match up to somebody else? I completely understand
I feel like you don't really need to say the whole explain that gram speech anymore. The guests are usually lost in the sauce at this point and most of the words probably go un-processed.
She's the best! Great job Melissa!
You need Mike Rowe on here. Melissa's comment about you having the worst job...I think Mike would be the judge.
Honestly....I've ALWAYS wondered Hot Ones legal situation with having high profile guests eating crazy hot wings lol
Really?
lets be honest here, most of her movies tanked, congrats lol
YAAAY, MELISSA BOSSED-UP!!😃👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Melissa McCarthy gave Sean Evans the finger.  #1 Moment
Melissa is hands down gorgeous and such a funny, cool person ❤
You know it's going to be a good episode when the guest says the first one is spicy. 😂❤️
😜😜😜😜😂😂😂😂🙃🙃🙃🙃
Spice opens up curses 🤬 🤬.... 😂 😂 😄 🤣
17:46 I kept wheezing with you Sean! We all know, but man she's a gem   And Hot Ones bringing it as always, good stuff
Loved her in Happy Time Murders. Wish they made a sequel or even a tv series. Underrated and was funny asf.
Melissa McCarthy is so naturally hilarious,  what a great episode!
This is awesome! What a guest.
You should have Josh Homme on as your next guest!
wow 1100/600 thumbs... eesh
I LOVE MELISSA DOWN!!❤❤❤
Also another thing I should point out about her performance of the songs my friend was saying that she should definitely get an award for how she did it. I think that I can tell that she really studied the older version of the character but she still brought her own pizzazz to the character. Talk about immortalizing the Legacy I'm going to be remembering that poor unfortunate souls number more so than I did in the original
This show has broken some of the best and its all been amazing to watch for the last 6 years
When she gave Sean the finger! 😂😂😂😂
I luv her she's hilarious & has a wonderful personality... 12k views n 23 mins awesome...
Oh my god the milk spray!😂
If you try to breath in to live 😂😂
Yes watching you eat hot ones is it
I remember her from bridesmaids I love that comedy I always come back to that but a couple days ago I Saw The Little Mermaid and with a friend of mine who is a Disney fan just like myself and I will say she killed it! She captured the fear and the chills that Ursula had when I was young watching it on VHS. They even made her look terrifying when she finally grew gigantic like in the original like I was terrified of Ursula by the end of the movie which is something I didn't quite get with the original but I did feel the chills back then.
They do realize it’s June right?  May happened already
She was such a great SNL guest!
Tammy vs wings!
Would like to see Eminem in this show for some reason😅😅
She’s soooo funny ❤😂
How dare you allow Melissa McCarthy to put Da Bomb in her mouth and go through that! She is a treasure!
I literally can't think of a funnier hot ones guest than Melissa
I’d love to see Josh Homme!!!
When are we going back to the single table? The pandemic has been over for months.
She’s the best; love her work in Spy, The Heat and Mike and Molly
"As you try to breathe in, to live, it gets worse!" Spicy Shark has gotta make a comeback. That gets some great reactions
Ariana Grande in Hot Ones who supports it? ❤❤😢🥶
Yes GOD saved her for Hot wings,, hahaha ya baby🦂👑
The Ursula make up was a travesty. This makes up for it.
Cross pollinating is a real thing. Be careful where you put those spicy fingers 🤣🤣🤣
Hold on, ONE gram photo chat? I feel like there were some edits there. Hmmmmmm.
Please bring on Mads Mikkelsen and Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age.
what an unfunny human. comparable to amy schumer or nick kroll. pathetic.
wow after james corden we even got melissa mccarthy. glad to have the most unfunniest people on the planet right here.
Gilmore Girls taught us that when Sooky is around food we need to get the fire extinguisher ready.
An easy episode to skip.
I about lost it when she gives him the finger.
Mannnn.. I miss Gilmore girls
Why release this so late
The spray milk bottle 😂😂😂 I love this lady.
One of my Fav People!!!! I literally screamed when this popped up! Melissa, my 18yr old daughter and I absolutely love you! You are such an inspiration and keep us cracking up with your many roles. You killed it as Ursula!! Okay now let me watch this! Lol
Who else made it before a million views?
oh!!! now there is a GREAT ACTRESS !!! ty
"that's one?" at 1:37 we already knew she was going to be SUFFERING!!! 😅😅😅
Yes yes yes yes yes!!!!!!!!!!! I’ve never clicked a video so fast
Gotta get Tyler posey on here
mommy? sorry. mommy?? sorry..
Even black people hate the new lil mermaid flick😂
Never clicked so fast on new hot ones.
*Idk why I love this woman so much, but I do lol*
I wonder why it took two weeks for this to be released.
She was in a lotta cringey movies but nevertheless she’s adorable and sweet
It's Dope To See Melissa McCarthy On Here Eating them Spicy Wings😂😂
Buttermilk.
Good to see the "hottest" show on YT partner with the "hottest" game of 2023!!!!
I dunno about the rest of your but to me this makes a lot of sense that she be takin’ this on.
Happy time murders needs a sequel or spin off show. The world building in the film was incredible. Melissa wasn't half bad either
When are you guys gonna get Dewayne The Rock Johnson on the show?
Hi mom!!
All hail the Madea for white people
All the botcomments loving melissa when the video is 8 minutes out...
Loved her performance in The Little Mermaid!

Wow Melissa McCarthy one of my favourite female comics thanks for this one ❤
Love her reaction to Da Bomb!!😂😂😂😂

I love her! She always plays such raunchy and crude characters but she's always so wholesome. "I've never blown my nose on camera!" Girl we've seen you do a lot more 😂

Melissa McCarthy can devour anything, performances on stage and onscreen included. She's one of the finest and fairly talented actresses we've ever come across.
