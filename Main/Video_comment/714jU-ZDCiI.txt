Do English people actually consider this a storm? 💀
Like a russian winter =)
On Friday a part of my fence fell down because of the storm.
Nice

Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others. But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted". Matt 23 NIV  YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.  If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.  AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.  This, then, is how you should pray:  Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.  "Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway", we can use google search. These are the teachings, The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God. REPENT, and start doing what is right. If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.  Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. GOD IS SPIRIT so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.  In the New Heaven and New Earth, only Righteousness dwells. May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.
This is the UK for you Americans.
was barely a storm and definitely not worth naming ffs
Ain't nothing but a peanut.
On the way home from shopping around 4pm on Saturday, I saw someone's wheelie bin fall over in the wind. I live in North West London. 😁 The Elf Princess from Lord Of The Rings has farted. 😆
So that’s why it was so windy today.
Sometimes I like those windy, stormy, snowy days!
Who was the absolute maniac who was all "know where would be a good place to go doing a storm? RANNOCH MOOR!
Anyone know how to de-frost a cat?
SNOW
I have seen england to day i hope than ther is no victim
I was nearly in 2 car crashes trying to get to Manchester airport. Missed my flight,
Jon Snow: Winter is coming Daenerys: the dead are already here Me: what o_o
People getting killed by trees, horrible. We should cut down all trees to be on the safe side.
I am a just eat delivery driver on a electric moped. yesterday was quite funny getting blown into different lanes while driving . I have taken another shift for tonight should be fun 😁
This was crazy a man died cause tree falling down killed someone inside of car
We had some snow in Birmingham this morning and it was treacherous. We had drifts in places up to an eighth of an inch. Oh yes and the trees were blowing a bit.
*Mention the location not the username of sender.*
My horses shelter fell down, he is now very sad. The horse trailers have moved, and some trees fell blocking the road at both ends, to which the wealthy neighbors were waiting for us to move so the kids could go and see Santa... 🙄
I left my bathroom window wide open by accident and at 1am I was woken by all the internal doors clanking and banging like a tornado was in the flat. The bathroom was full of leaves and seeds from the trees and the bath towel had completely dried in the wind!! It never dries without the heating on! Lol 😆
If our government can't stop those illegals coming from France then the weather will.
Why can't this happen in the south 😕
Global warming in action
Thia is terrible....340mph winds and gale force snow about 6 ft deep...
Dam global warming
I'm gonna have a moment of silence for my trampoline that disappeared during the night.....
My apartment was shaking with the wind that's how strong it was
Why do these muppets think we have to give names to storms and other extreme weather? And who makes them up ffs???
Disappointed by the lack of Lord of the rings jokes
Yeah, yesterday in Inverness the highest speed wind gust I measured was 20mph and a total of 1cm of snow fall just to melt instantly and they called in a storm - please visit Florida one day for a high speed wind and Swiss Alps for snow and you may change the news for the better.
What's a Arwen?
Yeah I think we're guna pay for are summer this year good lol
Where is any of this? What a great informational video..... 🙄
Anyone else only seeing a bit of wind and rain zzzzzzzzz
Wind.    Call it wind.    It’s wind.       Though I could start naming my farts.     Maybe not in this Climate.
I think it's called Winter.
Just a normal day in the UK.
I feel sorry for those poor illegal migrants crossing the channel in rubber dinghy's. Lol
Speaking of snow, i cant wait to get bang on it
Is it covid snow that we should fear now?
Arwen ain't gonna batter me bruv
"Battered" ? It's just a bit of hail 😂 Hardly worth a mention
We had snow last night in hull and strong winds today. Garden fence needing repaired! 😬
quick , quick , ...where's my suntam lotion
more lies lies lies  of course there is no cold weather....every day is a heat wave  ..ask cop 26
Iv had bigger farts 💨 😂
Why are we naming storms, don't understand this americanization of our country.
Meanwhile, down here in the east its gorgeous blue skies.
Is that it?
If it's in the mainstream news  Can You Believe It  Probably 🚫 Not 😂
Wow, that was interesting 🙄
Now the government will use this for the new COVID scare tactics
I liked the bit where the video says where all the places shown are...
This is news? Pretty pathetic.
Bet it’s down to climate change. Never in my life have I heard of wind rain and snow in late November.
Its look bit dangerous.
Uuuu beast from the east....uuuuu
More like a gust of wind storm 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is Santa still coming?
I’ve seen more batter on my fish 😂
Least it stoped the boat bandits for a few hours...Oh come on that's worth more then 2 likes what are we all snowflakes
It’s a bit of snow m8, calm down.
Looked out my window this morning, fence has gone and so has some of my wall..bad winds, no snow here
Don’t believe this at all must be from a few years ago suns out where I live
Now the weather report is even dramatised "UK Battered.....By Wind and Rain" ....what ?
Well this footage doesn't do it justice, fences and trees down all over the place
Who'd have thought wind, rain and snow during autumn/winter.
It blew all my leaves into next doors nasty neighbours garden. Job done :0)
Lol,, battering ?
Drama queens👎
Hello storm Arwen
how americanised now... storms have actual names now
Nearly got squished by a tree and a branch ripped a bit of my car off. Lovely bit of weather 😂
People of Britain, learn to hold your phone in landscape.
Didn't notice in Essex
What happened to global warming I thought winters in U.K. would be warm by now 😪
Me 2ft fence blew over….plz be careful
Well there's a minute of my life I won't ever get back.
This used to be a slight snowfall when I was a boy , and people were normal.
Bad weather.  Has to be global warming right?
Gone and melting already. Big wow
Very informative news video telling us the first names of the video sources. Now all we have to do, is guess where the hell any of this footage was taken in the U.K.?  Wales?, North West?, North East?, Scotland?  Without details this isn’t news, it’s just footage that could be from anywhere!
Storm "Stupid Name"
When will people learn to hold their phone the right way round when filming. 📵
More evidence of global warming? Lol
‘BATTER” 😂
This must be the only country where seasonal weather is actually considered to be news.
To batter the U.K…….I love the exaggeration of the mainstream media.
The only thing in the house with power is my phone. Yet 4 miles down the road the other village has power.
Will be a rough sea for the dinghy divers
😲. Thoughts and prayers go out to all the leaves being blown off  the trees 🙏
BREAKING NEWS - Wind and Snow in Winter
My hat flew off and got hold of it two blocks away!!
Roll up roll up. Get your clot shots here
Hi folks from here in breezy North East Scotland fair breeze last night I thought I was going to have to put a jacket on.
We need that in the south towards france asap .
Milk and bread guys , snow during winter, well well well
Newcastle fans wont even put a jumper on. We will be fine. I think every year has been a time when i say to my workmates, ooo your bin go over too? Bloody loud wasn’t it. Was only a prob in the 90’s when i had curtains and an undercut Barnet.
When I think of up north this is what I imagine
Oh look a high wind.       We are Dooooooooomed.      Tuesday,  sunny, with a chance of meatballs.
Someone's house in Chester-le-Street had a plank of wood smash through their bay double glazed window early this morning, due to the wind.  They was on a local Facebook site looking for emergency glaziers to board it up and waterproof it.
Another media outlet NOT KNOWING or IGNORING all the power outages across the North East due to this storm. Some parts of Darlington where out for about 10-12 hours.  A village near me was out for nearly 8 hours, but the snow and wind must be more newsworthy lol.   Sadly I've heard there has been some deaths due to the storm, don't know where though, people have said not to worry, as they will be put down as "died within 28 days of a positive test".
Lie in bed, watch Netflix and peep your head out on Monday.
Funny looking global warming
WARNING: they want to bring in a mandatory cov pass regardless of whether you have had the jab or not. When? On Dec 25th when everyone will be distracted with Christmas.
Can't wait haha love the winter
More importantly, butter on hot toast, warm toast or cool toast?
If that’s rannoch in the first part then tbf it’s like that up there in the summer.
Wide spread gales ! Corry
Not the best place to stand in storm weather... Wind hitting you on the left and the see on your right.
Waiting for the mass conspiracy theorist to tell me this is some kind if government plot to control us 😅
Why is a "news" channel allowed to post a few clips that people have taken and call it their own "news". Literally the lowest effort content possible
_High Winds_ = news 😑 Man, the UK is so easy to upset
I noticed that it's near the sea, why didn't the French stop this....
🤣 🤣 🤣
Batter? What are we a large cod
Seriously? Is this a storm? A bit of wind and a flurry of snow. Try living in Belarus in winter. Last winter it hit -36. Snow so deep you lost the road from the pavement. The whole of life in uk grinds to a halt under 2 inches of snow and a few degrees under zero.
Was it caused by covid. Like everything is caused by this sodding virus, as written  by the local rags daily.
Hi ni but not as bad as this..
Whst storm ? Northampton absolutely fine no snow as usual here
Ah yes. That beautiful thing called wind.    Or breeze
Stop scaremongering. These clips are in Scotland 😂.  I live in London. And the sunny is fully out! And no rain or snow.  What a click bait.  Just mention “Scotland”  🤦‍♂️
Can't have wind without it being a storm and can't sneeze without a disease. Get a grip MSN. Calling it a storm to facilitate the global warming 😎 👌 panic. Haha
Yes, it's snowing.
This is normal weather not propoganda for the climate lot
Wow. Half a millimetre of snow.  What are we gonna do
The wind blew all the covid away, we are saved 🙏
Thoughts and prayers for all those wheelie bins put out on Friday, it's like the killing Fields out there...
It was bound to happen at some point. Weather has always been unpredictable. Take note you weather forecasters!!
Arwen means good fair honest , uhhhmmm yeh rite
God these newspapers they love to create a drama "batter uk" 🤔 its winter and you generally get winter weather in winter!
Storm...sigh. Named too. When did we allow the media to routinely insult our collective intelligence and get away with it? We get what we deserve.
Wait you mean to tell us we are having winter weather in the winter? Well damn I'm shocked! So this shows climate change is a HOAX!!
**Laughs from Canada**
Why such brutal words? It's not battering is it. It's a light snow and some wind. Report the news for once
And a nice beautiful evening in Scotland we see here
Wow is this that thing called 'wind' i have heard about? I live in Scotland we have never seen this before, thanks for the upload so we could all finally witness this mythical 'wind'.
We got that weather yesterday up here in Highlands. Calmer today tho
Wish my missus could blow like that 😒
you are acting like this is the worst storm we've ever had. pull yourselves together. its a bit of snow rain and wind if you cant handle that then maybe Britain isn't the place for you to live
Let's hope this storm is being utilized for energy security and self reliance with wind tidal and wave power? ;-) Let's also hope that Boris Johnson utilized our power to construct the world's truly renewable energy economy, otherwise he'll lose my vote. Those are my lines! ;-)
So a standard UK winter then..... I wouldn't even call it bad, the hurricane from '88 was far worse than this!
A beautiful  summer evening  in Yorkshire
My dog chewed my shoe up this morning . How can I go out with one shoe ☹️
It’s a bit of wind and rain.
This video is absolutely useless if you don’t caption where these videos were taken.
This ain’t even my final form. Once the wind out here lifted one of my motorbikes in the air, just your average winter
We’re British. This is nothing. As that Uber eats advert said it: “BRING IT!”
Boomers using the term "batter" in the title lol
I’ve seen worse. It’s getting like America over here, sensationalising normal natural behaviours. Those of us who are old enough can say that the weather was much worse when we were young.
I was wrong, sparkhill is still a dump when covered in snow
Turn the heating off to unwelcome guests please. Gobal wariming didnt you know.
It’s called winter you snowflakes!!!
I'm to far south. I always miss the weather. P.s firsts.
