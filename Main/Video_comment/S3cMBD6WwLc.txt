okay that on was a travel in  6:15, his gather step came in earlier than he anticipated so he had to take an extra step to be faster getting to the basket
AMEN SPREAD THE GOSPEL AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Giannis on thanuz mode again
Once again the Cavs played scared against a top player in the league
Giannis is the best basketball player on earth 🌎
Cavs playing Amazing without the King.
3:20 HOW WAS THAT NOT A TRAVEL LMAOOO
Giannis is the best in the world
Fun sports weekend happy thanks giving
…….so Giannis is unstoppable at this point? Only way I see it happening is if everyone on the team is 7 foot or better.
Is nba still on?
07:52 demontized the video real quick
They got this year
Si
Cavs bogus for this lost..
Damn this looked like a good game… it seems that the Cavs might be a threat in the weak East!?
Can we call Dwight Howard or Demarcus cousins pls, we need toughness and better play when allen off the court lopez can stay I guess since he’s a locker room guy but cousins will bring some bark and scoring here and there we’re missing that and maybe that bark will rub off on allen but either way they should really call either Dwight or cousins
Great game
Bucks played some great ball. The chemistry on this team is immaculate.
He is in the conversation of legends
I been saying it since his rookie season but Donovan Mitchell is going to become one of the best players in the NBA, certainly in the back court. This young man is insanely talented. Also good to see Robin out here still doing his thing holding it down for the old guys
When the bucks are healthy that bench is going to be deep.
Lopez got abused
I hope Mitchell doesn't stunt Evan Mobley growth, I seen no passes to Mobley in none of those pick n roll plays they had...or any iso plays ran for Mobley In the whole clip he is more than capable.
Over paid
Unstoppable Gian
The Cavs need this. They have the tools to break a dry spell which championship teams have, they just have to figure it out. 23-2 run can happen quickly...especially if Giannis is hitting 3s lol
carter gives the bucks more offense and defense. good pick. if everyone stays healthy, Bucks coming out the east.
Can we cut it out with the "Cavs are a contender" nonsense now?
You know he's gonna slash but you still cant stop him,
Cavs rlly hurt themselves, and Greek freak gone be Greek freak
0:55  Where's the foul? Oh yeah, there wasn't one.🙄
Damn I was certain it was over. Cavs was a tough fight
Ugly broadcast, did they shoot this under water?
Dude I’m 100% convinced that if you put gianis in a 1v1 with some random guy he’d win every time. I mean think about it, it’s hard for NBA PLAYERS to stop him, now imagine what he would do just hooping with some old heads at the rec.
Robin Lopez is back 😮
Is it me or does it seem like every other game we are playing at Milwaukee
Giannis is the best player in the league. He's STILL getting better is the scary part lol. The passing and shooting is the most notably improved part of his game I think
After struggling for years to find a center it's nice to have Brook Lopez.
Giannis Giannis Giannis.....boooyyy
As a cavs fan we truly need Ricky Rubio back more than anyone. When dg or Mitchell goes out the offense isn’t the same it’s stagnant asf Ricky moves the ball around . But all in all we need to get healthy and learn to finish leads
They think we a good team now... wait til khris Middleton come back from injury we will be in the finals book it!!!!!
Giannini top big too strong!!
That lady commentator for the bucks suck what happy to the main guy who used to call the bucks games ?
Giannis quite literally reminding the league he can do this EVERY single game but he wants to shut people up and showcase his other offensive skills
The amount of traveling I saw was outrageous. Good game nonetheless
Giannis turned on the afterburners on them boys
Nba games are hard 😊💯🏀
Cavs need to get tougher hopefully this will show them what is needed we are young and there is still time to grow
If the bucks this deadly with Middleton gone, I don’t wanna know what’s gonna happen when he comes back lol
God Bless you and God and Jesus Love you
Keep it rolling Bucks
Carter's a bucket
Cavs need to replace brook lopez and get a new backup center
💙🥀
Sadhguru thought help you grow up
Antecantshoot wouldn’t last a quarter with me on the court I’d dolphin dive/blow out his knee man wouldn’t last a full season in the 80’s/90’s. This rim running shit is just dumb at this point, real hoppers don’t allow that shit. Take a page out of Malones book
This game was either fixed or the Cavs got scared. I've watched the Cavs all year. I've never seen them try to post Robin Lopez as much as they did this game.   Maybe people that don't watch this team can't tell, but I can.
Bucks are on a mission
Carter went from a G-League sub on the nets to a 6OY on the bucks
Can’t wait to watch these teams when Middleton is playing.
If we were hitting 3 s against Chicago we could of won.  But Chicago was excited after horse whipping Boston
George Hill he playing better than last year..
Akumpo
I'm need the Mobley Bros to get aggressive to that rim and become a lethal shot blocker.. once we establish our defense DNA.. we should be good to go to make a long runn in the post 🏃‍♂️ 🏀 🔥.. GO Cavs... WeThaLand #GarlandGreene the serial killer.. #DM the postman
Watching about 90% of the bucks game so far it’s been a thrill to watch. Considering the fact we don’t even have Khris Middleton back, Pat Connaughton is out again, and Joe Ingles is not playing yet, this is a dang good team
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👀
OK not so fast on those Championship Parade plans.
An old fashioned midwestern rivalry. Cavs have been better than expected, Bucks look like they are on another run to the finals 🏆
WTF!!!
When the Bucks get Middleton back it's a wrap
Giannis is unstoppable
Damn Cavs terrible ass 3rd quarter
giannis travels so much smh
Giannis shooting and making 3s with confidence is an evidence of how he did improved his arsenal throughout his career. He is the exact definition of HARDWORK. 💯
if all giannis does is run and dunk i would simply stop him from running and dunking  oh wait
Giannis is UNSTOPPABLE on this game..
The Greek Freak 💯
The hell got into Grayson Allen??
Please Go Sign Dwight Howard Lopez is trash 😂
I see Milwaukee winning again this year 🏆. ima KNICKS Fan but you can’t deny Greatness #Giannis 🔥❤️‍🔥
Garland couldn't get 4 assist smh
Give Giannis his flowers he been a monster for a while now other players need to stop hating on him.
So the buck stops here with the Milwaukee Bucks I guess; they got the Cavs number so far this year, only team I've seen so far 👍❤️. Pura Vida
Hawkshot thats Robin!.
Bucks looking fucking scary
Mobley needs to work on his handles and put on at least 30 lbs. of muscle.  Cavs also needs to find a reliable back-up center. Robin Lopez is not that guy.
I love how jevon carter went from not having an enough playing time last year, to being one of the key piece in bucks
Freak!
I really hope that bud is gonna make the right decisions when Middleton is healthy because Jevon carter has earned every single minute that he has played and should get more minutes than George hill who imo is too inconsistent and think marjon should also more minutes than hill he’s already a better defender and when he’s playing good he can at least 15 points off the bench
Yeah this is why cavs definitely have add more athletic sizes against teams like Boston,Toronto, Milwaukee this is there only weakness they needed a boogie cousin,some like Jae Crowder to do the dirty work 💪🏿
It’s crazy we not talkin about how the cavs was missing 4 key players, Allen, love, levert, Rubio. I knew once Jarrett Allen got injured, I knew they was gonna come back
Jevon Carter has turned his game to a new level
Impressive turnaround! I had gone to bed after the first half and hoped they figured out their defense in the second. Nice to wake up to a W.
Donovan Mitchell is the closest game to D Wade in today's  NBA
What can you do with Giannis? He's the best player in the league!
What a game! The Bucks play like a team that has true brotherhood. Salute
To be a true championship caliber team, you got to have that killer instinct, consistency, and physicality. Cavs not there yet to compete with established championship caliber teams in a seven game series. Offensive fire power not enough to win championships , got to have that defensive tenacity, grit, and  mental toughness .
bucks killed them in 3 rd quarter 35 10😂😂😂😂
Bucks look like a championship team…as of now, I don’t see anybody beating them, in the East or West
Giannis being giannis simple as that
Giannis is a dirtiest player the way he moves bumping pushing etc.
Mitchell should have stayed in Utah
I thought I was tripping there are 2 Lopez
When in doubt. Act blind when the freak travels 🤷🏻‍♂️
I feel the refs cheated the cavs
As I stated, the weakness part of Cavs is the coaching. This has been my position since the beginning of the season.  On the West Coast, the Cavaliers lost all their games to championship coaches. Furthermore, Donovan once again explained how the Bucks in the second half raised their game to a playoff level.  https://youtu.be/rXAoMSxMfMw  As you could see, they were playing up on the Cavs players. JB was once again incapable of seeing it or reacting to it. If you notice Bucks Coach Mike Budenholzer got ballistic when the Cavs were up to 16 points.  And, we can't keep saying Allen being out they had players out... In certain situations, I see JB needs to grow as a coach and utilize the bench more. He needs to be better... we seen this picture too many times and how it ended.
Y is robin lopez on a team n not Dwight howard😂😂😂😂
Laker bucks team Lbj idol 💛💜💚🇵🇭💚
Rob Lopez have to always be ready. Dude looks half asleep and didnt expect Allen to go out. Those turnovers really hurt their momentum
You all are fucked when number 5 scores 18… we don’t even have Middleton and joe back.. what then…. Lol.. just what.. Miltown baby..
7:53 and fuckin one!!
Why can’t the Cavs hold a lead?!?!
Cavs ain't winning a chip anytime soon 😂 maybe in 60 years
Main Ton is working well, Middle TON is not even back yet!!!! Alright, it's not funny.
Giannis will be goat. That aint far fetched....aint bias...aint prisoner of the moment.... its happening right on front of us
How do you only score 10 points in an entire quarter? Is this 2k on 2 minute quarters? Lmao
I was watching this game and it’s crazy to see the switch that Giannis flipped during half time cuz WTF
Yannis went too crazy but Cavs gonna be at the top of East
Eastern conference finals
Well I'm glad I put a $ 1k on the bucks to win the 🏆
the fans bringing the energy on a late Nov game is the true definition of a fan base 👌😤
literally a bucks highlight tape
When the Cavs have a huge lead and the next thing you know giannins and his team turned the game around that is amazing come back... And the Cavs nowhere to be seen...
Fear the 🦌
Grave gianis pamugas man kaayo!
Such a deadly Bucks squad; loaded with defensive minded players that can shoot the ball well from anywhere. So diverse and well-rounded. Everyone contributes. Mad props to Jevon Carter as well for playing some outstanding basketball.
Yessir good win for my bucks our offense and defense play good out there today let’s keep it going my team💚🤍🦌
As much as I like CLE they’re still behind MIL and BOS. Just not enough playoff experience outside of Mitchell and love. They will make the 2nd round but they have a ways to go to be true contenders
This Game Just Proves The Cavs Are All Hype🤣☠️
What a rigged ass sport people actually watch this bullshit still everything is for money these days not about the real outcome
There Is Giannis And Then There Is EveryOne Else!! That's It....That's The Post!!!!!! I Expect This Very High Level Of Play To Continue No Question.
Are the Bucks the new super human GSW ? I mean two 10 ft players shooting threes , and dunking , I mean how are you suppose to defend that ? Tht shts crazy
Yeah
What did we learn tonight?  This Cavs team is talented enough to win a lot of games.  Jarret Allen is critical to both their defensive and offensive execution.  I don't even know which Lopez brother the Cavs got but it's the wrong one.  Dudes a clown. There is 0% chance the Cavs can beat the Bucks in a 7 game playoff series.  That's all I got.........
How many times is Giannis going to sprint down the middle of the court and euro step dunk that bitch
Teams better be careful not to over look the Cavs...
7:51 Ayyyyy ohhhhhh and fffffffffin oneeeee
what is happening to Mobley? Mobley is a bit of clumsy, his performance is getting worst this season.
Time to say the Cavs are the most overhyped team in the league. If they can't pull together a full 48min against a team above the Celtics then you can kiss the Finals goodbye.
Wow, I'm not sure I've ever seen Giannis get that many dunks in one game!
Class was in session, Cavs got taken to SCHOOL 🏫
Another CHOKE Cleveland in 2nd half 😅😂🤣😅
monster giannis strike again😁😁😁
10 points in the 3rd quarter lmfao I expect that from the wnba
Comeback haha
Great game by giannis, but no allen for the cavs their best defender on the paint
This is the best game of the year so far. Change my mind.
Fucking choke artists man cant ever keep a big lead
Cavs need to learn how to defend the 3
Too many fucking ADDS!!!! WTF
Wtf
Cavs played two different games smh
Still love this Cavs team Bucks are on another level. We have to play consistent basketball the whole game be able to match them. First half we had it going and couldn't maintain it.
If you didn’t know, the bucks allowed 10 points in the 3rd quarter. 10. TEN.  Now that’s a halftime adjustment
Lopez vs Lopez. Great night.
D- Mitch is in the right place at the Cavs, he is Poppin off
giannis and lebron get away wit so much traveling bro. its sad
That's how you finish! What a game.. go Bucks!! 🦌
We cannot make the excuse "we lost because Allen was hurt."   We lost because we stop passing the ball. Milwaukee started passing the rock by the 2nd half and created a rythm that couldn't be stopped. And this much I know, Donovan Mitchell will never win a championship if he doesn't discipline himself like Gannis. The man made over 30pts playing unselfish basketball. Truly disgusted by this game. Good one for Milwaukee.
As a Cavs fan this Bucks team reminds me of the 2016-2018 Cavs. Giannis is explosive just like Lebron was and they can light you up from 3 at any moment. GG. You guys are gonna go deep in the playoffs. Hope we can get a shot at you along the way!
The Cavs have a decent record. That being said, if you can’t beat the upper echelon of teams you aren’t going anywhere come postseason. The cavaliers have done a good job of beating the so called bottom feeders which is all good and well but sooner it’s going to catch up to them.
Now this is what defense looks like day and night compared to the Brooklyn Nets. They lock them down the second half very good game for the Milwaukee Bucks.
Where is middleton ?
I don’t understand the Cavaliers are a better team what happened?
Them steals helped as well.  But yeah second half we turned a switch!
Ggs from a Cavs fan. I can't wait til our team becomes some killers like what the Bucks have when it's time to lock down. Mobley needs some muscle and some attitude if he wants to stand a chance against Giannis. GA made him look like a child out there. It would've helped to have Allen out there but i don't know,  since we weren't shooting well. Until next time.
I hope Bucks keep Grayson Allen.
I literally thought this game was a wrap based on the Bucks first half performance but somehow Red Bull gave them wings! GO BUCKS!!!
I was there and very nervous when the first half ended. But that 23-2 run on the third flipped the momentum and Giannis was just too good.  Let's Go Buck!!!!🏀🔥💯
Jarrett Allen not playing changed this game. But 10 points in a quarter with 2 all stars is pathetic. We gotta do better man
Jew Holiday.
Cavs keep wearing out, mostly because their guards do so much work, and can't be stopped, but they use a massive amount of energy. Slow it, and move it around, gents.
Is Giannis the greatest NBA big man of all time?  I mean better than ShaQ, Kareem, Wilt, Olajuwon, Russell and Ewing.  No question about it.  None of these players could really shoot from the outside, and definitely not 3 pointers.  Who else could dribble and drive like Giannis.  The only comparison is possibly with the inside game and rebounding.
Freak!💪🏻😎MVP MVP MVP........he should be in top 3 now!I gues...💪🏻
Wow giannis is a monster 🥶
MVP giannisss
The Milwaukee Bucks are 13-5🟢⚪️🦌
Best Ohio basketball team
Man...Gianni's played like a savage this game regular season game 🎯 the buck were down 👇 by 16 and ended the game by a 20 point ☝️ lead...Wow Bobby Portius score 🎼 his 500th career 3 point draw ...yeah that's the numbers of a champion 🏆💰 👀😁😎🙏👌
Hahaha those dunks giannis is doing cannot be done by others. So crazy,
Great to see Gannis and the bucks living rent free in the Cavs heads!
Cavs starting guards took 42 shots. 🤔 Aside from their 42 shots ... they had 4 assists and 4 TOs. 🙂Everybody thinks adding Donovan Mitchell to Garland was a genius trade ... but there's only one basketball. Other players have trouble getting into a rhythm if a couple of guys are volume shooters, and you don't even touch the ball on offense. If Cavs don't make a very serious run in the playoffs then the Jazz clearly won the trade.  Time will tell.
Hell of a bounce back game for the Milwaukee bucks tonight. Giannis just flat out willed his team to victory in that fantastic 3rd quarter .PS  What did marjon do to not warrant any playing time in the last 2 games?  I still have a problem with Grayson and Jordan. They kill the team's momentum so many times  even though Jordan did have  kind of fluke 3 pointer tonight night  Can't wait to khris comes back
Cavs is one player away and one year away for the youngs guys to develop and get experience. They are good this year but next season is the real deal for them.
Go Bucks go impressive win
This was a intense game
GIANNIS MVP
The Greek freek turn the game around
Cleveland CAVALIERS 102 vs 117 Milwaukee BUCKS
Best in the world
Half court lob. Wow.
The Cavs didn't have any answers for Giannis tonight, as Giannis scored 38pts on 13-20 FGM, 2-3 3PM and 10-14 FTMS.
Possible playoff preview. Bucks would definitely win it but the Cavs could probably take a win or two
MVP!!! MVP!!! MVP!!!
Jevon been playing like a man possessed out there he deserve every minute he’s been playing.. he a dog on defense and he efficient on offense . I hope bud keeps him in the rotation when Middleton gets back
Yo if gannis keeps shooting them 3s and making them dam he is literally about to brake the nba great win tonight bucks #fearthedeer
Bucks lowkey got some dogs in Giannis, Bobby Portis & Grayson Allen 😂😂  Them boys got grit
Donavan plays like dame lol
The comeback was insane
Cavs fan here. Props  to the bucks. Bucks Truely a championship team. NBA a game of momentum swings. To be elite, you must have the mental toughness and composure to survive the tidal wave. Cavs got burried in that third quarter and lost all their composure and will. Cavs not quite there yet.  They have blundered many late game  leads this season. Killer instinct and consistency not there yet. Can’t see them winning a 7 game series against the celtics or bucks. Hopefully they can mature and grow into a championship caliber team, . they have the talent to do it i think.
Bucks are just on another level right now. The Cavs need to be more consistent on finishing a game. They got too much long players to not be dominating the paint.
the Flubbaliers have no answer for Yanni.
The Greek
Bucks vs boston eastern finals🔥🔥🔥🔥
👋👋👋👋
wow what a turn of events the bucks looked so lost until the end of the 2nd half and completely won the game by the end of the 3rd, mostly fueled by Giannis.
Bounce Back Cavs!!! Bucks did great tonight, Giannis lead the momentum. I respect that ✊ #CavsNation
Oh wow Milwaukee! Night and day better than that first half. Night and day better than that Bulls game. Some of the most inspiring basketball I’ve seen from you guys in a minute, and you started 9-0 (a 35-10 run speaks for itself)! And Big Up Jordan Nwora, who I always give a hard time; that was the best game he’s had this year. Well done!
3rd Quarter turnaround was crazy ngl
1st
As a Cavs fan, Cavs got to be consistent and play efficient and smart basketball if they wanna compete with the Bucks! I mean the Bucks are in different level! They are definitely the best team in NBA right now!
Giannis for MVP
What a turnaround for the Bucks in this game. It seemed like they could do nothing right in the first half, then they flipped a switch and went off. This should be a scary sight for other teams. It's insane that Skip Bayless thinks Embiid and KD are better than Giannis. Idk what sport he's watching sometimes
Giannis is simply the definition of leadership💯
Preview of 2023 ecf
hey can i get something as a gift please.
https://youtu.be/2st92Khve8s
crazy bro. 3rd quarter cavs only scored 10 points ...
Giannis gonna be MVP again. Mark my words!
rimero
Tough L for the good guys
