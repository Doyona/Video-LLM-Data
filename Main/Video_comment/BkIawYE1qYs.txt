The sports world needs more people like Deion Sanders. Deion Sanders is someone who is a life changers for this young athletes and is leading by example with great purpose and great energy to bring out the best in everyone he coaches. He has a strong foundation of moral values as a father, as a coach, and as a human being. Much respect and wish great success to Deion Sanders and what he is trying to do for the future of the next generation of college athletes.
Coach is using "Thy rod and thy staff" and doesn't understand the context of the scripture. He thinks it means a team of people. That isn't what the Word is referring to at all. The Staff and Rod are one in the same. Love Coach Prime but he fumbled this one.
Prime
Preach Coach👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥❤️❤️
After this interview he became very single
Got the right attitude and and
Honestly, I missed D. Sanders in 😢the Florida and NFL days. I am though glad I found Coach Prime!
Loved it! Coach Prime is absolutely amazing in every sense of the word
Coach, your physical breading was very high at this interview 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
she fine
His mother was his first teacher.... others added to that !!.....
I LOVE HOW HE BRINGS UP ALL HIS KIDS!!!! He doesn’t let you forget about the others trying to talk about only one of them! I LOVE IT!! That’s love and WISDOM!!
this is well done and  good research wonderful interview
He is insanely attracted to her. It's literally dripping through the screen. And she looks like the younger Garcelle Beaveaux. She's stunning.
❤im just watching and texting my son in bed.... very proud of his discipline his leadership his drive when im away from him.... working supporting us family... just love how he is with his sons ... so i TRY as a mom do give my son this .... smh just a beautiful person .. hope my son meets him if thats possible

VERY SMART MAN AND COACH!!!!!!
Motivation
Great Interview. Proud of you and Deion. Monument not a moment. A Great Dad for sure. Deion is everyone,'s Dad to those who never had one.
Deion is a rare legend
4-8 😂

Dope prime
Great interview
Keep doing your thing Dion all of these haters you got you know you know you got them on the wall Dion much love😂
Greatness interviews greatnes
The collab we’ve all been waiting for
Primetime your son is  bad man I want to see them go all the way. Right into the pros.
Does Prime have a separate bank account???
Awesome interview. I Believe Coach Prime and Deion!🙌🏽
Wow. What fantastic interview. I tell enjoyed listening to Deion Sanders.  He did not mince words that he doesn’t want his sons compared to anyone. They are representing the best of them and when they’re on the field they walk tall as a Sanders. That’s power in the words!
It's funny that people were saying that he got that position cus his daddy was tge coach and they weren't looking at his wins.
Deion Sanders for president . This man is well spoken on life Etc.
The classy flirting from Coach Prime 58:27 Can't say I blame him 🥰
Coach  Mr. Deion Sanders aka prime Time, is my coach now he needs to be an agent.
Man Coach Dionn, you got me talking to this TV as I watch this interview!!!  This touched me on so many levels, and I’m so impressed with the interviewer and I love how you make spiritual references to Hall that we are witnessing in your life at this time! I love your confidence, and I love that you look at the men you are coaching and see them as productive men of the future! I love how you’ve fathered  your own and how you have always mentored others! Great job Deion! Great job Mom Sanders!!!❤️🙌🏾
Love is action.  My husband told me that he would show me he love me.  He wasn’t going to tell me he love me more than he showed me love.
Great interview!!!!!
Oooo Lord ... discernment!!!!  That's it!!!!
This is off the subject, but can somebody tell me where I can get that hoodie that Coach Prime is wearing???  That very same one!!!  Thank you!!!
I just want a wife like Taylor 💯
ANYONE KNOW WHERE TO BUY THE SWEATSHIRT HE HAS ON?
Absolutely beautiful that's all I can say 💪🏾💪🏾🙏🏽
He's breathing heavy
This interview helped me better understand Deion, humanized him
I lost all respect for Prime in 1992 with the way he dealt with Tim McCarver.
what a fucking father, coach, and human being.
Amazing ❤️‍🔥
BLACKS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE TRUE HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE EARTH
Prime is a sellout him saying he made it comfirms it.
She is so beautiful got some beautiful legs I can't stop looking at it my God
this man is holy ghost filled
I've been following Deion since his Senior Year in Highschool and he's been dealing with the hate ALL of his life and has PROVEN people wrong time & time again.
Here's my take. The loss of Travis Hunter weighed more than anyone could imagined. Coach Prime has utmost class, and he's Rock Steady! Two things here: the racially motivated hatred and vitriol from the Media and others actually influence and empowered jealous Henry Blackburn to act on the suggestion of: "Travis Hunter playing both ways is subjecting himself to injury". That's what you call the power of Suggestion, just like when Trump was indicted he said, "somebody is going to get killed by indicting me". And what happened? That White supremist murdered Blacks before committing suicide. But on the Contrary, Coach Prime exercised wisdom, by saying "Henry Blackburn made a tremendous hit on Travis". Well, in case you all didn't know, coach Prime unstands the INFLUENCE OF HIS POWER, so he said what he did to pour water on the Death Threats toward the Blackburn Family member, including Henry, whose residence is Boulder, Colorado. Now, do you see the wisdom of Coach Prime vs those idiots out there that's attacking him as if he's still playing the game of Football
How can you dislike this man !!!
💯‼️
Agapé Love; 🖤♥️I KNOW U HAVE A GOOD HEART & MIND;  🖤♥️I love that you stay TRUE to that & Urself🖤♥️

Rooks Rocks. Deion -Man of God!!
That was an awesome interview; I stayed hooked!!
If you believe in prayer please keep him lifted. I pray that he is blessed to live his anointing fully for many years to come.
Prime is Prime ALWAYS 🙌🏾 😎
How can you hate on someone who represents greatness and confidence like this. Not only does his own football career back him up but also the way he speaks of himself and others. I don’t respect anyone who can find away to hate on greatness. If you don’t relate just say that.
👏👏👏
Taylor Rooks so bad🥵🥵
she didn't come to Jackson state, don't show up now
This was a great interview!!
“I never talked to my opponent, my game was too loud”….🤕🤕🤕…bars
Just as he was  beyond excellent in the NFL, Coach is amazing now! Enjoy: Lo! I AM with you always 💯 th Chris Phally channel video on YouTube...😊❤. Any loss is the price we pay for success. Dr. John Maxwell...
Good interview girl
With all due respect, am I the only one that felt coach prime wanted to run through Taylor in the interview lol. Never seen him more ready 😂
I don't understand why this man is hated on! It's crazy to me. From being an Falcons fan Braves UGA and Buffs because if prime. He genuinely loved.
I want him to be successful! Love this dude.
Excellent Interview! Entertaining, but more so, Inspiring! Great Questions & flow of responses! Thank You!
Deion is ready slap the meat around
Prime is Real , he's just Heaven sent for a whole lot of reasons ..
He’s lying to himself when he says he never makes decisions off of emotions
Mature response, he will be ok, better to get beat up early. This kids got a lot of days ahead
I still Believe ❤❤❤❤❤ !!!   Let’s Go
Incredible interview! 🎉
All them other coaches watching and LEARNING
I really don't watch PAC 12 football.  I started to ask myself, who is this Bo Nix guy  I googled him and remembered he was in the SEC and was horrible.   He then transfers to a conference that, by far, really doesn't play defense.   Go figure ... He's a Heisman candidate now. 😂😅😂
A decent team but not the one the media tried to made it out to be.
Prime got stomped cu exposed they still trash lol
Taylor Taylor Taylor
This was such a good interview. Well done 🙌🏾
"85% of y'all NOT going pro." Whew.....
To be great, you gotta love the process. The product is profected through the process of preparing. Kids needs Daddy time...not just coaching. I wealth of knowledge in his interviews. Be unapologetically you as long as it's in a positive light. If I beat you at you at your worse, what did I win, however if I beat you at your best, my fulfillment is over the top. Like having my favorite meal! You have done Florida proud! Like they say that it's always 5 o'clock somewhere... it's always Prime Time somewhere!🙏🏾✌🏾♥️💪🏾🛡️ Awesome interview...Taylor came prepared for this interview!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
2:13 prime is breathing like Kendrick perkins😂
AIGHT...THEN.....run it
Audio guy for sure got fired. lol
I appreciate all the entertainment this dude has provided. But, he's killing me with the religious BS. Just give credit to the hard work you and those players put in. We get it. You love your Lord but that ish is cringe worthy.
Deion Sanders is a Living Legend🏉 Coach Prime and Colorado is going to be Legendary🏈 God and TIME🙏🏾🔥🔥🔥🐜🐜🐜🐜
Prime is the man the goat cb

There's not one other coach fill this way about their players either  win for them or go back to the ghetto 😮😢
Work Draft 😤🫡 I’m 30 years old and I’ve never heard a coach worry about that personally myself.  Shit is truly inspirational man really cares about them off the field.
Excellent interview!
Yhis the same way in boxing the enemy always saying something bad at you when they know there going to  loose😮😊😅😂
Prime really insepire me to be a better father and person and lil league coach
All I've heard growing up is that the " Revolution will not be televised."  And Everyday, Everywhere there's a camera on the web, television, and radio, we are witnessing Coach Prime revolutionize the college football world.
I can’t believe Charleston white said all that bad shit about this man!! He lost a lot of respect from me cuz this man is really walking what he talks
Coach prime got me being a better oerson
This guy is forreal how can you not like this man.. he leading these young men man it makes me cry
GREATNESS!
Black Excellence ❤
"Stop stressing then attack the blessing". Deion always has some wise words for the kids on his team and for anyone that will listen to what he is saying! Deion for President 2024!
Deion is the man he's doing what he's meant to do ❤😊
Well done! This was well balanced and not like that Bull Junk 60mins did. You go girl!!!❤
Thank you Deon. Let these fathers know that if you aren’t raising your kids you are not a man when you aren’t taking care of your kids.
Trump and Deon are only 2 I listen to
Very well done interview by Taylor Rooks, Top Notch!! Coach Prime always delivers!!🙏🏾👊🏽💯
Awesome my Brother 🕶🙏🏽🏈👊🏾🏆💵
Deion is the truth
His energy is contagious.  Its like a trickling effect that umbrellas over the whole university.
Who is this Taylor Rooks? Not only is she fine! I love her thickness and she’s sexy! and most of all she know her stuff!! I’m usually up on most sports or news interviewers or sports analysts or commentators. I’m surprised I’m not very familiar with her. I will be from now on though! I love it when you’re enlightening me about sports or news and eye candy at the same time! Win Win 😊😏😎👍
Im a new tractor trailer driver and certain maneuvers have been difficult. After hearing this it gave me a sense of confidence. I nailed the hardest maneuver on my first try. He truly is an inspiration to all.
Awesome interview. Both are class acts. Truly anointed man of God and well respected by many. Keep doing the Lord’s work my brother.
@charlesprice6719 Coach Sanders or Coach Prime. Peace
I for one is feeling Coach Sanders.😮
He said prime is an alter ego we all have.  Did u hear that?
Loved this interview. Taylor u are a monument not a moment. Keep doing u❤🎉😊
Not a  moment but a monument wow that was well said. Keep doing your thing. Coach Prime
Deion can get it! Every woman reading this knows what I mean.
Whoa great video! Was listening while i was playing the game and didnt expect to see such a beautiful woman 😅
I’m trying to find this hoodie he had on. That thing is tough
Excellent interview !!!
I truly enjoyed this interview.
Oregon SMACKING y'all niggas in the face!
Prime is Dope but her thighs Tho ❤
Great interview.
He's teaching! I wanted its personal.  He trademarked it. He just taught me that. ❤🎉❤😮😅😊
2real!❤
Damn that 1980 Sports Illustrated interview was cold..
Baptized by T. D. Jakes
This is an anointed man of God I am so excited about what God is doing in his life. God is really using him and bringing a lot of people in and he is really speaking by faith. I’m excited about what God is doing for the team and the coaches continue to do your work building the kingdom. God bless you Coach Prime.
Why not have a workforce draft?  MAN, talk about a transformation of college football that would be!
What else is new black people are the best of everything... that's why I need to say all the race mixing is just confusion... black women real black women never date outside their race...  also real black men do the  same.
Grandpa rizz
Why his heart acting like he won the national championship
How can you not love Coach Prime? Such an incredible human ❤️🐐
I wish ppl would look pass "PRIME" and listen to the man Deion.  He is truly a SPECIAL individual/Human being.  You may not like his swag (another word for confidence) or his ego his method of speaking or whatever else...but the MAN speaks truth from his heart his experience and mostly the Bible. (And I ain't that religious) Yes he is different and SPECIAL.  He only  want the best out of his ppl. And his ppl are family friends and all other human beings.  If he wasn't coaching he make a wonderful preacher.  Some might say even a PIMP..!  LOL...Ok...that was a little off beat.  Point is he has exudes positively, confidence, work ethic, humility, faith and love for ALL.  IK he's helping me.  GOD BLESS YOU Mr. Saunders.  You definitely have a special calling  and you are accomplishing it.  RESPECT🙏🏾❤✊🏾👊🏾💯
How can you hate this man when all he do is love but shittttttttt they hated Jesus its so sad
A self promoting blowhard. First thing he did was a brand promo. This man left damn near a whole team behind to get money he doesn't need and to get HIS son a cozy draft spot, then went to CU kicked those kids out and handed his son another starting spot all while claiming to " love the kids"
No belittling of the interviewee! Classy Interviewer.  Love this❤️
A workforce draft would be super dope!!
Hello, ESPN. You should hire Taylor Rooks! Well done, Ms. Rooks. Deion is an inspiration. He's an amazing man of character, but more importantly, he is a man of faith. God's favor is upon you Deion.
This is a GOOD man. Like the late Kobe Bryant, they were two of the best athletes weve been so privileged to watch. This man looks outside the box and is paying it forward to the kids. Much love and respect mr Sanders. Good luck brother.
Taylor is a Beautiful Sister...
Hit it coach
workforce draft! I love his bold honesty!  80% will not get drafted for pro ball and he's making sure everyone is prepared with an education to have the career of their dreams.   This is such a selfless act.   I love Prime
Tell me why Deion Sanders is the one pointing me back to God 🙏
Oh boy another set up . Please don’t call her and cum over the phone like tuck . Prime cumin lol 😂
Deon made this fun
This guy is a role model I do not care if he loses
Trump and Sanders
Coach Prime, please take care of yourself, your health is wealth 😮listen to your medical team
Love what coach prime is doing !
I love my babies
I've dreamed about being a good father.   Life happened, I prayed and pushed,  but here I am.   I  hate it because it is not my purpose
The audio is weird but good interview
This is the real GOAT!!!
Taylor you are an amazing interviewer 🫶🏼
I know everything ain't for everybody but this man is a master motivator. If Deion Sanders don't motivate you to be a better person, a better athlete, then something is wrong with you not him but you.
her voice is so attractive
This is one of the most honest and meaningful interviews that I have personally watch and I have watch a lot of them. You go Sir....! Love what you are doing for the betterment of our future being totally invested in building future leaders.... Period Blu Phi to you a good D-9 salute....
👍🏈👍
Deion is truly one of a kind. Much love to him.😊❤
she is sooo fine
The sexual tension in this room. I don’t know if I’m inspired or aroused. Get it prime!
Lou Young is gonna do this one proper!  Prime is him.!$$
I need to know where to find that hoodie!
Taylor so fine - tell her come to Dallas - im trying to take her to Babes Chicken
Deion looking to tap that ass lol
This brother has made me look at life in a another way now it's on me thank you my brother
How can u not love this dude
Deion is a cultural phenomenon in that he inspires young Black men to be the best versions of themselves. His God fearing approach helps them to focus on what’s important in life, i.e. knowing itself and living one’s best lifestyle. Incorporating virtues that shun the 7 deadly sins of pride, greed, jealously, sloth, wrath, revenge, gluttony, & lust!😢
Why his microphones are always bad???
Excellent post KingKarolus and I agree.  If all of us listen to Mr. Sanders comments EVEN though most of his comments are about the kids he coaches, those stepping out on their own need to listen closely to what Prime says.....His comments are for all of us be they Black, White or whatever, his comments are healthy for all Americans.
Deion, you and your family helping my wife fight through her trying time I’d be life. Thank y’all!!!❤❤❤
It's crazy when fathers stay and coach their children for life!!!!! Do it tooo
Ms, Taylor she is phenomenal journalist bronze women
Before they write the story I’m gone give you the glory that was 🔥🔥
Is anyone else astonished at how large his hands are?
This man was the absolute truth when he stepped on any field .... now he giving praise to the man above....deion is going to be alright
Deion Sanders, his children, team, Colorado University, and the State of Colorado have been chosen by God to start a new movement in sports entertainment to demonstrtate the divine purpose of using sports entertainment to mature young men and women into mature, whole, successful, secure, and fearless adults who know their divine purose and divine assignments in life  so they can bless and  impact the  lives of people  for good to glory of God!  Darkness hates the light! Most of the people on earth choose to live in the  darkness of their soul, mind, emotions, and body. Everyone has freedom of choice! Those people who choose to live in the light have a different mindset based on God's way of thinking, speaking, believing, feeling, acting, and reacting in daily life. Invisible choosing to live a spiritual lifestyle.   All of those people who believe the same as Coach Prime, and who live in the light, think like he does about how to live life with a positive mental attitude based on the word of God.   They absolutely support Coach Prime  and his way of coaching the college football team at Colorado University and his obedience to God's will in fulfilling his purpose and prophetic destiny at Colorado University. Coach Prime is unstoppable and more than a conqueror in Jesus' name! No weapon formed against him shall prosper!    Deion Sanders' mother taught Deion one of the greatest spiritual principles,"Always be yourself!"  Deion discovered that he could be greater, do more, and have more in peace by being his "Real Self,"  the Self that  God created him to be.  Through the years Coach Prime developed a close relationship with God, expanded his faith in God and his word, studied the word of God in the Holy Bible, and he discovered God's purpose and plan for his life, and the will and purpose of God for his life. He began to love his Real Self more than his ego-self centered self the world teaches us to love and become. The ego-centered self is anti-God, limited,  and powerless over the forces of darkness!    Deion learned the spiritual and mental laws that govern his Real Self, and he began to faithfully and obediently apply them properly in his daily life.   Once he applied these laws and principles sufficiently and successfully to the glory of God in his own life, then God trusted him and promoted him to teach young men and women the truth  he had learned and applied in his daily life!   This is living life on divine purpose in the spiritual and mental realm and demonstrating it on the physical realm in daily life to have a healthy, joyful, successful, and prosperous spiritual life on earth. This is living the way, the truth, and the life in the light and teaching of Jesus Christ!   This is what the Bible calls the " new wine and the new wineskin" of the  truth being taught in  this new age of spiritual enlightenment! This is what it means to let the Kingdom ofxGodvor God Government come on earth through you by letting God have his will and way in your dail life according to hisvpurpose and plan for your life. This is God's will and purpose for every man and woman. God assigns them to do this not only in sports entertainment and religion but also in the other areas in entertainment, business, government, education,  family and family services, and media!
Love them to LIFE. not to death.  That's a bar Coach, thanks
🙌🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥
damn this interview made 60 minutes look like SNL. Phenomenal Interview, truly inspiring, I played college ball about 10 years ago and now doing IT work but doggone Coach prime and this movie in the making got me wanting to go to church this Sunday and ready to run through a wall with them all!
Outstanding interview from beginning to end. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Like Jason Whitlock don't like his self facts
😂😂😂😂 coach prime got bars
This is a Kingdom Man bringing God's love and blessing to all he touches.  Thank you, Lord and Deion!
I can't leave away from my TV for 1 second without it jumping to a CP and CU video 😑🙄
You the man. President Sanders.  How does that sound?  We need a man the Chinese and Russians will be scared of.
Where’s the wedding ring holy righteous man?
I don't think this much about a lot of people (like y'all care, lol) but Taylor Rooks just oozes sexuality, it's so natural with her.
Taylor Rooks!! 😍😍😍
THE. BEST. INTERVIEW. EVER!!! Give her a raise!
The way Unc poured into Taylor, wow. Love everything about this.
He reminds me of my father so much he was diehard cowboys fan too I just wish he was here to see this era of prime and go with me to watch him coach these guys🫡❤️💯
Taylor Rooks- you are HER
Great interview. Just wow.
She was professional n a lil flirty...,I KNW THTS RIGHT!!!!
Taylor does a great job in her interviews. I'm surprised she isn't on a larger platform. Deion is what we need in this moment in time. He brings positivity and confidence in self that black men need to see. I pray him, his family, and this team do some remarkable things this year. Go Buffs!
Taylor Rooks been adjusting her posture 😅
S/0 to Taylor alway asking the right questions and making the guest feel comfortable
I love me Deon
How can u not be a believer
"COACH PRIME," should be called "FATHER PRIME." Colorado University (CU), will soon be either "CORNERBACK UNIVERSITY," or "CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY." FATHER PRIME has done a TREMENDOUS JOB. Every HBCU should have learned from this WINNER. The NCAA should be recruiting more MEN, like "COACH FATHER PRIME." I say THANK YOU  to "COACH FATHER PRIMES," family for sharing that BLESSED BLACK MAN with the WORLD. Everyone needs to say, THANK YOU, to ED O' BANNON & those Lawyers who filed that Class Action Lawsuit years ago & WON the case for NIL money. They STOPPED the CRIMINALIZING, of  THOSE YOUNG ATHLETES, for recognizing, their OVERALL, TRUE VALUE.
Yo prime be cracking me up with the sayings (they’re good). I know Lou gonna get those in a video!
If I was a recruit , this interview alone would make me want to play for Prime!
Learn the lesson, stop stressin, and attack the blessin! Sheeesh 🥶
id like to know the ages of his sons and other players that followed him. nobody mentions it .
who does 100 interviews during football season?
he must have clones. never seen so many interviews by just 1 person. i didnt even know he coached till last year. i used to think like he was a egomaniac. busiest coach in football.
Her beauty is definitely on the outside,  but what she's working with on the inside far exceeds the exterior.  She sees the man's weaknesses and does not expose him but gives HIM game in secret.  She's a jewel and difficult to find.
This was a complete interview, and I thoroughly enjoyed it,however,  I don't totally agree with everything.  A great dad is a great husband that's the generational order. If you build a good man,but he doesn't know the formula of how to demonstrate love to his wife or girlfriend the man is not complete.  He will always be lacking something. Additionally,  when a man selects the right woman, he receives a special grace over his life, and his children do as well. The woman is a God fearing woman. A woman who is busy about her business.  She shuns confusion and bickering.  She's seen not heard.
Deion for president
I love Coach Prime man, he’s a true man of GOD.
Why is bro breathing so loud I. My ear the whole time I’m tryna do work while this man’s jus talking and moanin in my ear
Coach Prime 💯🦾
Prime for president!
That was so great
Preach Prime
Deion getting old. Hear this man breathing the whole interview lol. Jokes aside, he is showing us black excellence right before our eyes in real time. Enjoy him while he’s here people!
Deion running game on a lil girl
Why he breathing so hard?😂
One day they’re gonna to make a movie about his greatness. The blessing is that we’re living in it. This guy is changing the world.
💯💯
Goat
Prime don’t dig how he blessing me man.
Did your minds and bodies of pornography and spilling your seeds and addictions.
Unbelievable human. Bro just shines different.
Very well said
SHEDEUR SANDERS STAYING ONE MORE YEAR 🦬🦬🦬
This was deep!
Taylor Rooks is, Her! Put some respect on her name.
Prime said, "I'm duggie'ing in my purpose." 😂😂 Love it!
He’s so much more than a coach. Love to hear him speak and the life that is clearly flowing out of him into these men…and honestly, the rest of us as well. Love Coach Prime!! ❤❤❤
Gotta love and respect prime. Great interview Taylor. Beautiful and respectful as always. Coach Prime, Sheduer, and the rest of the squad, including Bucky, Darius, and Unc Neely, let’s take care of business with Oregon this weekend. Oh and shilo we need another pick 6 from you too!!!
I live in Massachusetts and I’m a stone cold fan since McCarthy before the scandal. Thank God for Coach Prime he has brought life back to a fantastic school. I’m impressed with the Athletic Department for CU they went through a long drought, the character of our COACH PRIME .I say our because I’m a son of Colorado and the Buffs. Character is everything and with Prime putting together a Top Notch Top 10 Team. The hit to Travis Hunter is a blow, this team will respond. It’s time for two young men to become the Dawgs they can count on, this is an opportunity and chance for those kids to shine and with this team, I really think what happened to Travis will motivate them while he’s out yet dieting to get back to both the defense and offense. Everyone is thinking okay they took out one of their greatest players, I say that because he is special, I haven’t seen a young man go Iron Man playing both ways over a 100 plus snaps a game. This team has so many special athletes that will be Pro bowlers Super Bowl winners with the character of a REAL LEADER how lucky these young men have to be under Coach Prime and the staff he’s put together. Tonight I learned so much about Coach Prime and Deion the man the myth the legend and now he’s coaching my Favorite College.
A workforce draft WOW this man truly cares for his players!
Would love to see what coach prime does after reading the four agreements
Prime breathing hard af lmfao
deion Sanders is one good man to listen to. and to aspire and understand to be. he is awesome, absolutely love this guy
What Prime has done for Black Coaches is open up doors that were not currently open. I believe we will be seeing many new Black Coaches in both College and the NFL. Now I’m from just down a few towns from Boulder and that’s my FAVORITE ❤️ College and I’ve been through so many Colleges in the 80s. Now as a Danish American it’s way past time that all these programs both in NCAA & NFL. It’s been way past time for equality shine to all, so many athletes that have had me on the edge of my seat from Prime to Elway, Gradishar  Terrell Davis and my favorite player Steve Atwater. They gave us so much excitement now it’s way past time that now you can see the talent that they bring. Those who play hard can coach a specialty when their talent is Special.Much love and blessings to the Buffs, anyone with serious talent would be foolish not to visit one of the most beautiful campus in the Country, oh and best Mascot Ralphie❤
Coach Prime is breathing hard....I hope he get that check.
nice
I can't believe the comments that I'm reading about this. I've been a Deion Sanders fan for many years but I have to speak my peace on this because I'm sure no one else will. This is not college football at all. It seems more like a BET award show on that sideline and that's not fair to these young athletes... It's bad enough the NFL is turned into a platform for sorry-ass sjws like Colin Kaepernick who I thought we finally got rid of. This is not right what's going on and I hope it all implodes because this is just more identity politics just in college football and it's not fair to all the other college football teams. I just can't believe they're allowing this to go on. This is, again, college football not the NFL
God is good!  Coach Prime is teaching and preaching the gospel of Christ 😇🙌🏾❤️
💎💎💎💎💎
Shawty think she slick got that slit down her thigh Wea prime can seee😂😂😂
This was the best interview! Deion and how he poured into Taylor. She’s so authentic! Love her❤
I believe Sanders is Prime  as I consider him to be the corner I’ve EVER SEEN!!! But he was a Cowkid and I hated him. But the mf’er is selling chicken. The last straw if you will.  He all ready let money and the Edomites take him then he sells KFC. Looks wrong and is wrong. The epitome of a sellout!
Awesome interview!  Coach Prime is amazing, and very inspiring.  Excellent job, Taylor!
Pull that mic back on my uncle got him sounding like he got breathing issues
Shout out to Taylor she killed it!! Wish she was the main host for ESPN instead of Malika for the NBA as well!! So genuine and great flow of questioning.
I luv Taylor so muvh pressure 🥰🖤🔥🔥🔥
Shilo is overlooked as well!!!
Coach Prime is the real Coach Carter!! This man instilling life skills!! So valuable in this day and age for the young generation. Blessings
I don't even watch College Football,  but all summer long, I couldn't wait for the first day to watch,  now Im Hook on Deion and his team
Bro breathin hard af 💀
Amazing Interview!
We will always follow culture especially in sports.
Anybody else hear Deion breathing like a Buffalo...lord Jesus this man 😂😂😂
Awesome interview!!
I hope his doctor checks him out this week for the heavy breathing. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
See here's the thing.  If Coach Prime is not doing his thing I would never have heard of Taylor Rooks.  She is a fantastic interviewer.  A rising tide raises all ships.  This was an outstanding interview
That was great questions - you definitely came prepared and did your homework.
One thing I love about coach Sanders is the fact that he is mentored. He is wise enough to allow Coach Saban to mentor him and coach him.
This man has all my respect and welcome to the big 12. 👏🏼
Steve white around the mouth like a powder doughnut, are you on that stuff Steve?
Beaware of opportunist....women Deion!!!!!
Prime got bars
I love Deion he is unorthodox but wise asf. Boy got the juice
Man those mics pick up everything!! You can hear his deep breathing
Come on now! You better preach, Pastor Deion! I just love how he continuously gives God the glory. This is why he's having the success that he's having and will continue to have in the years to come. He will have success wherever he goes as long as he puts God first. Amen and amen 🙏
Truth bombs all over this video.
PRIME is our American Dad.
Bruh she had ME blushing😅 🤤
Thing I worry about is if Dion is spending too much time on the media tour. I know he is likely spending lots of time with his team and coaches but perception must be managed as much as reality. The more he is on all these various shows, peddling sunglasses, etc is the more the risk these things get pointed to when the team starts losing games as his “lack of focus” on the team. Should do less of this stuff. Love Dion. Been a fan since he was a kid at FSU. Just want him to chill a bit with all this stuff. The next two games are critical.
“ Everybody wanna be the man until it’s time to be the man “
UMMM TAYLOR ROOKS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FINE
Good interview, but "damn" she got that Sharon Stone thing poppin.
I love this man!
Man this man is literally preaching 💯💯
Love me some "Prime Time "
Who can speak against this man
Deion remind me of my elementary coach name coach Sneed he was our father at school the only difference is he is going to curse he act like Martin Lawrence to we listen to him before we would listen to the principal when we got out of line acting up at gym time which was the funniest class other then music class gym time which was everyday we go to school was to do 6 inch and he will be like yall got to do 1500 and if you dont finish we will keep doing it everyday till you finish 😂😂😂😂
Man I felt his words…
Where can I get that hoodie?
Kirk Franklin is a dawg in his own right.
Why would anyone hate on deion man. He is a legendary icon weather you like it or not💯
I wish he had been my coach.
I love this good human being! Prime is one of the human examples we need today.
I guessed tyreek hill 🤣
This young sister in a GREAT interviewer 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾…   She actually listens and she is smooth with her follow ups… 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Aye when Deion get to the pearly gates he gone tell God, “I’m hea!” 😳
Dion live the life you love and love the life you live my brother the swag is the swag more power to you
Dude didn't even remember himself dropping bars in his youth, man Deion Sanders is truly inspirational
He is legitimately 1of1. There has never been someone like him and there will never and I mean NEVER be someone like him!
Tough!!!!
Yes he knows about that energy and know how to make them ppl show WHO THEY ARE!
She so fine I almost forgot who she was talking to for a second.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 interview
Taylor Rooks. Period.
He’s very confident huh, but I guess he’s a proven person . Kalab Williams probably the number 1 pick though.
Adjust the mic lower, to close. You can hear him breathing ijs
Is prime okay physically? He sounds like he’s breathing hard and the microphone is picking it up.
It's feel good, look good Taylor. Smdh
He trash talked Andre Risen. C'mon now prime.
Damn Dion shootin his shot boi!
Coach Prime a real one. The messages he put out into the world everyday not only for his team.. but for life in general. We witnessing greatness at the highest level with Deion.
This guy had the same energy when he played the game I watched prime Run his way into the hall of Fame 🔥💯
Coach Prime ! Is absolutely everything ! Many Nuggets were dropped . I can’t get enough of Coach and football 🏁💎
This man has true narcissist behavior… all I hear is I, I, I. What so sad and now many you all have forgotten is when he went to JSU, he stayed on this bandwagon about how many HBCU football athletes weren’t being DRAFTED into the NFL…funny no one talk about that now….sorry guys he a straight out SELLOUT to this HBCU family…and ya’ll support him?🧐 WOW🥴
Great interview
Coach Prime is so genuine and humble
Gurl tryin' to show that "monkey"...dress hemline inching closer to it!
Go Get a Natty Coach Prime!
This can be the first time we see three BLACK NFL players in the same house. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.
Deion was the face of football
Seems like my manz having a hard time breathing
Can’t for get that record he put out
Taylor Rooks, what an awesome interview. 👌
Never talks neg ....love himself an God 🙏🏿 kids great father .... he's very genuine and honest about his conviction to God an his self .... nothing fake about deion sanders , never drank or smoked....great human being all around the clock ⏰ great interview....life 🧬 lessons
That girl is beautiful
If Prime showed up right now and told me I am capable of climbing Everest free-solo….I’m on the next flight to Kathmandu.
Taylor is one of the best things that happened to sports.. sheesh
TAYLOR IS FINE!!!❤❤
So many white coaches criticizing Sanders because they’ve never had to compete against a black coach to get the best players in the land. They’ve always only had to compete against each other. They KNOW Sanders has an advantage in recruiting (it’s already showing) and they definitely don’t like that because the result is obvious….a winning program!
Why is he breathing so hard
I ain't mad at all. Coach Prime, you do you....
Deion serves as a great example of positive masculinity.  He understands the psychological components that motivate people, especially younger men who far and wide could benefit from a role model like him. He wants his players to prepare for six-figure jobs. Makes coming to play for him valuable even if you don't make it to the NFL.
❤❤❤❤❤
IS THAT PRIMES BREATHING OR IS DARTH VADER ON THE DEATH STAR...
This was great taylor really did her research and didn’t ask all the same questions ppl have asked before 🔥
It’s sad that we have to dim our light because others may be upset about it. PRIME says otherwise and I can dig it!! Keep inspiring people!! You are doing an amazing job!
EXCELLENT interview. Very impressed with the journalist. I'd never heard of her before. Intelligent, confident, poised, and beautiful.
PrimeTime
👑
My man is preaching!!! Love it!
Amazing interview, could listen to prime talk for hours
That man walking in his purpose love prime !!!
At this point I gotta have my notebook out when I hear prime life lessons all through this 🔑 real keys
The crazy part is when Dion finally loses a regular season game the reaction is going to be as if it were a super bowl loss with his life savings on the line lol. Keep pushing!!
She...😮
Awesome interview!
Great Interview! Very Inspiration!! 🙏🏿
Taylor showing some skin 😮.... another marvelous Prime interview. All Glory to Yahweh🙏🏼🛐♾️
Coach Prime motivating people from all walks of life! Love how he’s a father first 💯
TAYLOR ROOKS IS SEXY HOT 🔥 FIRE SHE GETTING MAD ATTENTION IN COLORADO DREAMING NOW BABY DENVER LIT BRAHHHH OMGGGGGG EVERYONE IS HEADED TO BIGGEST CITY IN THE WORLD 🌎  GOING VIRALLY ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
TRUE STORY: When Coach Prime was picked by ATL,  Morris Brown College was chosen to perform at the new GA Dome.  While the band was there practicing, NO ONE came out to greet us…except Deion!!…he came out “Hey Y’all!!…yall alright?!?”…spent a little time with us and carted off…he ALWAYS been that guy!!!
Taylor is so beautiful 🥹😩
I wonder what reporter he was talkin bout that didn’t air the interview
The interview was fly and majestic. Continue to enjoy your journey as a journalist. It will take you places 🎉😊
Damn  “How you gonna be a father  and a mentor and leader, when you don’t even lead your own child “  That literally described any bad coach in the world .
this guy is just the best lol... kids are lucky to have such a good leader/mentor.. Deion is a great example of how being yourself is the most rewarding thing. There will be hatters and lovers, but you will love yourself and others and that's what matters.
What was College football before Deion ?   It wasn’t DEION or his Luggage !  ❤🦬 !  Start Believing because  He’s coming!  Go Buffs
Taylor Rooks is the best interviewer I have seen in a long time.  She is excellent at what she does, no notes, great transitions...BOMB!
Coach Prime X Taylor Rooks is insane 🔥
Insightful to see Coach Prime keeping it real from start to finish
this interview was really good
Taylor rooks so fine lol
Libra Rocks. Salute To All My Libras. Taylor Rooks is off the hook. Super Gorgeous and Presidential. A magnificent, magnetic, majestic, magical and royal chakra energy. Salute to the Goddess and Salute to My fellow libra Hall of Fame Coach Prime I grew up and always followed Deion Sanders. To me My #1 All Around Player that ever played the game and many other professional sports. Great Personality fair and just Coach. I Salute This Content because it is Prime Time, Look Good, Feel Good and Play Good. Monumental. 🎖🏆🥇🏈🎉🎇✨
HE'S GOING TO ALWAYS WIN BECAUSE HE GIVES YAHAWAH🔥 THE GLORY !!! PRAISE GOD !!!
PRIME IS SOMETHING MAN LOL GREAT COACH
A Business Draft for Colleges sports.  Brilliant.  Slow people will say we already have this concept in college career fairs. The problem is college career fairs don’t ensure recruits are Smart, Tough, Fast, Disciplined and with CHARACTER.  Colleges are turning out woke followers who lack courage, critical thinking, and reading and comprehension skill.
I love this man ❤️. Such an inspiration! Deion you are definitely backed by God!  Your unwavering display of love for your children and for those around you is definitely needed in this world ❤️.  You are inspiring men to be better fathers and people to be better individuals! You bring me to tears with your beautiful heart and loving soul!
Amazing!!! Interview!!! 💎♾️ 🙏🏽🙏🙏🏿🙏🏻🙏🏾💎🐐❤️🦁🫀🌟🏆♾️
"I also think when you're  good at something and you know you're good at that thing - for whatever reason it makes people uncomfortable if you vocalize that you're good [at something] - and that speaks to their insecurities that people feel." - Taylor Rooks  This whole interview is a blueprint for GREATNESS from both Taylor and Prime. 💚💥💚
This ninja the Farrakhan of football lol
The way he break everything down is crazy
This man smart asf 😭😭😭😭
Deion is saved without a doubt. You can tell that he loves the Lord.❤
Love Prime but they’re about to get smashed by Oregon and USC the next 2 weeks.  UO and  USC are just on different levels. If he sticks around long enough he can hopefully level up CU to be competitive with the top brands in CFB
This interview was awesome‼️ Speak it Taylor, say it CP🔥🔥🙌🏾👏🏽✅🙏🏾
This is what America looks like!
How can you not respect Prime Time, Colorado has the highest GPA in Colorado Football History.. Enough Said..Damn Dr.J
Breathing heavy asf lol
This is the cutest 1st date ever!! 💖
How is this anointing by God and Christ ? When God and Christ anointing people it led to the salvation of mankind souls. Money , wealth, power , egos, earnings 6 figures jobs ain't what God and Christ about, sad how people promote this as a blessing when this is worldly goals which leads to worldly reward.
Hhmmm Taylor got moved.  I felt that.  Authentic Host..
Arrogance first class, ain't nothing about God is in this.
Americas father figure right here 💯
Let's punctuated (That's it That's all of it!!!)
I had to write that down. "Moments That Are Consistent, Translate Into Monuments".
Prime hasn't changed since his days at FSU! He's one of my favorite players when I was growing up! Taylor is a fine and a great interviewer as well.  This was well done
Why do women show their legs in situations men don’t have to?
Coach I need that Drip Swag Hoodie
What an amazing man. Thank you so muah coach Prime. I’m Colorado Buffaloes fan because of you. Great interview Taylor…🙏🏾🙌🏾
Magic
So last comment Jimmy Horn Jr. #5! That was the # I played with just sharing. The number is Special🙌👍💯‼️
This interview is very empowering, motivating, and very, very positive!!!!❤🙏🏾❤
Great job Prime time 🙏🙏👍👍
No way this interview doesn’t have 1M+views
Taylor is Gorgeous & Smart
This lady is the best interviewer i have ever seen. And i watch a lot of interviews but jesus she was prepared
Keep up the good work good to see you
Deion for president
When GOD has his hand on the mission, no one can stop it. They are trying so hard to discredit Coach Prime, but the more they try, the more GOD elevates Coach Prime. Love it and thank you LORD for showing us what’s possible when we serve you. It’s not for us, but for you to use us as your vessel to bless others.🙌🏽  Taylor is doing an excellent job. Killing this interview with pointed valuable questions and such poise.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Great interview, Taylor and Deion!
Don’t let this distract you from the fact Taylor accused an nba player of being inappropriate
Sanders is amazing the way he makes people feel is electric and I just pray that him and Colorado accomplish all they set out to do
I hope the world know what they got with this guy he diffy!
ALL things are possible with GOD!! Coach prime is living proof!
I'll cry 😢 to you... before I'd 🤥 lie to you !!! Gets me evrrtime!!!🔥🔥🔥
Taylor Rooks, you ask excellent questions to bring out the best of him. I gotta rock witcha🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿👍🏿💯
Moments that are consistent turn into monuments. Powerful words
Prime gear is always clean as hell🔥🔥
Coach Prime is doing a great job with his team and our youths all over with his positive messages. And this was a great interview. I'm concern with the Coach's health because he was breathing heavily and with his recent coughs. Take care of yourself Deion!
GREAT INTERVIEW! I enjoyed this interview for so many reasons. Coach Prime was so inspiring. Taylor Rooks killed it! She was classy and did her home work.
God is working through this man!! Thank you Prime!
Love❤ your interview style
Amazing amazing interview I’m inspired
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥
That hoodie is so fire
That multitude and multiplicity are his fav words....lol
They connected GREAT INTERVIEW!
Preaches more word than most pastors on a Sunday.
Taylor Rooks is just so good at what she does.. so talented 👏🏼
I’ll be honest, I’m embarrassed to say that always put Dion in the  Michael Irving category; big personality, just wants the Lime Lite, Hollywood low character TV personality. It sounds like he’s always been secure in who he is w/ Christ faith, family centered man using that light to infect other to believe in themselves no matter the outside chatter. Dion Sanders…you have my attention. He’s got these kids playing w/ inner 🔥!!!
Is Coach Comfortable YET!!!? I WANT TO SEE A BUFFALO GAME!🙏 it is God's plan🙏
I have been a Deion fan for years and this has to be his most profound and enlighten interview ever in my opinion.🥰💯
Toxic Narcissism loved him as a player as a coach. It’s criminal what he said to the returning Colorado players at his first meeting. It’s a sickness to feel and to think that coaching is about replacing players who don’t perform on the college level. These are not pros. They are bigger goals at play is a protes is extremely shortsighted and self-serving
Bigger than MLK !!
Coach prime the best
This was a Master class on how to give an interview and be interviewed.  It exposed so many avenues of what we wanted to know and what we didn't understand about a public persona.  Every Dad, man, woman, coach, athelete and young-person should have this as required viewing.  Not familiar enough with Taylor Rooks but really enjoyed the play back and forth and the respect given on both sides of this interview.  It shows how we should conduct ourselves to our elders, elite and accomplished people, as well as Black Men and Women towards our people and ALL people.    Deion shows when you give respect you now have the Right, dare I say ...the permission to DEMAND respect back.
Taylor !!! You’re questioning and style brought  out the best! Great job
Don't get me too'd coach
Yes Sir!!!  A Workforce Draft is the winning idea!!!!!
dam she is fine asff
Just imagine what Taylors dms look like lol! Drake probably the front runner, but Deion in his "Prime" would be right up there  neck and neck with him and all these other athletes and entertainers on her list. Hell, who knows? He still could be! 😅😅😅
How can you not root for this guy. To go against him is going against far more than a college football coach
This! 43:45
Prime is right though. Taylor Rooks and Joy Taylor look fly, but they know what they're talking about. It's noteworthy.
when he said he wanna swing on that! I remember his fights he didn't back down in the NFL
MAN! This man and this interview was EVERYTHING! I'm not a football fan and never was, but he got me watching! Even without being a football fan, I've heard about Deion, Prime over the years, but I never listened to or watched him. The knowledge and inspiration I've gotten from this man in just under a couple of weeks has been profound! I'm watching and listening now! You've got my attention!
Excellent interview! This is THE ABSOLUTE BEST interview on Coach Prime to date!!! Girl, you did that!
This interview was electrifying!! This is a man of God and a father to several 🎯
💜
He’s doing it his way.  I’m here for it.
Like she said put me in 😼🥱🥱
I played on so many high school teams with players who had no expectations of winning it all. I wish we had a coach that said from the jump, “We expect championships. We expect excellence.” 🤔
That was worth every minute of my time. In fact, I feel like I need to pay something.
Jimmy Horn Jr. Is the player who will go through walls for Deion and Father. Inspiring Moment headed for a Monument. Let's Go Jr. Let's Go Son!!!
Work Draft! Who thinks like this People! Who???? God Bless this Man! He good for Fatherhood/Leadership/Top Dog!!!
Heavy!! Thank you for this!  Best part of this interview: I want to be remembered as the greatest Dad ever! And not just to his own!   Black fathers we are influencing more than just our own! Thank you Deion
🐐
Continue to be great coach prime. And Taylor
Prime & Deion! Ok Prime is the character flash/performer/leader/player(flash)/rock/fuel/extraordinary individual/ no joke!!!, Deion is the man/mentor/father/believer/disciple/follower of God! I get Him! This interview was incredible! Taylor is so Awesome & Personal! Extraordinary Fellowship together! Much Respect! Notice Deion lifted his mother up... what he did for #5 penetrated my ❤️your father wants to cheer on front of his inmates for his Son❤️💯‼️
Love Coach Prime but he moved around a bit when she said that Travis wasn't going to play just an observation.
"Referring to his Sons  "they are second to NO one , they are first to themselves.; A Father being an example to his SONS. Blessings Mr Sanders
"You know before I write the story, Ima give you the glory". This man is beyond blessed. I actually feel sorry for all these Prime haters.
The interviewer was phenomenal! When Coach Prime is comfortable he’s gonna give you gold every time
Awesome interview …Taylor Brooks .. filled with insight perspective and life values !!! I love it
Not the cabbage patch…lol
The XFL needs to flip Deion and the players because NFL want be able to compete! 💡
This man said he wants a workforce draft.🙌
Wonderful interview.  She's great.
Lou Young about to go crazy😂😂😂
I've been following Coach Prime Tim from his college years to his reality show until now I love it because he's unapologetic him & he's not allowing the pressure of people opinions  stop the assignment & the mission God has to get done thru him. Call him what you want Coach Prime has a anointing on his life that causes persecution  you could tell he has a personal relationship with God  so he's going to be miss understood.
“You can’t be angry and want to be blessed simultaneously.”
Only 13 mins in and this is better than 60 mins
I have NEVER been interested in football but I always loved Deion’s words of wisdom, positive energy, and personality. Now I’m fully invested in learning everything about football since he started coaching college football.😂 Wishing him much success. What a great interview! You are amazing Taylor!🙌🏼
CU WILL BEAT ORE
Este hombre está en todas partes. ¿Tiene tiempo siquiera para dormir?
She only un crossed her legs once in the interview. “Class “
Amazing he has the time to doing hour long suck up interviews during the midst of the season, think Saben is doing this?  All about Neon Deion
Great Job Taylor 🫡✊🏾🙏🏾
Prime makes me want to be a better man I respect this man so much as a young man myself 💯🤝🏾
I would follow deion Sanders into the danger of gunfire because I believe in whatever he's selling...
Coach got me watching Oregon film!!! I stayed up the other night for hours coach prime 🤣 we all gotta do our part guys, Go buffs!
Is he ok? He’s breathing so hard. I’ve noticed that from a few interviews
This is what “God Like” energy look & sound like.
Well done Taylor.The sky's the limit
She is fineeeeee😍
Sauce on the other side of trav? COME ON MAN
Prime gives us quotes to live by and motivate us as a ppl to do ur best every time And I'm hear for it
A workforce draft?!😮  I can't wait to see it happen at CU first. What an awesome idea.
The only player that hates Deion Sanders is JERRY RICE. He will NEVER support 😂😂
LET'S GO 😁
Preach Pastor Prime!!  Amen
Whitlock throwing punches in the air rn😂. On another note, that hoodie mean🔥🔥 Go Buffs!!
The best bro hands down.
Can't wait for Lou to do this one!
Next level interview great job! Wow
Work place draft is a smooth concept, would motivate ppl even more to be at the top of their field
This interview was amazing
👏🏾
I dont even watch sports but I love how he is winning on and off field.
Yo, having Kirk Franklin 57:00 on this is so Godly and this is why. Jason “Fatlock” Whitlock criticized Coach Prime for having Lil Wayne walk out the team last week and said “Why didn’t he use Kirk Franklin if he was so much I touch with his faith” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
These Taylor interviews have  gotten many of men in trouble.
This man was so far ahead of the game since the 80's lol. There is a thin line between CONFIDENCE and ARROGANCE & people are going to judge you regardless,so keep doing YOU PERIOD.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I absolutely LOVE this...this aligns with my Research Agenda!!! Mr. Sanders is the Truth!!!~Dr. Tj
He is motivating confidence and fighting life when your at rock bottom, just to get up and keep fighting in anything you want to do and accomplish.
That was one of the best interviews/conversations that I've ever watched.  Both Coach Prime and Taylor are amazing individuals. ❤❤❤
Coach Prime is  an Amazing and Phenomenal man. He’s a GREAT Father not only to his biological children or his team. He’s a Father to everyone he comes in contact with. I love it!!!!!
😢 got my daily Prime cry in.   Time to start the day.😁
We took it personal too... Like...What u mean😊🫡
Cuz we a monument baby!!! 😄
I see alot of people saying we alot of more dad men like prime. We out here we just not Rich and famous so nobody acknowledge us. Much love to prime
I followbyou everyday Coach Prime and I don't even care as much about my Professional team anymore..  Go Colorado Buffaloes 🐃
People who excel at life makes good Role Models & Coaches. Smart, discipline and good Character. Who wouldn't want this man to Coach your kids away from Home.
Young lady did a excellent, excellent, excellent job. You asked the hard questions with respect and the question wasn't that you were trying to be nosy. You would just a professional. I'll call you first time we see you won't be the last. God bless
Taylor Rooks is beautiful and natural! 😍🏆
Stephen A. Is the guy who never aired the interview. It wasn’t his call tho.
She is sooo gorgeous
Great interview !!
You can’t hate on this man! Truly happy for his success and some. Keep it up Coach Prime!!!!
Coach is coaching the world right now, everyone within the sound of his voice can learn something. let me keep it local, I need this real bad. 💯
They do way to much bout Travis I've seen players like him
Legendary interview man. It almost feels like coach prime is still a younger version of himself, just years older now. And he tells us HE HAS BEEN UNAPOLOGETICALLY HIMSELF.
Seriously, how can anyone be against this guy?!
she killed it
Look. There are a lot of people in a position,with a platform to do what Deion Sanders is doing,& people are trying to knock him, which is just INSANE. This man is opening up doors for a multitude of people & everyone should APPRECIATE & not HATE, especially young African American men from single parent household. God bless my Brother.💯❤️🙏
Such a great interview.
I thoroughly enjoyed this interview!  Best wishes to Coach Prime and the Buffs!
Taylor is some kinda beautiful. Elegant, with an amazing presence
Workforce Draft!!!!!!
Imagine what Shilo was thinking when Deion said “Y’all ain’t stopped nobody all game”. Bro had a pick 6 and a forced fumble.
BRUH!!! I NEED THIS HOODIE!!
Deion breathing is very labored😢... I send him healing energy.... As I've commented before he need to breath from his abdomen, drink herbal tea (dandelion), and rest...💜💜💜
It’s called Confidence 👏🏿💕✌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
❤️❤️❤️
Lets go COACh!!!
Bruh Taylor bad asf..my lawdddd
Good interview Taylor
✊🏾✊🏾
That corporation draft is a fire idea 😳🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
We need more leaders of men like Coach Prime.. drop some gems. Today, I will mix kobe mentality with coach primes to obtained the succes he talkin bout 😤💯
I was up to 3am screaming at the T.V in double overtime Go Buffs 31:39
Please stand for the next president of the United States, Deion Sanders.
Coach Prime is a real one!💯
A wonderful interview!!!❤😊😊😊
I pray God continue to utilize him 🤝🏾💯🙌🏾
I am a industrial mechanic .I’m not even a ball player. This man motivates me to be great and study. And drive my self for me.
Coach Prime said that there should be a workforce draft for the players who dont make it too the NFL. He goated for mentioning something like that.   I've never heard a coach say anything like this regarding the players who may not make it to the next level as a football player. Forward thinking at its finest!
Great interview! Coach Prime is legit, you can sense it.
Prime’s confidence is next level!      This isn’t made up; this is HIM‼️ the realness is so genuine! It’s hard to dislike Deion Sanders!
I love this so much!!
Playa playa😂
This was such a good interview and the questions were outstanding.   Keep rising to the top and shining queen‼️
Coach Prime needs an Albuterol
This is one excellent interview! Kudos
I wish I had a dad 1/1000 of Prime!
That was a great interview
I like how he motivates on and off the field
Mark my words they going to make a movie about this season!!🙏❤️💯🤞
Great job Taylor! Questions on point. Deion is a NATIONAL TREASURE.
I Thoroughly enjoyed this interview. A walk in excellence. This is how it supposed to be done. The LORD GOD It's doing tremendous things in our lives. It's beautiful to watch those who Believe. Bravo ❤❤❤
55:59 - 56:12 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯🦬🦬🦬🦬
Coach Prime is my Man.  I just have to kick back on one thing he said, Her Question was Is It Sustainable?  His Answer was No, because it's his anointing that is making the difference.   I would agree 1000 %, It is his character and anointing that is making the difference CURRENTLY..  But THE END GOAL Should Be, to make replica's of yourself, To PASS DOWN/ON the Baton of Success.  Be Fruitful and Multiply.  In scripture this  means to create more of YOU!!!!!  The Real Success of your program is, IS IT SUSTAINABLE!!!
She is beautiful! Keep shining ALL!
You can’t stop a MAN, that have been ANOINTED BY GOD. He was a BLESSING for JSU.
I’m definitely folded if Taylor waves at me
Bishop AKA Jerome Bettis Do Ya Homework. I bet Bishop can run that ball!!!!!!
That is Americas Coach for sure
What’s the color the color is confidence lol
Deion love for Nick Sabin speaks volume.
Why would you bring Kirk Franklin? Your not as cute as me ? Come on  spoiled it
I found this lady on local tv over 10 years now look she everybody favorite.
Coach Prime is the man!!!
How could you not go ball out for this guy!!
I would pay Coach Sanders a scholarship to take my kids
God is good! Great interview! Great biblical lessons! Coach Deion Sanders continue to be great! Coach Prime you are truly amazing! We believe! It’s our time! To God be all the glory!!!
The cabbage patch was 30 years ago 😂
I feel you coach prime you are absolutely right
Interviewer & interviewee awesome
I can listen to this man all day everyday
she gorgeous
Damn I would marry Taylor yesterday…
Deon Sanders Blesse! Walking in his calling! GOD called him for such a time as this!! 🙌🏿🙌🏿
I know cocaine lol
I LOVEEEEEE THIS ❤❤❤❤❤
Taylor fine fine
A walking and talking inspirational force unquestionably, I love it👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾
That's a badass hoodie he has!
We need to protect Coach at all costs, he’s not Americas coach, he’s our coach. Those who know gone know..
Unc dats some magnificent real teaching sir... RESPECT UNC...
If only every child especially black boy could experience having a guy like Deion in their lives oh wow how great would that be
NFL owners hearing him mention Cheetah/ Travis and Shedeur in the same sentence or Sauce and Travis 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 they gonna try to make that dream come true
Whew this interview 🙏🏾
Not only is Taylor Rooks fine she is at the top of her game as a journalist she never disappoints her line of questioning is always so on point fantastic job...
Naw..naein
Love this in depth interview. Deion is HIM. Many interviewers short change him. Smart & thoughtful.
Wise & Solid: "You can't get caught up in trick or treating".. Coach Prime
Great interview! Taylor Rooks 👀
Ma Connie Raised a Great Man. He Still Let His Mom know He Made It Safely To His Destination
I love him 👏🏽👏🏽anddddd that hoodie if so effin dope
She bad……
It’s not about a black man, white yellow or brown man. This is the type of MAN we need leading our youth.  I’m Asian and I find strength from this bold and strong man.
That was a great interview 👏 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The part where he explained the boys dad being inmate and making his dad proud hit different…. Instant goosebumps all over my body. Truly powerful didn’t have a present father to be proud of me like that. But now I’m a dad and my two boys are gonna make so proud whatever they do in life
Be careful Prime. The devil has all kinds of snares. Notice this seductress with this dress exposing her thighs, almost up to her buttocks? The devil is very subtle and all he needs is a vessel. I can guarantee you this was a part of the blue eyed devil’s agenda to ensnare you. Be sober and vigilant!
Dope Interview ❤
He’s a marketing genius
I'm rooting 🎉🎉🎉let's go Buffs
Goat talk
Not gon hold you I’m fighting back tears watching this. That convo between him & Jimmy Horn was Wow can’t be taught 💯
Taylor know she bad. 😂
COACH PRIME IS BRINGING THE STRENGTH OF GODS WORD AND IS LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT. WHAT A MOTIVATION FOR A MAN. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS HIM WITH WISDOM GRACE AND POWER IN JESUS NAME🙏🙏🙏
I wouldn't mine a pair sunglasses they do looks pretty good I may so myself 😅
Great interview. Good job
I can't get over, how BEAUTIFUL Taylor is! 😍
Somebody oughtta really check out deions breathing especially with his clots!
Coach sounded creepy...you could hear his voice change the moments he became full of himself...  he's filled with a spirit but it's not the Holy spirit.
Prime the legend, God bless him. 🙏🏽
An awesome, Godly man!
This mannn is amazing!!!  I’m admire him a little too much :)
"I made a deal with god" 🤣🤣
Taylor is one sexy lady 😅
Where can I get this hoodie tho? 👀👀
Love how he said it is his calling
Prime bringing up Shedeur Decision on his dad recruiting him is too funny 😂
Goat talk
Not going to lie of my son was a football player I’d want him to go play for coach Prime. Prime will teach him about football , life and how to conduct himself. It’s a once in a lifetime experience
Deion “Coach Prime” Sanders is a man among boys. Salute King.
Lou gonna have a field day with this one!!! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you so much for having Dion Primetime on because he's not just a motivator he's a man of God that inspires not just football players but people mainly people of God in all things that they do in their life I thank God for him amen
"MY KIDS AREN'T THE SECOND TO NOBODY, THEY'RE THE FIRST OF THEM"..... POWERFUL WORDS PRIME, POWERFUL WORDS.....
🔥💯💪🏾
Thank u both. .. u made my morning..  Amazing mind .
What an awesome interview,  Great job Taylor!
What's all the hype about??
Who is this chic? Her questions are excellent   How can we not love Deion, Prime, Coach Prime? Dude just don't profess GOD He lives in the name of GOD U don't like Coach Prime? Yo ass really JEALOUS and real INSECURE in yourself
I wasn’t familiar with your game Prime
Best video on YouTube
i need that hoodie!!!!!!!
Does his breathing sound wired to anyone like he’s out of breath
don’t lie she look good in them sun glasses
Deion Sanders is the dad we all wish we had he seems to embody the perfect balance of a man and I commend him for the belief and confidence he instills in his sons it’s inspiring to see. If there wasn’t a blueprint before this man has shown us the blueprint for being a successful black man in America. Thanks Prime . GO BUFFS 🦬‼️
How can you not root for him!
I wasn't familiar with Taylor Rooks before this, but she did an incredible job with this interview. I'm going to check out more.
This interview gave me so much energy I’m ready to win
Super Nice  Interview 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Prime, next time stick to Taylor and the likes and stay away from 60 Minutes. They did you a disservice.
I could listen to this Man of God speak all day! God bless him and his family and team!!
G m know that God can and God will ❤
Prime and The Rock for president
She said put me in coach🤔🤣😂😂😳…
Great interview Taylor!!!  Great questions and lovely to get to know the whole Deion!!!  I am so happy for the boys who are directly blessed by him!!!  Thank you Lord.
his the real 60 mins right here
For Coach Prime to say he talked up his opponents and to “whoop” them at their best… I’m convinced he’s a real life Vegeta. You can’t tell me different
I loved❤ this interview!!! We saw Coach Prime not only is he inspirational to his players but he is inspiring this nation . I wonder if he knows that. Thank you Coach Prime you have reignited me in my 50’s to be unapologetically authentically ME!❤❤❤
Females are so exhausting! I see she wore her t-shirt to interview Coach Prime!
Coach Prime,  keep on doing what you’re doing with those young-men, and know you’re going to have some haters. Let them hate, and you keep teaching, winning, and walking in the light. I truly believe, your steps are being ordered by the Lord. Keep spreading the Gospel, and let God do the rest, and people will see the hand if God at work in your life.
Awesome interview
Love T.R. interviews very professional. That smile lights up the room
Lol i said Tyreek Hill before he did
🖤👏👏👏
America's coach of the year of the decade....Go Buffs 🦬
I have become such a big fan of Deon Sanders after watching all of these videos by his son!
💬😂😂 Look at all the hating roaches 🪳 in the comments. Just say that Deion Sanders triggers your Beta Inferiority Complex and keep it moving.
“You (God) know before they write the story, I’m going to give You the glory”. FIYA 🔥🙌🏽
Goat omost isn't even enough
This was such a good interview. The young lady doing the interview did an excellent job!!!
Ion know.. from what I see .. 60% Love for prime 40% Hate
Man this guy is a blessing to this 🌎. He is truly doing what he was called to do. I appreciate he doesn't subtract God from the equation. Truly inspirational and beautiful to watch.
Once you learn the lesson, you can stop stressing, and attack the blessing
I need that hoodie
Coach but he still dress sporty, only real athletes know the high socks with shrivel 💪🏽
Gah dam!!!  This is type of fathering we need and I trying to do. What is your calling and purpose?
She asked great questions!! A little awkward the way she’s looking at him BUT really great interview overall!!
Deion could seriously be a pastor 😂 great interview from Taylor and Deion
@Taylor Rooks is NOT lying when she says there are so many ppl behind Deion that he doesn’t even know how many. I’m a 60 yr young woman. I’m one!! I don’t watch football and here I am now watching EVERYTHING Sanders!!! I’m not going to lie but I only started watching after the TCU game. I watched ONE video and that’s all that comes up on my feed since. 😂😂😂
Masterclass every morning when I wake up and coach prime gives me a reason to forge ahead.
Loved this interview, love the fact he refers to the Lord. 🇺🇸 💪🏿🦅
We HAVE A FEW… that will step up..  BUFFS BY 14 next game
I Want that Hoodie ... Where Can I Find That Hooddie
BUFFS ARE DEEP
Next MAN UP IS A DOG
Excellent interview and interviewer. Coach Prime just dropping those nuggets of wisdom!!
I’m glad Taylor rooks never switched up
Keep the main thang the main thang
Taylor asks the best questions in the business. You can tell she’s prepared yet nimble enough to create in the spot.
Prime is not a regular person he should be studied
Lmao put me in coach...
FatherFigure on Deck…. We as MEN AND FATHERFIGURE LOVE YOU BROTHER PRIME
Wow this is one of them one's 😁Coach Prime is an inspiration to many...Love from South Africa 😌❤🇿🇦
This beautiful young lady needs an award for this interview. Job well done.
Workforce draft has already been created. Its called a career fair 😂
Qualified replacement for ESPN
This interview was as good as it gets. Interviewer did phenomenal. Didn’t interrupt and questions were lined up. Great follow-up questions too.
I want to see you win prime
The audio is fucked
This was amazing!!! Uplifting!!!
Thinks 1/2 america wants him to lose. So sad he feels such hatred from people he doesn’t know, but then wants people to see him for who he is.  Insecure narcissist complex.  He must of had a hard time making friends as a kid
I’ll answer for prime. He’ll be what deshaun Watson was supposed to. He reminds me of prime deshaun
I love the idea of a draft to enter business
If you’re not proud and inspired by Coach Prime something wrong with you
THIS INTERVIEWER IS AMAZING
Fax soon as he said “aight”my internal translator said” aight now I dun told u stop playing with me”😂😂
Underachieving… Keeps me up
Win… that’s my DOG
17:05 he might be referring to Cormani Mcclain there 5 star CB
I watch too see you WIN…..
Saunders need to market his own Style Glasses called Prime time  PT logo
She a very   Good  Taylor rooks and beautiful
This has been the best interview  ever. Great job Taylor 👏🏾 ❤
Deion is the best. The interviewer did a great job of asking questions about what makes Deion tick; his purpose in life and why coaching is much more than winning games.  For those of us who are Christians, we understand what Deion means by the anointing to fulfill the Lord's purpose for his life. Deion knows his purpose is about much more than football.
Only God! Love you Deion Keep Going Bro! Also Go Chester Clippers, Go Chester Panthers, Go Chester Cheetahs, Go Colorado, And Go Eagles! Respect!! Praying that All of sports play safe and healthya 1 more thing Coach Prime Praying that you accomplish what you set out to do! C-CITY'S FINEST!!!!
I’m ready for Lou to do this one lol
Wow!  What a great video to listen to.Very inspiring to me.Amen Deion 🙏 🏈
This is the most inspiring guy in America
YES… Jesus CAN Trust You✨.
Deion had her panties wet eye already know.. The body language don’t lie, she feel that man power 😂 💪🏾🤝🏾
BEST EVER BLEACHER REPORT INTERVIEW, HANDS DOWN.. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾
Blessed and highly favored…loved this interview!
Deion Sanders spoke nothing but truth!
Come on now Coach Prime ( Who wears many hats for Those Young Men (His Sons) ) You better Preach 🥰 👏🏾 🙌🏾 I Believe 🤗
Bro how can you not like Prime. The Player, The Father, The Coach like come on. I’m not perfect but I’m present
This interview is the BEST! However, that Hoodie is a BEAST!! How can I get one of those???
She did her homework.❤❤ Loved this!!!!
READY FOR THE NFL
God bless, protect and continue to guide this man 🙏🏿
I’m 41, and this is the best interview I have ever seen in my life
When he speaks of himself vs Prime; I hear the "fire" sign speaking, he's a Leo through and through. Fire signs: Sagittarius, Aries and Leo! ;)
Pastor prime in his mode!!!
Love this guy
Great interview! Coach Prime is a humanitarian! Thanks Coach!  W e here A 'ite R esilient  This means "WAR"
This was such a great interview 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 In Prime We Trust
Prime is motivating the nation.
I need a gold pair
Love the respect he gives nick saban
Deion is great, but Taylor is AMAZING!!! Smart, Professional, Well Spoken, and Beautiful! Black Queen
Coach Sanders/Prime is the Beyoncé of sports. He’s on superstar status. He’s UNIQUE, I said what I said🤷🏾‍♀️
Deion is the true definition of a servant leader and really knows how to inspire people. That team would run through a brick wall for him and that is because he has the ultimate buy-in from them. This is only the beginning and I’m excited to watch his team/coaching success. His purpose is so much bigger than football, he’s inspiring the masses.
This women is smokin’ 😮!
Deion’s words are a mindset.. you don’t become one of the best in a professional sport like he did without having that mindset… it’s something you gotta walk, talk, believe   Gotta crawl before you walk. And you gotta walk before you run. Everything is a process. Stay focused and everyone be blessed
“Workforce Draft” 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I need that CU hoodie that coach is wearing 🔥
Walking in His calling!
I gotta get that hoodie
Taylor keeping that 😻 under wraps
Once you learn the lesson you’ll stop stressin and attack the lesson !!! I needed that
Deion Sanders is one of the best Athlete to ever walk the planet. He is on track to surpass his success as a Player. The guy is legend. 🐐
Hell this even motivated me for my afternoon meetings on new potential accts. 💪🏾💯🤷🏾‍♂️😂
There’s so many men that don’t want to let anyone tell them anything. I hear men say “can’t nobody tell me anything”. So many men can’t take advice from another man about their successes, failures, relationships, and opportunities. And Deion is proving just how impactful it is to be led by men. He can lead these young men because he allowed himself to be led by pastors, coaches, and other men. I just wish all men thought like this. And the same go for women too. Awesome interview just awesome.
Man every tim ei look for his sweaters he wears i cannot find one :(
Such a well spoken coach, leader and most of all *father*
Love watching Deion.  The real deal!
I pride myself on being a great father/dad. That hit me because that’s what I pride myself on. No matter how much I make and what I do if I can’t pour into my kids none that matters. From one father to another I salute you Coach Prime
I already loved Prime. This made me appreciate him more
I just love prime ... I love everything about him
“A work force draft.”   Coach Deion “Prime” Sanders is truly ahead of everyone else.
So much jewelry came out this man’s mouth! She was a great interviewer with awesome questions and the know how to allow prime time speak in totality.
Love this interview
Great Interview 🙌🏾
I’m from Florida! Let me know mane!!!
He's so inspiring. Such a great dude
She's a really good interviewer amongst other things
Yessir pop prime 😂💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 I want shedeur to show his tail sat 😤😤😤😤
Does "the 4th Quarter" mean being an NFL Coach?
That quote from the 80's is the bomb!
You are seeing God Blue Print of a coach.
Please explain why you dislike Coach Prime.
Prime is making America great again!!!
What a great interview...Deion really has a clear mind
31:15  greatest answer I ever heard 😂 prime is really the man
Prime is definitely a Preacher with a coaches whistle
It sounds like Coach Prime is getting a cold.
He chose me because he trust me that's some 🔥🔥🔥❣️
Winning just makes everything better
Love this interview but I think the production value was lacking. Taylor deserves 60 minutes type of quality by now. They didn’t even put a solo camera shot on her, for her questions. Primes breathing on the mic was a little distracting as well. Just speaking from a technical perspective.
With everything going on in our country and the current state of Black “culture”….how can you not root for this man? He’s truly a man of god and a man of great character. Most importantly, he’s a wonderful father raising his children the right way for the whole world to see. If you can’t respect that….your whole perspective is wack. Major salute to coach Prime and the Colorado Buffs. This is deeper than football. He is Black Excellence.  Outstanding interview! 👏🏿👏🏿 Taylor Rooks is the TRUTH. 🫡💯
In any arena, a great coach sees more in you than what you see in yourself and holds you not to the standard of what you are but what you will become. You can clearly see that with Deion
Tracey like girl quit flirting with my man
Spectacular interview! "Moments that are consistent translates into monuments, and I'm a monument not a moment"
Taylor Rooks that was absolutely a great interview...
Am I I tripping or does it seem like Coach Prime is Breathing kinda heavy?
When he spoke about Jimmy horn jr I choked up. That hit deep.
Prime my son is 11, I'm trying to reach him to be smart, fast, tough, discipline, with character...he  coming
Gotta be a awesome feeling to be able to coach ur sons.. i dunno why people criticize him for that sometimes saying daddy ball
Yo... catch it.
“My game was to loud”  “Deion Sanders “
Not go lie I wish my dad was like prime 😢😢😢
Just know Coach Prime nor his players start anything but will not sit by if someone is dissing them.  Coach Prime NEVER says anything negative about a coach or team and neither does the team. CP made positive complimentary comments in his press conference about Norvell. Then Norvell criticizes CP appearance/style and question his raising. So Coach Prime used that to motivate his team.  CSU had 17 penalties and 9 were personal fouls and a target on Sheduer. It was obvious Norvell either encouraged his players to take Travis and Sheduer out or he CONDONED it. Most respectable coaches would be yelling at their players for 17 penalties or taking that dirty hit player out of game at least a few plays but no.  This player gave Travis a cheap shot AFTER the ball hit the ground, the ball was out of bounds and the whistle was blown.  The dirty player postured over Travis and as he was walking off field his teammates were dapping him up. Undisciplined players = bad coaching Coach Prime is an excellent coach. The people who don’t like him are worried and jealous. Deion Sanders has been Prime time since Florida state. He is not arrogant, he is confident. People are insecure about a successful, confident head black coach. Coach Prime is a good man and teaches his team hard work and to respect their opponents. Sheduer is a good kit but he isn’t going to sit down and let another man trash talk his father. CSU walked over to where CU players were warming up. Mind you, CSU had the other half of the 100 td field to warmup on. The players walked across the field and started throwing the balls right in the middle of CU players. Then started trash talking first. Sheduer was throwing to Travis and a CSU player batted the pass away laughing. So CU players responded and CU coaches went on field breaking argument up keep their players back. One of the CSU coaches started cussing out the players and threatening them.  I’m tired of the false narrative going around that CU are arrogant and instigators. That is not true at all. CU players are not backing down from attempted intimidation and trash talk if started by other coaches or players.  People are jealous of all the media attention CU gets but of course it’s bc their coach is a well known elite player who was the best ever at his position who is 1st ballot HOF. He has celebrity friends and NFL past and present players are his friends and they want to support him. When the players are meeting or practicing it is all serious focused business. Coach Prome has hired experienced talented coaches. Coach Prime is in no way arrogant or selfish. Haters try to spread that narrative. “Don’t let my confidence interfere with your insecurity” - Deion Sanders He wants some of his practices and players throughout their day on video. That’s for the players, not him. He wants his players to get as much media attention as possible to benefit them. So they will be recognized and have a better chance to be noticed by the NFL. NFL recruiters from every team have been at their practices and games. They have several teams scouts at every practice. Coach Prime loves his players. Thank you for being fair and honest in your podcast. When I saw the word “spectacle” in your headline I figured you wear more jealous haters but no.
Taylor the 🐐 for making this happen
I love how he never forgets to mention his other kids when they ask about one
Best Coach Prime CU Interview looking forward to a follow-up at the end of CU football season.
Taylor Rooks was AWESOME!!!
🇭🇹💪🏿👁🔥💤🧬
Coach Prime understands Emotional Intelligence!!!!!❤
One of the very best interviews! That 60 Minutes interviewer was horrible
Can they turn down the man’s mic? I don’t want to hear him breathing it takes away from the discussion.
Seems I hear lots of heavy breathing from Deion indication of lots of pain.
Deion Melanin on glow mode....Deion, Ali and Mayweather understand something that the vast majority don't.
When you have FAITH in GOD...  Whatever GOD YOU serve EVERYTHING will fall into place...🙏🏼❤
Isn’t odd he has the same birthday as Whitney Houston ♌️ 🔥.
you can't catch multiple interviews within the same, dang near a month, where he says something completely different in each one.
Taylor Rooks might be one of the finest women walking the Earth.
Lord have mercy!!! I have been struggling in my career and personal life for several months, just feeling stuck. I started following Coach Prime daily when he got to Jackson. Since he's been in Colorado, he has motivated me right up outta my seat. Everyday I watch a video, I find some different nuggets to set me on fire!!! He is so motivational, encouraging and uplifting. I thank God for his son's daily media coverage because it's helping me. I feel like I'm Prime!!!! Thank you.
The way he use his words is amazing man, he’s the perfect role model
There is just nobody like Prime!!  He it!!
Well he is not JUST America’s 🇺🇸 Coach he is the World’s 🌍 Coach ! I’m in South Africa 🇿🇦 and I’ve been Coach Prime like nobody’s business. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
It's going to be crazy how all the same media outlets are going to switch up on Prime once they lose 1. Sad world. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Jimmy horn Jr story almost had me in tear talking about his father and the inmates cheering. It’s a Shows a great deal of leadership knowing your people and knowing how to get the most of of them, just having someone that really believes in you! We support you Coach Prime
I don’t care too much about him/ being a coach. But who’s making all this money behind the scenes? Is there any black person profiting off this or just purely white greedy Neanderthal recessive gene people
18:44 Workforce draft? That is a phenomenal idea! Some of the best people that I worked with were former college football players and I work in tech
The Horn story was deep 😢
Not go even lie I rewind the part that dress came up at the start imagine waking up next to that Beautiful Woman every morning IM going in every day
I love Deion's brutal honesty. The faith speaks to it abundantly. He is a model the culture needs during these times.
This interview was nothing less than Legendary . One of the greatest I’ve ever watched . Salute to the interviewer and Coach Prime . Amazing
Great job 👍
DEION the man of  God!
🔥🙏🏾🙏🏾
Amazing interview. The best one with him i have seen so far.
It’s crazy this chick so elegant these days. Back in middle school days boy she was trying out is all I cud say lol
Deon did a free Fathers day event in Frisco Texas, at the Main Event bowling alley. Charles Haley we there also. He gave away free autographed footballs, he was kicking it with us big time.   Saw him at Church a few times, even spoke with him on twitter once of twice when he was doing his reality show. He inspires me so much, the anointing is all over that man. I am a better man because I was able to have him as an example, even vicariously.
After they play Oregon and USC, I’ll let you know if I Believe.
Great interview
‘ … for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.’  Matt 12:34
Every one of them boys will leave that school as MEN. Deion aint just a football coach.
GM-Coach, Why did your Mom name you Deion Sanders and the spelling? Coach- Who is Travis Hunter’s father?
🤝🏿
Vote Deion for President!!!🎉
Great job great interview word of advice, fire, your cameraman
Taylor you bad
Many blessings to Coach.. By the way! Taylor Rooks is so fineeeeee....Bermuda
A workforce draft for the athletes who don't go pro, but have the intelligence, the grades, and leadership skills !!!  What a great idea !
shilo its time to become prime work ethic and swaggg lets go
Idk this talented lady doing the interview, but she is one of the best I’ve seen in along time. She gets a lot of questions while still getting the deep details. She classy! Great job!!! I hope we see more interviews
Taylor should have her own show on TV because this interview was informative and insightful and makes the CBS 60 Minute interviews look like fingerpainting by a two-year old Chucky protege'
So I have two boys, 6 & 2 years old. I have a great dad and all my life I’ve tried to be like him. Along the way it seems I forgot to be me. Along comes Prime and shows that you can be you and still be the best dad possible. Honestly, this man inspires and helps me all the way across the world. The pure strength and love and honesty of the man. We’re looking at something great happening in front of our eyes people.
An adult daughter sitting on her father's lap is a cause for concern 😟.   Creepy!!!
Work Force Draft 💯
The father we all needed love you prime ❤❤
Coach Prime is such an inspiration all around the world of Postivity there is just No room for Negativity at all
Taylor is super fine.
CONGRATULATIONS COACH PRIME TIME & HIS PRIME TIME TEAM!!!❤❤❤🏈🏈🏈👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤...BEEN ROCKING WITH PRIME TIME SINCE THE 80'S AND 90'S WHEN HE PLAYED FOR THE ATLANTA FALCONS AND THE ATLANTA BRAVES!!!❤❤❤🏈🏈🏈⚾️⚾️⚾️👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉...WE LUV YA PRIME TIME AND PRIME TIME JR'S SHEDEUR & SHILO!!!❤️❤️❤️🏈🏈🏈👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
u wanna witness take heed "if i give u something i want something back"
Great interview by Taylor Rooks!💪🏾🇺🇸🏈🏆
Taylor should have her own show on TV because this interview was informative and insightful and makes the CBS 60 Minute interviews look like fingerpainting by a two-year old Chucky protege'
Loved this interview
Coach prime is everything lavar ball wants to be.
🔥💨🛸
You feel so motivated after hearing him talk 😂😂😂
SORRY,  I HOPE SHE'S NOT A AGENT.... WITH THAT SHORT DRESS 👗... PROTECT DEION. BECAUSE THEY WANT HIM TO FAIL BE ANY MEANS NECESSARY.... EVEN OUR OWN PEOPLE.... FACTS !!!
Work
"I'm pleasing God and not man!" Deion Sanders
This interview was beautiful. Thank you for the inspiration.
Deion & company is going to do what Deion does. I'm not worried about that. I focusing on that beautiful young lady and those beautiful legs.
Need that JIMMY HORN NETFLIX SERIES…. Real talk
He’s building CEO
As an African-American man that group in the states and grew up in the hood in the 70s and 90s in Los Angeles I had a really tough upbringing but I tell you I was lucky enough to study Buddhism and I move to Thailand and I realized that as a Black Culture we are very emotional like he says we let our emotions direct our actions once you realized that meditation calming down analyzing relaxing deep breathing before you reacting learn to respond and not react! thats my 2 cents!
Fathering
Great microphones.. I heard every breath from Deion.. lol, great interview though!!!
Underestimated…. Accurate assessment
Heavy breathing Deion!!
IIIIIIGHT….
I know how too Handle ME
Mental JUDO AT ITS FINEST
This was a great interview!
Anger is NOT FROM THE DIVINE
Coach Prime take over college football 🏈 You are doing a great job 🏆👍
MEN: NEVER ALLOW EMOTIONS TO DETERMINE YOUR ACTIONS
FatherFigure
Essence of CONFIDENCE
Wow! Ive never got done with watching an interview and said " I need to watch that again" until now. That was more like a mini sermon.
Now it makes sense why Shedeur needed help from the referees in Colorado.He spends more time looking at cars than his playbook or being in the film room.
Always gotta tether some white man to a black persons success.  Where tf was Nick Saban when Prime was coaching peewee?  Winning 3 State Championships as a high school coach?  Tom Brady came around AFTER Shedeur EARNED a name for himself.  I like Taylor but JFC, can black journalists leave this narrative in the fxcking past?
I got teary eyed when he told what he said to jimmy horn. Speaking life in to someone can definitely make a difference
Can he run for President? May be the only person that can get the budget balanced.😁
Blessings. Coach Prime ⚡️
Powerful interview Miss Rooks thank you 🙏
19:00-19:38 ❤
Sage words Prime. But I stayed bc I thought she was gonna show us some sweet… something! That girl fire!!! L Let me get a nipple ❤
Taylor pretty
Taylor Rooks😍😍😍
PRIMEETIMEE BABYY😂!!!❤
Taylor fine af
The world’s greatest father! We loving it here in Memphis! I’ve seen so many great fathers right here! Go Prime! Show them who we really are! 💪🏿 I’m ordering me a pair of shades! I support everything about you! Win, loose or draw! “I want a work job draft for my players.” Wow !!
Mr. Sanders...You tooo REAL...You Kept me SMILING...What A Great Compliment To That Beautiful Sister...We Are So Happy For ALL OF Them..THE BRIGHTEST AND THE BEST...YOU GO BOYS .. I'm WATCHING... STAY WOKE AMERICA...
Straight up Florida born an raised,love you home boy ❤ im down with u prime to the wheels fall off from Florida state to you coaching you always made Florida proud of you!!!
If you get tired of getting motivated speeches, step to the side, get out the building.
This interview is great. Share it with everybody.
Prime breathing hard… he want that young cookie and she going!!!
This is the beyond 🎉 inspirational. Everything top to bottom about this full 💯  content is amazing. So amazing @Taylor Rooks & @Coach Prime ❤️‍🔥
Coach Prime is a great motivational speaker
Does anyone have the link to where i can purchase the hoodie Prime is wearing?
Wish they would have turned his mic down, you can hear every breath he took
Taylor Rooks is an amazing journalist. Coach prime is a God blessed man
Great interview,  consistent positive vibes throughout the interview. 💯
Prime just don’t miss!!! This energy is different….
Shaking up the good old boy. It was going to eventually happen, it took him to do it, and this is society. They want to let you do it. They'll let you do it. They don't. They won't. This place would be a lot of better place. If you're in so much racism in it, country will be a lot further. It wasn't so stupid about to color people's skin about slavery. Not trying to go backwards instead of forward. That's the other side ideology. Peace to everyone.
Taylor is something special tuff
The best interview!
He is right to his purpose and that is what motivated me
Brilliant as usual, emotions will mess you up. It is best for the most part to be analytical and keep those emotions in check, you got to have a strong mindset, this society this world hates it when a black man has confidence and can back it up. They don't want you to be smart. They just want to be a dumb job. I don't want you to have money and know how to use it, I wish the whole Colorado organization the best. Keep it up! Coach prime, great content.
“I’m not a moment, I’m a MONUMENT” SMH Deion Sanders you are truly one of Gods Generals!
Amazing interview!!!
Props to deion .. i couldn't think straight sitting next to her fine azz. Frfr
I have a strong feeling that the big wedding will be soon maybe when the two children graduate college or get drafted whatever comes first. Coach Prime has been engaged since 2019.
“Everybody wants to be the man, until it’s time to be the man”  WOW that speaks volumes 😮
One of the most insightful, motivational and intelligent interviews - wow phenomenal.
Whatever rewards for sports interviewers this year she should get an espy, emmy, Whatever the hell lol award 🙌🏾 great interview
We a monument this ain’t  no moment🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 in Jesus name amen
This interview was amazing she is going to go far an this was a super dope one right here she did that
Pastor Dewey Smith I love him! He can sang😊
Get your young men to Colorado! ❤❤❤
The best  interview period) is so much better than that 60 minute garbage salute to Taylor and Coach Prime , unfortunately you would never be able to please everybody so just be you salute
Who was on sound this day?? terrible audio
GOD, you are so awesome and wise! You are truly using this MOG to CAPTIVATE ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL men around this world, to be an example of how to be a MOG, a Dad, a husband etc…….. WOW! I see it Jesus! to God be the glory!! THIS IS WAAAAAAAAY beyond football 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈 🔥🔥🔥
Cormoni was a mistake. He's not tough, discipline and no character. That's why he cant get on the field and they nedd him in the worst way.
This is so fun to watch him lifting so many people up.  Literally millions of people.
Say what you want but this brother is undeniably God led and bred.
This is the best interview Taylor Rooks has done and this is probably the best I have seen from coach prime !!! Blessings ❤
Coach is HYPED!  Breathing all hard and everything.
I love deion he got swag everything JUST hear me out here i don't think that he can coach actually nobody else outside of his son that playing QB you heard what deion said in that youtube channel he told both of his sons that they are not going to nfl yet he been coaching his son since pee wee to high school now two colleges and I don't know that if his son can be coach by no one other than his dad that's the only  coach he knows and samething goes for deion,jackson state players came over to colorado that why deion is so successful he knows his players inside out
Amazing interview!!!
Guy changed the NFL fr…quarterbacks were throwing to him like it was on purpose.  First time thought it was a mistake.  Second time I was like these bozos…
I understand Shedur & Travis (out for now and love them so much) but SHILOH is a Dawg…definitely a NFL Draft Pick!! Team HEADACHE GAME “CEO” #21…Shiloh you are “DOPE”:..keep it that energy young man…you got this!!
Some of these people don’t get it, this is an ANOINTED man of God on his God given assignment/mission that’s what makes him different and why he’s making such an impact!!!
Its simple HE speaks WE listen so much food for thought my head is over weight in 59 minutes 😂😂
one word... legendary... (in shedeur voice)
Great interview
"STAFF" is crazzyyyy @15::39
Monument I had to look it up lol 😂 makes sense now lmao 😅
Molly wore em BETTER! Still cute though!
Agreed.  Taylor’s in the house. 🙌🙌🙌
57:00 I hope Curt gets the help and redemption in his walk with God.. after some of his recent actions he has taken that seems to come against The word of God.  I pray that I am wrong, but if I am not... I pray he is delivered and redeemed IJN.
Awesome Awesome interview!!!! I love me some Coach Prime. I’m watching and cheering for you and the Buffs!!! ❤
56:00 That is exactly how I felt.. I know that feeling.. when you say something, and it amazes yourself.   Remembering it is even tougher but if remembered will be a quote.
He breathing mad hard 😂
Taylor is the best interviewer I have seen . She lets the person talk . May God enlarge your career Taylor...And coach prime is the best ever and his God is proud of him
This is a wonderful interview
We Love You Coach Prime! ✊🏾
I don't know how you can not be a fan of Coach Prime. I wasn't a big fan of his as a player, mainly because he was really good, a showboat and never played for my Bears. Lol/ But I always respected his abilities and especially marveled at how he was another crossover NFL/MLB player. But now I'm a huge fan. I never expected Sanders to be the underdog, but he's amazing in this role and I absolutely love the wisdom mixed with the told you so attitude he gives off. I'm rooting for big upsets the next 2 weeks at Oregon and home vs USC.
Great Interview ❤
I love coach. Pimping Prime his words align perfectly. Walk it like he talks it !!
“I’m a monument not a moment“ 🔥🔥 that’s a bar
I got to say, them blenders are off the chain. Last Friday and Saturday I saw Mr. Coach Prime give them Blender glasses to the people on ESPN First Take, The Pat Mcafee show, the crew on ESPN College GameDay, the crew on Fox and more covering the CU vs CSU game. Easily 20+ people, men and women and NOT ONE PERSON looked bad or even average wearing Coach Primes glasses. To me it was impressive cause not everybody looks good wearing glasses let alone 20+ people wearing the same style and color. Every person I saw looked like Rich, A list celebrities or the Swag dripp’n and most of the people I saw, i wouldn’t characterize as attractive between a 7 and 10  on a 0 to 10 scale. Typically I don’t like glass or look good in them but damn I want a pair of Prime’s Blender. What can Mr Coach Prime not do? That man has been winning at life and everything he does or has done since birth. I’ve followed him since is FSU days to The NFL to broadcasting, business ventures, being an analyst, mentor and coaching young people at peewee football and every single level to where he is at now. In over 30 years, I can’t remember or think of time on or off the field getting into trouble or embarrassing himself, his teammates, friends and his family. I can’t recall him ever using profanity or being disrespectful or in any legal trouble. I know someone people don’t like his style, the man just believes in himself and bets on himself. Take away all the accolades and fame and I bet you he’d still be the same man he is today and teach people of all ages, gender, nationality, race or ability for them to believe in themselves like he does and like how he believes them. Any parent had a child that grew up to be just half of what Coach Prime is would be extremely proud of their child. Honestly he’s the perfect roll model and seriously that’s no bullshit. Shit I wish I was 25% of what Coach Prime. The man is just a winner at the game of life. He has that locked down just as good if not better than him locking half a football field by himself. I believe and nobody can price me wrong (mic drop!)
Where can I get this hoodie
STMG
Bless 😊
*What is her name again?*  (I can rewind or check the description.. of course) She did her job well.. I appreciated all of her questions and return to journalism.. my gosh.   She is going places.. and so shall it be for *Taylor Rooks* Amen!
CSU coach is a black man and is the first person to insult coach prime this season.
Prime time is the right time for our Country. ❤❤❤😂
The Goat
Taylor rooks 😋😋😋
Awesome interview!  Great flow.
Coach Prime is a living Lengend... 🙌 👌 💯
Amazing. Now how long before the media attack and try to rip him apart for who knows that. Pray that he has anointed protection. Because y’all know America. Build you up to break you down. What an inspiration though. A loving doting father.
I really enjoyed this interview,  Coach Prime and this young lady Taylor, great job all the way around.
This is a beautiful interview. Wow. Helped him be shown in his strong ways.  So amazing.  The way he played. In every way.  This was amazing. Thank you.  I want the glasses
One of One!
Coach Prime is Mr America… i can’t tell you when is the last time I watch a college football game, but I watched & watching all Colorado games since prime have arrived…
Coach prime my dad too at this point I listen too him and his speeches everyday like I’m there with him💯
Je nay say kwa
GREAT INTERVIEW
Good video
That was an Excellent interview Continued Success to both🥂
"Learn the lesson stop stressing an attack the blessing" WOW
Why is he breathing so fast????
*Black men in America and general get STEREOTYPED by the minority of the world which makes the majority believe it. Meanwhile those same people have confirmed through THEIR research black men spend more time with their kids than all other ethnicities GLOBALLY!!!*
I’m pleasing God not man - Prime
Deion sanders is so inspiring and Taylor rooks is a damn good interviewer
But ppl have to understand, HE WONT WIN EVERY GAME. So don't write him off after his first loss.
I saw it was an hour and said , shi lemme watch 10 minutes, ain’t no way I was watching an hour, but nah they got me😭prime you something else
Gotta love coach prime!!!!
Jason Whitlock somewhere crying and punching air. Wish that brother would get the hate out his heart
Great interview, Taylor Rooks! 🎉 You’re masterful at creating a comfortable & trusting space to have a conversation. You weave in questions & observations that are insightful  and inspires folks to be reflective, vulnerable & transparent. Keep up the fantastic work!
Why everybody say the state of Colorado?
This interview is phenomenally better than what 60 Minutes did hands down. 💯
If you don't understand the movement then you probably need to evaluate yourself 😁
19:13 the reason he's the best!
Taylor is gonna be the goat. I'm talkin lisa salters level goat..  You cant teach what she has. Looks. Skills. Charisma. Total package...
Where can I get that hoodie
We are living it with him❤especially me lets goo ...
She's beautiful 😍,,,,and coach prime is unmatched energy 💯
Discernment is one of the ultimate gifts to pass on to a child.
His breathing is concerning. Be well PRIME
🎉🎉🎉
Taylor Rooks> Malika Andrews
CHESS OVER CHEXKERS
the shade is like the white gloves from Michael Jackson
Amazing Interview!
Damn Prime that hoody goin crazy. I need one to match my shades
Great interview 👍🏾
Be great on the field and lead with class of the field. CU. Deion is a good man because he values being a father.
People who are praying and hoping that Colorado loses/fails never accomplished anything in life and they’re insecure with themselves when they see someone with this much confidence and faith like Coach Prime. Coach Prime is changing college football whether you like it or not. Better start BELIEVING!!! 💯💯💯
She should not be wearing that outfit. She needs to cover down more..females are lost setting people up
This is probably the best Coach Prime interview I've seen. Helps to have an hour, but Taylor asked some amazing questions to have a really nice and insightful interview.
AMEN AMEN AMEN NOW!!! WE ARE HERE NOW!!! PRAYER CHANGES EVERYTHING NOW!!! MATTHEW 6-9-15 NOW!!! OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN NOW!!!
Colorado losing a game will not stop the movement. Prime himself knows how hard it is to go undefeated in college football. It's the haters that can't wait to say "I told you they weren't the best". Mind you, we're talking about a 1st year college football team that just went through a complete rebuild. FIRST YEAR and they cannot wait to see them lose. LMAO that's hilarious to me.
Don't think she is understanding the conversation
I love Deion but man you know exactly why they thought Jacksonville wasn’t going to translate because it’s a black school we need to stop pandering to these white folks comfortability
People don’t like him because they don’t like themselves, keep being you coach prime
Well done Ms Rooks!😊
Amazing show.
I rebuke all negativity in the name of Prime time😅
Never been a college fan until him
Rumor has it Taylor still has a smile on her face after leaving Deion's house the morning after this interview!
I love it
Picture this u cant walk without pain from 3 Quarter this man his painkillers are off u still see him going beside the line jumping! How in hell can that not motivate u this man breath and life football! We Coming!
Coach Prime more people luv u than hate u. .we wanna c y'all Boyz shine💪🏽💯💪🏽
Love you deion sanders
Taylor is ❤
A “work force” draft for the players that won’t make the NFL is an amazing idea.. that’s a NCAA game changer , for EVERY sport..
I just don’t get the disdain ppl have for this man. It’s like him failing is the only thing they want and expected from Prime smh.
Sam! Please tie this man down so he can get much needed rest, and have a doctor check him out.  He’s breathing harder than normal along with that cough.  🙏🏾 Praying for him to stay healthy & strong
Coach breathing like Darth Vader
😎 these are yours for real
I need some of that formula 😮,
It's so easy to love this guy!
Walk in yo purpose. This little light…. Shine Deion. Shine ✨ ✨✨✨✨
Prime time 2028
Deion is amazing. Can we give some love to Taylor Rooks? This is the first time I’ve heard her and she was so prepared and professional. She understood him, his history and his present. Her questions were respectful and reflective of who he is. I am impressed.
So inspirational I've never seen a coach like this ever in college football I'm sure there's many great ones but deion in different
Coach Prime for President!!!
"I was primetime, then prime, now coach prime.  It's only the 3rd quarter and i'm highstepping." - that line was absolute ❤‍🔥
Taylor Rooks is H.O.T 🥵
😎🧢
I love this man .. I’m 30 and I get excited hearing him talk So I can only imagine what these young boys feel in the locker room it’s Primes time Fr
I just love him❤
This feel like a 60 mins interview...go girl..prime blessed you with this one...
What an interview. Wow.
Lou Young finna have a field day😂😂
I love Deion 😂😂
When McCaskill get back from injury the run game between the tackles will be on. Dylan will be that pass catching back. Alton can catch too.
Deion’s rizz game is next level😂
Florida is a mix of trenches and swag
Coach Prime is not a moment, he's a Monument! Prime said that with his chest poked out 💣💥💪🏿
He locked in on the legs lmaooo 😂
Deion Sanders has always been a man of impeccable fashion, as he reminded GQ when he said, "I don't follow trends, I set them." Yes indeed, Coach Prime. Yes, indeed! But once you started tucking your sweat pant's inside your tube socks you immediately became everyone's image of their  grandfather. 😐 Your status as a fashion icon in the culture has been revoked.
Excellent interview 🩷🩷🩷🩷
Such a phenomenal interview! Great work Taylor!
IOTY
This dude next level!
So many quotables from Coach Prime!!!  He is truly walking in his anointing!  Shout out to Taylor Rooks she lead a great interview AND she FINE FINE FINE!!!!
I've seen every interview with Coach Prime out there.  This one is--hands down--the best.
Deion exudes positivity and I ❤ it.
This interview was everything!
Deion's spiritual discernment and the spiritual gift of the Word of Wisdom are through the roof. No weapon formed against him, and the team willl not prosper!
Wow this one of the best interviews I ever witnessed. Love it so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
He's still such an entertainer! 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
Somebody said that’s the coolest 8 toed man on the planet 😂❤💯
“Moments that are consistent translates into monuments” 💯
College Football needed something NEW!  I LOVE IT.🤗😁🤗🏉🏈🏉 IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE!  THANKS, CP!🐐🐐🐐🏈🏉🏈
Taylor that was an exceptional interview!!!
First 7 minutes were classic.
The Reason his players love him is that he is giving them that manly confident.  He is also a  father to his players. Some of these Kids do not have a motivational or a  fatherly figure  like Coach Prime  in their life. He is one of a kind.  These Kids  will  go any  length   to give their best for him for the love he has for them. They do not want to let him down. These kids will remember the times they spent with Coach Prime for the rest of their lives.
T Rooks Great Interview one of the Best I’ve seen with Coach Prime ever. I’m more convinced now this is “God’s Plan”. Truly a purpose driven life Coach Prime
If this was early 90s or late 90's early 2000's she would of been one of his BM's
Deion you the MAN 🏆💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Prayers for Travis
Radooo
Buffs
Real one
All ight..dope Collab..
am I breathing heavy or is he breathing heavy?
I need to see Coach Prime with an Avengers roster. Go there, recruits!!
I love the way he intercepted the sunglasses comment, and ran it all the way back and turned the sunglasses into a sold out brand.
Taylor is a ROOKstar, pun intended. I’ve seen just about every CP/DS interview. So I know she studied the assignment even I learned some. Using Coach words, she *Dougie’d that thang*
"Me and my homey Winning, we know each other real well"😅😂😂😂
⚡️⚡️⚡️
Leader of men. Send your kid to him. Why wouldn't you?
That Work Force Draft is about to come to fruition.
Nick saban can’t compare because he never played at that level.  He will never have the knowledge of Deion. Deion will only rise.
i have a terrible attention span and this brotha had me locked in for an hr😂
I pre-ordered some blenders, should be here by December lol. Deion sanders great athlete, better father!
Prime Time
This will be a VIRAL VIDEO. The intelligent line of questioning and poise of Taylor (appropriate adjustments were made-happy to see it). The intimacy and transparency of Prime. I do not think I have ever seen him open up like this in interviews. Definitely not with the big box cable channels. Been a supporter for many many years. Really such a phenomenal interview.
Most of y’all are the biggest haters on this fuckin earth! Get a life
Coach giving you that game
Love you❤❤❤❤❤CP
She fine❤
That interview was awesome.  Thank you for this blessing.
if Shedeur gets drafted by the Falcons?
My goodness!! What an interview!!
A Great interview 💯💯💯!!
Coach Prime is so smart.Very well spoken.Much respect
“When you are consistent, you make monuments.” I am a monument!! Powerful!!💥💥💥
nice legs ...
Coach is a true salesman
Big coach prime
You were Neon Deon Prime TIME First
She is a phenomenal interviewer ❤
Glad I’m living to witness this ✊🏽🤎
prime 4 president
DO YO THANG 💥 WE'RE WATCHING  🏈 STAY BLESSED 🙏
Came for Coach Prime, stayed for Taylor Rooks.
Wonderful
*_GOD and COACH PRIME_**  ----->  They Got This*
Deion like a living pimp who aint cussin and his pimpin the game of football, spitting solid game... love it... im all in with prime. One of my fav athletes all time
Coach Prime is so in his purpose, calling, and the plan for his life in this time. The energy of every moment during this interview documenting his responses shows it. In my Rock voice (It's electric)! It's so inspiring for anyone who will allow themselves to be inspired for their calling/purpose in their industry or other area of life. Truly limitless!! Congrats to him, the team, staff, institution, and US who are witnessing it!! Love it! Much continued success @drjeanco
How is Deion over 6 feet tall and she makes him look small lol.
Coach Prime will continue to Have Great Success Throughout His Coaching Career because God Is Using Him To Enact Change. This Is Much Bigger Than Football. When God Calls You To Do Something, He Will Equip You With Everything You Need To Be Victorious. God Bless Coach Prime, His Staff, His Family and The Entire Colorado Buffalo Football Team 🙏🏽🏈
Dang. She's a great interviewer. Great queations; great follow-ups
THAT's A BAD MAN!!!!!
🙏🏾🙌🏾😇🙏🏾🙌🏾😇
That needs to be put on a shirt ( I’m not perfect but I’m present)  That is a powerful saying a lot of Men need that.
Best interviewer/interview I've seen with Dion. Thank you so much. I pray you stay healthy and confident and keep doing what God blessed you to do! 🙏😇🙏😇🙏
Was he breathing loudly?
Fire interview first time here
Deion doesn't mind being confident but he's honest. Made it clear he didn't actually play 2 sports in one day he just showed up to two games. That story has been passed down so often you lose track of the truth
He got me trying to fix my mistakes as he speak. He got me motivated
Great interview. I feel Prime's annointing and people won't always understand, but they're not supposed to. Keep glowing, growing and going. In your corner. I see God in you and I'm glad for the people who are blessed to be in your altitude.
The irony of Coach Saban being interviewed yesterday and talking very high about Coach Prime
Well said Mr Sanders      Amen
Mmmm K ... both R dressed 👗 😍 4 success ... prime definitely got Dat 👌 💯 merch buffed uP but ol gurL gotta great dress don't like tha shoes buttt loVin da viewz WINK
You know ima give you the glory before they write the story Jesus Christ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
Take the good with the bad thanks...
We love you coach
The world is going to flip on him as soon as colorado loses
Spanking Incoming
This man is DIFFERENT! Coaches/parents pay attention he said a “WORK FORCE DRAFT!”…. I never in my life seen a college coach put there kids in position for a “CAREER” if football don’t work! Also with his corporate connections I see every kid come out this program with a promised future!
16:50 do yall think he was talking about Carmani McClain?  I dont know😅 46:52 talking about him again 😂. Yeah Mclain isnt playing this season. And i dont blame Deion
Taylor so fine🔥Deion toes gonna grow back!
I said it once and I will say it again.  If you have followed this man's journey from JSU to present time, you are witnessing the greatest football movie ever. In real time.
I just LOVE this BROTHER, we Florida boys are ONE! Go head Coach PRIME! PHENOMENAL interview!
Taylor Rooks so fine she got coach Prime spittin rhymes!
Females are to be seen not heard especially about sports 💯
Prime is Not just a coach his a pastor in life❤❤❤❤
Cold Part is Deion can take anyone's girl or mom if he wanted😂😂😂
This man is black excellence. Mentoring on another level❤
As my mother would say.. “Favor ain’t Fair”.. Blessings Coach Prime to all your endeavors and the people you touch along the way. 💪🏽🙏🏽 Go Buffs!! 🦬🦬
Clearly, Deion’s father not being in his life had a tremendous impact on him
Yes coach prime.
she started the interview like a news reporter  lol.......but the questing got better
That Hoodie 🔥
Deion is always great but I gotta give credit to Taylor Rooks for killing this interview!! 👏🏽 🔥
Coach PRIME!!
Fantastic interview! Well done Taylor and Prime👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
my man practices with the team thats why he was breathing so heavy
💪🏿💪🏿💯
I never really watched Deion....he is SO awesome/dynamic...his Son Shedeur is Deion reincarnated😇👑
Once a player always a player!!my man smooth like butter
One of the things that really struck me was when he spoke about an employment draft for his players because he knows 85% won’t go pro. That is a huge leg up! Huge!
Moments that are consistent translate to  monuments fiancé is a monument not a moment. Come on now.
I respect Prime for doing the interview Bec he looks tired. Everytime he talked during this interview he was out of breath right after
I really enjoyed that. Black Excellence
Man Lou gunna have a field day with this one 😂😂
Bro is on his square at all times man
Coach are you nervous or what quit. Breathing so hard😂😂
Taylor brought out the best in Coach Prime 🏈
Deion is reaping what he sowed! He knows the Lord Amen!! May God continue to bless Mr. Sanders & his family! ❤
Feel l7ke he talking about mcclain
mehn, that woman is intelligent, classy, and fine af!!! sheeeeesh!
EVERYBODY WANNA BE HIM UNTIL ITS TIME TO BE HIM!!!! COACH PRIME,,,HATERS ARE HATING BECAUSE YOU ARE THE SHINING LIGHT THAT BRINGS LIFE TO EVERYTHING & YOUR NOT AFRAID TO LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE BRIGHT!!!! MOST PEOPLE THESE DAYS CELEBRATE BUMS WITH NO HEART NO MORALS NO PURPOSE!!! COACH PRIME PUT FEAR IN THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE IS UNAPOLOGETICALLY HIMSELF & COACH PRIME IS A MAN OF CHARACTER & MORALS!!!!!
Absolutely great Interview. Great insight, great questions, great personification of a real, insightful and knowledgeable interviewer and interviewee.  Real all day long.
Awesome interview
Prime got so much swag he could hit Taylor fr 💯
Thy rod and thy staff isn’t referring to employees but it flowed 😅
She fine as hell!! ❤Bae come here…🥹🤣
Interview is great
Always looking forward to coach Primes speaks everyday. It’s like poetry ❤
FANTASTIC INTERVIEW!!! 💯💯💯💯🙌🏾🙌🏾
Put me in coach👀 she know she wild for that🤣
She's really pretty.
29:17 where those real claps or a edit?
Deion be breathin awful heavy.
13:36 “Tap me on my back!” 😂😂🔥🔥 this a real life GOAT! The talk different.
Taylor Rooks did an Excellent job, Well Done!
If Deion single bruh betta shoot at Taylor fine azz
🐐
Coach Prime is beyond legit
“Dat Florida” is ❤
She is bad asf
Coach Prime is everywhere, all the time, love this man.
Great interview. I’m concerned about Coach Prime’s breathing.
I Love Attractive/Females Journalists/Host Like Taylor Rooks💋😉😚☺️😊🥰😍🤩😘& I Rock With Prime Since 96
Nigga breathing hard af lmao
I’m a whole monument!! 👊🏾💯‼️🔥
I’m convinced that the people that don’t like Deion have never experienced the love and the respect he has for others and are intimidated by the confidence he has in himself. It’s so foreign to them the rebel against it and want him to fail. The want him to feel how they feel daily because they aren’t even proud of themselves.
At this point anyone that doubts his ability to coach are just haters. He's proven himself over and over again. Hell i'm a 44 year old white woman and he's got me wanting to put on a helmet and pads!! I love absolutely everything about Coach Prime and his football program!!❤
Awesome Interview!!
I had something I needed to do and I just paused and had to enjoy this. This was amazing
How in gods name is every one of his interviews a motivational speech. This guy is what’s up.
Let's go coach prime
Need both Dad and coach Yes both is necessary!!!
Characteristic of the Buffalo 🦬 he runs to the storm. The sooner it attacks the challenge, the sooner its over! Let's go Buffs
I feel like Prime needs to slow down a little … he breathing heavy and forgetting words I just pray he not over doing it🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
You can't help but love Coach Prime
I..WANT..THAT..HOODIE!!!!!
Hes my preacher man he gets me through the day as regular person
Great interview
That was beautiful.   Great interview!
Taylor is the GOAT of one on one interviews.
The thing that's crazy is he literally 1 of 1... no other college can duplicate prime...
Teach How to be a man
Exceptional
Best interview ever
Taylor Rooks... YOU GO GIRL
She showing and shaking her legs, she ready for Prime Time. She said put her in Coach!😅
Unfortunately the audio is terrible :( it’s hard too watch I was so excited
Beautiful interview.  We here until the wheels fall off with Coach Prime.
🦬🦬🦬ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW THIS WAS A GREAT INTERVIEW 🦬🦬🦬 WE HERE.
We don’t do that no second I told my daughter she got a scholarship for tennis graduated this year. Yes I am grateful but I always told her no one can beat you and be in. You don’t be a carbon copy.
“Once you figure that out, you will learn the lesson, you will stop stressing, and attack the blessing!”
THE BEST interview of Coach Prime I’ve ever heard. It’s in my saved folder. It’s like it was made for me and I’m going to listen again and again for wisdom sake. I’m firmly planted in watching and praying for the team’s success. National championship is on the way real soon… watch ❤
National Championship in 2yrs 🏈💯
this is ain't no moment this a monument! PREACH👏
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👌🏾 job well done👌🏾. Excellent interview with a nice spin at the end.
He is killing it at being a dad. If only every child had a Coach Prime in their life.
"You know before I write the story, Imma give you the Glory"💥 Coach Prime
💯💯💯
Her dress got it's own mind  you go girl 😍👍🏽
His hoodie is filthy 😍
Great interview with Dion aka Coach Prime.   His relationship with God is real and he gives God the Glory for all of his successes.  May God continue to light he and his team’s way!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Taylor Rooks is a really good interviewer
Coach Prime Breathing like Darth Vador 😂
I watch the game to see you and the buffs win...
Love this guy!!!❤
🙏🏿❤️
I’m going through the worst time of my life homeless and alone but hearing Deion speaks just makes me feel like I’m the happiest man alive
“I envision a darn workforce draft!” THIS!!!🎉👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Coach Prime cover your family, players and yourself with the blood of Jesus daily. In Jesus mighty name.
“You can’t help but have confidence because you’re prepared “.
Prime you're brilliant!!!
Taylor is a different type of fine ❤
This is bigger than football what Deion Sanders is doing right now. He literally changed the game!  In Jesus name Yahweh, please Bless and protect this man and his family. Amen 🙏 ✝️ Thank you sir
Absolutely, the best life. But a black man isn’t supposed to live his best life according to certain clowns of the world. Florida swagger is different from Colorado as a whole. When you as black man that’s bigger than the whole population of black Americans in this state, you are are threat. To be accurate we’re 4.09% of Black Americans in this state. This puts the whole country in a conversation as who knows best, when it comes to football. Or being a Coach. But this is bigger than all sports. This maybe too deep for the ones who don’t understand the level of Elites. Bottom line, keep hating. 😂😂😂Lol
Coach breathing the last few videos…🙏🏾🦬✌🏾🤎
Deion sick 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 get well soon legend
Great man! 💯
Such a great interview!!! ❤
Shedeur is gonna be legendary frr
“I’m doing the cabbage patch in my purpose” is wild🤣 how could you not love em
Work Draft for Jobs.....why haven't all these other coaches done this........😐....this is why they dont like Prime. Its a new day.
You know before the write the story I'm in my glory "Coach Prime"
Taylor Rooks is a good interviewer she is posed and ask the right questions. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤎
Its some ppl in the comments that dont believe. Yall not tired of doubting the constant results that Coach Prime continues to produce? Yikes!
They say Florida is crazy naw we just way different then others lol if u born and raised in Florida in the 70s or 80s u a rare beast lol believe I kno Orlando 80s baby right here
"Moments that are consistent translates into monuments." Deion Sanders 2023.
Love the Interview! Coach Prime is the best!
Great interview
Coach Prime doing his thing & so is the entire coaching staff
I absolutely love this Guy. He's real, he's fair and he's absolutely love the Lord. Amen 🙌🏾!!!!!
From growing up in Florida where football was our outlet to success to knowing coach prime personally he thinks real talk real acts real feel real with that said God knows who's to touch ❤
Ohh everytime she interviews somebody they start talking outlandish shit hope prime ain’t say no nonsense
Prime is a Confident Charismatic Caring Committed Called Coach!
I hate Deion arrogance so much. I’m tired of seeing Colorado everywhere. You know there’s other teams playing college football right?   - Most white men on Instagram right now when mentioning Colorado Football
That hoodie 🔥
Lou young got some work to do lol
RE Overhyped: unapologetically recruiting => documenting with purpose
Loved the interview...but the audio engineer dropped the ball on this one. Didn't clear up until 51mins in.
I feel like I’m witnessing a legacy being laid down into the history books
😂“Before they write the story, I’m gon’ give you the GLORY!”🔥Yes!😄🙌🏽✝️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Primetime in his bag on this interview. Lou Young is gonna do this skit on his page lol.
Coach Prime is a Class Act God fearing Man
🙏🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why would you say...white people cant play corner?  Its racist.  Its bot believing in god....the man is a joke
This audio is terrible. Great interview tho!
Great interview Taylor!!
He’s already the greatest athlete of all time, only BoJack can compete w that, now he’s on his way as a college HC
He said that.
That work draft is genius and that hoodie is fire 🔥
This dude has so much pure swag it’s amazing to watch
Did neon not say...white people cant play corner?  Blacks cant coach.  Its not racist.  Neon said it
So what is mr prime??  I heard you say that travis hunter text you early in the a.m. you change your times he texts you lets go on game day and change the words you use about the text from 1 interview to the next. was it late like 7 late or 9 late? just trying to keep up with the story
Man I’m so glad to witness this. Witnessing this is a dream. Words can’t describe how incredible this is.
They done let him get comfortable
Time is talkin that talk y'all💯👏🏿👏🏿
Current NFL running backs need to take a page outta prime playbook $$$
EVERYBODY WANNA BE DA MAN UNTIL ITS TIME TA BE DA MAN💪
Coach Prime speaks so eloquently! Its truly a beautiful thing to see him give God all the praise for his journey and success! And shout out to the interviewer she did a wonderful job! Better than that 60 minutes interview
Here, coach 🦾
Oregon 42 - Colorado 10
Why is Coach Prime breathing so hard?
When Jimmy Horn Jr was making that touch down against  CSU the look on his face was priceless!
Americans Dad 🙌🏽🙏🏽
Where can we get that hoodie at though
Coach Prime be dropping literal GEMS in all his interviews!!! ❤❤❤❤
Wow, I respect him even more. He gets it.. we're not talking church or religion. This man is talking an honest relationship, something we all struggle with as his people. But like I knew this is bigger than Football. Yah is using someone who in the world's eyes is viewed as selfish and promotes himself only. People, I keep saying we are more than you see. Yah is using him to prove his Glory and that fact. This is the reason why we are hated because of this. The Bible says my people will bless the nations, meaning other people. If you get my drift
2 days til this team gets smashed!!!  5 win team.  What a joke neon is
What happened when Deion Sanders at FSU didn't go to class his senior year? They called it the Deion Rules? Didn't go to class? Answer for that son. You players ask Terry Bowden? Coach Bobby Bowdens son?
Dion Sanders I love you but she have not interview everyone big she have never ever interview Michael Jordan she not on that level
Prime for president …
This man done made Colorado America’s Team and this will be the worse they’ll be during his tenure. That’s scary
Aye prime like the brown meat sistas he might pull up on tay lol
God for knew you before you even had a mother that echoe
if the team tht drafts shedeur offers prime bread he out lmao
Coach flirtin.. he excited... lol... my guy
Before they write the story, I’m gonna give Him!! glory
didn't give 2 fucks about college football before Deion sanders
Deion Sanders should announce he’s running for president
THE PEOPLES COACH
Coach Prime  culture is a real thing. When misunderstood can be a problem. We play the dozens have a belly laugh and go home. Others outside the culture may become deeply offended and wanna' fight frfr. Taking it personal meant ...'Let's play ball' for bragging rights, not a knife fight!
“You can’t be angry and wanna be blessed simultaneously” man you just changed my life straight up!
Lol man’s knew he said sum
Floyd Mayweather did the same thing and got the same results, when he went from "Pretty Boy Floyd" to "Money Mayweather" and has been laughing his way All the way to the Bank ever since - it works!
I’m here at 10k views, it’ll be a million in the morning. 😂
The bloom nearly popped off the flower last game. Whew!
How can you not love this man💪🏿
We lucky he’s not a Pastor bro will be a billionaire
what a guy Coach Prime is man I'm locked into college football these days 😂😂
Workforce draft? He's already the 🐐
D E I O N !!! Love you mannnnnn!!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤
“He who finds a wife finds a good thing”. Coach Prime may have found his next wife.
Wow! God is using him to impact so many on and off the football field. Well done Coach Prime!!!
I dont know how some of these parents are going to say no to this man!
This is America's coach...we all need this man.
When you’re truly great and give the glory to God (and I’m not even religious)…First they hate you then celebrate you
This is something else.  Prime is the real. If he doesn't win another game, he is still on top.  All time great.
Prime breathing hard
Coach prime is him 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Coach Prime ❤❤❤ 💯 💪
Man Taylor like that fr😍
🙏🏽🙏🏽💪🏾
MR. DEION SANDERS!!!!! NFL 1ST BALLOT OF FAMER... NFL ALL DECADE TEAM IN 1990'S...  NFL 100TH ANNIVERSARY TEAM.. 2X SUPER BOWL CHAMPION.. ONLY ATHLETE TO PLAY IN SUPER BOWL & WORLD SERIES!!!! SUCCESS BREEDS ENVY & JEALOUSY!!!!! CRABS IN A BARREL HATERS ARE JUST THAT,,,,CRABS IN A BARREL!!!!!
why the audio so bad
This has to be 1 of the best interviews I've ever seen, and  I love interviews, I love seeing what makes people tick. Taylor Rooks is a jewel. We need more journalists like her 37:24
I've noticed lately that Coach Prime breathes heavily a lot. It could be because he's always on the move, but I pray for his health.
Rock steady
Prime putting that game on. Rizz on rizz on rizz
He Trusted Me!💯
❤
Muhammad ali was brash. People love him. Donald Trump is brash, his people would die for him. Coach Prime is brash, and people can't get enough. People don't really care about  boring people, they like the guy who's loud and brash, but you have to be good to great. This is the way the world functions, and I love it.
44:41 - if you watch one of the behind the scenes video from well off, you can hear Shiloh telling Deion that he was going to church tomorrow. In another video, when they all met for brunch, Shiloh did in fact go to church and by himself.  😊😊  So he did what he said. :)
The walking & talking of Great affirmation, manifesting !
🛑🛑🛑 wait hold up!!! Smart people the way he is sitting he is  not getting the same  view as  the camera... People please think
The world needed witness what fear, desperation and excessive pride looks like in the flesh. The countenance of CSU  coach became distorted from  the negativity. Keep being a light Coach Prime.
All his kids are so lucky to have a father like him so many of us black men didn’t have this luxury of us role model like Coach Prime.
What this Bull Sht Charleston White put a bounty on one coach's sons! I know this can't be true!
I'm trying to figure out who's out of breath 😂
Thy staff that’s deep
Prime Time Football 🫡
Coach Prime is very inspirational 💯
How can you not want to see this guy win 😎
I feel great pride Coach Prime got an inter with my FUTURE WIFE 😌🌹 here you go bae and I have cleaned the house and made some soul fooood!!! Mmmmm! 😊
Don't worry the hype will lose interest when Colorado loses 6 games 😊
💼🕴🏿💐
Coach Prime is correct and knows that Only 1.6% of College Football Players make it to the NFL.  And the average NFL Player’s Career is only around 3 years long.
Super inspiring! 🙌🏾🙌🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Prime said he wants to have a work draft for his kids that don't go pro so they can still be successful even if they don't make the league. That's some real talk right there! I believe he can make that a reality.
Coach Prime remain unapologetically: Comfortable , Committed and Compassionate 💙💛
Worried about Prime's ego -- we'll see...
Don't start speaking French, talking proper and baring gifts Coach Prime. Somebody git Tracy on the phone!😅
No Excuses this week Buffs? OREGON. RUN FOREST? RUN? OREGON 47-24.😮😅😅😅😅
Coach Prime!
60 minutes take notes
At 5:45 he sound like the comedian Lou 😂😂😂😂
“Genae sa qua!?!?” 😂Luv coach prime!
The University of Colorado better back up that Brinks Truck if they want to keep Coach Prime after next year, LOL
I apologize kings and queens but she's got a nice pair of legs WOW glad I'm not married cause I know my wife or even my girl would be like are watching the interview or watching who's giving the interview 🤣😂
I am a huge Deion fan, have been since he was a Cowboy, but i hate when they mic him up and u can hear how heavy he breathes, kinda distracting just a lil but i wonder if he actually winded or sumn
This gerneration Ali, no doubt...
Fuck it Deion for president
OMG that interview was so good....Coach Prime is built for this....Lord continue to pour into him❤
❤it coach💯
Great Interview
This nigga average 4 interviews an hour
That interview was monumental!
the biggest star in sports right now
Brotha said he can braid hair too. I feel him. Ima girl dad. I braid too.
She fine dab🤣💨
My new favorite College team is Colorado!!!
Congratulations in advance to Coach Prime and the Colorado football team for winning the Conference Title and the National Championship 🏆
Great interview. Love Coach Prime
"The Difference Between The Impossible and the Possible is in a Person's Determination"
Great interview 👏🏿👏🏿🙏🏾
I can’t believe CSU coach brought up how his momma raised him like she raised him any better than this man momma raised him. This dude Amazing
Deion Sanders is the truth
Taylor your questions  are amazing
God is using Coach Prime. He’s been through a lot in life that’s why he can relate to a lot of things. He’s experienced and very knowledgeable about life. He’s walking in his calling. He’s honest with his self and the kids.  Keep being u Coach which u have always been.  Ur making a difference to all of us.  God gets the Glory. 👏🏾🙌🏾
Bless this man. I adore his personality so much. I want him to take it all w/ his spirit. GO Coach Prime🔥🏈🔥🏈🔥🏈🔥
PRIME TIME BABY 🎉😂❤
That man has a beautiful soul
Somebody said he smashed and now I’m looking at this video completely differently 🤣🤣🤣
Has Deion or any of his kids served in the Military... or do they hide in the back?
I wanna play for coach Prime 💯😂
Good video
Which NFL team is gonna be the one to offer Prime the HC job?
This interview is one of the best I’ve seen with Deion.
He always big up the sistas!
NCCA ain't said nothing about that dirty play that damage Travis's liver
Coach, prime❤👍🏾🫶🏽👍🏾👍🏾🫶🏽🙏🏽👏🏾😇
WHEN THEY LOOSE( COLORADO BUFFS) OR WIN, I’LL CONTINUE TO BE A COACH PRIME SUPPORTER🫶🏽💯‼️NOTHING BUT LUV FROM ME AND MY FAM, TO YOU & EVERYONE WHOM IS BLESSED TO CROSS YA PATH UNC🫶🏽💯‼️
Taylor is Beautiful
Living out the essence of "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." ℒℴvℯ ♥️ it‼️ -BBnBaB
Coach Prime lifting the nation not just Colorado❤
I bet the the interview that he is referring to will come posthumously.  That tape will be worth millions.  I wish he would have dropped the name.
I couldn't focus if i was Prime😂😂😂😂
That was a G-r-e-a-t interview....Really thoughtful questions.....I feel like I know a lot more about Prime now....and it all is genuine....You can't fake all that....everything he said has been consistent with every other interview/appearance, etc....All his answers confirm what he says outwardly....Great interview...great personalities..
Coach Prime is UNIQUE and Taylor Rooks is a GREAT interviewer!
Deion Sanders you talk too much nobody cares if you win or lose only the people who drink your Kool-Aid.
During a time when there are so many fakes out there, it’s extremely refreshing to hear someone being unapologetically themselves – ain’t nothing changed Coach Prime/Deion Sanders has Always been Him!!!  And there are receipts longer than the ones you get at CVS via decades old videos, magazines, etc that he’s always been this way!   Also, people are tired of hearing the same ol’ tired story line about Alabama, Ohio State, USC every year for the past 10 years.  What’s happening at the University of Colorado is very interesting and fun to follow.
I'm Proud what Coach Prime shows the world
Wise dude man!  Salute!
Team Prime Time here💪🏾🏆🥇❤️
Coach prime in the building. And on a side note Taylor rooks is the baddest female on sports talk and it ain't even close
Best interview I’ve seen all decade .. thanks T rooks and D Sanders
She need to have a longer dress on
bro. this is great
He spitting BARS
He has soooo much passion about what he does it just wants to jump out his body listen how he’s breathing he’s trying to whole back the tone
Lol...longer the driveway longer the money. You are the main thing of the main thing Coach.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
😍😍😍
Taylor rooks x coach prime 🔥
Then you got someone like Jason Whitlock talking nonsense bout Coach Prime eventhough Coach Prime is walking the walk.
@ AUDIO ENGINEER: put an expander on the vocal tracks…the mics are close so you can hear them phasing. And use RX-elements de-reverb to get rid of the room early reflections and brings the voice upfront for more clarity. Its bleacher report, yall should know better
Great Interview!!! Lou Young is gonna kill this interview when he does it. Lol!
This innerg is divine ! ThankU Primerime!!!❤❤❤
People taking thing’s personal and it’s all marketing
Great question. Great interview!
Listening to coach prime is like getting the word of the day from your favorite teacher or pastor 🔥
A coach of men no matter where they are in life. Sharing his secret to an extraordinary life.  Faith in God paired with effort
I’m here for Taylor
I need a Lou Young version of this asap
19:20 great husbands... if you like it then put a ring on it. Leaders, fathers, teach these young men how to become great husbands and fathers. No more baby mama drama, no more shackin up
Coach Prime is the most powerful Black Man in America right about now real talk 👈 go Buffs
she could have pulled her skirt down a little bit. exposed too much
The GREATEST FATHER THAT EVER LIVED! Whoa! Standard for our community 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
The guy that loves the sound of his own voice, the guy that loves the smell of his own farts,
Black Jesus......
Coach Prime America’s coach you motivate me everyday 💯
Pantie wet
taylor rooks is special, with all due respect
Amazing video 🎉.
I wish she wouldve asked what NFL COACH would you like to coach your sons and why?
Her fine ass
Take me to church!!
Sheesh she a  baddie 🤑
Great interview
taylor…wya
He has long fingers. Or football catching hands 🤣😂
Showing the world that when walking with God nothing is impossible...
I slept on how fine Taylor is. Good job.
All of this is why Jason Whitlock is eaten up with envy and jealousy. Deion Sanders is an authentic, intelligent and caring black man.  He is always decisive and positive. Everything that Whitlock is not😮😮  Blessings to him.🎉🎉
Can't wait to see his new team next season. Everybody wants to play with Mr Sanders. This is gold. He is the best representation of the strongest men on the planet. The black men. And everyone no matter race or creed is invited to experience greatness as a whole. He's bringing everybody together. I love the fact that I lived to see this. I can rest now.
18:21 coach prime clap with all 8 of them toesdis man here is hilarious never a dull moment👣
"Janay Sequa."  Anyone know her?  😂😂😂
Loved this interview but damn does that woman make my pants tight. This is exactly why I could never get a woman like that. B/c no woman is gonna respect a man that says the shit that I just said even if they know it's a compliment.
Microphones don't work
Great interview. This man found God at his lowest point "suicide." So nothing can break him. He was truly SAVED, and had fully SURRENDERED to God. Win, lose, or draw. Confidence!
Audio is mid come on bleacher report give Taylor the good equipment.
....Blessings & Success Coach Prime & Team Colorado❗️🏈....
Lou young gon have a field day w/this one
Great interview! Thanks for showing the world more Deion🙌🏾💪🏾💯💯💯💯

Colorado doc gon be crazy.   Closest thing to fab 5 but more turnt cause it’s prime and he got his sons and luggage with him 🦬!
Taylor is sexy ❤
The world needs more men like deion... the work he's doing for these young men is incredible.
Coach Prime my favorite coach
I apologize it was hard to focus on the interior of this interview due to all that light coming off that phenomenal woman .. she shine like gold!
He’s an amazing MAN!! He’s the answer for what NCAA football has missed since it’s inception! He’s the epitome of a great leader.
We all look for recognition
God bless coach prime
Coach Prime the truth.
One of the best interviews.  She asked amazing questions, showing  a more complete picture of Coach Prime! Fantastic job❤!
Sheduer should stay cause he ain’t better than Caleb Williams or Michael pennix to me. He’ll be clear cut number 1in 2 years.
Love you Deion
Oh, God, this man is so hilarious. I am naying, cabbaging in my purpose.😅😂. This was a great interview, it was funny, motivational and inspirational.
Prime knows how to market 😂😂😂 Get paid Prime you deserve it..
Go Deion, Go CSU🎉
Taylor R 🔥🔥 oooh she fine!
His breathing kills me everytime he’s interviewing. Wonder why he breathes so hard, he seems to be in shape
Colorado needs to lock down Deion for multiple years before he gets a crazy offer from  outside !!!!!
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🙆🏿
Prime talk.
Anger is not a component of the essence of God.  You cannot be angry and be blessed at the same time.  Amen
Media is going HAM trying to advertise Sanders
Let’s go CU gotta get the win over Oregon!
That's Prime Finest!!
Like I KEEP SAYING 👁 "IT'S BIGGER THAN FOOTBALL!!!!!!"
👀 who's breathing so hard, we can HEAR it ..
Lord keep him near the cross in front of this lady showing her thigh/butt...where Sam at? Where is smac entertainment 🤔 yall don't put him in precarious situations. learn from Michael Irvin....please. If I worked for Prime I would have told her put them legs down and show some respect for this grown man.
They will make movies of this man
Man, she is bad?
Prime is A Poet & Didn't Know It. He be flowing!! 😂😂
She didn't feel all that air up her butt? Deion don't fall...you better pray, these folks out here trying to trap you. 😤 Don't let the devil in.
COME ON NOW👠👠👠  PREEEAAACCCCCHHHH COACH🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Prime think he slick, he trying to get some coon 😂
🔥🔥🔥
Blessings to Coach Prime.   The hate & doubt he gets is weird & hilarious at the same time.
It's beyond football at this point, he's flat out anointed ,walking out his God given  purpose and he's COLD with it! ❤
1. WE HERE 2. AIIIRIGHT 3. RESILENCE  ROCK STEADY BABY ARETHA FRANKLIN  ✔ IT OUT 😂😂😂😂

Coach Prime isn’t just motivating his team… he’s motivating so many of us who are on our own paths. He’s America’s coach!’
He’s getting COMFORTABLE!!!
Deion Sanders shook the Game upside down, Imagine Deion Sanders in 2nd & 3rd Year as Colorado's Coach. Damn..
This man is living his best life and we are living it with him💪🏽
Respect the hustle... Bringing the game to all....God is good!!!!
Wait Deion. You made it only just now? They call you Prime already.
First
I honestly wonder, is there any chance he actually has success with Colorado, “success” as in making the playoffs. Genuinely curious
😊
prime and Taylor black excellence
Prime is the Prince of football
Let's go Prime !
