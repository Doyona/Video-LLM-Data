Back then I would always want to collect that I don't know why
Were are better than you. That is all, dismissed.
So if Elon musk gave you a billion dollars that means instantly there is a billion less pounds of trash ?
I'm from Michigan and i live in Holland Michigan and i go to lake Michigan

Alright time to donate the fucking universe to team seas
Thanks to Mr best
Cool and thankyou
#add?
Amin
No ones talking about how they managed to get a bottle in front a dude perfect headquarters but "can't collab with them"
Team seas is a scam, the trash they collect just ends up in the ocean again.
I found it now in Albania
You guys should flip a bottle in every state!!😁

When you live 1 hour from lake mi and your in the middle of michigan
Mr beast
#teamseas
I’m not giving you a like for this due to the fact that it really is just something that could have been summarized in a comment shorter then this one as well as the fact that it’s not like you did a good thing you just didn’t do a wrong thing. Like I don’t get a prize for not stabbing someone also this is really just a rant.
#Team seas
I did ut
Save the turtles with team seas
Michigan!
Just a quick search would tell you that this bottle ends up in Ireland
Lol
I was mad there for a second 😅 I thought you put trash in the ocean, and didn't clean it, but ty for doing that ❤️rand alot, and everyone should go donate to #teamseas even 1$ helps bring one pound of trash out of the ocean ❤️❤️
Who else has been scrolling through shorts for hours and is feeling guilty for wasting time but just can't stop scrolling
why did you do it in the first place?
Now this is how the ocean gets 'Polluted'
Yes!!!
I remember watching the video in 2017.. Ahhh I miss the good old days. But I think we all do.
We care about our bitches
OP, STILL A BUNDLE OF STICKS
I LIVE IN MICHIGAN
#Teamseas
Why?
So where do you put the trash after? Just curious
Does anyone know why at the very beginning they showed Matthew flipping four bottles at once?
That’s cap🚪
#teamsea
Sure u do
#TEAMSEAS
Great, thanks
# Team seas
Pollution
Why dont they just pick up the litter instead of making us giving them money that does nothing
Best way to cover up lying. Nice.
Well, I guess that makes you significantly more virtuous than anyone I've ever met.  Congradulations, you are the best.  You deserve a gold medal, a steak, and the respect of the worlds leaders.  Your very handsome and I am sure the ladies are all over you.  If I was in your position, I'd probably ask the Dr to euthanize me immediately because life doesn't get any fuller than it is for you right now, you've peaked.  From now on, for the rest of my life, I will thank the Lord for blessing my planet with your existence.  Thank you for picking up a piece of trash and letting me know that the reason is because you care about earth.  (Don't mind me, I'm just delevering what your video was fishing for)
We do not care
POV : you actually live in Michigan
LETS GO MICHIGAN! WOOHOO!
👍
Use a see through flask
Message in a bottle trick shot :good ending
Bro? You just got bottle to ocean with string, and THROW IT TO THE OCEAN, YOU JUST PUT THE FUCKING STRING TO NOT GET HATE

BOOOOOOOOO
Stupid click bait what a useless YouTuber
Then why did you throw the bottle?
How do you go to team sees
And then #team seas just trash it :)
Let’s goo. people save seas for ever #team seas
Let's be honest if the team seas thing didnt happen you would have never told us. Also I looked at both videos and the day of time is different. Imagine lying to your community.
Just imagining the video of mr.beast and collecting garbage from a beach and an robot on the water lol this kid is like fuck the ocean let’s get some views by throwing this bottle in the ocean lmao 🤣
This reminds me of this videohttps://youtu.be/Q4OedyQGKYI
Nice way to go
Bad fornthe enviroment
Here this is the best trickshot in the world:and https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
All I have to say is cool
😃😃
Teamsea!!!
Water pollution is free in this world even foreigners too
I live next to Lake Michigan lol
omg
Peta be like ya kill by buddies in water
noice
" *Be honest who else is just scrolling through shorts rn* "😂
When you tree the bottle I was like what about the bottle you trew😨
Too easy
Wait a minute, you just broke our trust by trying not to break our trust do when you put the callculations togheter you could just be filming another video of a rope actually being tied to the bottle just like how you did with the previous bottle ending up in the golf of mexico, which means that you actually littered and tried to gain our trust even tho it wasn't yet broken but now has been broken by your attempt of fixing the non-broke. Trust.
Thank god they didn't litter
God bless ✝️
Their name is Thats Amazing for a reason.
Cool
I have donated over 200 dollars to team seas
#teamseas 👀 Them: let's throw this into the ocean🌊
Is glass okay?
So they lied
You are making ocean dirty and mr beast is doing that much 🖕🖕
Lmaoo
YES SIR HELPiNG OUR world 🌎
Sea: no money cant help
cap lol
My pirates and crew on the Way to get the message
Hello. 👋🏼 Jesus is coming back soon, 🕊I wanted to tell you to find God, 🙏🏼 before it’s too late.
God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten so that who ever may believe in him may have eternal life. John 3:16 Jesus died for you so why don’t you live for him. Humble yourself and come before Him and call upon His name. Ask for forgiveness so that your sins may be washed away. This life is nuthin compared to life in heaven. Remember even demons believe in God. God bless :).
Plot twist the bottel they pulled has a different message
What the hell is wrong with you
You guys threw the bottle
From mr beats the new team trees us gone is now teamseas
Gf
#teamseas
Umm pls font put bottols in the ocean that might of harmed an animal but good that u pold it back to showr
Damn I so expected him to say we put a gps tracker inside of it
So you lied
Cool
Still waiting for that dude perfect collab
Don’t lie. U littered. Team seas didn’t exist back then
Yeah you should always care of the beach like in my class I have a group and I'm one of them in the group and the lesson is trash can go everywhere
WasteD my time 😅
#teamseas
Awww I love people like you guys
Use a glass bottle
Hi. I'm really confused on how tying a string to the bottle made it better? Can't an animal choke on the string? Please help me understand better.
"... So we basically beat up a person and then we took him to the hospital because we care about people"
Gaaaayyyyy
So it’s click bait
Wow
Money is actually the greatest obstacle, without money there wouldn't be corrupt people.
I dont think it will help the ocean because people throw 18 million trash in the ocean everyday or less but good job for trying to help the seas 👍
WOW!!.....Never knew throwing plastic bottle in the ocean 🌊 was a trickshot:,000
At least they confessed it was fake. Unlike most people.
Nice
Teamseas
Y
Oh so humble. You surely pulled the bottle back because you care about the environment, not that YOU WANTED TO PLANT IT IN TEXAS! Morons milking mayhem.
Now that is how you get out of posting clickbait
mrbeast did that seas
Team seas

#teamseas
Wait but but what country did a people pick it up but what was in the paper

Silly. . . .and I doubt seriously those dollars are going towards some "save nature" fund. . .it's going into your pocket for more tech equipment and video games.

Mr.beast #teamseas
You know this video is made as an FU to all those people who said "oh no littering" in the comments section of the previous video.
Awesome job guys. Great examples to everyone.

Come to Indianapolis in Avon it's only a 1 or 2 hour drive from lake michigan
Do you live in michigan   I do too
This stuff is stupid climate change won’t destroy the world it’s only going to end up out where nobody goes also why do we have to pay to grow trees or get trash like stop now!
What the f$&@
Your copying me.beast he made teem seas
I didnt see the original, but who actually believed that? 😂
Sometimes YouTubers lie
“See we love the new cause PLEASE DONT CANCEL US FOR THE LOVE OF GOD”
Are you guys serious? They through a plastic bottle into the ocean and we don’t know if they actually went a picked it up
Respect!
That Page it's obiously a scam

Ok
#TeamSeas
Yes you did littet
Yeah. Aphmau and Mr. Beast both posted a vid about #TeamSeas.. But they weren't in it together hehe
We care about our beaches hmm that sounds sus
It's bad enough thousands of tons of trash get dumped into our waters and oceans every year. Can we NOT intentionally throw plastic bottles in the lake for content?!
Yeah it's cool but u r supporting team seas by throwing plastic into the ocean that might not come back
#teamseas
team seas
So you lied!!!
Iok
So. What was the point???
Ok I'm tired  hearing  about this litter  I clean the freaking park at school  becoming  I wanted  to
#teamseas
Next time, put a gps on it.
Why don’t you just pick up trash in the ocean instead of paying for it
Sure
#TeamSeas
teamsea is useless and worse than teamtrees
You can't stop water polution
Packers Fans with their lies

It’s a scam guys Mr.beast and other YouTubers are making millions of off peoples misery. Like Bernard madoff  said you promise people for something that isn’t going to happens while taking their money, while you show fake results. Isn’t it suspicious that he didn’t explain anything other than just send me money??????
coulda just threw a glass bottle but go off
I thought you were polluting
That’s amazing: Trickshots into Team Seas
you onow turtles eat plastic... so u killed the turtles
Xxxtentacion die in 2018

Fucking liar
I only care about nature that doesn't try killing me
Ah phew I actually about to command hate about throwing bottle to the sea.
Is anyone still fighting Nestle company for using lake superior to make and sell the lake as bottled water...pure life??? Years ago the government gave Nestle water access to use as much as they wanted to sell pure life... F nestle....
#teamseas
Your a tool
Respect for them, exposed themselfs for humanity
You duck
this is bs cause the vid with string is new
Hallelujah!!!
YEAAAAAAHHH TEAM SEAS LETS GOOOOO
Now thats how you advertise
This we called telling lies very confidently
Excuse for clickbaiting
He just remade the vid.
#teamseas
Oh you are doing this for only video everyone knows that
Team seas is just like team trees. Great thing to do but once its been around for a couple months you won't really hear anything about it
i  am    a     kid       so   i   can't    🍩 donut
At least you took it back
Ok guys I was honestly so mad you littered but when you revealed the string I was so realeaved
Bill Gates donateing 1b
Its still the virgin channel
Hxeul from your NVR I have been trying the chance in kan Aryan nyanyi in a few years now in my opinion we meet lcuoz and the future if the reader's choice to go back in town this coming Monday to Thursday at
I was bou’t to say
Team seas
I was gonna rage before y’all clarified lmao
love this!!!
Free expose
I donated  $ 20 sooooo it means there's 20 less pounds of garbage 🗑
Is there #teamland bc its like #teamsea
Jimmy will do dia
👋👋👋👋👋👋😌
Lake Michigan!? I live rly close to there kinda
You know team seas has inspired me to throw at least 17 plastic bottles filled with more plastic, including plastic straws (obviously) into the sea.  God it's amazing how the internet can band together.
#TEAMSEAS
*Hoping that Someday Villager Vids n' Chnl, Going to Recognize too!⚡*
Mr beast
Let's stop the pollution. What is the leading cause of ocean pollution? Find out if there's one small thing that YOU can do to stop the pollution.   Hint hint.... If you eat fish or seafood, you are paying to pollute the oceans and lakes. Stop paying to pollute ! Also, dead zones are causes by runoff from animal agriculture. Want to restore the oceans, STOP paying to pollute it in the first place.
Every youtuber now has enter the teamSeas
Jesus loves you so so much and he died for you so we can be forgiven and go to Heaven with God if you accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior so repent from your sins.Have a great day🙏🏼
Through plastic in sea, and say save the world..wooooooow.......meme
Damn thats sad man..
Good. Team sea forever!
Cap that’s filmed after wards lol
Why does this feel like a modern add on tv?
Interesting!!
They had Us in the first half
Plastic, metals, cloths & glass are all made out of something from this world 🌎 and to the world will it return eventually. There's no such thing as littering. 🙄🗣
well, I think I'll speak for various reasons when I say ...if this video went viral and several ventured to do the challenge now they have polluted the ocean for a "challenge" so hey, those guys who threw the bottle and didn't tie a string on it have now polluted the ocean, thank you
Ñ
Good for you I guess? 🤷🏼‍♂️ be careful patting yourself on the back so hard. You might break your spine
Fraud
Ok
Could of just used the same bottle
#TeamSeas
Imagine if mrbeast teamseas found it lol
*erases long ass paragraph*
We found another one
It's so weird. I just finished reading the Environment Protection After Rebirth novel, and then Team Seas came into my attention.   The novel was about a ghost who becomes more powerful if she picks trash and if she influences more people to clean up trash.
Засоряете море!, портите природу!; так нельзя!
Calling bullsh!t
This was fake and nice at the same time
Need to cull the fishing industry to effectively clean up the oceans
Jangan buang botol/sampah ke laut.. Itu bahaya untuk kehidupan laut. Bisa aja dimakan oleh Paus/ binatang laut lainnya.
#teamseas everyone!!
Nature ?!
Shut up. This made me give you a dislike and an unsub. We didn't litter shaking my head.
I’ll give you a dollar if you just stop filming yourself
Elon has to donate 1 billion dollars and then we have 1 billion pounds less
I thought you littered for a moment, and I pissed. But, it's amazing that there's people helping enviroment! :)
Lol
Idiots
Damn thats a long string
O M G!
Or we cqn take the time off our jobs and lives and just go clean ourselves. If its so important...
Lmao, how much y'all wanna bet this is remade footage?
water pollution
Sorry but this is just clickbait.
#TeamSeas
really? plastic?
omg....i am tripping or did i seen this exact comment section before?..are these bits or do i have dejavu?
Awesome, love u guys <3
Awesome, love u guys <3
When he talked about polluting the ocean I already knew what he was about to say
Yay #team seas yay ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
#teamseas i love that idea
I bet the reason u put a string on the bottle is so that you can use it back at Mexico when you record the bottle later when it crosses the country. I bet.
People what money to go crazy like mental diseases
Good ad
We care about our b*tches sorry beaches 😂
actually i need to be born the exact 1 year gap between my sister and have the same birthday but i'm born 11 days late than the date😂
“We care about the ocean” but you? No we would totally lie to you…BUT THE ANIMALSSSSS
o7
I laki you
I heavily doubt 1$ is 1 pound of litter removed if it were that easy it wouldnt have any trash in it. Also it depends on where that pound goes.. people really only think one step ahead man
Please 🙏 Support
https://youtube.com/channel/UCJKAI7C8Lu4s03Eaj5akXvA
Cap
Sonit is all a lie?
I would've just thrown the message in the bottle. Like why not? One bottle wasn't going to hurt
Hahah I was just abt to type litter
imagine they never did that, and actually left it, and recorded it again at the same spot with a different bottle, that would be funny af
What is wrong with u
#teamocean Give the ocean safe
0/10
Plot twist: they they filmed a separate video of the bottle with the string and left the original in the ocean
I couldn't care less about the nature. I throw shit in the water if I want too
So you lied
I see it 🧠🧠🧠🧠🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈😰 howwwwww it just what the heck
Wow, what a good deed. Gonna go throw a bottle in and pull it back out. Hopefully I feel just as heroic
Poor water
Mr beast
Love the team seas introduction
So what you’re saying is you’re a godamn liar
I don't understand, where did the bottle that was pretending to be a bottle go?
Subd simply bc you chose to show you didnt litter & $1=1lb of trash removed when you got to their website! Thank you, for caring👍💯
This polution our nature
I knew it! Scammers!!!
And before you explained thousands more humans tried to copy as in video and polluted... All because you pretended! Great work!
Mr beast donating 1million dollars 😈
#teamseas
YAY!
it would have been better if he threw a glass bottle tho
Fake fun fact: he didn't actually take it back out, he just left it there Fake fun fact #2: he doesn't care about oceans
Fake
#TeamSeas
only ppl who gonna be receiving the messages are the fishes lmao
Sooooo... These guys casually admit they lie for views?  Welcome to viral culture folks
Did we litter of course not we just added string an animal can chock on:)
You genial
Ever since being in marine bio, I’ve never realized how much we’re effecting oceans, team seas coming in clutch hopefully
That's really cool and considrate
I went swimming in Lake Michigan but I found a bottle with a note in it
Yes we can get sum stuff in this house cause we don’t want it in there so much stuff lol lol I’m happy to hear it
So you are a fake? That made alot of money faking? Well it is America
Y'all like ur beaches n I like my bitches
Probably did litter in the exact way thats destroying the environment that mr beast cant solve  How much you wanna bet you lost 1 itsy bit of microplastic off that bottle?
#teamseas
Wait I just realized if I don’t donate one dollar then does that mean you guys won’t do it but if I donate unlimited then do you clean up the whole ocean
Putting plastic in the ocean, very cool
Thus is a joke
Ayayayayyyyy
God loves you so much 💞💞
God loves you so much 💞💞
So you simultaneously made click bait and helped the environment at the same time.
Or you could’ve just filmed a bottle on a string because you didn’t want to be charged with littering   >:)
Plot twist that was another shot of a different bottle that they pulled back
Its nice
Didn’t know where this was going. Happy with the result
Plz dont start to trying  it so dont  like this video
Mrbeast
Wisconsin ❤️
You liar wtf 😡
Waste of time
do u want a cookie
#TEAMASEASA
I threw a watermelon into Lake Pontchartrain when i visited my family this month. It wasnt littering because fawking alligators eat everything within 1 yard of the water.
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️https://youtube.com/shorts/8fIRyuVrt-Q?feature=share
That defeats the purpose and fun about tossing a message in a bottle into the ocean and then wait to see where it will end up.  Although if I had to pick what kind of bottle. I would use a glass bottle. Since glass is biodegradable so I wouldn’t be lettering since the glass bottle isn’t plastic
So that would mean I would have to spend 17.6 billion dollars to get rid of all the trash, no thank you my guy.
U can see the string at the start
Yo I'm by lake mishigan
hi
This is so amazing
Send Doge
Teamseas ad cmon bro...I'm not from the US
"And filmed another bottle with a string tied to it"
One thousands lies for every like yall give
It could've floated down the Mississippi river then over to Texas though
So you lied to the whole world? Lying is ok, that's what you're saying.  What is real in this world?
Ayo I remember going to lake mich and seeing a bottle
Yes Im sorry but I don't have a dollar right now
Omg I live right by lake misigan
They just re filmed it 😭😭
Water pollution!!!
Bro help team seas While ur throwing garbage in the sea And also my english is not very good I'm from india thats why
Still a lying son of an ass but at least you didn't litter
This is wholesome.
It was all fun and games untill the string breaks
Bro did they help anything or actually did anything??????? (Practically)
"Every dollar gets less of one pound in the water" Me: just do it yourselves if you actually care
Team seas sounds kinda “fishy”
Wow so awesome you littered!
repent Jesus is coming back not forcing though......
my mom well fonate 20$ bruh and my money
I'm sick of arrogant bodies of water. Like Lake *Superior*? Fucking get over yourself.
It's kind of like teamtrees
You tricked a lot of people
Fuck i was ready in the start of video to say to you dont throw plastic into the ocean you idiot. Im so happy bro you did this. Great thing to do and great message
Students this is an example of OXYMORON!
Go pack go
Where you guys from?
There is no way it couldn't
Yeah no dip
Dam I could of found it, I live right next to Lake Michigan
Vickings are better than the packers

So clickbait
Who think it did?
Are u serious
Why don’t they do 1 dollar = a ton
No one cars
STAGED
YAAS
No hate...but why do people have to donate before they clean the oceans? Why can't they just do it without asking for money? 🤔
You guys live really close to me
Yeah teamseas
i knew it was gonna be a #teamseas thing
So you lied
Him just ignoring the fact he just got exposed
Wow, like no one knew it was fake
PLOT TWIST The bottle with the string is the 3rd one
He could be lyin just sayin
What happens if you donate 999,999,999,999,999,999 dollars is all the trash gone
I got worms from lake michigan

Donates $1111111111111
Fun fact I live in the costal bin
Either way it would take over 100 years to go through all the lakes
Joe 😭
All the comments: Wow team seas is better than team trees  My brain: What about the lakes? Do they not care about the lakes☹️
Thats a sweet way for that to work out
As a science nerd. There is a extremely small chance of it hitting Texas based on the waters current.  Don’t get mad, I understand the joke. If it is…  Btw this channel is goated  Best channel
It's all fun and games till the string breaks.
But the pound of trash still goes to the waste
Well no fucking shit whoever believed this was clearly an idiot
#team-seas everyone
I'm trying to start a fundraiser for it
all fun and games until this is considered littering
Welcome back to polluting the ocean
TEAMSEAS!!!
* fake throws plastic into the ocean * fake lands on the other side of the country  * fake sponser to help oceans
cap. the bottle definitely traveled around the coast
Go Jimmy Go team seas
Message in a Bottle by Police That is all I could think through this video Lol
The trick shots are good, but this is truly amazing
There was no string
This #teamseas thing is becaming really boring,there is no video without atleast 2mins of ads for #teamseas
That's amazing how well his editing of strings is
Throw your car battery in the ocean to charge the electric eels
Yes
I live on Lake Michigan
Ay nice vid
Dumbass littering the ocean
😑😑😑😒😒😒😝😝😝😂😂😂😆😆😆
Every little counts
Isn’t pisty one of the sea team?
Cap
#teamseas
You can do what he said if you want to donate
Shit the fuck up I think you know now one is going to do that shit
😐
Dumb way to bring attention to saving the ocean
Yess we need to care about our world and rivers and beaches and oceans
I want to donate to TeamSeas but I'm just 15 and I can't get my money from the bank without permission
#teamseas
Do you guys live in Michigan? I live in Michigan
Then why use a new bottle?
The wave waiting for it to be at the shore
Team seas
Wow I TOTALLY didn’t know that
Thats gay i was hoping someone would find it
😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
If thats true, I'll give u 2,000 dollars for the sea!
$1 magically means 1 less pound of trash.... Like what?😂
Your mom

Bruh today my teacher told me an 19 year old boy made a website and that the same website 😟
What a lie
Do you like Chicago?
Teamseas
“ because we like our social credit”
So.... what was the point of this? "We made a faux video because we care" gtfoh
Cheap mr beast copy
Why pay to clean up our own earth 🤷🏽
I just donated 1000
Yaaaay you care about the wprld
What happens if i donate 1000 dollars?
I am gonna put a gps in a bottle and throw it to Meditarrianen sea.
Mr Beast be like: Nope. Plz don't.
Nigga…. 😂✌🏽
#Teamseas
Yes team seas
Based
Team seas Is kinda of stupid if you think about it we’re starving the fish because we’re taking all of the trash out and that’s what the eat just saying
Ich hasse es😁😁😁😁
this video is so inspiring that it made my day worse😍😍
Team  seas aka water team treed
I thought nice people were gone😥
I was gonna say... But you didn't litter so-
Nah, you capping. You filmed a different bottle with a string now attached to it
#TeamSeas
Yes
Respect++
👎🏿
That was the stupid shit ever.
#teamseas is the best
So yall lied to sus
Use a glass bottle if you do that
At least we know these trash videos are fake
Lame lol
#teamseas
Hey everyone I have a hard question for you all so the question is chose one I)All the trees in this world should be burned II)ALL OF THE WATER BODIES SHOULD BE LITTERED CHOOSE ONE BYE 👋
#TeamSeas WHOS WITH ME
I was about to say this is the worst time to make a video of you throwing plastic in the ocean we are good people
This like saying oh I wanted to this this but you guys caught my lie so I gonna come with a excuse that I was not littering. That sus and slick as hell
bro you are a legend for promoting that i'm so glad you did it in this form too had me in the first half ngl
Good job 👍🏻
Guys I fake my videos but it’s fine I pick up my trash
#teamseas
Life goals........
How does one dollar equals 1lb of plastic removed from the ocean?
If you used a glass bottle it would be fine to leave it in the ocean. Glass is natural. It’s made from sand :)
Yeah, but dont fake vids
You could have simply done that with a glass bottle 🤷🏻‍♂️
Thats agaist team seas
And this is why there are Sea animals dying
Do u live in Michigan because that is we’re I live
So,  your trick shot was just... a trick?
https://youtube.com/shorts/w1oJzjD3f5I?feature=share
#TeamSeas for sea animals
#teamsea catch them 😂
Thinking maybe Mr beast force youtuber to said donate to the viewer
Why give mrbeast money
It's obvious the bottle that came out the water hadn't been in the water for long. It still had the writing on the side of it and the bottle looked new.
“Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.
“I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life
Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him
wow…
Yay! #TeamSeas you can do it!
Crazy more plastic and people like it how stupid they are.
I've heard before from a former green peace worker that an open bottle especially when cut open can actually be somewhat beneficial to the environment in some cases because it creates a miniature habitat at the ocean floor for plankton and other sea life.
What about a $1 towards lake Michigan. Ilive 10 minutes from it
So you would need 30 billion/30 million dollars just to put an impact in the environment
That’s why we have water pollution by dum ppl and their dum videos 😃
No shit
children threw plastics into the sea 😡 sea ​​pollution 😡
Yeah , mr beast also doing this. .....  Make sure that everybody cares about ocean
It's trashing!!!
Lmao
I love this.
Plot twist: The bottle with the string is *another bottle*
Gotcha
#teamseas
What a shame
That’s a cool way to introduce it
So creative
Yee
I was just about to comment y not to litter
But actually caring about the earth was the actual trick!🙄
Ah yes anti water pollution
well yeah save the ocean but think of how many ppl bought it did travel that far
Too Easy
That's cute , but I call BS You got so much hateful comments that you lied again to everyone and tried to say you had a string on the bottle. You're such liars! You did litter, and you did influence people to litter as well. Then you lied when you said where it ended. Then you lied about littering in the first place. May God have mercy on your soul. You need Jesus!
dont spread lies your dollar not doing anything. the world is bigger than your minds
Hello fellow packers fan!
Neeeeeeeeeeerd
MrBeast is going all out this time
It's very nice to know that these guy care about their bitches.
🙏
Let’s go PACKERS 🤩
Cap
It's hilarious to me that everyone tries to make "trash in the ocean" a World issue and it's absolutely not, it's shity people that live on the coast. Why the hell would I pay money for their bad behavior? I don't ask coastal people to pay money to help pick up the highways, that would sound stupid but somehow asking everyone else to make up for their bad manners is ok?? It's absolutely asinine
#antiteamseas lol
I am very heartless sadly I won't donate money cuz I mean that's still just going to be wasting stuff
Reality: when he threw the bottle he knocked a fish's head and the fish "drowned"
Bruh how to get away with fake videos💀
https://youtube.com/shorts/rwSPoTdZDn4?feature=share
Probably🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
So fucking cringe.
So you lied
Plot twist: they lost the bottle so they repeated the seen making it so it looks like they care.
You have got to be fucking kidding me
In 2017 you inspired millions to litter. Very bad example.
I donate $20
Mad respect for yall. Also I hope your table ends up in a museum one day
wow
ya
Good job you did so many
So basically mislead everyone then came clean.  Pretty fucking stupid.
…so what was the point of throwing your bottle???
A lie just to get views wow wow what internet has become
So cute 🥺
“It’s just a trick shot, bro”
What in the fuck did I just watch?
Press X to doubt
If you go back to the video in 2017 there is no fishing line attached.
Don't promote ocean pollution
Green Bay Pakers 👍👍
Got me in the first half ngl..
WQ is the first of its kind in the 🤗😄😕😮
Poor water inhabitants
I didn't know you guys were from Michigan I am too
YES THATS AMAZING IS A PART OF TEAM SEAS!
Fine, i'll do it myself
And liars so when you do videos people won't believe
Cool guys making cool content. Feels like I just went back in time to 2015
Fooling the fools     AGAINN
Lol 👊❤
So you consider yourself a hero but in fact you're just a liar
Sorry
Oh
Dude your killing the sea
Simpin for the environment 😁
With the string is so long you can decide it in the bottle and it's somewhere and you throw the bottle into sky and in the water and you would you want to see it again just pulled the string
All this is llllllliiiiiiiieeeeeeeee
What if i click the hastag its a #squidgame
Cringe
I remember that lol
That is so lame!!
Mad respect
No
Sherlock Holmes: so that's how you did it
HELL YEAH
#Teamseas
No offense  Ocean: why those humans always throw trash into the sea.
#teamseas
Donated 6 dollars ☺️ Hope that helped
Actually its 2 pounds now
Littering wasn't even the first thing that came on my mind when you said you faked it
Reverse ratio
want a cookie
Every 1dollar you dono you get scammed No thanks after faze scam never agian
If you care about the seas. I strongly advise you to watch #Seaspiracy 👍🏻🌍
Everyone is fping this. Support!!!
But you don't care enough about your viewers, apparently
Amazing
Bamboozlers😤
Im pretty sure they pulled a bamboozle again and filmed a 3rd bottle with the string so the 1st actualy was littered
Respect
You fucking ruined the nature
Team seas is mr beast
So you lie
What
Mayn we dont have trillions of dollars
#teamseas ←from Mr beast
Great you ruined my childhood
Wtf
Wtf
God I was so scared at first 😭
When lie with a good soul.  Y
So he faked it?
Omg do it again but for real and put a tracker in it?!!!
If you're throwing a message in a bottle It shouldn't be considered littering let's be honest. That's like saying putting a paper boat in the water is littering or an actual boat
It travel with turtle throat
Oh teamseas u also joined mrbeast
Says the guy playing with a shit load of plastic bottles...... stop buying them you're part of the problem.
And this is why glass bottles exist for notes in bottles. Because if for some reason the bottle is never found the natural cycle of the ocean will break down the bottle and paper over time becoming sea glass pebbles and soon just peices of sand and dirt. Glass is best!... plastic is evil
Do a glass bottle
ഒന്നും മനസിലായില്ല
We care about our bitches ? Oh you mean Beaches
Let's go something to do with #teamseas
You threw a bottle then brought it back. That’s not saving the world that’s just being stupid for content
Has to be another TeamSeas dumshit.
Yeah, I think it’s a good idea throwing your plastic bottles into the Ozean.
Plot twist the bottle they pulled back wasn't the original bottle they threw in.
Nice!
I like mother nature and you do too😺
hmm caring about the seas but click baiting balances it out
You have all my respect!
#teamseas Les go
Every 1$ youll save kyogre and every water type pokemon #savetheseas
Could of used glass
Hahaha
The great lakes are beautiful and I hate to see parts of it destroyed
I cant unhear the word “Michigun” once I became a geometry dash player.
Modern beggar
I donated.  Yay.
Bro I'm from Fiji and that is Fiji water bottle.
When I was a kid me and my dad made a miniature wooden boat, punched our home address into a metal sheet and nailed it to the boat. About two months later I received a postcard, a farmer about 30 miles around the coast had found the boat.
"BTS seeing this and donating 5 million dolars"
Team seas supporter les goooooo
Fake videos 🤣🤣
Like any normal person actually believed this
Don't throw every single garbage on ocean always clean the ocean
It's also highly illegal to actually do a message in a bottle. Unless your in and actual dire emergency. If your stupid enough to do this and leave your name with contact info and the authorities finds it they will fine you for littering
Team seas yea
#teamseas
Its not a good choice to make this video
TOO EASY
Mate great respect for team seas good job mate. But why would you admit that it was fake
Support Mr beast
I have a funny idea. What is the world bank just donated all of the money to team seas XD  Lmao i don't make sense
Team seas is a scam, don't feed the rich
Its mr beast chanel
team seas 2 Mr beast
I live near them
"Obviously it didn't travel...."  Noooooo! You mean it was real? 💔💔💔😒
This is a lie
I heard that from mr beast 😉
I got it
👋
Throwing thrash in the ocean is BAD but.. How about multi nationals who pour tons and tons of DANGEROUS materials or chemicals in the ocean and nature. Wanna implement rules regulations and laws start on yourselves period.
We can do this #teamseas !
Plot twist: He used the string attached to the bottle to pull it to Texas
Best marketing ever lmaoooo

Save fishy’s and turtles

Message in a bottle use class not plastic  ,and since class is made of sand it's contributing to the environment.
“We care.” *proceeds to leave the bottle in the ocean anyway*
Yay im gonna tell my mom to donate
I've heard about#teamseas and Mr Beast is reaching out to a lot of youtubers and I have donated and I am going to be donating again Friday
Why would you film another bottle if you pulled the original one by string? cause y’all are lying about everything for the team seas movement 🤦‍♂️
MAY TEAMSEAS LIVE ON
Okaaaaaayyyyyyy?
#teamsea
Do you live in Michigan
#TeamSeas
I’m glad you care about the ocean:)
My friend ate a Straw to prove the turtles are weak
When someone donates 1,000,000 dollars Everyone that works there: F*CK
Plot twist: it's a new bottle with a string that was filmed
#teamseas
I live in Michigan
All of this translates to. . . The video was fake
Tysm for not leaving it i was about to get MAD if you left it
Just got 2 team sea videos in a row
Love this vid
Team seas babyyyyy
*respect*
Well that's not how a message in a bottle works
Witch state and city you guys live in cause I'm in Kenosha Wisconsin right by lake Michigan maybe 6 miles away
Mad respect
I donated 5 dollars to team seas :D
I love the teamseas part  Half: oh they are doing something nice for the earth  Other half: oh teamtrees .. teamseas ... ooooohhhhh
Bruh just faked a video and exposed himself
1lb?????? That's amazing
I would do that ❤️🥺
Soooooo ur a liar
Do not supposed to do that do not go to a beach and throw the stupid bottle over there since all the the waves will push it instead go grab a boat and throw it to shore and wait until somebody picks it up
Oh ya
I’m in Texas ;-;
#teamseas
That good
What if he actually didn't do that and there was another bottle
Why u lying for
#teamseas
Isint a beach an ocean
I like you're hat I'm a green bay fan to
If you lied then,       How do I know your not lieing now ?                         😕
Yes you cant just use glass bottles(still respect that you are helping teamsees)
That is definitely a lie, you’re just trying to save face
I live about 30 mins from that beach lmao, i will not say where it is but i will say its awsome knowing you have been there too. Its a great beacg
Pls accept Jesus as your Lord and saviour he died on the cross and God rose him again for our sins  So we can have eternal life he loves you ❤️
And probably will break the wire of the the fish poke
#TeamSeas
I actually knew that sometime is it pirates in the ocean and probably to get a piece of bottle and you open the thing
Oh course its team seas 🙄
#teamseas
I live in Michigan
So you're liars then 🤔 congratz
Team seas man
Honestly, it's nice how youtubers are spreading this message and donating. It shows how they care for nature. The internet can be a great sometimes, yk?
I LIKE IN TEXAS!

So I actually wen to Lake Michigan and me and my cousin found a note in a bottle then we did on of them to I hope someone e found it it had money and some other things in it for y’all try to find it if you go there
Finally not a dumb tiktoker
Do you guys live in michigan
Ok, So Your Whole Post Was A Lie
Before I did not real understand how bad the seas were but now because of people like this guy and mr Beast are legends
Tricks audience gets clapped by env ppl now explains we the good guys. U literally came out clean by getting exposed 🤡
I live in Michigan and I feel like if I tried the string thing the string would break.
I live in San Antonio
But still animate others to throw garabage into the water. I see
I would’ve left it in there thats trash with a purpose it’s worth it
Got scared because of team seas
What does my contribution go to?
Wait do they live in Michigan?
That's cool of you to explain and encourage others to help the environment
It's not littering if there's a note in it idiots
Lies
Wow
Separate videos?
Stop polluting
Ok

You don’t care about the lakes?

You’re telling me that they couldn’t have littered the first time by leaving the water bottle in the ocean and then find out about teamseas and then record a video throwing a bottle with a string

#teamseas
Because we care about our nature, not our subscribers, that's why we don't litter but lie to them
#teamseas
Everyones helping team seas that's actually great. Caring bout nature is good
Environmental pollution 🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡
Mrbeast will probably get 30 mil dollars for team seas in like 2 weeks cos his fan base now is way much more than it was when he was doing the team trees project
Team seas

Hmmmmm this is very interesting how is it possible that there are more garbage in oceam
#TeamSeas
My family is packers are you
Mr beast
Government: Does Nothing.  MrBeast: Fine, I'll do it myself.
You still faked it tho
stuff like this starts out altruistic but ends up corrupt from money
I disliked then liked when I saw the string
If yall dont support we gonna be doomed so what I say  TEAM SEAS ONLY🤗 No need to thank me👌
Bayshore, i live near there. Lol
Stop buying single-use plastic
We scammed you, but we saved nature
Teamtrees and teamseas are just well planned scams.
“We’re fake as fuck”  Everyone: likes that ?????
I live in Wisconsin
Hi
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
#TeamSeas
Team seas is gay as hell, just use recycling bin. We have littered way too much already. The environment and the elements will take care of the trash overtime weather it takes decades or millions of years. Humans are insignificant as fuck to the earth and we are just as irrelevant as any other species that has roamed gods green earth. I do not think that our planet should look like shit and I don’t say treat the earth like shit by any means. I am only trying to say to use your recycling bin and stop giving these stupid fucking power hungry “non-profit” bum-ass liberals your hard earned money.
Why do not use a cork in a bottle and put a QR code going to a Rick roll but I have the string still on it and put a stick on the beach with the string attached to it so when somebody opens the bottle and reads the QR code on their phone they will be Rick rolled
It's not 20/17 bro
so what y’all saying is we gotta pay to not have pollution in our oceans!? XD 😂
I got the bottle! It's says Ur Suck 😔😔😔
To be honest In my opinion, without offending anyone or being condescending, and without triggering anyone, I just wanna say I got nothing to say.
I don’t care about beaches rivers nor oceans
Yeah we love ur bitches
You had me in the first half not gonna lie
Slacktivism incarnate.
Less go for the turtles 🐢 respect ✊
Team seaaaaaaaaa let’s goooo
What a giga chad
Ok yeahhhhhh. Team seassss :))))

Where are you guys from? I probably live pretty close by if you threw in the bottle into lake Michigan from the wisconsin side
You probably did litter and now your pretending you didn’t with a new video
When I was watching halfway it reminded me of mr.beast and what do you know the ending was that
So glad to see this huge collab to help the ocean
I hate when ppl save “ save the ocean” like it’s impossible to have a clean ocean ppl clean it everyday but ppl also dirty it again
Jesus loves You!!

#TeamSeas
Most people would just leave the bottle
Y’all are the best for being packer fans
So we got to pay a dollar for you to pick up a bottle from the ocean? How about I pick up bottles my self? And why is it a dollar?
Sounds like a cover up
I donate 5 dollars to TeamSea
Thats click bait
You care about your b!tches and what else?
What was the point of that?
Twinks who care omg
Mr beast seeing this video: TEAMSEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...

Got on trending boys well done  Now we can spread the message to lot more people
#TeamSeas
Bro I literally just saw 3 vids about this lol but I'm  not complaining I think its so great :P
Something tells me it was supposed to be an add
If the teams seas thing never existed he wouldn't of done this
Mrbeast video too
Except it's total bullshit, the whole 1$ = 1 pound, so think about it, that 1$ pays for everything including 1 pound of trash, this includes the boat the captain the fuel the labor the machines, even if you donated all of that, what's the 1$ for? See it's total bullshit ploy, there is no way you can check to see if your dollar is going to be used to pick up trash, seriously how many $$ does it take to pick one pound of trash, according to this it cost 1$ for 1 pound of trash, of it's plastic it's recyclable so that dollar is not being spent on it only 34¢, 66¢ Is going where? In someones pocket, it's a scam
💥💥💥 Buy chilliz token
A large part of me was happy you retrieved the bottle, but then my cynical side is like, wait a minute—did they get roasted for littering, then filmed another shot later with the string? You ought to have used a single shot with a pull-in right after throwing the bottle... I hate the cynical part of me, but it keeps me alive. **sigh**
TeamSeas wants to erase humanity
Why did this video need to be made
bruh
Respect
#TeamSeas
An i the only one or when I watched them cleaning beaches and he said that site it's going very viral so I bet there are alot of cleaning going on for the waters

While you’re out there you should learn the definition of SEA LEVEL & teach it to the globetardian religion  George Orwell on 🌎: “Does NOT rest on reasoning or on experiment but on AUTHORITY”  ‘As I Please’  “SOMEWHERE or other—I think it is in the preface to Saint Joan—Bernard Shaw remarks that we are more gullible and superstitious today than we were in the Middle Ages, and as an example of modern credulity he cites the widespread belief that the earth is round. The average man, says Shaw, can advance not a single reason for thinking that the earth is round. He merely swallows this theory because there is something about it that appeals to the twentieth-century mentality. Now, Shaw is exaggerating, but there is something in what he says, and the question is worth following up, for the sake of the light it throws on modern knowledge. Just why do we believe that the earth is round? I am not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give ocular proof, or have a theoretical knowledge of the proof, but of the ordinary newspaper-reading citizen, such as you or me. As for the Flat Earth theory, I believe I could refute it. If you stand by the seashore on a clear day, you can see the masts and funnels of invisible ships passing along the horizons. This phenomenon can only be explained by assuming that the earth’s surface is curved. But it does not follow that the earth is spherical. Imagine another theory called the Oval Earth theory, which claims that the earth is shaped like an egg. What can I say against it? Against the Oval Earth man, the first card I can play is the analogy of the sun and moon. The Oval Earth man promptly answers that I don’t know, by my own observation, that those bodies are spherical. I only know that they are round, and they may perfectly well be flat discs. I have no answer to that one. Besides, he goes on, what reason have I for thinking that the earth must be the same shape as the sun and moon? I can’t answer that one either. My second card is the earth’s shadow: when cast on the moon during eclipses, it appears to be the shadow of a round object. But how do I know, demands the Oval Earth man, that eclipses of the moon are caused by the shadow of the earth? The answer is that I don’t know, but have taken this piece of information blindly from newspaper articles and science booklets. Defeated in the minor exchanges, I now play my queen of trumps: the opinion of the experts. The Astronomer Royal, who ought to know, tells me that the earth is round. The Oval Earth man covers the queen with his king. Have I tested the Astronomer Royal’s statement, and would I even know a way of testing it? Here I bring out my ace. Yes, I do know one test. The astronomers can foretell eclipses, and this suggests that their opinions about the solar system are pretty sound. I am therefore justified in accepting their say-so about the shape of the earth. If the Oval Earth man answers—what I believe is true—that the ancient Egyptians, who thought the sun goes round the earth, could also predict eclipses, then bang goes my ace. I have only one card left: navigation. People can sail ships round the world, and reach the places they aim at, by calculations which assume that the earth is spherical. I believe that finishes the Oval Earth man, though even then he may possibly have some kind of counter. It will be seen that my reasons for thinking that the earth is round are rather precarious ones. Yet this is an exceptionally elementary piece of information. On most other questions I should have to fall back on the expert much earlier, and would be less able to test his pronouncements. And much the greater part of our knowledge is at this level. It does not rest on reasoning or on experiment, but on authority. And how can it be otherwise, when the range of knowledge is so vast that the expert himself is an ignoramous as soon as he strays away from his own speciality? Most people, if asked to prove that the earth is round, would not even bother to produce the rather weak arguments I have outlined above. They would start off by saying that ’everyone knows’ the earth to be round, and if pressed further, would become angry. In a way Shaw is right. This is a credulous age, and the burden of knowledge which we now have to carry is partly responsible.”
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

We don’t litter…. WE JUST LIE!!! 🤣🤣🤣 jk
i love #teamsea
Respect ❤️
I feel like the only way his could actually work is if you got cargo shippers involved and had them hand it to a bystander in the next port they enter, then after the bystander is done, have him give it to another boat’s worker to give it to the next Bystander at the next US Port
Whhaaaaatttttt? Something untrue on the internet?!?
I was about to comment about how you littered, but I'm glad this turned out the way it did
He tied a string so he didnt get yelled at for littering not cause he didnt want to litter 🤦‍♂️
Thanks so much

What about caring for the lakes
You know it’s not good to throw bottles into the ocean because sea animals can die
God bless you
MrBeast 2.0 but ocean
Do you live in Michigan because I do
I wanna donate 10,0000000 dollars but my mom won’t let me should I steal her credit card?

My boy
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat 😱 Omg

https://youtu.be/ATiYoo3WEjI
Bet you did litter but you threw another bottle in the sea tied to a string to fool us.
https://youtu.be/ATiYoo3WEjI
So basically yous lied and made money from the vid haha all your shit is fake ass
That’s amazing
#teamsea
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT #TEAMSEAS LIKE WHAT EVERYBODY??????
Bruh
Less goo he part of team seas
Mr. Beast your amazing for makeing it mr.beast👌
Take care of the environment
#teamseas
woohoo u made this on my bday
wait it went up by $1 miillion in the last 2 hours
respect for not leaving the bottle in the water
Love this channel
Coincidence: Saw this video after MrBeast clean the world’s dirtiest ocean video :):):):):)
That’s cool but why are you littering
#teamSeas
Did you make a new channel for Colin?
This is the first time I’ve seen your channel but you get a thumbs up just for caring about the environment. I love all the youtubers standing up for the sea. People often take it for granted forgetting that not only does it feed a large amount of the worlds population and produces about half of the world population. Without it we would starve and suffocate considering the deforestation we do just to build more and more houses and whatnot. We need to save the ocean and the sea life in it.
Ate a rockst
OMG MR BRUNCH LeTS GO BRO :)
Uses magic wand "SKADADLE SKADOODLE THE OCRAN IS CLEAN looks in ocean cleans
U just throwing plastic in the ocean bro. Stop
Wow
If they pulled the first one out then why’d they need a 2nd 🤨
Great job helping teamseas you guys are the best
#teamseas
Couldn't care less.
Ayy  my man
sorry, can't donate cause I cant donate in this country or region yet.
How does a dollar remove a bottle from the ocean
Lake Michigan is literally the best. We go there every summer and it is super nice. I am so glad you care about our oceans and lakes, because it’s my favorite place to go to
You could have done It with a cristal one, cool video
Deception but good deception.
I live in Michigan the lake is so nice
Yoo your also in teamseas?
This is wholesome!
I think it is so cool that a ton of famous YouTubers are setting up the #TeamSea fundraiser! 😁
Liars
Ur are the best in both trickshots and saving the word 🤯🤯🤯
I live in Michigan 😅
LES GOOOO
#teamseas let's go 🔥🔥
You care about beaches but you eat fish? So  you don't really care.

You should make a golden bottle and use it as a prize for colin if he lands the hardest flip in the universe. Then he wins the King's Bottle 😎👍
I cant believe so many youtubers are apart of #teamseas

If elon musk has 170 billion dollar he can give them 9 billion dollars.... We can clean 9 BILLION PUNDS OF WASTE cleaned.. And he can even give all humans a billion bucks and still have 150 billion dollar 💵
