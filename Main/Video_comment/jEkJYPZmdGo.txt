He’s so English 😊
진짜.. 사귀는건 바라지도 않고 진득하니 바로 앞에서 오랫동안 응시만이라도 해보고싶다..
I always find myself returning to this video just to laugh like I did the first time.
Not sexy at all
I think sex scene is a "normal" scene for them, but in this interview, they still look so adorable and curious 😅 about sex scene.....krn di adat ketimuran, adegan sex masih jadi adegan yg tidak jamah dipertontonkan, bahkan untuk adegan kissing sekalipun...meski ku akui adegan sex nya banyak banget untuk daphne-simon saja, apalagi dri pasangan yg lain di season 1 ini 😂😂
Every celebrity seems to have this same story
James Bond methinks
I am usually so brain dead that when I started watching bridgerton out of no where and he entered I was thinking, damn, man is so fine, everything about him is just fascinating, his built, his accent, his face and I hoped that he finds a really good lady who would suit him well, didn't know that he is the main lead until daphne and him made an agreement.
I only cared for their relationship 😭once they left so did my interest in the show
I understand why daphne choose him over the prince 😂😂 even i will do the same who cares about the title when the man is this handsome 😂😂😂
He is the most handsome guy Ive ever seen. Perfect face card very manly. He is every girls dream man
ㅈㄴ 잘생겼네 1인자네
Yeah Rege. He said he was insistent on Duke going down on Daphne scenes. Now that's gender equality. What a man. 😏
He's the reason I watched the show, can't believe he isn't coming back.
Oh how I miss him in season 2 and 3
He is sooo hot❤🤤
This kid is impossibly good looking, it's almost offensive to present him to the public.
He is o beautiful! Is he mixed ?
❤❤❤...oh my gosh he is so yummy...
Damn I love him even more😂❤️. He’s even charming outside of his role as The Duke
Amo,amo,amo ❤❤❤❤❤
Guy seems like a genuine and friendly person. Wish we had more men like him in the world.
This man is the most stunning man i've ever seen.
Fantastic interview!  So freaking funny
I would pay to listen to him read the phone book.
Coisa mais linda,quando ele fala que está com a boca sempre ocupada!!!!!❤
WOW! The man is charming, charismatic, well versed and damn funny too! ❤️❤️
♥️✝️
His sooo handsome OMFGG !!! 👀♥️♥️
you're telling me. I was knitting wholesomely AND BOOM THEY WHERE RAWDOGGING IT XD
to much white dna  not real  black  actor
is this what is feels like to be swooned? my god this man is something else
Omg! This made me laugh my 🍑OFF!!!! (That might actually be the first time I’ve used this emoji)!!!
“It's not stop”  *stuttering* “there's a bit”
BOND
Am inlove with him
im convinced he's the most beautiful man alive
OML, it’s Reggie Jeans Pagé!!
Would make a great James Bond. It's time for a 007 who is young, handsome, oozes sex appeal.
His acting ability is so amazing. Please stay in Hollywood
I love his acting so much I am hoping I can get him as lead on my film a vampire love story, red to black the power of love. he be perfect in it
Simon is a sight for sour eyes 😍🔥
Yeah I'll stop them in a minute 🤣🤣🤣
Anyone here after season 2 thinking he has NOTHING over Kanthony?
He is the only one i heard by now that doesnt have the same voice as in the show
that haircut definitely reveals his white side, its so ugly
Such a handsome MAN hahaha
All I see is the next James Bond
man i really missed him in s2
Wow he is a complete different person in real life lol
We missed out on his inperson interviews!!!! Covid taking away that too 😭
he is soooo pretty i need him on season 3 or another show Now
so mad he wasn’t in season 2
Doesn't matter what ethnicity he is, he sounds very British. Hope he is the next James Bond and a mega star.
He is such a dork I love it. I had no idea he was so incredibly normal 😂
Bridgerton's season 2 is approaching and for sure we all gonna miss the scenes with Rege Jean Page in it. It won't be the same without him. GOD created this man so perfectly. Not only with his good looks, great body, beautiful smile, his versatility. He is a total package, waiting to see him make more movies for all of us to enjoy.
I love him for being so funny and charming
That was so funny 😂😂😂
I'm not aloud to watch it but I can read the books but one of these days I'm gonna meet him
James Bond? I think he'd pull it off.
No puede ser tan dulce, copado y gracioso... Necesito que hagan por lo menos una temporada más con él, que se tomen libertades en el guión. Amor por el Duque y Daphne
His voice alone could just make you pregnant
🥴🖤🖤
♡♡♡
His accent to golden lol
What a cheese
He’s just so Damn handsome omg
sorry but his voice isn't deep enough to be Bond Idris Elba would have been excellent
istg he's so damn hot
Rege is half Zimbabwean.. & if you know anything about African parents you know how awkward they are around the subject of sex. I pray non of the scenes came up with his Mom and siblings in the same room....the horror lol
WHAT DID HE SAAAYYYY?!
He is so handsome.  And looks more particularly handsome in the series (Bridgerton S1)
I watched bridgerton because of its plot. The plot:
I just can't find the right words to describe this man...he is just😍😻😈💞
I was really disappointed that this was really THE ONLY part of the show that Rege was speaking...
awwww hes so sweet : DD !!!!
🙈
He's not only attractive but FUNNY and now I'm pregnant
I also make a „tactical cup of tea” when Im watching netflix (with my mom) and scene gets really steamy.
he is stunningly hot
What did he say before '... enthusiast' regarding the valuable furniture anecdote? 1:35
after watched bridgerton, i fell for him, he's so attractive, handsome, and sexy. also his personality and his accent. he's so beautiful
"i- uh.. there's a bit."
His real voice sounds so different than his character's .
I sure hope he doesn't turn out to be a monster
lamento que Rege Jean Page no trabaje en la 2da. temporada de Bridgeton NO SERA LO MISMO SU PRESENCIA ES INIGUALABLE.
I want to be Fran.
The thirsts in this comment section.
Bad video
He just oozes charisma and charm.
tiktok : renegade netflix : rege-jean
Jesus truly loves you and wants you to go to heaven (2 Peter 3:He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance). Please believe and trust in him as your Lord and Saviour. He is coming back very soo with judgment. I pray that you listen to what I have said. God bless
"Tactical cups of tea"
He better be WB pick for Superman, Superman is the only romantic handsome super hero.
He gives me Sebastian Valmont vibes.
Damn this is hilarious 😂
Nice one..Big up! I'm a Reggae/HipHop beatmaker - It would be great if you could check out some of my beats as well. Respect
Thank you.
Damn! This man is hoooooot😋
Very happy to be a doppelganger of REGÉ-JEAN 😍🔥🍀😄
Omg i love him 😂❤️
I don’t think the family were surprised, his parents told there kids stuff , to be careful  maybe a bit 😯 shocked  and Simon was careful and so was Daphnis so all was ok,  there doing a movie 💕💕😁✌️😎
He is the sexiest man alive after Michael B Jordan !
I don't think I actually heard a word he said.
Is the guy from Bridgerton in any other projects other than that show?
Finished season 1 yesterday...yeah, they really were going for it. Lol. I loved him and Phoebe, but I'm pulled into the story and will be watching season 2.
I am just in love with Rege Jean page ❤️😭

The premium adapter ignificantly wail because heat randomly fancy regarding a typical crocus. finicky, polite woolen
He's so damn cute! LOL!
I don’t think it was understood enough what he was saying. You never see women getting head in TV shows, and I think it’s balanced that they showed that. Men don’t just sit around going “suck me women” they also give pleasure and women own and enjoy it so I thought that was great for women and men, it’s manly to to do that.
When I see Regé-Jean Page my gaydar goes off like crazy! Why won't he come out? It's 2021.

Yassss😍😍😍😍
I mean ... aren’t all sex scenes gratuitous?
I know him as Chicken George
Wow
He’s got French ancestry?? Because that name is definitely French
Everyone hits the bed, you have to be careful not to fall of.f 😛
I HAD NO IDEA WHO THIS GUY WAS UNTIL I WATCHED HIM HOST SNL. AND WHILE WATCHING HIM ALL I THOUGHT WAS WHY ARE THESE WOMEN GOING CRAZY FOR HIM? CAN'T THEY TELL THAT HE'S CLEARLY GAY? I MEAN, SHE HAS A LISP FOR DAYS.
He's soooo freaking hansome, i think  am gonna die
he could definitely play the role of Heathcliff so well!!!!
Technical cups of tea
Muito gato este conde 😍
He's sooo gorgeous
if i was daphnes actress i would’ve caught feelings so fast
Thank you for  submitting the  video clip ... I am about to go  for a meeting with my  hair shampoo in the shower, be right back with the scoop ... :P.
0:29 me right now
Why do I find Simon more suave and attractive than Regé???  Simon looks more confident and sexy whilst Regé seems weird.
There’s a sex scene literally 5 minutes in...

He is funnier in person....love his real character more than the Dukes
He got a long neck
The title is wrong: the ‘not safe for work’ WAS his work. 😂
Handsome and funny! Good Grief!
HIS  CHARACTERISTICS ARE NEARLY BETTER THAN HIS ATTRACTIVNES (nearly) 😏
He is ridiculously good looking, but his character portrayal sucks. Sorry. But, my god, he is gorgeous.
The labored shell univariably develop because east canonically scorch minus a goofy quiet. soggy, astonishing fox
He vaguely reminds me of Emilia Clarke
The question viewers should be asking is why were the characters black-washed when  black promoting agendist Shonda Rhimes got ahold of the series. They were white in author Julia Quinn's Bridgerton  novels......https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10244470/bridgerton-review-blackness-representation

i love him

I honestly expected more sex the way folks were talking!

His so good looking 😍
how can a person can be so perfect
His voice is so different in real life than on the show
I saw him the US series. for the people. Hot as anything in that too. Phoar
He does be so amusing and much handsome, whatever is to happen to my poor heart 😍
I liked him even more when I found out he's part Zimbabwean 🇿🇼🇿🇼🇿🇼
There was to much sex, we didn't need porn. A marriage is sacred and needs to be kept as such.
Hey there,, I'm from California 34 yrs old single gay,,  you?????,,,
Ugh he is so perfect. I don’t think I have ever had this big of a crush on even nonfamouse people... is this what it feels like to be a fan girl? I know it will never happen, but a girl can dream.
Gosh...he's charming!
I cannot stress enough how much Rene Jean Page is now my celebrity crush
🥰🥰
i love him so much help
The next James Bond...  The Sexiest Man Alive. This British Zimbabwean is the Best. I love him.
daaaamn this guys got looks 🔥
Rege’s impression of the room monitor’s inner monologue had me cracking up!😂😂
I was seriously laughing the entire video
Is it just me that thinks he's a lovely actor, but i don't really find him that attractive? I just wanted to know, seeing as everyone but me sees him that way... From what I've seen, he is a nice guy, but i don't see anything more than that? Sorry, i know I'm unusual 😬😭
I think it would be very cool if Shondaland would do a spin-off of Daphne and Simon.  But in the new episodes Simon has to go away on business.  In the process his ship gets in a bad storm and he is blown off course.  In the following episodes Simon has to use his wits, strength, intelligence and love for Daphne to get back home to Clyburn castle and his true love.  The show could use flashbacks of their times together, their lovemaking and the birth of their children to keep Simon concentrating on his goal of returning home.  Their reunion would be epic and I think that would a very swashbuckling, exciting series.  Just a thought.
Regé has intelligence and sense of humor. I was entertained every interview he had with 😍 much better than zoom interviews. Can't wait for regé and phoebe to be together on an actual interview... 💖
Its really such a teen series with the plot I won't lie 😅 I get people (mostly women) watch it for the sexy romance romp. I do find it odd that ladies won't let their husbands/partners watch porn but they can invest their time in this and 50 shades lol
O Yes My Dear...
Handsome AND funny. 😍
didnt know he was gay
I can envision him and Ed Westwick, and Theo James in a film together.…😍😍😘😘😘
he's so hilarious LOL
Imagine him having a whatsapp groupchat
He did a very good American accent as an attorney on Shonda's cancelled abc show.
I've never clicked on a video so quickly
English language is ..... wow! hearing them talking like that make u feel ur really in that vintage time, I wish learned the English accent from the beginning if I try now I feel am playing one of those caractères In classic movies 😂
I wonder if his family were shocked  what he was doing  hahaha
Father forgive me but I can’t stop gawking at this man. #thelustisveryreal You my dear sir are everything!!!💜💜💜
He’s such a babe 😍
I cannot stop watching him!!!
If he’s not in season 2 I don’t want it 😂
The guarded rainbow pathohistologically glue because jail originally serve amidst a stormy kangaroo. pumped, average cat
This interview made me love him more
"well i got my mouth full half of the time" HAHAHA I DIED
Hé would be a good James Bond
Okay Regé-Jean are you in need of a new best friend because I'd like to apply.
I swear this guy is all I think about after watching Brigderton. From the mornings you ease to evenings you quiet to the dreams you inhabit!
This man is so feminine in his ways I absolutely don’t find it attractive. Gay vibe all over and women are acting so so weird like jeeeez it must’ve been a dry year
anyone else think his *real* personality is better than the character’s? he’s hilarious!
Μας έκαψες ρε Δούκα.....😭❤  Υγ Ελληνίδες, σας βλέπω. 😂
My first time seeing chairs versus the couch. How weird.... but a lively conversation all the same! 🇳🇿🇳🇿🐑🐑
Oh DO go on
Rege is truly adorable :) from a fan from Thailand. Have watched Bridgerton over and over.
I couldn't watch this episode. This guy is completely drunk on himself and was insufferable to watch.
He has the best bedroom eyes on the show. I’d probably birth him 37 sires. 😂😂😂
😂😂❤❤
❤
This man is God’s Blessing. He is too perfect and I can’t keep my eyes off him.
Brigettonnnnn!!! We love you!!!!!!
"Bridgerton" was a real treat and true Christmas gift from Shondaland Productions. And it was a shame the show was snubbed by the Golden Globes, and we know why.
I cant imagine how embarrassing it is your family watching you doing sex scenes on the screen, it should be weird and really embarrassing
I love how tastefully they're joking about the sex scenes🤣🤣🤣🤣💘💙
He's gay...right? I feel like he is
Am sorry but I just don't find him attractive is something wrong with me? 🥺
Please cast him in a black panther movie just please?
I hate the fact that all they ask about are the sex scenes :( I watched the show twice & I feel there was a lot more to it than just .... that
couldn't get enough with this guy. Dukeeeeee! ❤
Aaww he was so excited at this interview, I can tell he really liked to be on this show
Rege-Jean needs to be cast as 007.
He is dangerously attractive and charming. This is not a good combination for the sake of all the ovaries in the world.
That man could literally disrespect me to my face and I would thank him for every moment.
This man is so fineee
Smh I love it🤣🤣🤣🤣
"there's a bit"  MISTER WHAT?! BIT THAT'S ONLY BIT?!
I love him
Did u know he was in Harry Potter? No u didnt and now u will go and google ittt
Dude could be James Bond in the future
Had no idea he was British when he was on that other Shondra show that was on ABC (For The People).  He played an arrogant American male very well.
50
100% agree with everyone on Regé being so much better in person. The Skype interviews didn't do him justice!
I feel rege is somehow a shy man
Now I see  why the rumour they are considering him for the next JAMES BOND!
He is always hyper while talking .
I don't know if it is just me but I find no chemistry at all with "Daphne". She looks like a kid, and has no passion
he's so bubbly that it makes him even more cuter
why they had to make him that yummy
Alan Carr biting his nails cause he can't handle the hotness 😂😂😂 I would to!
He’s more British than his character 🤣
And he's set to be the next James Bond?!?!? He looks like I could knock him out with a miss
Those library steps didn't look easy 😂😂😂😂😂
These sons of Queen hit different in terms of looks wow
"I had to make a tactical cup of tea." <most British thing ever>
I see this man as the next James Bond
Haha he had he mouth full
It is lovely that the show is back, but weird without the couch
He is absolutely gorgeous 😍😍😍
If you like Brigenton check out Outlander.
I feel like we’re all Alan Carr in this moment
What a beautiful chocolate man.
how can a man be so good looking like this
Bridgerton reminds me of Tudors.
This actor is really nice and funny, and really good looking, but I think he's not very talented actor. At least in Bridgerton I didn't fully believed his character.
He is so beautiful and well put together. I binged the whole series in one night, cant wait for the next installments
Gosh!he's gorgeous and I fall in love
The whole show is posted here https://youtu.be/lsxy77EbFH0 The lady singer goes "Rege, my mom says Hi, and so does the rest of the world!" Lol
I love that he has a good sense of humour, I like him even more now.
He looks more attractive than the series omg
When he was in like I don't speak because I have my mouth full I was like 😅 - wait .... 😳😨
I have been waiting for him to go on this show.
)8
Is there anything more British than a tactical cup of tea?
He is SO attractive 😬
Shonda Rhimes is an international treasure 💜
Handsome 😍
He's so meh.
he is not only gorgeous and EAAAAAAASY on the eyes but also charming and witty and articulate and eloquent- lethal combination, really. deadly. i am deceased.
you know what guest you should have? Jeffrey Dean Morgan pls
Did he say he will not open the door in case it is the press - such a bore
This man just loves himself. He has been in one series . Get a grip .
He's still talking about the cousin/s who missed the memo 😄
“Tactical cups of tea” 🤣chile
Oh wow! I'm stumped, I thought Rege was American, but he's British. I love him. I first saw him on 'FOR THE PEOPLE'. He was so fantastic. I haven't seen BRIDGERTON, but hope to catch up on it at some point. Rege is a fantastic actor and I hope to see him do more stuff!
Awful what’s all the big about this show it’s dumb amd I can’t stand the commentator is annoying fake English language ew
His voice is so soothing 🥰❤️ he’s so handsome
I thought it was Niko Omilana
Ahh he is soo fricking good looking
He is so hansome
He is so so good at variety/talk shows and just speaking to people in general?.. I am obsessed with him. Also he is so beautiful
I have the biggest crush on him
In other news, Pornhub stocks suddenly dropped after Bridgerton was released...
💘
Tactical cups of tea might be the most British thing I’ve heat in a while. 🤣
Never heard 'tactical' nd 'cup of tea' used in a sentence like that before
There's actually guests on the shows in the UK right now? In the US, everyone is still on zoom. I thought their covid numbers were as bad as ours. No matter what, I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.
He seems a bit nervous to me. I read in some of the comments that he may have been drinking. Maybe it was a bit of both?
Idk who this but in the thumbnail i thought this was A young Jimmy Fallon just thought I’d click and let all of you know
He is so polite and handsome it hurts my soul 😍😭😭
hes so gay.
I’m just gonna say it. He is just so sexy. Can more men be like him?
He's so attractive, it's almost like he's artificial. My good, he's beautiful
I nominated Rege and Phoebe to play all romantic couples from here on.., they have us captivated. 🔥💎🎉💫
Graham: "At the table read you must be going 'I haven't spoken for pages!"" Regé: "Well, I got my mouth full half the time"  You, sir, are SAVAGE.
Duke and I 💙💜
This guy has EVERY attribute to be Bond. Age, diversity, height, looks. Between him and Richard Madden.
Some links on the real Black men and women who lived in the UK in the 18th and 19th centuries. Very few Britons and worldwide are educated about how present they were, in all classes of society. Queen Victoria herself had a black goddaughter, Princess Sara Forbes-Bonetta,  whom she was close to and helped arrange to marry a wealthy Nigerian industrialist, Captain James Pinson Labulo Davies. Many Black Britons of yore have 'fully' (appearing) white British descendants today, as you can see in the links below ...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Forbes_Bonetta  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Picton  https://mobile.twitter.com/bbctwo/status/796464416321585156?lang=en  https://www.thisisclapham.co.uk/sw4_local/the-african-academy/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_the_Education_of_Africans  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/equiano-centre/projects/black-londoners-1800-1900  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Soubise  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Africanus  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_in_Ireland  https://youtu.be/9mrWswnS_-M  https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/exhibitions/photographs-of-black-britons-in-1800s-unearthed-after-125-years-reveal-rich-and-diverse-black-presence-a3251531. html% 3famp  http://www.fubiz.net/en/2020/07/22/pictures-of-black-victorians-to-celebrate-black-british-culture-2/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_Sancho  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Relief_of_the_Black_Poor  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Africa  https://www.dartmouth.edu/library/digital/publishing/books/gerzina1995/  https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/irish-historical-studies/article/africans-in-eighthenthcentury-ireland/B135E1A488292C403EF99869903B6AEF  http://umich.edu/~ece/student_projects/rebel_women/minorities.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido_Elizabeth_Belle  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Antonio_Emidy  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Aldridge  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archer_(British_politician)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Coleridge-Taylor  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Eaton  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Barber  https://youtu.be/SUbtdQ0pI0Q
He's so amazing.. gorgeous, funny and so well spoken! I love him! 😍😍
Alan Carr is drooling haha I don't know how actors do it! I'd be so embarrassed if my family saw my sexual scenes etc haha this guy is so handsome and seems cool 😍 love his smile
He is so much more charming in a face to face compared to all the Zoom interviews we are getting. This is so so good!! He is the major leading man of this decade for sure! 100%!
He is amazing  we like the same fruit or should I say veggie 🍆.   💅🏾
I’m I the only that don’t hear anything he says because I’m so distracted by his looks and mannerism even when I try my hardest to concentrate on what he is saying
Duke I love u
Has he come out yet?!?
This just shows how much we've been robbed by all those Zoom interviews!!
i love his accent!! :)
I’m so excited to see rege in the future in more in-person interviews haha
We r back in the studio???
as someone who hasn't watched Bridgerton, should I? 😂
I love it when they brink up the sex scenes and he suddenly becomes bashful.
This guy is defo gay.   Hahaha ladies. He’ll be more interested in Graham. 😂😂😂
Bana olmadık hayaller kurduruyorsun simonn! 😻
Simon really looks like my brother's spitting image.... needless to say I made myself many many tactical cups of tea..😂

True salvation by Almighty God Jesus Christ.   1) We are all sinners. Romans 3:23 KJV For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.   2) Our payment for sin is death. Romans 6:23 KJV For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   3) We all deserve to go to hell according to the King James Bible. Revelations 21:8 KJV But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.   4) There is hope through the blood of Jesus Christ. Romans 5:8 KJV But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   5) Repent (change your mind) and believe on Jesus Christ. Acts 16:30-31 KJV And brought them out, and said, Sirs, whay must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   St John 3:18 KJV He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.   St John 3:16 KJV For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   1 Thessalonians 1:9 KJV For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.   6) It's everlasting, it's a Gift! You have NOT earned it! Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.   7) Now you know how to get to heaven. 1 John 5:13 KJV These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ask God to save you in the name of Jesus!   Roman 10:10 KJV For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
His voice, omfg! 😍

Stop with the cultural appropriation. You can't claim other races history.
I felt awkward watching some of those scenes
Sexiest man alive 2022
Females ain’t clocked he bats for the other team 🥴
The body guard for the room is so funny 🤣
He looks like Wilmer Valderama
Can somebody ask him his birthday?
He is great
does this mean he's in the uk already? phoebe's background for her recent interviews has changed as well. i wonder if they're already filming s2
Beauty, brains, muscles and sweetness...I’m completely lost.
My god he’s ridiculous.
I liked it before i watch it
“Well I had my mouth full half of the time” hahaha
I want him!!!!!!! I’ve never wanted anyone the way I want him!!!!!!! Jesus, I’ll move to England for him!!! 😍😍😍😍
Maybe, just maybe, he can play Bond well...
rethink internet with the euro by me.
a litte bit of lego.
entfernt der sich überhaupt.
a coud believe or think on this.
Devastatingly handsome indeed.  Much more handsome than what I imagined the Duke of Hastings would be when I read the books.
Lmao how charismatic is he? And Alan Carr! I feel your reactions buahahaha!
The Duke
Rege is the whole package...handsome, sexy, talented, intelligent, funny, etc etc etc!  Near PERFECTION!!!  😍😍😍
😍😍😍
He is one full package isnt he? Can act, good looking and on top of it he is a good talker. Wish to see you more in showbiz Rege
Do one with phoebeeeee
He is not only beautiful - he’s definitely bright as well. Well done you ❤️
He is lovely. And funny.
The cousins are so right tho😂😂😂 a little warning would have been great to know when to go have the opportune Cup of tea
I wish theyd interview phoebe and rege together. Escpecially now that he is in london. He's in london right?
Sooo, he is now in london?
all i see is the Duke of Hastings talking, help me! LOL
You are a coward SJW who thinks the word GYPSY is racist when that's not a race, it's a culture
I like the way he talks
He defs looks like he linked up with long time barber, he looks good!
The guy in red would be me in front of REGE
About time Graham!  When’s the full cast on?!
Very intelligent eloquent and handsome young man ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rege😍But Where’ Phoebe?I wish they both came together, please invite Phoebe too😍
Rewatching, rewatching, rewatching who did this? Oh my Regé is not your regular guy to watch over and over again he's really a funny and smart guy,now I know why he choose books.🥰🥰🥰
Where is the rest of this show?
He reminds me of Eddie redmayne
This interview is so different and fun❤.  Goodness can someone interview rege and phoebe together pls
Alan on the graham show? I'm blessed 💀💕
he can come to my All You Can Eat buffet anytime.
Rege is nothing like his character Simon.
❤️❤️❤️
Literally everyone asks them about those scenes, they weren't even that racy, sheesh!
Yeah when they finally got married and went to honeymoon after that it was like non-stop sex lol
😂😂😂😂
Yes, the furniture is a lot of money, be careful it doesn’t break. All the actors are doing a great time, Rege Jean Page is a good actor
I would have never guessed Leonard Knox had a british accent in real life...huh.
I always cringed when people sed someone lived in their mind rent free but rege literally lives in my mind rent free, and I have no plans of ever evicting him, honestly I might start paying him to remain there 😩😂
Someone else cracking up like hell here?!? So cute how he reacts first🤣🤣🤣 goooosh I wanna see the whole show
I weren't gonna bother watching it, but I think I might, now 😏
I can listen to this man talking forever. He’s so entertaining to watch.
Beautiful 💯
HE is damn sexy, and what makes him attractive even more, it is with no doubt his personality. Not just a pretty face. And I am on match.com hoping to find a nice guy, just like him
Rege' definitely as the 'It Factor' ❤ Looking forward to seeing him in more projects 🤩 Oh and I would love to have a  conversation with him someday.
A White straight male free zone. The new minority
Producers were letting them go at it in actual antiques?  Modern replicas would do,  we wouldn't actually notice.
It’s unbelievable difficult not to look at this amazing actor. Something about these English/ African decent gentleman’s are fire. He looks Ethiopian/ Somali guys.
Tactical cups of tea 😂 that’s so British, both the tea and the avoidance.
Good Lord, I wanna have his babies....well, at least practice making them anyway
L I V I N '
please post the whole interview
Any OGs remember him from Waterloo road?
The amount of times I’ve heard about the tactical cups of tea 🤣
My god he’s gorgeous 😭
I clicked on this hoping to figure out how to pronounce his name but unfortunately I didn’t hear it said haha
I'm watching it again at 10.45pm I can't get enough of the Duke ❤❤🔥🔥
HE IS SO CHAOTIC?!???? HE WAS NOT LIKE THIS ON ALL THE SKYPE INTERVIEWS, I’M YELLING
👏
For a moment i was confused.. which show i m watching Graham or alan 😅😅
Alan carr proper excited lol
Gorgeous, Charming, Charismatic, Witty, Talented, Sexy Af, Intelligent,..And I have barely begun to scratch the surface. God definitely has favourites and it shows.
He is better with phoebe near... He win when she is near.....
Episode 6 - best episode
Perfeito, ele tem ar de estrela mesmo, merece o mundo!
This clip is not enough, when is the full episode airing on tv, does anybody know? Please and thank you.
What a beautiful man <3
Congratulations to Regé ! Looking forward to his new and bigger roles. At this point, you can tell he is all about seizing this opportunity and whats comes next with it! Straight business and Im here for it. 👏🏿   Side note: I love these solo interviews of him. He seems to be more expressive and enjoy it better.
So happy Regé-Jean is going on Graham and getting attention for his good work.
Oh Jesus... I'm in love now. I was worried this would happen. RJP has ruined my life completely.
More please
This beautiful specimen of a man. 😍😍😍
Goodlooking, intelligent,  voice of an angel and a great sense of humor,  what more do you want...Mr. McDreamy, step aside
oooh am I'm the only one thinking if he is on the Graham Norton show then he must be in the UK therefore they must have started filming since he lives in LA. Yay can't wait for season 2.
Regé-Jean  could get it
I was so looking forward to him on the show. I’ve always loved your guests Graham but thank you so very much indeed for having Rege on the show.
This man is too beautiful for words
I'm tired of his hotness. Why all this for just one person ?😑😑😑
I unfortunately will not be seeing this episode tonight because,  it will be shown next Friday  at 11:00 pm on bbc America.  We are a week behind when the show is new for regular bbc in London.  Tonight will show season 28 episode 15 on from January 29, 2021.  I would love to see this one and others when they are completely new for America and London.
I wish this interview was with Phoebe as well. Both together would be so much fun.
So that's it eh. We want more.duke
He is the actual plot of bridgerton
Wish they asked some new questions instead of the same recycled ones, but glad to see him in a live setting
It’s so nice to finally see Regé do a in person interview. Ahhh, he’s such a intelligent speaker as well too ❤️❤️❤️
Ahhh The Duke😍😍
He has such a great sense of humor omg
🥺🥰😍🥴🥴🥴🥴
tactical cups of tea 😭✋
i recommended bridgerton to my nan after watching 2 episodes. needless to say she was not amused😂
A whole package: smart, elegant, funny charming and incredibly handsome..... btw Alan Carr’s reactions 😆
I have never in my life seen a more handsome man but unfortunately the interviews are too repetitive and Graham Norton is usually my favorite interviewer (along with Conan). I hope Regé-Jean Page doesn't overexpose himself (no pun intended) and I hope they find something original for him to do after Bridgerton and not rehash some old (Bond/Black Panther) role. He's too good of an actor for that.
The set is more valuable than the actors
He is so much more charming in a face to face compared to all the Zoom interviews we are getting. This is so so good!! He is the major leading man of this decade for sure!
A NEW INTERVIEW 😍😍😍
Where in England is HIS accent from?😍
Is it just me or Regé has a stronger british accent here compared to other interviews, and also talks faster (seems very nervous too) ?
Can't get enough of that handsome face and smile!!!
IMHO he gives mad gay vibes.
He is so elegant.
I was waiting for him to come on the show
So, early and i love Graham, but anything Bridgerton has my heart
Oh yes I know him ! he was in the show For the People and it was cancelled for no good reason it was a great cast and show!! well done I have yet to watch Bridgerton
"I’ll stop them in a minute” lmao classic 😂😂
So I lost this in my notifications so I actually hunted it down!!🤣🤣
❤😊❤
Love this
Lmao, the title is a little exagurated but its still a very funny scene.
OMG MY DUKEEE 🥺❤️🔥
I thought that was Niko Omilana
Who else is stuck in the never ending loop  of The Graham Norton show 👀
Rege-Jean's accent is hot af
I've never clicked faster
Lmao “has his mouth full” 🤣🤣 every woman was VERY excited for that scene 😉
YESSSSSSSSS IM HEREEER AT THE 1ST MINUTE
I can't wait for season 2!
