Hazbin hotel = FNAF knockoff Reasons: 1. Charlie looks like a wierd Freddy fazbear knockoff but female  2.Vaggie is rip off of Maggie from the Simpsons  3.Alastor looks like a Ennard ripoff but demon  4.The pilot makes fan of Scott and FNAF

Tomar flubbed dinner again?!
Istock
Better not be That fuck bot
0:00 ,,Hello, hello hello."  Almost gave me a heart attack here.
Now that his small intestine is gone, does he no longer possess his rubies?
Too bad I can't buy any Angel Dust merch because he is gay.  Thanks, Viziepop for changing his sexuality. *Sarcasm.*  I love his old sexuality much better because it made more sense.
When you were broke 💔
Tomar gifts us again
24.95 USD??! I want the t-shirt but the price.
The fact you drop so frequently but never bring back any designs makes me so sad cause sometimes we can't afford the merch but love a specific design.
Because you're not a real family if you don't have a land-line... At least that's what I've been told..
я бы купила...
You should release Vacay to Bonetown as an individual song.
Draw Fayemelina from Monster Legends pls upvote so she can see
Vivziepop, can you guys please add eng subtitle at captions in your videos for hazbin hotel and all helluva boss videos. I lack in english because english is not my main language. Love from your fans from Malaysia 🙏Please
Celta preto 23
Hot take,  I don't like this. I understand its to fund their shows and whatnot but in my opinion its kind of just gross, I kind of hate seeing official stuff like this of characters I like because it kind of takes the personalities away it feels like. I know nobody is going to agree with me, and I'm not trying to start any arguments but thats just my opinion.
Played like a damn fiddle
Holy fuck there’s playmats
Is that tomar
Hey that's Tomar
Bro I got trick by an image 💀
dammit how did i miss this
IM SORRY BUT CAN YOU SAY "Hello Hello" ALSO HAVE ALASTOR DO IT...
MOM GIVE. ME UR CREDIT CARD
Man downed a milkshake and shat himself 😩
The comment below me, spam "😳📸" in his replies
Wait isn’t Luna only 17????
Tomar
You perverts actually buy this stuff💀💀
Twas but a trick....
lookie what i found  https://youtu.be/rU6u25npzSQ
Stella stuff?? Throw it out the window!!!
Look Tomar, its you.
😭
mickey d’s
This had 666k views when I clicked and noe it has 667
The 666k views is so ironic
As of 8:57pm 3/11/23 666K views
I really appreciate how the alastor merch isnt sexual. I know a lot of people thrist after him, but its nice to see the team commit to his asexuality. Its hard to get ace rep man

Welp I alrd had the imp gang's sticker from a commision i did lmao
I want millie no one else just millie
Lemon Pepper hot XD
PHONE GUY FROM FNAF?!
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Hi aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I didnt even look at the image... I just saw hazbin hotel and said YES
I saw this only march 11💀
What. the. F**k
omfg, i'm pan, and all the pins and shit that are up are making me freak the fuck out, like, I WANT THE MOXIE STUFF, HE LOOKS SO CUTE, OMFG PLLLEEEAAASE, but then i remember i'm broke, and can't buy pretty much anything, because I know me, and I will end up buying everything (and at least 10 of each moxxie and loona pin)
._.

‘Lactose allergy’

Episode thres seasons two,when?

whens the next helluva boss episode coming out
Wait, I need help, why does the audio sound familiar?
Can't wait for this weekend hooray 🥳💥
I'm gonna start cyber bullying you to post more Helluva Boss, cause damn. Hurry up ya losers!
Here before the new episode this weekend
My mom said that I can’t get it 😢😢😢😢
Nah but wear the fúck is harbinger hotel episodes
Loona is soo good
Someone needs to hug marketing guy, he is on a down spiral
How is that, everytime i visit Vivziepop there is not a episod of the show, but a commercial video...
please do more helluva boss episodes
Vivzepop what will be first 8 seria or
i love how from sexy talk we ended up here
I’ve lost all interest in this series. Enough with the merch plugs and lack of content.
TOMARRRR TOMARRRRR TOMARRRRR the end
Out of curiosity when will we see the next episode of helluva boss?
작가님...ㅠㅠ 올려줘여
I know you put a lot of effort into making merch and even the episodes of Boss and Hotel but I just wanna warn that this is leading people astray, everyone has their beliefs and I don't want to take your freedom away but, it's just sad to see such golden potential focused on well making demons look fun and like in some ways good guys. God loves you and Jesus died and rose for you accept Him and let go of your sins and desires and follow him please. Take care.
hello vivziepop are there any copies of the art book of vivziepop thanks
Dont get me wrong, i love the show but, if i get one of these, fatherless i will become.
When’s the next episode coming out
mommy pig didn't buy me a bigmac so I cooked that bitch and fed my brother george
When yo new episode comin out
Hello How is *Pixel The Potato Cat* Doing?
Soon can we please have more Helluva Boss ❤
Also, if you haven't already, plushies of the characters would be so cute
Stolitz is going to fix itself right? Despite how Stolas is messed up,  I truly love this ship. I'm obsessed with it, despite literally finding out that this masterpiece of a show existed several days ago
Oh my
when will the next helluva boss episode be out its been months #
Thanks :)
I watch these advertisements only to listen to the man talking he’s awesome!
I got the Millie keychain for my car keys- it definitely matches the whip, I'm glad i got it frr
could you put dhead from Puss in Boots in this series as a dhead x loona idea?
When exit the episode 3 of season 2   Of helluva boss   And finale of helluva boss season 1 part 2?
Why is Fizzaroli in the hellborn section of the official ranking chart but hes classified as an imp on the wiki?
Vivziepop truly is a marketing genius. She knows how thirsty her fanbase is and knows full well that her characters are sexualized to the highest degree, and decided to make some profit off it. I imagine a lot of it too, seeing as at least half of these designs sold out last year and these current ones will likely sell out just as fast.
We all can't wait for more. I wish this was on prime I would watch it in a heartbeat 💓💓💓 feel better
Why did you troll me like this
You didnt have to make moxxie so damn cute
I’d rather be lower down on the fbi watchlist than higher up on it (I’m already #12 on the list dude)
I knew it wasn't anything spicy here I found some flaming hot merch instead tho 10x better
hey dude how is episode 3 going?
Whens s2 e3
Can u ad some subs?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
simping fro that Angel merch
0:36 GOT ME DYING JAJZAJJZJAJZJA
[Bonjour, ici l’assistance sociale, veuillez attendre que je relance Google Traduction. Car comme d’habitude, il me lâche H24]  Bon après cette tentative de blague raté (Relançant Google Traduction) I’ll stop speaking in French a moment.  I have three questions :  1- Have you ever watched “Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure” ? 2- Have you ever played a “Pokemon” game ? 3- Do you speak French ? Me, I can understand written English but I have difficulties understanding spoken English and write some sentences. The story with Google Translate was just a (failed) little joke.  (Google Traduction s’est arrêté put1)  Bon sur ce : Bonne journée/ Bonne soirée [Traduction : Good day/ Good evening]
When will the next episode come?
Bro, please make more episodes make four seasons please show is very good, very detailed, and I wanna see more assassinations from Moxie

WHY IS IT EVERYTIME I GO TO YOUR CHANNEL YOU ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MARKETING VIDEO!! WHYYYYY
No update, no sale...
Your vids are gooood though
It’s been 4 months Bain e I watched you guys and no new episodes
blueballed again
Omg stop I saw this and was like: “NEW EPISODE?!?!!” 😂😂😂
lol
Ill take your entire stock of loona.
i LOVE YOUR VIDS WAY TOO MUCH KEEP THE SEXY VIDS AWESOME WORK
Makes more Hazbin merch than actual content, bruh
For fucks sake. I thought this was an actual new episode.
Vivziepop... This is an amazing thing you've made. Let's party with Rakdos
Yes🤌🏽😌❤️
Been waiting for episode 3 of helluva boss -_-
LMAO I LOVE THIS-
Can we get actual content and not marketing campaigns?
bro they did the fanbase dirty 💀
Boo!
Next sexy episode when buddy
Vivziepop can you make another video of hazbin hotel and helluva boss?😃😄
THATS SO SMART TO MAKE MERCH LIKE THAT
THE SPICY MERCH OML- VIVZIE KNOWS HER FANS
ALL OF THE MERCH LOOKS AMAZING AHHHH
VIVZIEPOP KNOWS HER FANS FR
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOUR MERCH OML
This channel is 80% ads
But like imagine what kind of people would buy the stella ones- worst character kinks
Just saying this does not sound like the usual guy that always talks about how he has to hurry up and eat his donut or how he still working on episodes or how he needs you to buy this merge so he can pay for his kid's college fund maybe he was too busy to do this one so they got somebody else
The voice over guy sounds like the guy from the first 5 nights at Freddy's
And you should do some about Moxie and Millie and of how they met
Why is there no heluva boss still?
I couldn't reply because I had to do
... 🗿
Helluveboss ep2 broo
Plz tell us when the next helluva boss episode comes out please
Landline guy, are you doing OK?
I'd love some of the merch but theres no way im using robotshark, especially with their cost to ship stuff to the uk...
Sure wish you folks would spend as much time making your story videos as you do making your merch videos.
Billy-joe I saw this in my checklist into bad thing
WHEN THE HELLUVA IS THE NEXT EPISODE
I just love that guy
0:47  moxxie's one makes me smile (besides the one in the top right, I'm talking abt the femboy ones LOL)

ME LITERALLY WONDERING WHAT THE BACKGROUND MUSIC NAME IS (also i hope y’all make new episodes! take your time<3)
Were are the new episodes plis
still on the starting ad. scared to click the spacebar and unpause. yet so tempted to see the smooth animation. (edit; I was disappointed by the lack of cool demons kicking ass) (another edit: nevermind I was satisfied by the goofy auto voice message at the end)
333k views… change it please
0:11 me
Dammit I wanted husk hoodie but I forgot because I got drunk
HOLA vivziepop saludos desde peru' soy una fan

Hey vivziepop enough with the Charlie X vaggie it needs to stop it will get the show cancelled fast
Dorm full of these Banana would love it
I would like to buy everything but they don't sell to Chile, well, thank you
Ya we ya pongan la serie de hazbin hotel???? 😡😡😡😤😤💢💢
I feel like when i get too many loona Pins Blitz will kill me XD
This channel has become merchandise crap
Sad. Where is the other great guy? 😪
Make porn plis :v
Yes we get it you have mercy the 2nd video this month about it, please I just want a new episode update 😂
How about a new Episode? Or finally Hazbin Hotel before I lose interest completely. This ist getting lame
I BET STOLAS WOULD GET BLITZOS STUFF 😂
🖤
I am once again asking for more Striker merch in general
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Why are you doing this to me? Why Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
omg just do videos pls, ur merch no one will not buy without new episodes
I praying veroshika new playmat be available next month because I really want it so bad
Make sure to get them before they're gone! I guess...
PLEASE WE NEED A EPISODE 3 SEASON 2 FROM HELLUVA BOSS
Cool story but needs more Octavia. Got some really good designs though. I do have a Loona standee, pin and a Millie pin on pre-order. Previously bought the Octavia standee but I still can't bring myself to break her out of the case to stand her up. Not really a standee collector but funny how that works that you still wind up with a few. Funko pop figures are the same way in that they are not something I collect but I own three of them anyway.
Love the playing cards. Replacing the ♠️♣️♦️with an apple, a key, and a pentagram respectfully.
Still waiting for hazbin hotel
Я думал новая серия (
Урааа что-то новое эх я так жду отель хазбин
I love how even this narrator has a lore.
Just stay tuned...
When next episode
Where’s the next hulluva boss episode
JUST POST A NEW EPISODE GOD DAMN
New episode comes out this week.
Hey you guys ever had a mcgangbang?
Idc, just keep on making the episode! 👺
If I just had money and a credit card
Where’s the new episodes of Helluva Boss? 🥺 Miss seeing Blitz and Loona’s father/daughter growing development also Blitz and Stolis’s unlabeled relationship & dynamic
wow
No new episodes?
Viziepop veroskia is a ddlg icon pls have more of her n perhaps a ddlg song thank u 😀😗
Year 3 of waiting for hazbin hotel
I keep thinking she’s uploaded a new episode of helluva boss everytime I get a notification of her channel
I want every merch showed in this video.But,I have parents.
Oh great. More diluted content. More ads. Woooo! Get out your wallets simpletons!
Am i the only one who though it was the new episode 😭✋
I'm sad I never have money, but these gags are hilarious.
Drop the episode I know they take forever
Where is the goddamn episode 3 season 2?
Все: ждут контент по отелю Вивзи:ну, можете купить мерч, пук пук, вот, а 1 сезона отеля не будет, 4 года прошло всего лишь
WHERE WERE THE FIZZAROLLI STANDEES
How about telling us also when will the next episode be released😩
Hype no episode for almost five months, but yeah hey wanna buy our shit tons of stuff after the fans have been in stagnation for months good marketing viv
I was having issues ordering, for some unknown reason it wouldn’t continue to the next page, it would just stay there after I hit the continue bottom, so…
Yea lets do more merch. i mean why would we produce more of the actual series right ?
i just noticed the pilot was 3 years ago 😭😭
An excellent set of items for this universe.  Only great for the sellers of this creation, since the audience of the "Hazbin Hotel" universe will buy such items only with pleasure.  Someone out of opinion for beauty, someone just out of interest in the universe, and someone maybe stupidly for masturbation.  But this does not please me, that for a place something original, they stupidly took and created this.  Thank you at least that the children of this universe are not shown here sexually.  Although, looking at the very first batch of goods, and looking at this, I would not be surprised that this will happen.  And even such characters as Octavia, who are closed in themselves, will look like a woman of easy virtue, ready for anything, even in her mouth, even in the fifth point.  Forgive me who broke the brain at the concept of the meaning of my text, I do not know English, but I wanted to express my opinion about a new product that I do not like.  Why am I surprised though?  At least the Infernal Boss is going to the bottom.
I'm sorry. I'm too poor to buy anything
can you make a thing plush (from episode two) please? it would look soooo cute ❤
I just got a stand up keep up the good work guys
Wasn't v-day like 2 weeks ago
Welcome to vivziepop. 9000 commercials for fap fodder and also a few episodes of little demon people.
ate
Gotta respect that vivzi 100% understands their audience, and exactly what they want 😏 respect
I always love your guys merch. But it's always so expensive Shopping for me so sadly I need to skip this one :( but nexttime I'll buy some again :D
I can’t with this guy he’s too good of an actor
Де блять нові серії?
Bruh link isnt safe http not https
Can you make another helluva boss episode pls
How about you make some fucking content, seriously, I know it takes a long time to animate but you never work on it , you make like one episode a year it’s annoying
Once again how did I not get notified bout this earlier nice merch
As much as I super love the pinup designs, especially since now the boys are in on the fun too, I want to say THANK YOU for NOT sexualizing the one character canonically a minor (Octavia)
The merchandising is crazy i’m about to buy the entire stock of loona items
Vivziepop I make it to you and I’m going on my break now and I’m going home and I have a shop in the house to go get my stuff!! :D 🖐️😭💕💖🍼🧸
WHERES EPISODE 3???????? 😩    I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR NEARLY A YEAR ALREADY 😩 😩 😩     I need a hot tub

Everyone: *buys* Me: WHYYYYYY
I love your merch I hope I win that giveaway I don't even want the iPad I just want all of your merch ❤💜🖤💜❤
when is the new episode coming out
I wish I could buy some of em' , the merch looks real nice tho!
Hazbin hotel merch but theres only 1 teaser episode 💔
im beginning to feel like this is becoming a merch sell out channel, i get that it takes a while to make episodes, but with all of these merch sales they should definitely be able to afford to be putting out more episodes...
When are we getting a new video??
Did—Did you just make a steamed hams joke?
I wish we could've gotten a shirt with Loona and Octavia together. Maybe when the next batch drops I can get that wish.
Unsubscribing.  Too much merchandise advertising. Not enough show.
It’s been 5 years, stop having those sales just make hazbin hotel 2 already
Eu não falo inglês
If I had money to spare I would buy a lot of it.
I don’t have money for the playmate but I did get the posters. I love striker so much
I’m so sad I couldn’t buy anything this time around but hopefully next saving money
What the fuck are all these bots in the comment section it’s getting FUCKING ridiculous
tomamaoto
Honestly I wish they'd make less stuff, I only have so much money before I have to skip some things
i saw this in my subbox and I was fucking LIVID! then I realized it's just the reminder of the valentines sale ending. good god. I was like "VIVZIE! I HAVE NO MONEY!!!" gf and I got everything we wanted from this drop. just gotta wait for the preorders. so the odds are it's gonna get here just in time for my birthday in april :D   cyall in the summer when I spend too much money on hazbin/boss merch again~
I want to buy it but I don’t
Where season 2 episode 3 of helluva boss well if it's taking you this long I think it's gonna be good
I liked the old narrator better
#27 on trending lol
Ad narrator, we the fans hope your summer time deals have you feeling much better then valentines
I’ve never seen an IP with a content to merch ratio so outta wack
The end of the phone call got me so hard lol
A very beautiful voice, and greetings from Russia :)
Pro Tip Take a Screenshot Of one of the posters and Copy and paste and then Print it At Least you'll Get some merch 🙄
Does she even make content anymore or is it all merch sales.
First comment I see is about the premise, I need a drink…
I wanted a Sallie Mae pinup but i couldnt 😭  Also theyre sold out lol, maybe a Blitzø one
O yeaaaa
Grabbed every loona item
I GOT THE MUG! I GOT THE MUG! AHAHAHAHA

It's been a years you been making the show called Helluva boss
The jokes makes me feel like laughing and feeling guilty trying
Yes I’ve been wait
Phone guy
👍🌈🦉
Bit late lads
I hope they bring the playmats back at the end of the year like they did last year for last year’s play mats
Armor is green, Screams are internal, Anime is temporary, Doom is E T E R N A L
“So what does this have to do with you and last night?”
I can get all items
Do you ever actually post content, or _just_ advertisements?
Man i wish ya'll would keep it going till things sellout. Little broke atm and wanting to get merch 😭😭😭😭

LMAO!!!
Whew! Got my order in just in time!
Hurry up with the new anything!!!!
Nice😂
If you would still like to reach us, please hang up and don't call again.
"wont be coming back"   i can almost bet they will return next year like everything else they say wont be coming back
If it's not another episode of Helluva Boss, then I don't care.
Is weird that I had a dream that stolas bit stella in the neck and ripped off off her head
To think that this is mark 1 is insane, and you made it public.. can’t wait to see the progress
❤
Shadow:  Hey buddy I'm glad to drive you to the hospital as for that Valentine's stuff I'll think about it also I was wondering since you're like Tulsa tower how do I take you to a bar we can get some alcohol now listen I know I'm descendant of Salazar slytherin  But that's no reason a wizard like me and a muggle like you can't hang out call me back sigh about the answering machine I just found it a couple of years going I just said Hey why not and it is thanks for calling me or sending me a message love you have a great night stay stuff at that buddy
JUST GOT A POSTER HAHA
This channel has become 95 percent: BUY MERCHANDISE!!
rip, the guy on the phone
I would have but all of it if I had money but I don’t😭
POV you have no money like me:  Why must you make me suffer this amazing merch I have no money you know what why shouldn’t I why shouldn’t I steal money to buy this amazing merch
theres someone missing-  SIR PENTIOUS-
I swear, IF S2 E3 OF HELLUVA BOSS DOESNT COME OUT SOON, IMA GO !-!-!|\|$@-@-@-@|\|3!!!!!  I need more episodes to waaaaaatch pwp
Literally stop sexuliazing your character pedo.
More merch of love 💕 ♥️💘, come and get them!
the character development for the announcer guys are so grand. i love it
Every time I see a notification from this channel, I get a heart attack anyone feel the same way?
💗💗💗
Can’t wait for the next episode of helluva boss
*im a SIMPle man. I see verosika, I click* 😂
Too late it’s almost the 28th
😋
Not to be mean but when is next hazbin hotel comping out
I would buy but there isn’t any more good moxie merch in stock😔
Vivzie  how do you feel knowing that everyone likes your series and there are even people dubbing for other countries like me who am from Brazil and I really like your helluva boss series    ⚠️I translated from google⚠️
Who else wants Verosika to smash yo-  Uh... I mean...            fine you caught me...
I googled Hazbin Hotel recently— and one of the top recommended inquiries was « Is Hazbin Hotel OK for eleven year olds? » I think the answer to that is no 😅
When are you going to release more Hellavaboss!?
Awwwww I feel so bad for him. I would’ve given him another chance 🥹❤️
Do you own Helluva Boss?
It's sometimes hard for me when  Vivziepop uploads a new film on her channel after months of waiting. I am always convinced it's gotta be a new episode of helluva boss but then i see a merch update once again and I feel a little sad. At least we can increase our collection by adding new, beautiful, priceless items to it.
Sweet as less spicier just for me please.
wheres s2 ep 3???
How did they get the godly man Tomar himself to announce these things? Do they not comprehend the power he has or the destruction that comes when he flies into a fit of rage?
What did y'all do to stella
oh boooyyyy... hawking more merch... twice as much shilling as actual show to watch... You guys are exactly the kind of people the helluva boss crew get hired to take out.
Also I got 5 landlines and 5 answering machines from the 90’s
Loving that Millie merch 🤩
That one person who bought everything: 😂
Trust me I don't need anything anymore I have a lot already now where is my new episode !? 😐😑
I can't get one but I want to
HI TOMAR!!!
Yippee
God, I do not miss answering machines. Voicemails are so much easier to ignore than a hunk of beeping, blinking plastic on the table. It's bad enough when the caller is clingy for attention.  So anyway, looking forward to those shirts I ordered! Good stuff
10/10 McDonald's Date
Now that's *SPICY!💯👌🔥🙌😎🌶🥵*
Oh If U Tell Vivienne Medrano to Make New Characters Like Twizzly Twizzles & Blaine Blaine-Ling & Morgana the Gorgon They Will Be New Demons in Hazbin Hotel! Including Adding the Old Characters of Her Speed Draws!
this is cool :o but i thought it was a new episode of helvua boss 😭
I love your new video keep it up your awesome 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 and can't wait to see your new episodes 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Sweet I can't wait for adult swim
well i buyed the playing cards so im waiting for it to come :l
Im lucky to buy something before 27
imagine, putting out actual content instead of cash grab merch..  crazy
Oh my
WHAT THE
well, this is kinda late, don’t you thin?
I see this and I keep recalling the moments they called the artists who draws lewd Luna creeps... Then they sell lewd Luna merch. XD
i’ll buy it in a bit
Yeaaa
i wish i had enough money for the stolas hoodie. Will the stolas hoodie come out again next valentines?
I would like to ask when the next episode is coming, put if curiosity
Thanks for the heads up, I almost missed my chance
I like how he keeps us updated despite his conditions.
Wish there was a way to turn off notifications for sales. I get excited thinking it's a new episode, then... nope!
🥲 I was waiting for the deep voice
Well at least he's apologized and reminded about the quality merch
dude sounds so sad i wanna give him a hug
Lol nah I'm good on merch. GIVE US EPISODE 3 FOR HELLABOSS PLEASE
Where are the shows?!
Ay ya yay. It’s muy caliente in here.
I have a rotary dial telephone from the 90s...
Nasanha
Most people get paid on Friday
Ohh!!
I always buy from your sales every time you put out one of these videos. You are all so cool. :)
Bet they're just tryna sell out as much merch as possible and fucking dip
Can you make another episode
4 shop updates for each episode of actual content
0:49 thank you for putting everyone in a very nice outfit 👍
Glad I bought the Pin-Up Verosika Standee before she sold out.
Wait how does someone forget that they are allergic to something lol??
I actually made my first purchase of Helluva Boss gear a few days ago when some of the extras from older merch came back around. I got two shirts, a Loona keychain and a Loona plushie and I love all of it. Great stuff all around.
but.. i liked mc donalds :(
Man i need one of those pins haha (I say as i wash moth bodies from my wallet)
The narrator LORE tho
I’m surprised this doesn’t mention that there are 4 new episodes coming in the next couple of months. It’d quell a little bit of the impatience among people who missed the teaser trailer
Just wanted to apologize for not replying to the dozen or so other messages he left on my machine—communication's never really been my strong suit (in case you couldn't tell by my phone and answering machine from the 90s).
No pls let it last till 2 months
You said there would be some spicy stuff, but all i see is just horny figures! So here's my question: WHERE ARE THE TACOS?!?!
Буду ждать перевод. ничего не понял
i like to think that all these little stories viv tells for merch drops are all cannon and happen in hell.
ok i may do a purchase BUT you hurry on the new seasons deal?
cant wait for the next Helluva Boss episode
Aww I wish I could get merch
HAZBIN HOTEL EPISODE 1 PLS
Please when is the episode 3 of season 2 coming out ?
Selling merch for a show that doesn't even exist yet seems super sketchy to me...
4 months
I have an idea for you have god port a curses on Ymir when he dies come back to life again
Where's Episode 8?
Just an idea they could make a non canon comic like “a night with loona” they could also just sell straight up hentai with an only fans. they could make a good amount of money with that. With how much everyone in this fanbase are degenerates they could make a lot of money to support the show if they do it as a side business
Squeeze those udders
they post these more  than more episodes
How he recovers from the surgery 😅
Stop teasing us QwQ
OMG YES
Is it strange that no matter what, I have abstained from NSFW Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel material?
VEROSIKA FUCKING STOP DEAR GOD

Blitz in the mercy🫣😳
63,358 views
Ahhhhhhhh
this guy deserves to be a character in hazbin, he'd fit right in at the reservation desk.
I always get these notifications and think it's a new episode😭
Hm, how very interesting,  …how successful is this?
New eps?

Hey Vivziepop I just really wanted to say that I love helluva boss and I can’t wait for Seson two ! I just wish I was a voice actress to bc I just love HB so much❤ anyway lots of ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉!
Мне кажется на нас деньги зарабатывают отеля хазбин нет а реклама есть . Где логика ?
Holy shit is that Tomar
I would buy stuff but I’m poor soooo…
another promo for merch at this point im better off un subbing and getting the actual episodes through the algorithm on my home page when they drop
Awesome merchandise
🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
How to frick people over and over and over again ofc
Lol i don't have money 🤗
We're is. A. New. Videos
I am poor😂
When is your show coming back
whys it so scary when you get a   notification from this account
Нихуя , вы пробили дно , молодцы!
wan do we get new ep <3
i don't need that merch because i have 5 million power in rise of kingdoms
I need that call blocker for calls & texts...it's brilliant.😂😅
WOW they really decided to wait AFTER Valentine's to release them.
Congrats to the dude who survived Surgury
Make more fucking episodes of hazbin. The show that made the fucking channel and you keep milking more than gta V
Feb 14.
How about you make more episodes. This feels like a cash grab.
I have to say these things from this merch were really cool. It all looks amazing with sexy style. We will wait for new merched and i hope they will also look that good.
I cant wait to get my Angel Dust!!!
🧐
Where's part 2 of Season 1 Finale of Helluvaboss?  Why has it been over 3 years since Hazbin Hotel and still no scheduled release date?
I want to buy some so bad but I have to save every dollar for college tuition. Someday
Good god.... Stella's pin-up 🤤😩
I’m *very* certain my parents would be *very* against the idea of me having *demon merch* from a *demon show* while being related to a *Christian* grandmother from my stepdad’s side of the family. Who also has a *christian* sister with *christian* things decorating some of her house.
Nice music.
Like 2 weeks late
Cool
I swear there are more merch ad videos than actual animations. I know animation is time consuming and expensive, but can't you include this as a pre-roll for your episodes on Youtube?
sorry to say that but what i really want is not of your cool merch but more episodes of helluva boss, so yeah...
When new episode?
Viv definitely knows her fans.
They are awesome. 😀👍
Que la funemos dice :v
I too am very sick.
I love helluva boss and hazbin hotel✨💗💕😍
ahhh damn i don't get paid till thurs xD no limited merch sadly
Episode 3!
Where is episode two of Hasbin Hotel?
I wanted Stella's Pin-up Standee and it didn't last even a couple of days.... TT_TT....
👏hock 👏that 👏merch  In the background: *please forget this was ever a show, its always been just merch okay*
🔥
Just done playing plague Inc. And than i see this intro
They know very well
The constant begging for money in exchange for hentai is getting annoying af.
they aren't available for ship to Chile :c
I start to suspect that this is not made for children
Love that it was a voicemail left so funny  Already got my pins of the female characters, my standees of Charlie & vaggie, Cherri bomb (sold out) & loona, along with 3 keychains and stickers and my Charlie poster my poster got shipped but the rest did not yet can’t wait for them though
I wish I could buy merch man.
He has a point, why DO I have a landline/answering machine from the 90s? I wasn't even born then.
NEW EP WHEN????
🤨
I missed the cherry standee and now I'm upset
S2E3 when?
Is that tomar?
So are we going to get actual content for the show? Or will this be another filer video?
I DONT WANNA BUY YOUR FUCKING MERCH IT BEEN I DONT KNOW ABOUT 4 MONTHS SINCE THE NEW EPISODE WASENT MADE EVER SINCE 2022 I DONT EVEN CARE IF YOUR BROKE TO DO EPISODES I JUST WANT HELLUVA BOSS PLEASE
I love u Vivziepop ♡♡
All purchases from the website that they are on, help with the production of Hazbin hotel and Helluva boss correct?I believe someone said it does but I’m not sure.
boring, also valentines its a lie, and its almost half a month gone, give us new episodes instead of these
The sussy murch, ima get a cap
I would love to buy Valentines Day themed Merch but I’m not a big v day fan and winter my hours her cut. So less work less money on my end
honestly peak advertising
I will get them next time when I have the money
New phone guy fnaf ❤ (love your show)
I'm going to start heating up if you don't mind
I really want them, but I can't buy them. Adulting sucks 😮‍💨
I expecting helluva boss episode 3
Oh
Damn i still don't care
DOOM GUY
Why can't you do the end on friday, you know. When people get paid?
I like Helluva Boss, but this channel is 90% merch ads.
Damn gone in two weeks
Awesome!!!
I honestly feel bad for the person who's advertising the merch, it was clear by the first video about these that he's not havin much luck in his life and honestly I just wanna hug the pain away.
The narrator is so more of a character than the two shows characters are
Very sus
is it me or they released alot more merch then episodes ?
got my loona shirt and its awesome, im getting my human loona shirt torrmorow
Bro I saw the new video pop up and I thought a new ep came out
I'm glad I got what I needed for 2023 Valentine's merch. Some standees I liked, pins, keychains and one new play mat. Hope you guys get all you need for the Vivziepop merch of Valentine's 2023.   It sure would be a while before I spend money there again. The caller on the landline at least is okay recovering from his operation.
I've never had a valentine. Must be nice tho
OH MY GOD WHEN'S THE NEXT HELLUVA BOSS EPISODE

Ok and where Is episode 3?
WHAT A FUCK ANIMATION !!
I very much wish there was an Octavia (not valentines related) desk mat. I know there is a cool playmat but id love to get a mouse/keyboard desk mat of Octavia.
Bought.
And again a merch on top of merch what will be next goal? One Episode per year? Where is the hazbin hotel as promised? Where are the Helluva Boss episodes as promised? Just merch nothing else anymore? 4 month since the last Ep. 3 years since the hazbin hotel pilot? wtf? But  our money is needed... okay. But where its going? Not in the production im sure.
Are you gonna be okay?
WUOOOOOOOOO
I'm unsubscribing. Someone will just have to tell me when the next episode comes out.
💜
Marketing genius
Un pregunta tienen entregas para latinoamrica

oh really
New episodes coming this summer so keep calm we are so close
MY CLA-
How many times do i have to get bamboozled by this channel to understand?
Interesting
Googl images
Need more ads! When are the new episodes?🤔
Holy shit- I'm early! Hey Viv! Love your Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel merch the shows in all!
Don't worry, next Valentine's Day we'll hopefully see it come back sometime.
Releasing all this merch but not a single Helluva Boss episode
Why is Hazbin Hotel always mentioned in these when only the pilot ever was released.
Googl images
Octávia pliiiiisssssss
Whopper Whopper Whopper Whopper Junior Double Triple Whopper 🔥
Googl images
Do you honestly expect people to get really excited over this stuff anymore? You guys haven’t come out with an episode in like months. Get your shit together. I’ve already spent $100 on Murch.
when the hazbin hotel coming out?
have anyone counted the ratio of merch content:actual content?
As much as I love your work,  Viv, the fact you're selling hazbin hotel merchandise when you only have the pilot episode out makes me think you don't plan on making more of it
No
Vivzie: "You know the kind of FREAKS that drool all over you" Also Vivzie: "Here's a lewd Loona pin for sale!"
A little late no vizie?
nice
😈😈😈
i got soooo baited
Why don't you guys ever have sales that last to the beginning of the next month? Because that's when I get paid
❤❤❤❤
No seriously, we need episode 3 and you can keep the merch
Does anyone else want more episodes posted and less ads
Epic work! Great job!
Nice video
OH COME ON I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE NEW EPISODE
"I know, I know. Takin' a long time." For the high quality effort you guys put into this show, the long wait is beyond worth it. A lot better for a really good episode per 8-12 months than one subpar episode a month because "Duuurrr we want episode naow!!!!" Please don't rush these absolute gems.
Well this scam certainly had more effort put into it than needed.
Me waiting for helluva boss s2e3 like:🍷🗿
What a bad time to not have money 😔
Kinda feels like you guys are just milking the shows. It's like you're more focused on the merch then the actual thing. Idk I could be wrong it just feels like that. Doesn't change the fact that I love the shit out of the shows.
Bro it's 2 weeks past valentines day 🤣 but the merch still looks cool
VIZIE UPLOADED! IS IT A HELUVA BOSS EPISO-goddamnit
Man, this announcer has a rough life
Love the merch but wen is the new episode?
Make some Hazbin and Helluva Boss funkos
DROP THE NEW EPISODE ALREADY!!!!!
Well, they got me. Bye wallet:(
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how dedicated the narrator is to his job that he would make this announcment just after getting out of the ER for severe digestive troubles?
That's a quality answering-machine right there.
I think its safe to say that Vivziepop is probably the best content creator on the platform right now. Good for them for doing that they are doing. 🔥
Rule34 artist: you cant defeat me HB and HH fanbase: I know but she can Vivziepop and her team
Can you please sell these images for desktop wallpapers?
They’re really out here selling softcore of their characters to fund their shows... I absolutely dig this energy team, you go get ‘em and take as long as you need for Helluva Boss.
Where is Season 2, episode 3?
You definitely know your audience with that thumbnail
Isn't it perfect timing that I'd just eaten some spicy noodles before this video released? 🤣
I'm so upset that Stella stand sold out so fast ;; please keep sexy, evil birdmom <333
Please we beg you can you please release episode 3 it's been so long 😩
Man I wish I can buy those all Merchs But I can't Because...  1st: I don’t Have much money to buy a single merch  2nd: Our country doesn't sell Vivzipop Merchs  3rd: evryone Hates me ■■■■■ 100%
Is the new hazbin hotel episode or helluva boss episode coming out first?😊  (I don't know how i am dirty minded and sweet)
Will they come back later
This all started after my February check.  And is going away before my March check.
Anticipation is killing me here. Maybe I should phone Blitz(o) for a ride down...
Sallie May getting merch is why I'm now 70 bucks short, very cool.  Oh also millies pin too but she was a given.
XD?
Ah yes, Vivziepop getting fans to thirst over the characters to distract them from the waiting for the next episode. Well played.
There's nothing better than a fresh friendly baked Vivziopo videos and they always makes our day or night even better keep it up
Yeah feel free to just keep selling us shit while we wait for the show lol
Other people: i spent my money on a startup buisness but it faild any how did you get broke Me: i ah.. i... i dont really wanna talk about it
Same shit new advertisement.
SKKS FINAL DAY AA
So HOT even your credit card will burn up from the lusting heat!  (the guy calling seriously needs help with his current relationship...)
Soy una gran fan de tus series no puedo esperar a ver los próximos capítulos de HB y HH 🥰🥰💗
WHAT ABOUT EPISODE 3 IN SEASON 2
When are new episodes coming out
Idc about Valentine's stuff
This scares me how much he sounds like my dad
If only Verosika was so prominent in the actual show...
I wonder if they’re gonna do Easter themed like the characters of Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel were all gonna wear some bunny suits like leotards and tights.
Even the merch drop videos are hilarious!! I'm cracking up and trying not to spit tea all over the monitor!!!!
This merch proves Vivzie knows her fans
Waiting for my beloved Striker stuff to come in the mail. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
14 days late for valentines lol
Hazbin hotel more like: i got a lot of merch but only one chapter and it's the Pilot but i'm super fucking famous
drinking ostrokrzewu paragwajskiego while watching this, something beautiful
Stop teasing and release the episode 🌚
Hey Tomar, it’s you.
The fact that Vivziepop's team read the fanbase perfectly by adding those mats just shows how much they respond to their viewers.
Nice
Hey viv!! Honestly such a massive fan and Cannot wait for the new hazbin hotel episodes!! I hope to meet you one day, it will be such a dream
Cant wait for my valentine's pins and keychains to come in the mail, thinking about getting Loona shirt for this line❤️
When you focus more on merch ( for literally year's) instead of making an episode 2 lol 😆😂
Man, not having money sucks.
Some jewelry would be nice. Like necklaces at least
Vivziepop truly is a marketing genius. She knows how thirsty her fanbase is and knows full well that her characters are sexualized to the highest degree, and decided to make some profit off it. I imagine a lot of it too, seeing as at least half of these designs sold out last year and these current ones will likely sell out just as fast.
I appreciate these ads a lot. They are really funny and I'm happy to be able to support this show however I can.
Will the pin up stands will be available on April 18? Cause I want one so bad for my birthday, my birthday is on April 18!
The Stock Photos are what get me 😂
They're taking their sweet time with Hazbin Hotel. It's a good thing I'm a man of patience.
I thought this was Helluva Boss S2 E3 :(
Hi finally a new video
I swear this channel has the most qdvetised sales videos then pewdipie
Dam,if i had enough money i would buy every freaking thing
damn, hope you get well narator!
💓💚💛♥️♥️💕💕♥️♥️♥️💛💚💓💓💓💙💙💓💓💚💛💛💚💓💓💝💝💝🤎💘💜💓💓💘🤎💜💚♥️😍🥰😍😍
I bought Loona stuff
Ong love yall frfrrrfrfr
No entiendo mucho inglés, pero de todas formas me gusta ver estos videos de vivziepop 💠  I don't understand much English, but I still like to watch vivziepop's videos (I'm translating this with google translate)
Why did the voice at the end sound like narrator from the boys
I hate blitzo u make he no one love he a jerk we love charlie she a hero blitzo 😝🤮👎👎👎👎
adoraria comprar, mas pagando em dolar eu pagaria 5 vezes mais o valor da minha moeda
*Thanks for the latest new Helluva Boss/Hazbin Hotel Valentine's Day merch,**#Vivziepop**!'Looking forward to the brand new upcoming five season 2 episodes of Helluva Boss when they are good and ready!* ;D
I’m brain dead :p
Again with the sexy merch, i swear they never fail to deliver on these sorts of things. It's ridiculous.
Real glad I won the Skark Robot giveaway now, plenty of money to burn
I got the standees I wanted before they sold out, so I'm a happy camper! I know it'll be about a month or so before I get them (gotta love the pre-orders), but it's always been worth the wait. Now that prints are available, I'm hoping we'll get more updates about conventions and signing opportunities in the future.
Thanks tomie get well soon
i audibly gasped when i saw the notification

Still waiting, still waiting, still waiting for ep3 s2
I just want episodes🥲🥲
Cool ❤️‍🔥 😍😍😍hu
Moxxie my dearest
yes
When you come out 3 episode???
How long is the shipping normally take for this I ordered something but I don't know how long it takes a little curious. I don't mean to say this in any aggressive way either truthfully this is the first thing I've ever ordered online
Interesting
I love these commercial vids.🥰
Heheh I gotta love it Choom 👍🏻❤️ But I don't have enough eddies for it, so is cool ✌🏻 hope you have a Helluva great day 👍🏻
Weewoo

For a second,I thought that a new helluva boss episode dropped. I was wrong
bit late
I got two Matt's and the sketch back back. I can't justify buying more of have no use for it 😭
XD lol
Mugman approves of this video
I am here for the tit6t6t6t6t6esessees
Aun tengo asuntos pendientes  con tigo por funar a scott
Valentine's merchandise I won't get until May or June. Hooray!
Yeah more murch with no new contant : )
one thing i just don’t like is how long it takes  to get here after the pre orders are done. it still takes forever to get here. but good things come to those who wait
I forgot about this channel because u took forever to give us an episode,and that made me really not that exited about the merch
I think this might be the most  soon I've ever clicked  on my notifications  🙃
I thought this was a new episode 😭
Ооооо
Doe's anyone know what's the ost playing in the background?
Yep, I'll definitely take at least 10.
Thankfully I already got my merch ;) And it is *SPICY HOT* as advertised!
Woo
bruh bro, i thought it was a new episode 😭😭
44 coment here v:
I was about to ask the same question about the answering machine. Lol
"Hello? Hello hello? Well, if you're hearing this, then chances are you've made a very poor career choice."
But it's almost March. Huh??
My patience gonna disappear at midnight too without news on the next episode!!!
And that is why
The keychains are so 😩😩 and especially Engel dust 😖❤️‍🔥
WEEEEEEEIUUUUU WEEEEEEIUUUUUUUUU I DONT KNOW WHAT TO COMMENT BUT IM COMMENTING
Is that a phone guy from fnaf?
Awe, it's sweet that he made a follow up call to our date while apologizing for it being a bit of a flop, still a very sweet thing to do. :)  Edit: Guys, I have no idea as to why there are so many bots in the reply section. Just report them.
😄😄😄😄
Woah woah, not so fast, you might as well call it LATEntin.         *Don't mind me*
That guy is the best XD
"What made you think this was heaven? THIS IS THE OTHER PLACE!"  Helluva Boss fan: "What made you think I wanted to leave?"
You gotta love how he's straight up following up the previous two episodes of the date up to this point. Aaand I think that McDonald's gave him diabetes. So ye- happy valentines day 🥲👍
I'm wondering if there are any helluva boss or hazbin hotel fans in my country (Turkey), it's like I know these two...?
Bro rlly got hit by the McDonalds 😭
Hoi
👍
Buying merchandise helps fund the show!
VIVZIE LET US TALK TO HIM XD
