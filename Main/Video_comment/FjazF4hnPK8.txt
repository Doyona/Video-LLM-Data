Thanks what's the hotdog pres call we're you purchase them from
"lay our hot dogs.." proceed to dump them in pile onto the grill 😄
Yeah. The criss cross pattern helps make a good item made up of a paste squirted into a long smooth  dookie and now with the turd hashmarks, it really bumps it up and less undignified or uncivilized 🤷🏼‍♀️
Amazing 👏!!!!!!
looks good as always 🔥
They look so amazing! You have such h wonderful recipes Miguel!
All gimmicks
Doesn’t the hotdog get dry when you cut it like that? My mom used to do that and it always came out dry.
Looks pretty damned good....I'd kill about 4 of those jokers.  Well done my good man, well done.

Cut a hotdog into slices and then look at them under a microscope. You'll see anal hair, public hair, fecal matter. Just no.

Ok you’re gonna pop the hotdog in the micro wave for like 30 seconds, while that’s going, grab a slice of bread or a tortilla, flatbread whatever you got, slap some mayo on it, ding!

Looks good but when the oil comes out of mozzarella cheese it ruins the flavour. Try less heat and take it off as soon as you start to see oil in the cheese
Ramsey:  THE CHEESE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SEARED NOT BURNT YOU DONKEEEEEYYY!!!!
gordon Ramsay likes that
Reminds me of when the dog is sick then proceeds to eat it again knowing that's what made it sick the 1st time
Put the hotdog on the melted cheese then roll it  up, saves room
Needs something acidic. Not a fully loaded without.

Cheap ass dogs.
The marks were pointless if you were going to hide it with veggies and cheese. Smh but the end result looked good
I was like wtf is a bell pepper then it clicked what they call bell peppers is capsicum for me🤣🤣🤣🤣

Hot togs

Everything you did was amateur. How did you manage soggy yet dry? 👌
He eating a glizy
Damn that shi look 👀 good 😌 asf
The taste of sausages in America is so crazy. It tastes like salt and plastic.
Yummmmmmm
Why not just use a knife for the crosshatch, smh. For every stupid task there is a plastic tool no one needs.
Bruh. It don't matter how you do it. Hot dogs show how broke you are.
Who came in your sandw8sge 😶
Okay alright, ngl, tbh, imo, til that this actually looks pretty good for a hot dog

My friend Mike said the whole men race is over if us women have this
One with no cheese please
Dice the veggies and it'd be perfect
Beautiful marks on a hotdog?  Omg
*glizzys*
Criss cross marks had zero purpose
Hotdogs tast like shit
Grill needed to be on a higher heat if im being honest, no colour on the veg and you can barley call it a sear on the hot dogs either but otherwise as a whole its a well balanced choice of ingrediants with mozzarella as the cheese it doesnt overpower the onions and hot dog so their flavour still stands out.
This actually made my mouth water. Great job
Who the fuck has this setup at home?  This asshole is laughing at you
Bell peppeerrrrrrsss
Where's the fucking ketchup man
that is not a logdog that a glizzy tatoo
Looks great man
What maz doing eating a glizzy and some vegetables 🤣😂
why slot the hot dogs if you are going to cover them with crap?
If you want the best boiled hot dogs. Stab them with a fork add seasoning of your choice, bbq sauce of choice, and mustard.
Peppers, onions and cheese on a hotdog? Poor mans Italian sausage sandwich!
I’m surprise he did not say Glizzy instead of a hot dog
Foos gone wild. Warning! Where is this foo going?
Where can i get one???
It’s just a hot dog man your extra asf😂😂😂
Use real sausage. Not that hardened paste shit
No mames, quiero 4 para llevar.
I want this man as my personal chef.
These look great, but do this with some fire beer brats and then heaven. Even though they're beef dogs. The brats would kill it.
I would love to eat one of those right now

That looks like a muffuletta not  hot doggie
Glizzys
Wow
Philly cheese dog
I woulda wrapped the cheese around the wiener 🤣
But you can't see the marks you put on the hotdogs... Pointless
Congratulations you showed us something we already know how to make
Good food 👏
Imagine seeing this at a party and biting into it thinking it’s a Philly cheese 🤢
For those who are wondering (if anyone was) the song is Je Cherche un Homme (I search for a man) by none other than the INCOMPARABLE Eartha Kitt. Multilingual actress and singer.
The forbidden cheese
What does the hot dog "press" do?  More excitement followed by disappointment. 🙆‍♂️
I WANT IT NOW SOOOO GOOD
so he fancied up the hot dogs then completely covered them, sounds great to me!
Only americans eat that shit
I WANT one! 🤩😋😄
Why do Americans call viennas hotdogs. What do they call hotdogs then. I mean the bun with the vienna and the sauce.
You sound like foos gone wild
Turn the hot dogs into chicken strips and we might have a winner
Do you know what hotdogs are made of?         Everything ✌🏿
Glitzy master
Only in American can someone make a tutorial on how to eat the garbage parts of animals
Todo iba bien hasta que pusiste la salchicha en el pan frío q saco
His name is cooking with fire, yet he continues to use flat tops, indirect heat, etc... not cooking with fire lil
Son muy buenas las chaparritas.... aquí en Chile se llaman chaparritas
Comment imiter du vrai avec du faux. Aucun intérêt.
You cook all those peppers for presentation then you spend thirty bucks and a chunk of plastic that puts marks on your wiener
Didn’t toast the bun though
How to make half done hotdogs

Glizzy eater but they look good
Glizzy eater
This foo knows what he’s doing
Did not order a nut dog
I've never seen anyone put so much work into a hot dog lmao
This looks good
Spending $10+ on a useless, single-purpose kitchen gadget that does what a butter knife can do with less effort 👌
Absolutely disgusting who eats that
Started this video not hungry at all... now I'm rummaging thru my fridge trying to find hotdogs.... damnit Also, everyone needs the hotdog cutter thing. Wow...
Man you do a lot of starting off
Those look like shit with the cheese.
Nice overpriced one job having piece of plastic that does something that you can do with a butter knife.
That looks good 😌🤤
Cancer 👁👄👁
😀😀😀👍👍👍👍
Glizzy
estadunidense só come isso, o mínimo que se espera é ficar bom
Good video, I subscribed
The mozzarella cheese on top of the hot dog at the end looks wrong
Not the glizzy
instructions unclear it hurts and the doctor told me i can’t have children
Who the fuck goes, I need to share my HOTDOG recipe with the world
Beef anus in its own squeezins never looked so good.
Magi, what about the magi!
ChEeSeeeeeer GliZZYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Glizzy
Who cares?
This looks so good 😋
Black puppy: I'll be outside, call me when mine is ready.
GLIZZY GANG
I was just watching a guy sear a5 wagyu and then it goes to this
Dude is doing too much. All a hot dog needs is mustard.
Hot dogs - lungs , tongues and bums.
*GLIZZY*
I was waiting for him to say "orale"
I'm hungry af now 😒
But why the off brand hotdogs??
Were u working in front of Staples Center after the game?
I don't like the taste of burnt cheese it changes the flavor to a sour taste I would just top it off
Hotdogs are trash, and shouldn’t be used to try and prove you can cook.
Toast the bun brah
This guys really trying to give us a cooking tutorial *WHILE COOKING WITH HOT DOGS*
This reminds me of the CRH review. "Today we are going to test this new gadjick, the slutdog"
For presentation... Covers in cheese lol
This looks gross as fuck and he for sure didn't cook those hot dogs all the way through.
Those patterns change the taste
gross
THATS A SAUSAGE
adds a design to tha glizzy for presenting... then COVERS IT IN CHEESE ?!:!:
Ur a mad man
Looks delicious 😋
Philly cheese dogs
Gehen Sie zur teleg:ram, suchen Sie den K:anal "Walter Coin Coin" und verdienen Sie
Eeeeeeeeee mex idiot
Hotdog - sear on all sides? It’s round 🤪
No Matter how you cook a hotdog, its still just a hotdog
“Not the Glizzy!!!!”
Glizzy
👍👍👍👍
Bro, why is this in the german youtube trends ?
Why does he talk like that??? Lol
The end product looks disgusting and a hot mess.
You didn’t toast the buns fucko
https://youtu.be/eTNebUxR3NE
But why
At first i thought he gonna smash the sausage with that thing. After he pull the thing up i was like "what kind of sorcery is this? 👁️👄👁️".
Wtf thats not fully loaded you just turned a hotdogs into a taco
This looked delicious
that hot dogs looks like it got creampied
With cheeeese and extra dip
I’m glad this wasn’t titled Fully loaded Glizzys😂
Fully loaded glizzys
Subbed.
This man pre-mad his char marks 😂😂😂
This looks so good
He said for presentation purposes but then covered it up with cheese and peppers
Believe Jesus died for your sins was buried and rose on the third day for your justification and youll have be in heaven when you die 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 Acts 16:30-31
It was a good idea. No point in the hatch marks if there going to be covered.   My opinion: heat the buns on the griddle and put the toppings on the bottom. I find them easier to eat and not be so messy that way. I eat lunch on the go a lot.
How u gon use that tool on the hotdog for presentation purposes, but the cover it w/ cheese and onions😭
Use meat not hotdogs this fucking idiot
It’s Hotdogs or aka glizzys with nut and onions and peppers
watch out he playin wit fully loaded glizzys
Yummy 🤤
Wow....tic tok food that actually looks good...I'd definitely eat that....I'd probably swap the mozzarella for Provolone though  At first I was like "WTF DONT DO THAT TO THE DOGS DONT CUT THEM!" Then I realized.....FLAT TOP GRILL....and was like Mmmm acceptable in this case
GLIZZY
Crazy Russian hacker of cooking
Hot dogs are torture trash.
That's what she said
Cumdog
Chuyên nghiệp quá!
so why this video is on trends ???
Strips of bell peppers?  Mozzarella cheese??  This one's out there.
Who tf adds mozzarella to a hot dog
Cutting those vegetables is my headache
“Add some seasoning foo” “Like that ese”
Dude put a burn on those dogs . You may as well eat them out of the package
When I saw the title saying "fully loaded" the first thing I thought of was someone shoving cartridges into a hotdog. Luckly it isn't so.
Why of all the cheeses in the world do people choose that tasteless rubber called mozzarella ?It will never stop to baffle me.
https://youtu.be/Q6kqmTSfy2Q  WHAT THE HECK??!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Its a gilzzy carver
You know they can cook when they put cheese straight on the pan without hesitation       I would have 911 on speed dial 🤣🤣🤣
A guy handling wieners in a TicTok video equals GAY
That’s looks good
Where tf is ur food stand at!
What the actual fuck. Your putting a lot of energy into garbage food.
This looks great and I’m sure it tastes great but it kinda defeats the purpose of hot dogs
Delish😊
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Not a bell pepper fan personally but I’d eat TF out of that without question.
Looks good but I'm old school.  Hot dog with mustard and onions... that's it.
Looks so good king 😍
That hotdog "machine" is for lazy people.
Heavy breathing
Uses fancy grill thing to make hot dogs look neat. States it is for presentation purposes, immediately tosses vegetables and cheese over dog to cover up what was done.
Okay *now cook wild glizzys*
Should've added some shrooms to the pepper and onions
Nice flattop /s
😋😋😋😋
I'm not gonna lie it looked to me like miguel was cooking with propane
On this episode of “Will you be constipated or have diarrhea”
So basically a cheap mans philly cheese steak sammich ok
Why would any person eat a hotdog is beyond me, go and look how it is made and what's in it. 🤢
"Can I get a bacon cheese & weenie on uh roll"
Great vids man. You're giving me great ideas for the cookouts
How come every average stooge that knows how to toast a Pop-Tart thinks they're a YouTube chef now. Fuckouttahere
Reclaimed meat in hot dogs  is used for making dog food ... yuk
This guy: today were making hot dogs That one kid: aww he eating a gLiZzY
Funny... Almost everything in this world is about food.. And with these lockdowns... The world explodes with food...thats like the only human interest in this "western world"
Who puts vegetables on hotdogs  that just makes it healthy
Damn I’m craving this so bad now 😭
Hot dogs and vegies not cooked enough.  Moza is for pizza, put better cheese in a dog.(if you guys have real cheese in the us)
Got some wild glizzys
Rikooooo yummmmy
That looks awesome
The first man I’ve seen not call a hotdog a “glizzy” to try to seem cool

WHO THE FUCK JEZZ ON MY HOT DOG!!!!
Fry the hotdogs in butter. Fucking delicious like yo mas booty 🕳 Delicious 😋 😜  YayYa 🙌
All that for a hot dog .....looks like a waste of time. I mean it's just a hot dog
Brazilian Hot-Dog: That's a joke for me.
Glizzies
Gliziator
Beef dogs r the best. Fight me in the streets if u disagree
When I see the this red device all I can hear is crazy russian hacker saying  SLUT DOG
What was the point of slicing for presentation when you couldn’t even see the hot dog
I forgot I'm on YouTube and kept swiping up 😂🤣🤣🤣⬆️
Dude I like grill marks for the dogs. Looks like some good eating
Why is it always the fucking cheese
Nice hatch marks for presentation hidden by the toppings.
I have see no one say glizzy in da comments I am surprised but GLIZZY
He used a gadget on a hotdog for presentation but you can’t even see the hotdog with the cheese! I love your cooking though keep it up.
That hot dog looks like a glizzy
Glizzy gobbler
Never buy a product that does something a knife could do. A knife has a million uses. That hot dog cutter has one use.
When middle class white people discover hotdogs.
Ow
You cant even see the hotdogs fake cross hatch marks once you done lmao
Left once I saw you cutting the designs into the hotdogs, who does that or who even has that device 🤦‍♂️🤣
Looks amazing.    What time do you want us over, lol?
What was the point of the presentation slits on the hotdog if you were going to cover it all up lol
I love loaded hot dogs.
That looks grows
Ey u went viral again
Loaded? I call this false advertising
I have no idea why I watched this, but I also have no regrets
Gotta put some butter and Mayo on the bun buddy
Belle peppers, as on capsicum? Lol
The cheese
That does look delicious
Miguel why didn't you put couple of squirts of beer over the hotdogs?
😂😂😂this is a joke
ah yes i finally found it     the loaded glizzy
What was the address again!?
Looks blend
Ayyyo
The scores on the dogs aren't just for presentation, they also increase surface area helping them to cook more evenly
Yummy. 😋
Cheese ruined it 🤮
Get me to 100k
Glizzy
Looks delicious but grill those buns my man
Fully loaded glizzys
I love the slot dog. Great tool. Definitely worth it.
Why the crossmarks in the hotdog if you don’t even see them
It's freaking hotdogs people
How often are you eating hotdogs to justify some weird ass gadget to cut them? Find a better meat dude.
Bro if your girl has that thing he used on the hotdogs bro don't make her made or you going to have one of those
The words “hotdog” and “presentation purposes” are almost never used in the same sentence - and for good reason.
Your lucky you got that stove.
It look very good till you put the cheese on the top.
Damn looked bomb 💣
god left america
Those veggies needed more time to caramelize, dogs too in my opinion
Why does he call the glizzys hotdogs??
Dude that cheese at the end just got me WAY too excited 😁
Glizzy
That song id lit wots it called
Uh huh. Considering the only part of the hotdog that is exposed once it's put together is the ends I think you just felt compelled to use that gadget because it was too expensive to not find a reason to show it.
Hot dogs are overated. Use some real meat and not random jumbled up shit.
That might be the most useless contraption ive ever seen
Imagine eating hotdogs after the age of 12
Glizzy powder
Looks scrumptious
Glizzys
😂😂😂
That's a straight up O.G. hot dog. Maybe with bacon around it next time. 🔥🔥
Still eating assholes and eyelids though. The presentation makes no difference. I wouldn't feed that to my dog.
Omggggg 😮
The cheese glizzy
Those glizzys look scrumptious
Mmmmmmmmmmm
I mean I’d just boil/grill it and throw on some mustard, ketchup, and relish but ok  Please don’t put vegetables on mah fud im ‘merican
Phillycheese hotdog
What is he using to mark the score on the dogs?
Thats a cool trick Iam going to try. Thanks
What??? You used garlic powder on onions and peppers? Why not real garlic? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Y’all have to stop using bell peppers and move to poblanos. The sweetness from a poblano dominates the bell pepper.
At least he's not eating a Cattail. That dude was weird. - if you haven't seen it you'll be getting it in your recommended next week. See ya on the short.
The glizzy god
Why does aisan restaurants never run out of food they are always by a pet store
Why make the marks on the hotdog for presentation if you are going to cover it in cheese & cant even see them.  Looks good though
Don't put food on BRICKS
That’s a great looking dog
Glizzy.
What's the point of slicing grill marks into them?
If you don’t eat your hotdogs burnt idk about you
Thank you for doing them dawgs justice. Flat top is the best way to crisp up a dog.😍
Toast the buns bruh
Glizy
Wouldn't cutting them like that make them dry?
What that song playing in the background?
Have you try not sausage hotdog ?
You can add a little asada pineapple.
Wait, why do you put those dogs in that machine? Confuses
Glizzy machine
Glizzy
Not the glizzys 🤦🏾‍♂️😭
I actually thought he was gonna cook the hotdogs with the bricks
Thats not Mozzarella
😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why do you sound like foosgonewild
Glizzy
Carmelize the veg.
Was i the only one who used to eat raw hot dogs when camping sometimes
Where you get ur stone griddle
Looks dank, but that isn’t what fully loaded typically means
The gadget was so cool But after you put the toppings on  I could not see the design :(
I thought they cook the marks my life is a lie
Ugh was looking delicious till it was ruined by the cheese 🤦🏼‍♂️🔥🤘🤣
Dog if you send more than cook: 4 : 5 : enter on hotdogs you’re wasting time and effort.
No toasted bun no Bueno
What is that Barbecue called?
I don't know man the cheese kinda sus 😳
🔥🔥🔥
Lol
Looks like you used your own hot dog cheese at the end there.
Make chili dogs! My mom made some bouta week ago, I ate nearly whole batch I forgot how good they were.
Bruh I don’t even eat hotdogs so why did this get recommended to me 😂
I need that hotdog cutter. anybody know what it’s called or where to find it?
I have the black stone griddle it is awesome
Not the glizzys
I like how he calls his seasoning "Esentials"
Unbelievable dude. Those look great
Wtf is a hotdog my guy , I only know glizzy,  I'm a glizzy gobler 😏
Me going to the comments to see if someone said gilzzys👀👀👀👀👀
Glizzy
Neta!!
FULL Y LOADED AYO THAT IS A GLIZZY GUN
bro I’m a vegetarian and still watch all yo vids bro shit be entertaining asf😂
Store hotdogs are bad for you. I feel you have the capability and skills to make your own. It’ll save your health if you enjoy eating hotdogs
He had to let y’all know the beef dog is where it’s at that pork dog trash
this looks like the best hot dog ive ever seen
Fantastic.
That honestly wouldn’t taste good at all but I guess if you know you know
Tbh this is one of ur beat vids, I liked the hot dog crust machine lol👌😊🤤❤
Looks so bad would never eat that.
You gotta use sausage links for something like this not those basic dogs but amazing idea ❗️
Don’t trust anyone who has something in their kitchen just for making a pattern on hotdogs
I'll stick to my frozen pre cooked pre cheese stuffed ones worh some ketchup and mustard
Looks great bro 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Does that also come with a different top  for more regular BBQing? Or just that flat metal cook top?  Those seem like nice grills.
Oh my God , oh Lord, are you kidding me!!! you going to kill me dude just kill me.
I'm sorry for being immature but...     GLIZZY!
All I see is the ground so far is a good video
This sounds lile one of the guys that polices the police on youtube
Just put it in the microwave. It's the parts of the animals they can't sell you whole.
You don’t put peppers on hotdogs 😒😒
Cross hatching sausages is meant to be able to get more surface area for smoking, as well as a more thorough sear.
Hotdogs aren’t black enough!
Glizzy
Wow that looks good
Ghetto cheesesteak
Those are some long glizzys
Gtfoh! (Gotta toss some ched on that mozz!) Is it summer yet?
Is this a regional thing with hot dogs. I've never seen/heard of them prepared this way?
What’s that hotdog knife design contraption? Can u let me know the name or send the link to buy it. I want to!! Great video btw!
your pretty serious with your hot dogs, I stick mine in the microwave
Best looking dog ive seen
I don’t like hot dog meat no more, it makes me so sick...
You should of put the vegetables on first
Vat19.
Ok so you got my attention lol. Nice flat top.b
A hot dog only has one side..
If only these contained more than 2% meat...
Thank you now am hungry
that doesnt look like cheese at the end...
Dude, dont buy unitaskers its like the cardinal sin of cooking
Thanks for saying beef dogs because no way I ain’t eating no pork dogs
Why cut the hot dog tho? Don’t even change anything just takes time
I mean that would look delicious if it were real sausage and not hot dogs...
You gotta crisp up the cheese and roll it on the dog... Trust me
All beef hotdogs is definitely the way to go! Looks delicious!
Any hot dog without the skin, you might as well be eating dog food. Spend the extra money and get some good sausages. There's so many to choose from, kosher New York's, hot links, bratwurst, bockwurst. Don't spend your time doing like in this video and then waste it all with the $1.89 corn King dog food wieners.
He got skills
Glizzy man
Definitely should have put the hot dog in the cheese an wrapped it around the dog. Man that would be slap.
Almost like a Philly cheese dog
Olha só... Até que enfim os americanos estão aprendendo a fazer cachorro quente! 🇧🇷
Is this the creator. Of foos gone wild ?
I don't eat unions. 😐
Dude a glizzy gobbler
Missing some sauce my dude
He said fully loaded thought this man finna pull out an m4
Wow! Those look great!
Name of the song?
Wow im shocked how easily he scooped up that cheese, it wouldve been a disaster for me lmao smart idea 💡
im waiting for the glizzy memes
I bet he steal that stuff  just from his voice
I’d gobble that
Sucks I can’t stand bell pepper and they’re in almost every dish!
Not the glizzy
Stuffed Glizzy
Is just an hot dog
Glizzy
Glizy gobler

"fully loaded glizzy"
glizzy lock and loaded
No I wanted the bar-s dog chicken flavor and only ketchup lol 😂 seriously great video my guy keep up the good work I'm gonna make some dogs tonight can't wait
Ngl da veggies ruined da look
Should've just made Italian sausage
Looks great!
Wasted on the hotdogs
Looks delish just replace the disgusting, horrible-for-you, cancer causing hotdog with something else.  Anything.
Wagyu dog
so "fancy" tool not neccessary got. lol
Make a Sonoran hot dog we Mexican 😭
Whats the songs name
Cmon your better than this
How many hot dogs do you make to the point where you buy this just asking
Foos cooking hotdogs
Nice
The hard dog 🤤
Well done !!
Why do u have so much nice cooking equipment in ur home lol
Lol “make sure you get a good sear” it’s not a fuckin filet minion bro it’s a hotdog.
Damn bro this reminds me of the hamburgesa stand in the city of purepero near my moms home town
I suddenly remembered CrazyRussianHacker  Good old gadget days man...
Cheese looks nasty
U telling me u do all this fancy stuff but I cant even get nice hot dogs them bitches like $1.49
Hey that’s not a hot dog that’s a glizzy
Lol knock of phillys lol
Glizzys!!
I was sold on those hot dogs bro they look like fire subscribed right after I seen it
I dig it. Little tip though: garlic powder burns really easily and develops a not so great taste when it does. Add it near the end of the vegetables cooking and it'll probably taste a little more garlicy
So simple and looks so excellent!
I really like this dude. Gets to the point. Not preposterous or fake at all.
Dads looking at this👁👄👁
All that extra work and wasted time just for presentation, please dont ever cook for me you would piss my hungry ass off doing that dumb shit
Makes me hungry everytime 😋
Looks really good my man keep this shit up!
Why
This man said the slots helps with the presentation to make them look nicer, and then he completely covers them up with peppers and cheese 🤣🤣🤣 a knife would have been just fine if it was just about making them crispier lmao it just seems like wasted symmetry at that point.
Hear me out dawg, roll the hotdogs in the cheese
That’s a good lookin glizzy
“Good sear”
Cool videos, but... Why cut the hot dogs if you're just gonna cover it up?
Why the fuck do your shitty videos keep popping up? You fucking suck.
That's a flipping dog man
Daddy Miguel
What kind of animal doesn't toast the bun! Lol look good
Lots of effort which I love but there’s no reason to do cross marks on a dog that you’re going to cover up 😝
Gross with the cheese 👎👎
So no bacon? 🥓
Glizzys Goblin
Dang this looks really good
Quiznos
Glizzy
Where did you get the slot dogs thing....I want one for the cottage!
Should have did cross marks on all sides you missed an opportunity
Sheeeesh that looks good
W...t...f...
Hotdogs with peppers.. nonono
The cross Marks On The Hotdogs Aren't Just For Design But For The Inside Of the Hotdog To Cook faster
Slight chance someone here has eaten a hot dog after edc Vegas from them venders this reminds me of them straight slappin!!!
How lazy do you have to be to buy a plastic cylinder that put cross marks on your hotdog when you probably already own a knife?
Commentate on ig aswell
Glizzy
Nice dog bro
I gotta stop running into your videos at 3am.
omg that slot dog thing is cool!
That cheese idea was pretty smart, I've never seen it before.
those are called glizzys
So after putting on the mozzarella.. did it really matter to cross all the dogs for presentation!?   Great food and video ✊🏾
That shit looks good
you’re definitely from Cali bruh you got a foo accent
-Hotdogs, fully loaded First we add gunpowder...
Bro that looks like crap
Music name?
Awesome idea with the cheese
They’re ✨GLIZZYS✨
Love that press. Never see one before.
Glizzy😐😐
Amazing!
Favorite cooking channel, easily
głįżżÿ
I like this dudes videos. Always love havin them on my feed
I see you been doing a lot on the griddle lately 👀
What’s the purpose of that tool that you smash the hot dogs with? It just puts marks on it?
What’s the internal temp of those bell peppers?
Bad ass brother 😎
😍 Looks delicious
Bro u gonna run outta shit to cook
Very nice 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
he has done it again what will he make next?
Fire 🔥 now craving those
That’s looks insane
Cool
