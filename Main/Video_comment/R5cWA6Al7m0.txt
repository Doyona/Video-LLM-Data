Hey l am sure you get out henna out of you couch l bet you !!
I think you should stain your actual couch to see if it can get stained by anything. It's easier to clean a small piece of fabric than a small part of an entire couch. Because, if you can't get the stain off with some scrubbing and cleaning, you can put the sample fabric in tge washing machine. But you can't put the whole couch.
Just me or did she say the same thing with blue paint
