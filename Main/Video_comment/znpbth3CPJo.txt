Hi Mat here: which car do you think sounded the best. LIKE my comment for the car below to VOTE!
The golf r's true competitors are the a45s,rs3 and M2 not the baby cars
The AMG A35 does the quarter mile in 13.7 whereas the Civic Type R and Leon Cupra take 14seconds flat w/ FWD😮
There is no way that golf is stock still an Audi fan though
Not weee Double u… vauh weh
Gf r
Bloody Money Wasted.
Alleine im Auto.....  aber Maske auf..... Idioten....
Not much in it Reaction times of the drivers basically
AMG A 45.
Piou
Golf R kullanan elinden geldiğince geçilmek istemiş ama araba cidden çok hızlı,2-3 boy geridende başlasa gelmiş geçmiş hep:)
Bmw sound the best
THE A35s DRIVER LAUNCHED IT. A DAY LAYTER
It would be nice and great usefull information, if you would always mention the year of the cars, not just saying new. Every year seems a little different than the next, either better or worse. i would prefer to purchase the better year myself. Thanks, love your vids.
i dono why some BMW fans argue over VW about performance. Prats
BMW
Mat, where is a problem? Last video mercedes im every Race beat golf.. now not? Why? Driver? Link on your video: https://youtu.be/Bsg1je8TUCE?si=xYL_nxaSIi0qlZUv
You always must sit in fastest car in race.. Meybe 96% ..
That’s just embarrassing 😭😭
Why you dont got the A45?
Bmw
Why is the guy driving the M135i wearing a mask, sat alone in the car!? 😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
140i is the best hot hacht!
bmw has best sound
Is the bmw awd?
4 fantastic cars.
Bmw best
Merc may of lost still looks the best. Simples
Nah no ways that please can we have a rematch jst don't bring the guy in Mec clearly he can't race
Nah that guy can't drag race worst start in carwow history in the Mec
330e hybrid eco machine does 1/4 mile faster than a35 AMG
Vw is always the best
vw sounds best
I’m an Audi fan but that golf I own one  as my daily and it’s quick for a car for the town. Best daily highly recommend
Bmw
140i the only rear traction six cilinder on the market
BMW
Beside the Golf R just destroying everyone, i was quite surprised by how well the Audi performed.
VW Golf R is a Monster 🔥🔥
Just on auto trader having a look for an ex demo Golf R!
Mercedes was 💯 mapped
BMW
As of 2023/24 BMW decided to revise their M135i sneaky move 😂
Beamer driver wearing a mask by himself in the car lol.
Vw running a diesel gate style scam here..
The golf wins the sound good ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉xxx
Der Golf R ist das beste Auto von VW. Der Sieg ist geschenkt.  Trotzdem geht nichts über die anderen drei deutschen Hersteller.  Liebe Grüße an den sympathischen Moderator.
Audi
I DONT GOT A CAR
In Germany you will pay 10k more than those Prices in the Video
Sorry but the golf r should be racing the rs3 amd the a45 and the 140i.
Wild how they made the 1 series look so ugly.... absolute weird front
As you said the golf R is very fast and does not have 300hp. Stock golf R mk8 turbo boost i 21psi around 1,5 bar and you can see it making 2,5 bar of turbo boost in the roll race
The BMW
I think he should put GolfR VS Audi RS VS 140i M and A45 S AMG bcs for me it's like best golf VS little brothers of this 4:43  other hot hatch golf R is the top range of golf and the others it's not their top range of hot hatch whn it come to speed or drag race
Who is the idiot on his own wearing a mask? FFS......TOOL.
Merc looked like he went late lol
I thought 8R has the same engine as S3
i think the bmw and golf r
The Mercedes didn’t have a good lunch but the bmw won the sound test
Put A45 AMG in place A35
Il Golf ha 25 cv in più ! Gara non regolare
Crazy that golf is actually most expensive car in that line up
3.94 seconds. Wow!
The R is a beast
Should have included the scirocco R
Tools in cars on their own wearing face nappies 🤯🤣
GOLF is the  hottest of the hot hatch toys
When are you going to drag race a vw scirocco R for vw fanboys
Now test it vs the a45 amg 😆
OFFS! I just bought a Mercedes A Class. I feel embarrassed 😂
Matt always chooses the golf
Why you letting a brainwashed person drive the bmw wearing a muzzle in a car on your own
Vw
3:12 mercedes driver sleeping   ? xD
All the time when this guy is driving ,he wins the race so that’s a no no for me .
The VW golf 8 R have like 360 Hp definitely no wayy
The bmw 135i sound better
GOLF R is the great car
today im buying Golf VIII R :) cheers lads
The golf r sounds goooooooooooooooooooooooood
Not sure if any of these animals could outrun my tricycle. (Ninja 4 cylinder powered...)
I think if a A45 was there the golf would be challenged
Golf r is a jet
Bmw and a close second golf R
I hate the golf R every time I see one I always imagine a chavy boy racer and let's be honest it's just a cheap euro car with a transverse mount 4 pot with a massvie turbo slapped on
BMW ❤❤❤💋💋💋💪💪
I love Mercedes that excatly my Car🙂🙂
The Volkswagen Man!!!
Mercedes driver bad as fuck
Im not a golf person but that gold looks beautiful beside all the other ones. That merc ugly af and im a merc guy and have a c43 dont get no A class
Vw de Best bravooo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBP0jJ4uCJs&t=7s   it seems that this game on the link is more real than the video, video games are very real
VW 💥❤️❤️🚀
That would be about right for the Golf R  0 to 60. You need to factor in your colder climate hence quicker times. Mine sits on 370hp and manages that but in our current 23c. There for I would expect it to be quicker still if it was colder. Either way. Quick enough and equal to the 2019 RS3
PUT A a45 next time
For the record, reaction time should not count for 1/4 mile ET. It counts for the race but not for the time
In other drag races, the golf has only done 12.7.  I'm confused 🧐
BMW sounds the best!
Thought you'd all be dressed as women  ???
Why there arent any Z4 e89's 35i on videos like this.. would be awesome to see them
Why that AMG not getting hot🤔
つまんない
BMW sounds the best
A 45?
Why Mercedes drivers in drag race are so bad
BMW M135i
The BMW
BMW❤
BAH  GOLF R  TOP
They should of had an Audi RS3 instead of the S3
Why is the goofball in the bimmer wearing a mask?
BMW SOUNDS THE BEST
The mercedes missed tge start
BMW made the best sound
your car Mat that you are sitting in
P
O
Golf is tunned. Normally have acc 0.3 worst than s3
It is the golf r
Can’t believe golf r beat all, for that price is amazing
should have gotten an A45 amg instead...
01:09................That was not only a hilarious German accent, you made a perfect German face and posture too...........brilliant......hope no one gets offended.....
VW lie about power as well as emissions it seems lol
These are decent but older hatchbacks beat this like m140, a45 older rs3
mercedes slow
Anyway, I would take Mercedes any time..
whoever was driving the amg...it launches faster when you're actually awake
There must be an issue with that BMW driver really because i've watched many BMW in the channel and never loose a break test but at the end of the day great video Mat.
AMG ain’t like it used to be.
I thought the BMW would come off quicker due to the higher torque but the Golf R just blew them away. Now it’s locking in my choice to get a 2012-2013 MK6 Golf R 6 speed and do the APR Stage 2+ and Launch Control and No-Lift-Shift
👍👍👍👍👍
Golf R cant beat BMW in Roll race, your golf R is stage 1 ecu
Mat has stocks in vag group
OLY 3.94 ON A GOLF ?!
Matt “ hard on the brakes” then everybody else goes by 😂, without a doubt the BM sounded best !  Golf a great car but look soooooo boring 🥱🥱
The mercedes cheated in the brake test it wasn't level with the rest of you because it he was it would have been closer so yea the merc cheated 😂😁
Golf R
BMW are some of the best and make a new video of a McLaren senna and La Ferrari
3:10
GOLF is another level
Got a new shape S3, cook exhaust up till popping (about hour with valves open), put it in S gear change, dynamic mode, warm tyres, traction off sport mode.  I've had some punching above my weight, red light, open dual carriage way races against Ms, AMGs, GTs, Rs, etc and won all on that stretch.
Your car
Mercedes’ just love staying back even on breaking 😂
99% of the time the winning car will be driven  by Matt taking most of the guesswork out of these "vs"  videos.....
I think the person in the S3 is a bit heavy.
this should actually be a gti. i know its a price difference but fastest golf vs medium fast premium cars....mwah.
Does that bmw have AWD?
Bmw 1
Golf R  won before watching
It's shocking how mercedes made the a35 so slow
I have an 2022 Golf 8R. I confirm the good performance and the overhelming power of the engine. Its fast as hell. No tune.
Let be honest here! Golf won the 2nd rolling race because mat was moving his head to and fro in the end to make that overtake.
Без ВАГ, няма драг!
Dude is wearing a mask in a car by himself.
BMW sounded best
5:40 golf is just great
That Golf R is quite a bit of kit isn't it?! For the money it's the best in the business!
2022 Golf R 400hp+ not 320hp as factory specs states, seeming alot faster than it is cause it has alot more power than factory specs, seems to be better engineered than rivals ? VW theme Audi - Porsche - Lamborghini ?
👏👏👏👏👏
IT WAS TUNED
You guys should get the golf r with the rs3
True it doesn't have 320 it's been tuned
That golf r rocking 34psi stock or
Do you guys race other than straight down the road on dry pavement? If this is what Europeans prefer than ok but I’d rather see some twisties in all kinds of weather not just sunny and dry. I bought my s3 to handle Canadian weather (where I live, it’s really unpredictable). My last 2 cars were WEx but 268hp/258torque is a bit too underpowered.
I jus happen loving this channel since 2020 much love Matt 🇲🇼🇿🇦
But 40k plus for a VW Golf yeah right!
Why is the guy in the BMW wearing a mask in a car by himself? That's hilarious!
As a Mercedes fanboy, this hurts to watch but I still think the A35 is the prettiest by far and the interior is the coolest in my opinion. Doesn't matter though since I can't afford any of these anyway
The GOLF R
If I got it correct, I think carwow timed the RS3 to 11.9s 1/4 mile. Kinda mental how good the Golf R is
Bmw
Vw❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
M M M  the best sounding and car!!!!
If it was longer in drag s3 would catch it
7:56  A moment of a handsome four, a very sexy scene 🖤
Golf R
a35 driver go sleep and next time take the bus
Sorry to say I have the a35 and in my own experience I’ve beaten all 3 of these cars multiple times
Golf R
Mercedes and Audi they stopped in front of the line.
Mercedes driver ' this brakes really really well ' .Yeah right , you cheated .
If only yaris was there🤣🤣
So the golf R doesn’t do 4.7 sec 0-100? And does 3.94?
Except for the VW all 3 cars have stronger versions. M140i, A45 AMG, Audi RS3...the result might be different with the stronger versions
Vw🙏
RIP Mercedes
Mercedes should stop manufacturing that crappie looking car. It is ugly like suzuki ignus
You always sit in the powerful car among them...why...yani is right
Golf R
"A proper German" yeah there is nothing German about Dean lmfao
why are they wearing masks alone in the car
Wow Golf R
The DSG in the VW says it all. The best gearbox amongst all.
I was suprised how the golf r ws pulling from audi and mercedes
the GTI would've been a fairer comparison i feel
My favorite car audi s3 sporback
The A45 Is the fastest but the put the dumbest pilot in it 🤦🏻‍♂️
why didn't they do the test 2 times from standing?
Fuck vw
Golf R
Bmv
Bmw sounds the best🔥🔥🔥
Can you please remove M135i and replace it with old M140i.... Motech
Sure that VW is stock?
All those wins for the golf and i still wouldn't buy one if my life depended on it
Why does the Audi got a soft Limited and the Golf Not?
Shouldn't you be comparing the RS3 to these hatches?
Love BMW the most, but man, its the ugliest of them all
Golf R the best
I love watching these videos and seeing their head bob back and forth to get an extra oomf
Why use A35 meanwhile the is A45 I feel like the Mercedes was not even in its league. A35 should be with GTI and 128ti
The prices of these cars are a shame.
Golf sounds the best
Pretty pumped I just put some money down on the vw today. Now hurry up and ship it to Canada!
Amg driver is hate
Started loving VW by loking this vedio
On the Dyno the Golf R has 340ps
golf R fuck them all :D
it's ironic that the one you'd expect to be the cheapest is actually the most expensive one😂
How it s possible golf...son of Audi....go faster and cost more?😱
BMW sound the best
Another time Golf R demonstrates the Kingdom of the Hot HBs!!! And it's incredible that is the most expensive of the other premium hatches.
FUCK DRIVER THE MERCEDES ALWAYES LATE
Give me the CTR over any of these!
Volkswagen GOLF THE BEST
where is rs3?
A35 amg no a45s amg
Nice viral commercial ;)
The golf e power moters 🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
And now for the Audi on the end I hear nothing soft limiter
3/5 Audi because S3 is still quite good but the front mask looks awful. Exhaust sound is best of these. 2/5 BMW because the rear-wheel drive is still part of the 1-series. Exhaust sound is weird. 3/5 Mercedes-Benz because A35 AMG is a good but too teen appearance. Exhaust sound is good. 4.5/5 Volkswagen because R model is a epic. Looks best of these. Exhaust sound is good.
The sound bmw always best xx
Only adolescents care about how loud a car is. It is obnoxious and childish, stop doing the sound check please
This just makes me so much happier that I picked the golf r as my next car 😂
Golf looks tuned
BMW killed the 1 series. The old m140i was a beast.
The alleys exhaust is like NASA it’s OK yeah yeah soft limiter well that sounded crap let’s hear that BMW sounds crap oh that actually sounds pretty nice do you know what exhaust like there’s some fireworks going off same with the golf I can’t hear any pops from the Mercedes but I barely hear anything from the Aldi is the Audi even revving? I hate soft limiters!!
Volkswagen  - Das Auto!
"ASS DYNOMETER" - "PERFECTLY TUNED"  - EPIC !!!! Just when i thought Mat cant surprise me anymore with his  hilarious comments anymore :DDDDD
@Mercedes-AMG you’re embarrassing
Bmw sounds good
VW IS THE BEST
just watched one of your other videos and the Golf R did it in 12.02...
Is that George Russell in the BM 😂
Absolute aniahlation ....VW power
I wondering why the guy next to you have to wear a facemask while he is sitting alone in the car. Thats stupid.
Don’t ever say don’t got again that’s mad disrespectful cause I know what you tryna mimic
BMW sounded the the best, that's coming from a VW fan
Put the golf R with A45s M2comp and RS3
That Golf is running 2.3 bar. That’s about 33PSI. That turbo is running the limit. Mmmm the longevity will be questionable.
I can’t hear the Audi That’s all even though I got my ear right next to it to its exhaust tip I can’t I can’t I can hardly hear anything
Golf r Türkiye'de 800.000 TL
So the Volkswagen one The Audi was second the BMW was third and the AMG was last
Heard nothing from the exhaust in the Audi S 3
Soft limiter on the Audi Yep when it comes to sound check the BMW is the best sounding for sure I think the second is the goal and then the Mercedes and then the Audi
GOLF R!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Merc is easily the easiest on the eye inside and out, I wouldn't have chosen the others to buy based solely upon a few nths of a second.
That S3 should equal the golf. Some damn tuning issue I’m guessing
Make a race against a Saxo or 106 setup
Bmw sounds the best
A Golf R is more expensive than a S3?! 😳🤦🏽‍♂️
Definitely the BMW
The golf R is the Mercedes a45s to this cars
I hate no nothing gets home from the Aldi‘s exhaust
Mat use the a45 s AMG
I still favor my austin morris
Golf R for me
That golf you had must be a cherry picked one because other R's are not as fast
My older brother bought this car 2 years ago But he did not realize that he bought the car at a higher price. Now he wants to sell it, but he is not getting a fair price for the car, which is why he is now at a loss...
the golf has the same 1/4 mile time as a v10 m5
Bmw got the sound
The Golf looks like pure understatement
Wearing a mask whilst driving alone makes me scratch my head...
Now tell me which one you would rather be your daily driver lol
Prima di fare queste prove , sarebbe gradito vedere una prova su un bel banco prova, perché vw ha sempre avuto la pessima abitudine di imbrogliare sui numeri . Impossibile tutta questa differenza
Golf best car
The tidy mimosa fundamentally ban because foam congruently mate off a shy texture. quaint, substantial throne
Maybe someone  fm idiotic grup of engineers of Mercedes  will finally have the decency  to look at their"work".... I I was for a day the CEO  of Mercedes I would send home half of their Engine Staff....you are a complete shame boys,people use to look up to Mercedes till 10-15years ago! You make the worst  gearbox ever,maybe you pass a course fm Bmw or ZF gearboxes which by the way are german as well,but clearly those are engineers,you are jockers!
Would love to know more on brakes
Four rings is definitely doing well
I remember racing in my Mom's '75 VW Rabbit Diesel.  55hp.
Mercedes driver what shit
These guys literally have another video of these exact same cars and the bmw beat all how tf
BMW
Really surprised by the golf ,and why I'd the a35 so misserably slow
The type r civic would have shit on the golf..
Gone for the bmw in misano blue. The interiors on the others are fugly and cheap and as I will see the inside more than the outside, that's well worth another 5 tenths in performance for me 😃
Golf
The Golf R shouldn't be here but instead with the A45 and RS3
That Golf R! Has it been sneaking steroids while you weren't looking?
Would really like to know the trap speeds
At 7:10 mat and the guy in the Audi are both rocking😂😂😂
At 5:55 u can hear a samsung notification
The Golf 8R is the beast
BMW the Best sound
The way Mat says: bye byee everybody 🤣
I've read somewhere that Volkswagen always gives more HP than you can see in specs.
Golf r is the 911 turbo a of hot hatches
I still think I pick the S3. The Golf is quick but the Golf VIII is really cheap inside.
Alright, The Golf R
My dad has the mk7
Golf r: FRICK U LOT
Golf r
When did you think a Volkswagen would be more expensive and faster than a Merc ,BMW, and Audi
No way that beast golf r has only 320hp!
The vw golf r is just special. It's the best hot hatchback ever! It's insane!
Golf:I'm the quickest 4cyl! A4s: oh really?
The a35 has left the chat
EVO FQ400 >🇩🇪
Best sound bmw
U need the Mercedes a 45
A35 is shit very shit the best is s3 and golf 8 r and 7 r
That golf performs a class above itself. Phenomenal bang for your buck. VW nailed that car.
Bmw
3.9s for a 4 cylinder 2.0L? Just crazy! Matt u was right! 340hp on dyno test! Awesome
Love the rear end of the 1 series, but the front is ugly af….
It is the bmw
bmw  EXHAUST  is better abviously
Golf Type R rules and the new generation 2022 Type R is even more besser!!
Wolf
MB always slowest
You like embarrassing Mercedes ....you know A35 is slow 😂
I believe everyone now knows that the Golf has more than 320hp, the race is more about the others 3 Be interesting to put them all on the same dyno and test engine outputs
Best brake A45 beacuse so slow than others shehahwhsh
I have Golf MK4. I'm so proud my son MK8. 😎
Anyone else feel VW have given more h/p to Matt's press car?  I've not seen another 0-60 in 4 online.  Everyone  else hits 4.5.
The guy in amg braked when the rolling race started
The Golf r has dyno tested at 350 hp “before” it’s broken in so the actual number could be even higher. I assume that VW doesn’t want the Golf r to outshine the S3 on paper even if you guys expose the truth on the track.
I’m embarrassed for the Merc 🙈
Audi winnneeeer for me golf has power, normal
Vw made both the Golf R and the audi S3 but the Audi doesn't fart🙆🏾🙆🏾...
The Mercedes guy is a dumb
is this sponsored by VW again😎
Golf R all the way
Bmw😍😍
Do the R and a Nissan GT-R R35
Press car. A bit dodgy really. A lot of punters going to be very disappointed when their new pride and joy only does the factory claimed 4.7 and not sub 4…
BIG FAN
This drag race really helped me to decide what car to go for next, thank you as I have just ordered the Golf R in lapiz blue. Got to wait 16 weeks though but it will be worth the wait
Amg did cheat
race again with RS3,M140i and A45 AMG and golf R. Please:)
What about 2.0 t a45s. Why its not there?
That golf is truly fucking impressive.
0-60 times please. I have no idea what quarter mile equates to 😀
Bmw BMW bmw bmw bmw Bmwbmw
Hola las pruebas de frenado no son gustas frenan antes los demás participantes
Can i come test drive with carwow pleaaase...🙆🏼‍♂️
VW lying again. The R has 400 bhp.
Bri'ish
7:11 LOL😂😂
BMW sounded better no two ways about it
135i bmw sounds good
The bmw
I love watching races that are close and we can see you guys like rowing in your seats hahaha
BMW sounded the best Golf R 2nd  Mercedes 3rd Audi 4th
3:07
Bmw sounds best
U should bring RS3 NOT S3
So Golf R comes pre-tuned?
Why not Audi rs3???😏😏😏😏😏😏👌
Where's the BMW 140 I think that will beat the golf r
The Golf R is the only one that doesn't have a 3 in its name - the remaining three do.
BMW sound best
Golf 8 R sounds the best! BMW ain't far off tho
Golf top
Unbelievable 🙌🏾
But still love my bmw
Mk8 amazing
BMW ZF gearboxes are by far the best
Skip to 3:07 for the start
Mat seems you choose that car which gonna win how is that try swoop with others then do again the race😜😜
Bmw soûnd 👍
Bmw sounds best
what is quicker? They all will disappear off your drive before you can blink.
BMW driver was whack
When you cant hear revs idk if you know that you can roll down the window Mat lmao
Detalhe o golf é o único q tá com gasolina. Os outros estão usado etanol
hmm,  is the new golf that much faster than it use-to be or maybe it has a tune downloaded in it???
Laughing from German accent  testing 4 German cars, what a hypocrite 😂
Golf R have 340bhp on dyno ( Hamilton) and over 440Nm
wooooow
very disappointed that the R is faster than the s3.... :( i always thought audi was always more performance savvy than VW
so no one is gonna mention the 36psi of boost in the vw, jeesus cant see that thing being reliable for 100k mikes
I am a fan of golf R but to bad i don't believe your videos
And thats why my wife and children are in a mercedes a35!! Well that and the interior is nicer!
BMW are really ruinin it (look at my lips, ruinin it) by making the 1 series FWD. Should've kept it RWD like the old one. 😞.
Golf the king of hatchbacks
just saying, that proves anyone who gets an a3 over a golf is a bit silly, mk 7 was my fave gti, rline or gtd all better than s3 i think anyway
Audi isn’t making it easy for me to be a fan of them
Golf R looks like probably 380bhp
The golf type r has the best sound #yeswhynot
Best sound :  1- M135i 2- Golf R 3- A35 4- S3
golf 8R
Volkswagen ❤️ the biggest brand in the world
S3 the best ❤️
That a35 driver was sleeping damn
Golf R 🤯
this is not fair,couldnt you  get a golf gti instead beacause i think the golf R should race with the latest rs3 and a45 they are in the same class and the strongest hatchback made in germany
Se escucha mejor mi ford fairmont 78 sport wagon woody que esas 4 shits
We need to see all sides of track dry evenly just so Matt doesn’t keep on winning cause of his good dry side. Perhaps we need to see car swap & side too & drag race 3 times to see if there’s going to be the best times & am sure they would be. Thanks 😊
Golf r
Would be interessing to compare GOLF 8 R VS GOLF 8 R pack performance
clearly the bow sounded the best
The bmw
Mercedes has one car ahead when braking begins
Hey, Matt, if you think Golf R's engine is morr powerful than 320 HP, you maybe right. It wouldn't be the first time that a European car maker is lying about its cars...especially the VW group.
BMW is so ugly
For an extra 2 grand more for the golf I’d expect it would be faster
The golf8 R Price in Algeria is £70,000 🤡💩
Matt always has the quickest car in these things....is he a sore loser and the camera person dosent want to see a tantrum ?
ok, now bring in the Audi RS 3
Golf r sounded best
Golf
That Golf is savage
Mercedes driver, was in a deep coma.
Why didnt u take the 45s amg the 35 is more like the former 250 sport😁
Why not rolling the Golf to get the real HP figure. With the way VW prepped their cars to pass emission tests, I wouldn't be surprised if their test cars are on a special "test-mode map"
Nicht ganz fair das rennen muss man sagen der Golf R ist vom Golf die stärkste version aber der 135i und der s3 nicht gegen den 140i oder den RS3 audi hätte der vw keine chance
Bmw all the way
VW Golf r
Vow golf R
( caugh) Golf R 14 HP more than  competitors ( caugh caugh)
7:06 Mat and Audi driver syncing xD
F u Audi
The golf is 340bhp + ! Check the dyno videos
It’s not the first time that VWs press cars are „special“ 😂
Gold the most expensive? damn
you should race that golf with an rs3
😂😂😂 brummy, I love the German accent
I agree the a35 is slower (as Ive had both golf and a35) but that first launch was terrible by the driver. They should have re-recorded a fairer all around start.
So its confirmed  the Mercedes A series have a renault engine🤣😂🙊
I love the VW Golf, but I think I'm ready for the future. For the money I'd rather get a Tesla Model 3.
Really important for all those chavs driving around in these having their mom's passing for petrol and insurance😂
All these tests and they all don't  use the golf 8 R performance model, has extra 100 horse power.
Whats that? Fake vents on the bmw, god Damn right
One thing people don’t notice on the new Golf R is how low its drag coefficient is. Just looking at the front area and aerodynamics alone, i can tell that it cuts through the air so effortlessly, almost like an electric car with minimum wind drag.
Mercedes a45s would have won 12,1 seconds
Amg almost total disappointment! Congrats to that breaks though!
Welche Luschen sind da am Start. Da fehlt der Meister, der Focus RS.
VW R- gear ⚙ box said, no need to hurry, I'm quicker than the others🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂 funny you are Matt.
BMW Sounds better 🔥🔥
golf R vs AMG A45s
Sound the best in BMW then Golf Mercedes and Audi
Lets be honest though, the merc looks way better than them all
Im guessing the trade off for a golf r is least comfort.. i have a gti and love it but comfort sucks.
You guyz don't got a A45S? lol
Which is the quickest 4 cylinder, turbocharged, 2 litre, German hot hatch?  The AMG A45 S ?
The Audi makes the most sense, low profile sound and a more luxurious interior.
BMW Sound 😎
why didnt they put the a45 instead of a35?
Volkswagen Das Auto
We want amg A45s vs. Golf 8r please!!!
Mercedes😂😂😂
Bummers my favours
Would love 2 see Golf R RS3 A45 140m
Heeeeeeey... Thanks to AMG... 😀😁😂
where is Yanny?
On DYNO RUN Golf R got 340hp, anyone may tell me how and why?
We've reached an era that you won a race just by quickly thrashing your body back and forth. How fascinating.
Golf r is never standard. I have a s3 2017 that is quicker off the line with 310bhp
Nice cars but no one of them sounds good, 🤷‍♂️
Mercedes is just a fucking fashion accessory. They have nice front grills and that’s it. The cars are trash.
King golf R
The BMW is a powerhouse pops and bangs
I am sorry, I LOVE BMW!!!  but this says it ALL!!!  from that absolute BEAST B58 m140i to the new gen m135i is a major step back and the new auto gearbox is trash VS the beautiful ZF 8 speed!!!  Very sad day!
Mat just wanted the golf 8r to win that's why he never use the a45s
Hell yeah, the R is the finest, and not only the sound. Great Video guys.
Why didn't they use the a45s?
Golf r
Just watched a review by automann tv and the 0-100kmh on the golf 8R is 4.51s as the rolling on function on the race box is switched off and the measurement is in kmh to 100 rather than to 60mph.  This setup could a better measurement to use in the future as it gives us a better indication of actual speed.
fantastic
This Moment when vw Costs more than BMW, Mercedes and audi 🤣
got a merc ad mid way through this video , not a good placement there 🤣🤣
I dont watch this channel because of the reviews and thats why i as a german do not watch the german channel
Está amañado
Golf 8 doesn’t belong in that Company
BMW sounded best 👌🏼
Golf R vs A45s
Golf R
Mk8 Golf R vs Amg A45s?!?!?!?!?!
LOL they stripped pops and bangs out of mini because "regulations", but the BMW now has EXACTLY the same exhaust pops as a MINI used to have :D
torque converter win dual clutch lose Lmao
Hi Matt  Can I ask why reviewers don’t mention the weight of EV’s. The handling, and stopping power is compromised. I just sold my new 330e as it is much heavier than the GolfR and spoils the fun.  Please give us more honesty? 👍🏼
Bmw 135i sounds the best
we need a race with Yiannimize
"The quickest 4 cylinder turbocharged 2 liter" were is the A45s AMG?
Sehr guter Rennfahrer, bitte geben Sie auch den Preis bekannt mit allem Zubehör.
Hvjgnc
M135 is better
If you use the A35 use the GTI since thats an R it should compete with the A45s
Have a battle of the SUV 2 liter Turbos - Stelvio/X2/GLC/Q3/VW......just the regular 2 liters...
Golf R
Would love to see a warm hatch race like a polo gti vs something  Like if you want to see that.
You should have used the A45 to get the right result.! Not the Light Version of AMG!
The Merc driver was having a tea party when the others were racing, not good reactions.
mat:okay now audi  audi revs  mat: i hear nothing 🤣🤣🤣
VW lying about performance again! 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
The guy launching the Audi was asleep 😴
Golf R finally wins something for once.
The BMW sounds the best
3..2...1 and the Golf R is gone.
Bmw sound better
Looks like Golf really really wanted to win ...and it used all its 350hp. It is very lame what VW does these days...
Alll Golf R who measured had 350 Hp
The parched multi-hop kinetically pick because fibre totally tow after a fluttering jacket. keen, regular porch
mercedes driver clearly brake earlier. at 8:48 we can see the movement of the car who indicate he fully brake ON the white lane (when others only start to brake)
GOLF R
Could you test a Camaro?
DjdfhdjdER
Mat...Should know that volkswagen uniquely quote the golf's specs as at the wheel, not flywheel.
All of them sound horrible
The R does produce more HP and Torque than stated. About the 350 range
Golf, without a doubt!
That was pleasantly surprising!  Nice one Matt and team
Vw Golf R
Jddhdjhd
That R is tuned.
To be fair it should have been a GTI in the race, instead of a golf R.
That amg is a piece of shit!
why tf didnt u get a a45
My dream to have a car....normal car 😔
Sound bmw
Oh god, the Merc and Audi sounds horrific :(
Ok but why not the a 45? Or the a 45s
Let's not forget that we are talking about the m series, golf R and the AMG series of these brands, the sports versions of these models, it is not an audi rs3, thaht just an S3! now, put the diference of prices between golf and the s3 in the s3 engine! you got probably a beast!
None of these cars go well with reliability.
Not legal .... golf r with amg a45s and audi rs3
Audi S3 had fallen from grace so much. Very quick Golf R.
Golf
VW POWER!!!
Leon Cupra??
bmw sounded the best
Best sound-BMW. Best brake-Merc.for safety. Worst brake-VW, unsafe
Get the 140i,A45amgs & RS3 against the Gold
Should check  how they sound in launch mode ready to launch
Only 320hp, VW "powergate" incoming.😊
Have always have interest in purchasing expensive cars like BMW
Get a RS3 for that Golf
Golf r has more torque, more bhp and its lighter? How on earth did it win lol.. 🙄
Hi mat plz put the golf R against the AMG a45s would love to see that race
I wouldn't trust the VW engine to go over 120k km, great car for a 3 year lease but wouldn't want to keep it for longer or buy a used one.
What about golf 8R vs gr supra😃
Audi is a disappointment these days I really thought he was going to win
Stupid new  bmw 😕
The way they shake about In the car was hilarious
Mazda metela en liga
Audi sounds robotic
After everyone goes out and buys a golf r we find out it had a tune on it
Jesus what is the R going to do with a tune on it.....
Well isn’t the Golf R more like the concurrent to the Rs3 and the A45? Just thinking that the golf R is the fastest they built which means the S3 and the A35 should compete to the Gti
Totally unfair! These are the GTi competitors.
Vw golf R nice🎵 Good race✩.*˚
BMW in the mud
now imaging an RS3 😳
I wanna say the golf sound best but the bmw just killed it
Mercedes driver confused "launch race" with "lunch race"
The golf sounded the best
I think mercedez cheated in last round
Okay I can’t be the only one that’s happy that Vw is kicking fucking ass with this golf, keep up the good cars VW
Damn it.... The R 😳😳😳😳
We need the Ford Focus RS in this races has well....
wanker: why cant you make a list of stats and put them in one screen side by side so we can see them all in one go?? you are a bit dump arent you? videos are god though!!
2.5 bar pressure is 1.5 bar Turbopressure AND 1 bar atmospheric pressure. Thats not difficult.
the bmw sounds like 7r with akrapovic
Golf R, Merc A45s and the Audi RS3 now that would be fun
Why no amg 45s? Too expensive?
36lbs/2.5 bar of boost on the golf r... Anyone know if it's semi closed deck or closed deck block? Really hope it's closed deck cause it won't last very long at that boost level I don't think 🤔 she's quick tho!
That Golf R is running 2.5 bar of boost sheeeeeshhh
AMG A45s does that in 12.1 sec... the real deal!
Golf R faster than the original Audi R8.
I REALLY LIKE A VIDEO BETEWEEN GOLF R VS MERCEDES BENZ A45
7:30 synchronized headbang when headbanging makes the car faster
WHY THE MERCEDES A35 AND NOT THE A45S?
what's going with mercedes AMG A35 she is 3th
Vw costs More than the amg..... WHAT THE F***
7:32 lmaooooooooo  both Matt and the Audi driver were doing the extra horsepower dance 😂😂
the bmw sounds the best
took the guy in the a-class a second or two, to get off the break
Nothing against the audiator at the german channel.. he's good! But anyways he's not Matt Wattson so I'll continue watching on this channel!
That new Golf R is a beast. We might see it in the 'States come 2022.
Volkswagen and AUDI is quickest but the repairs appear like their speed.
And now the Golf R vs M140i, A45 and RS3
That Mk8 R is fast but how much is fast that much is ugly! That front end is 🤮, and lets dont forget that rear door open at crash test!
audi rs5 coupe is the best!!!
The amg was a joke, jeez
Makes sense why they didn't use the amg 45s
BMW🔥🔥🔥
What about Golf R vs A45s.
If it was an A45s it would be a different outcome
Mercedes was already driving behind, at the break test
On April fools day I heard they’ll upload a video where Matt starts in the slow car that’s destined to lose...
The golf if still boring as hell
AMG was a little tired... lol
Hi Mat I don't think the Mercedes was lunched properly
In this 1 series model is there an m140i
Imagine when the rs3 comes out
Apparently it's the new gear ratios on the golf r that makes the difference
Ate all these cars completely standard?
Min. 5:50... 2.5 bar on Golf R??? 😱
Golf r vs amg a45s
Break test is the least precise. Drivers hit the break pedal at different moments. One driver might start breaking a meter or two later than the other.
That golf was on steiroids
Bmw sounds great
A35 Gti S3 135i  Fair  A45s Rs3 Golf R 140i
This should be the A45...???
Uma pena máquinas como essas não ter mais câmbio manual 😔
Not surprised..most of the times you chose the car that will win!!
How come is the amg's and normal mercedes models always last compared to the bmw and audi??? 👀 Is the engineering going wrong?
All of them are shit why does a hatchback weight over 1550kg
i think if there was a45s insted of a35 so it will be a diffrent story
The Mercedes A45s is the quickest 2.0ltr german Car.  But anyways new golf R is worth the money. 🚀💸
Maybe a trip to a rolling road for the golf r is in order
Soft limiter is for emissions.
The golf r is more expensive than an s3?
De bmw
girl doing the countdown who is she?
Please put in the GR Yaris in this race remove the S3 or the 135i replace it with the GR yaris
VW Engineers laughing their asses off as their 340-350BHP Golf8 R, packaged as 320BHP  is busy slapping all of the others up! 😂
Golf are is the best  even pops sounds
7:32 hilarious 😂😂
Merc/AMG would always be the best. That golf r is nice af too
The A35 letting me down
Merc driver wake the fuuk up‼️🗣
0:58 finally all the figures in the same picture....! Keep doing so! 🙏🏻
VW the best!!!
We call this VW POWER BABY  ;) !
put this golf r up against the amg a45
WTF WV rocks it. Audi is not amused
S3 on fire <3
39k it’s crazy for VW, but very good AD) Even Audi cost less! AMG is the best. But AMG driver is the worst in this race.
The A 45 s will swipe the floor with the R
Wo kann man sich den bei car wow Germany bewerben falls ihr Unterstützung braucht 🤔🤗
where's the a45s mat!!😕
put the golf R against an RS3, A45 and M140
How do we know the Golf R hasn't been chipped??
BMW ruined the 1 series. The old one is a future classic. Buy the m140i before they skyrocket in price
Why don't you put the A45s? You always wanna give BMW the advantage and that is annoying
GOLF R is and still the best
Is the new golf r quicker than an RS3 in 1/4mile??
4 times the same car... Nice 😂😂
No wonder that golf is quick, its pushing 35psi lol.
There should be a big list or chart showing all cars he's raced, and which did the quickest 1/4 mile
The narrow ring relatively paint because slash conspicuously educate amongst a finicky shadow. swift, scary archaeology
Mat is pure entertainment as well as doing class reviews
Race the VW Golf R Mk8 against the Audi RS3. We have seen the MK8 against the A45.
BMW sounded the best
Golf 8 is great front design is such a waste of potential to me
Who is the nutter wearing the mask while alone in a car?
VW the car of the People ;) if you choose the BMW or the AMG is just for show off. Ill take the Golf anyday at any time.
This new Golf R is Nuts!
It was behind the bmw
The Mercedes cheated on the brake test
Use seat Leon Cupra
I got the feeling VW horses are stronger than the others xD
BMW what have you done !! 140i would of smashed the lot
I don’t know what happened to BMW but wow
These cars sound much better than new Audi RS6 and I love RS6.
It should have been the AMG A45s
please review the new Kia K5 it's a great car.
At the end it is just a Golf, a mums car
I reckon the Golf R could do 3.8s quicker time with a tune
The R should be racing the RS3 and A45s.
hi mat.TUG OF WAR-new s3 vs new golf r
Fffeè
Biemer !! Al the way !!
Next race Golf R vs Audi RS3. In an old video on Carwow RS3 was made 12.4 sec on drag race, Merc A45 was 12.1 sec. New Golf obiviosly have more than 320hp.
You guys know that jerking your your body back and forth is not going to make the car go faster 😂
Take the "r" vs a45s. May be fun. 😉 Greetings from Poland!
The mk8 r
The enchanting biplane comparably satisfy because beat bilaterally deceive an a resolute driver. near, miniature gear
So the toyota gr yaris would destroy them all?😂
I think the matts golf was with air filter tune ...
Isn’t the A45S a 2.0, 4 cylinder, turbo hot hatch?
The golf is first down the quarter mile and will be the first to be break...still wouldn’t buy one
VW wouldnt lie its must have 320bhp
Golf R MK8 with only 150 miles on it was dyno’d at 340bhp, run in they reckon more like 350bhp!
Bmw and golf won the sound
How many freaking times are you going to race this things   Why are not you racing the 2021 GLA45
Why not A45s?
Miss cupra 300
2020 supra vs 2020 gtr
Mat race the A45S with the Golf R please. This would be super close I bet.  Hahahaha Don’t Got
A45s AMG would’ve won tho
The smoggy wash correlatively blink because catsup reportedly attempt during a sharp vest. lonely, silent playroom
The mountainous money comprehensively entertain because production progressively crack since a slimy pickle. shut, gifted jasmine
BMW sounds the best
Is that me or amg cheat at break test
the mercedes wasn't doing 70 in the brake test
The bmw sound is the best
I think the Golf is producing 300hp throughout most of the rpm range and the gearing is helping that .
Well with a price tag of 63keuro in ireland the golf R would need to be impressive. Crazy money.
Don‘t understand why you compare an Golf R with an S3? It must be S3 against Golf GTI and Golf R against RS3. That would be the right classification. Underneath the Golf and the A3 are not the same class. A3 is One class with Polo and the Golf is one class with the A4
Why not AMG 45s ??
the guy in the beemer is a dope gent , it's like him and matt would be good mates
Mat, apologies, but when you put high end factory cars, you have to do it properly, so next time try the same with an A45. Cheers.
Mercedes said its not fast as the other's  bruh you were sleeping it has nothing to do with mercedes if you sleeping
A35 way behind on the brake test you can clearly see that 🤣 a35 not get level when others brake!
If your doing a hatchback battle for the quarter mile surely they should get the A45s AMG instead of the A35
Wtf, why is the VW the most expensive? Do the "luxury brands" lack equipment?
All four look like dogshit however dogshit is more exciting.
Golf is golf !!!
The Mrecedes Guy: "Yeah the launch was okay but it's just not as fast as the others"  Narrator:  "The launch was worse than that of a dead horse"
Audi s3 8v 💘
Ich finde, das ist ein super Kanal. Gucke ich oft :)
Have you measured them on dyno? It would be interesting.
Golf owners the new R did us proud 🥲!!
You should bring Audi RS3. A45S AND M140i against your Gold R
Great Vid 👍 ordered my new MK8 Golf R through CarWow today!! Might need Yianni to wrap it for me when it arrives 😎👌
I want to be your carwow presontator in the netherlands, stroopwafels!
The golf press car was 100% on a stronger mapping. Common practice for press cars.
Can you guys do a drag race with every GTR? THAT WOULD BE PRETTY COOL TO SEE!
Golf 8 R and bmw m135 have best Sound
Bring yianni in the race
Bring yianni
The BMW really sounds the best
It’d be great to see the golf vs a BMW 340I
We need Carwow in America!
This is BS, WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THE A45?????
VW took a dumb on Audi, that’s sad , considering the Audi should’ve been faster by a standard(Audi is the premium VW)
Unfair race, use the a45
@Matt Watson Cars: please keep your eyes peeled for the arrival of the new Cupra. Will be interesting to see if the VW Group allows the Cupra to equal the R-cars performance now that Cupra is trying to be a standalone brand? Especially in Golf Estate v Cupra Leon Estate where they’ll both have AWD. Or will VW keep the Golf R “power/acceleration hierarchy” intact?
Where is the amg 45 S? That's a 2 litre lol, but it would destroy everything there.
Why not a rs3
The Audi sounds the best, because it is quiet and after long trip does not give you a headache.
I love Volkswagen ❤❤❤
VW R
2.5 bars of boost for the golf!!WOW
Golf 12,3s - the same time as super sport car Bugatti EB110 GT [1992]
The New BMW 1 is sooo ugly.  The old design language was much more beautiful
a shame for the name m135i ..
Would like to see Golf r vs a45s vs rs3 🤔
New golf R vs A45s vs M140 please
Beemer
My Grandma has better reaction times than that AMG driver
Dissapointing from Mercedes to be honest.
Bmw 135i 😈✌️😎🤤
Hey Mat if you wanna open a carwow channel in Italy i'd love to be the italian Mat Watson 😂😂😂
At 70mph you're doing about 10 feet in 0.1 seconds. In other words, if a car won the brake test by 1 inch, the time difference in reaction was about 0,0008333333333 seconds lol
They ruin Golf look🤢 Why why 😭😭😭
Merc braked earlier, pause at 8:48.
Why a35 amg and not a45 amg???
Can you drag race vs a cupra with the vw?!
Bmw sounds the best but looks like shit. The F20 is way better
BMW sounds the best
Désolé très gros soucis la A45S il a 100ch de plus golf 8 R vw a tricher elle doit faire plus 320ch ou la A45s à un problème mécanique
Race of vacuum cleaner
Hi Mat, Kindly Go For the New BMW M140i,Golf 8r,New S3 And A45
AMG Ad 'We might not be the quickest, but we brake just fine'
Golf R increible
Carwow would like to thank James May for piloting the Mercedes A35.
5,36 mill. abonnenter
proud of being a golf owner
I just wana watch a dragrace.. Youtube : that costs you 2 unskippable adds and 3 ads in the video. Matt : not enough adds, ill just interupt the video for some more bs adds. Man i'm so done with all this add bs everywhere...!
What about Porsche 911 Turbo S versus Mercedes AMG GT black series?
i reckon that merc cheat a litlle bit on the brake test...according to that...on the other side Audi would maybe won that one
Next time A45s
He Carwow!  Are you still reading the comments ?
the golf R must be raced against the mini GP!
only AMG could win due to keeping behind the squad in break test?
Lamborghini Elemento  vs
Lamborghini Elemento  vs
BMW
Please one of the subi :(
Imagine the m135 with the s58 engine  Damn bmw you ruined the 1er
Please do 911 Turbo S vs 765
The  vw is way more reliable
I dont think the Mercedes driver did that car justice. It can perform better in the hands of a better driver
a45 vs golf r
Vw golf the best
BMW sounds best. But i dont like the Exterior of the NEW 1 and 2 Series. So its out.
Golf R sounds the best
Why do you slam the brakes at such speed
Bmw💥💥💪🏼
VW golf Rodriguez vs A45s
Came here for Mat's German accent ya
Do a Ford GT drag rac
Hahahahah 1 series and a class is not bmw and mercedes bro
A bmw sounding like that ?
I’m an Audi fan but I must say we need to stop putting soft limiters on our cars it’s just embarrassing seeing BMWs m5s and c63s popping and banging at stock and our cars sounding like a vaccum 😅🙄🙅‍♂️
Is it my grandmother using bmw
I did not think that the golf is going to be that quick🤯
WoW Golf R pushes 2.4bar of boost at the peak. And has 1.3 bar at 1500rpm. Not a joke.
If that reading in bar is boost(I'm pretty sure it is) then the golf has more power than stated/has an over boost function. My ea888 makes 400 @1.7 bar.
2.5 bar of boost in the Golf R???
The Benz is officially the oldest car there now.. my how fast time flies
Tesla Roadster VS Porsche 911 turbo s
Surely the golf gti is the correct car to race against these cars. Not a R, the top of the line RS3 would smoke the golf R
Mat two of the cars in that drag race where wrong  It was supposed to be VW golf GTI 8 R VS AUDI RS3 VS Mercedes Benz A45s Vs BMW M135i  Not otherwise because VW GOLF GTI 8 AND AUDI S3 and Mercedes Benz A35 and BMW 128ti are nearly the same so I request a rematch but no S3 and A35  So it will be Golf 8 R VS A45s Vs RS3 VS M135i then the Mercedes Benz A45s will demolish the GTI 8 R  And Yianni must drive the Merc
Always jumps the start
I think we would like to see how this golf R performs against the bigger Germans the RS3 and 45s, to see a closer match and how much difference exist
German channel so that someone on Carwow can actually pronunce Poorsch properlery 😂shots fired Keep it up Matt
That bmw is ugly
Vw>bmw

Why a pilot in merceses in slow kitchen
They used one of the slowest Mercedes Hatches of the A class range. Throw in a A45s and Audi RS3 and let's see how the Golf does
The real winner would have been the Audi TT-S.
I think the Golf is back, time to add in NFS again
Wow. Not even close and also not what I was expecting. Damn!
None of them sound good.
Can you arrange a race between Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Pagani Zonda, Bugatti, Koenigsegg and with each foreign car the best model.  I think this will be the best race the world has seen!
Mercedes might put too much effort on A45s and forget about A35
BMW definitely has the best sound
what about Gold R vs Audi Rs3?
Why volksvagen company with no prestige is most expensive?
I dont agree with this race..why dont you take the a35 out and put the a45 in...all cars are 2.0turbo except 135i...a35 not nearly in the league here
La mercedes e' una merda
Mercedes and BMW deserves to lose just because of it's looks
؟؟honda civic type R fk8 ??????
That Golf R is very impressive.  They have always been quick but the new one is very quick. I love the German accent you do Matt, its hilarious, please do more!
Hands uP for the Golf R.... wicked Beast!
Nah whoever drove the Mercedes was TERRIBLE
Α 45s is  also a 2 litre ....
So it bmw vs Volkswagen
Anyone notice the coolant burst in the engine bay of the m135i @ 0:31
Красивая рубашка Мэт Где можно заказать такую?)
Who knew the outcome of the race from which cat Mat was driving? 👍👍😎 that ahold was quick though!!!
3 hundred hospowah
Cut the video from 7:30 to 7:35 and add the song Volkswagen from Bru-C
I am a Volkswagen fan but the BMW sounded betterr
Porshe 911 turbo s 2020 vs porsche 918   1+
Wait so what VW Golf model is meant to rival the Audi RS3, Merc A45 etc?
I should say: 1 Golf 2 A3 3 BMW 4 Benz
Mercedes: all show no go...
Why A35 not the A45? Then you have to choose the GTI because the R is the top model of the Golf like the A45 of the A-Class... Weird.
Where is the AMG a45 🙂
3.94 in a Golf. Wtf.
Deffo down to the drivers this race, Car wow have some pretty awful drivers no offence golf jumped merc still sat their and it just doesn’t make any sense how the golf was gapping the far more powerful up top bmw and the audi also managed to real it in when the audis also deffo got less top end than the bmw 🤔
Bruh, u are in the Best HotHatch from VW... Here are a45, rs3... And human in a45 is stupid 😂🤷‍♂️ GOLF and BMW is shits...
Hyundai
It's not possible that people alone in the car with mask are good driver.
Now get that Golf R in the same ring as the RS 3 and the A45 please.
the result is obvious. More hp per ton - winner
The Golf is the lightest and strongest of them... Why should it lose?^^
2.5 Bar boost damn
Golf R vs Mercedes A45s
@Mat Watson, please race the new Golf R against the A45s AMG and the RS3. Should be very close. 👌Thank you
Its all about the launch. If Matt drive a other car it will be olso different.
I think BMW sound is better.
Should have used a a45s
The R Is such a great car
The a35 sucks a$$ lol. Way overpriced😜
BMW sounds the best
Golf r
Do eqc vs etron
New Golf R has also better drag time than previous Merc A45 381HP.
Which 2 liter 4 cylinder turbo charged the quickiest? -> A 45s AMG obviously :)
Sponsor today: volkswagen
but the A45s do got also a 2.0 Turbo 4 cylinder engine. so the AMG is the fastest and slowest at the same time:D
I think it’s not fair the Mercedes is the oldest version
Never buy a VW
Mercedes driver was napping 😴
The Golf R is faster than the outgoing RS3 on the Quarter mile with 80 hp less? It must have so much more horsepower combined with a LC made by Porsche lol The Golf R is also just 0,2 sec slower than the A45S which has around 420hp.. VW is trolling us with the new Golf R and i really like that.
BWW sounds better⚡️
Do the Golf R vs A45s for a fair race😂
Golf R vs BMW 340i, when?
Who wants mat to drive the Mercedes-Benz
Skip to 3.13 save the waffle.
whose R is this? its probably chiptuned
Start 03:10
The Merc cheated at the breaktest 😲
Why does VW need to be deceitful again? The R is easily 360 hp. Super fun and fast car by all accounts, but why all the lying?!?
bmw have a great sound omg its the best
carwow indonesia
Why A35 not A45.....
Mercedes driver has taken every drug mentioned in the Bible!
The Golf R Issa beast!!!
Hey Mat, another great video!  Any chance of some throwback drag races?  Pitch new against old over the years.... Escort Cossie v  Focus MK1/2/3... MX3 Mk1/2/3 etc etc... all the 911 Turbos... Lambo bash off!  Could be cool 😎
I bet AMG wins if you change the drivers,
There are other aspects of car you can include when giving information such as the size of wheel and type of tires and even the type of fuel you put in the car!
Hi there, AMG sounded the best and to be honest I feel you are biased with VW
Mat was hella annoying in this video
Che prova di merda fatta veramente male
anybody gonna say anything about the R being .1 seconds faster than the LFA????
Why are persons sitting ALONE in a car wearing face masks?????
BMW SOUNDS BETTER
Why do you always pit the Golf R against the S3 and not the RS3?
GOLF R VS FOCUS RS NEXT!!!!!
The Audi driver at 7:32 😂
Only old BMW 1 3.0 biturbo and Audi A3 RS 2.5 tfsi. PS. Ford Focus RS?
Volkswagen, Das Auto 😎👊💪✋
Why didnt you get A45 and not A35
Matt the Yaris was a bomb but this Golf R came out and is stealing the show from around the world. INSANE Power for a family hatch with so much weight.
Amg whats happening
Under 4 sec for a Golf is insane... A 993 Turbo with over 400 PS took 4.5 seconds. Just saying.
Benz slept on the line
Cheater car won 😄
Bmw sounded better
Fare play to VW but £ 41k for a golf an you can’t even get it with three doors  Now that’s not very sporty,is it!
Never thought I’d say this... I’m fucking bored of watching carwow videos and even more sick of seeing you Matt.. the same guests like fucking Yanny, Jesus Christ. I’m over it... moved on to pellet gun videos and crypto...
Do the f21 m135i vs that golf r
It is not so  much about horsepower in the Golf, it is superior aerodynamics
Yep,another video with mat plugging vag products and fixing the race for his sponsors .Really shameful.And no A45
Onde está a AMG 45 S
Why is there allways a terrible driver in one of the cars. That merc started a full second after the rest.
Great German impression. lol
Need A45s
Race the m140 with the golf r
BMW
Hey Mercedes - How I can help you? - Why VW is beating your ass? - _Error 404 file not found_
it must be a45 instead  a35
9:01 golf R check engine turns on...
Hot hatch drag race ? Really ? Where is A45s ? Come on Matt .. be fair
a teased civic has them for fun
The golf R has a new transmission setting call Beast mode thats y it's so freaking fast
Need the old m140i vs the golf
Carwow Latinoamérica hazlo :c
NEXT RACE: Golf R vs A45 S vs Toyota Supra 3 L vs Tesla Model X P100D And Audi RS6 vs BMW M4
M135i😍❤️❤️❤️
Can't wait for the RS3. The serial killer!!!!!!!!!
The VW group are lyin about the bhp. I think they are tired of coming loosing thats why they're lie. Audi is the clear winner
i wanna see the golf R vs RS3 and A45
I think u were in the movie name:Ford Vs Ferrari:)
Pointless test... Should have a gti instead of an R for it to be fair imo
Stupid merc driver
1:15 :D.Çdç.döS:ÇDÖ:Çsdö
Maybe if they got a 2021 AMG A 35 or 45, AMG would have won
Please add some drones shot to your videos
Imagine paying 2k more for a Golf. Just stupid to not pick the Merc
The A35 cheated on the brake test
would go for vw golf r!
The 4 wheel drive system on the R is why its fast
Matt you have more torque than all of them
2.5 bar on the golf r , thats 36 pounds of boost on a a stock set up , WTF ``)
if you want to be fair the A45S is the original AMG, so  is the best 2.0 4cyl. in the world. the R never gona have chance against....
I thought the Audi S3 is the more fancy, slightly better Golf R. Wtf.
Ok so if you want problems buy a VW, if you want a car buy a BMW, Mercedes or i30N, simple.
These videos are SO much better and less annoying when Yanni’s not in them
Take rs3, not s3 or gti Not r
The AMG cheated the brake test. 8:48
BMW sounded the best🇿🇦
The Sun is out that's why my guy
Is this a golf commercial?
Bmw did great with their second front wheel drive car despite being a rear wheel drive manufacturer
I would have the Golf everytime. The BMW I don't like because I have always hated the 1-series. It is ugly just as is the Mercedes. The Audi just looks bland and sounds it too. The Golf ticks all the boxes for me.
The Mercedes driver was taking a nap on the race start :D
Jesus christ those MK8's with a tune are gonna be stupid!
The Golf R is great, but bring down the Audi RS3 to see which is faster!
Audi RS3 is a 5 cyl not 4
The golf R is the 911 turbo s of hatchbacks, sounds like a vacuum but beats everyone in a race
That AMG was way back even before they cross the White braking line... No brainer why it won the brake test... But maybe  just a suggestion;  a drone camera might be good one  to see how those cars positioned themselves once the brake pedal is engaged...
Its kinda unfair to compare 2wd with a 4wd, the advantage is too big
2.5 bar omg. it has more than 350 I think
New AMG-ad: "Our brakes are the best."
1:12
Impressive result in terms of performance. I always thought the golf was a less premium alternative to the others. Now the most expensive!
Golf R is clearly tuned. VW are notorious for sending out press cars that are tweaked to look good. There’s no way it will do 12.3 at the quarter with just 320 hp. All things fair, I think the BMW has the superior engine, but is let down by the Aisin 8-speed that’s nowhere as good as the previous ZF.
Mat: "Here comes the V-" Me: "V-tec! Oh wait." Mat: "VW Golf!"
and where its the cupra leon?
U should bring the M140i instead of the M135i
Golf R :  when you play easy mode in racing games
Carwow Germany already subscribed weeks ago. If ever you need a host for Carwow Luxembourg, I'm in 😂😂😂
Mat: I just can't believe I was so lucky that I'm in the winning car yet again, how am I always so lucky?? Oooh, that's right, it's because I hate losing and I always try my best to get in the car that is most likely to win...
We know Volkswagen never get their figures right! Come and live where I live in Dubai, you’d love soft limiters!,,
The bimmer sounded the best in my opinion👍
bmw sounds the best
the AMG is in the same class as the gti , that would have been a more fair race. The R is in the same class as the A45s , IE super hatch. Just my opinion
The only problem with that Golf R is that they don't sell it here in Russia. Hell, they don't even sell GTI!...
Volkswagen 😍❤😍
Put RS3  Put 145i And A45s Then we we'll have a race
Audi driver and matt with their heads
When are you going to drag race the mclaren 765lt
Mercedes were just the only ones who didn't lied about their power figure ah ah
Great vid as always. Why the fuck was your man in the beamer wearing a mask in the car on his own? I think they were all wearing em bar matt? Why like
We live in a society where AMG A35 is a distant memory. Isn't that right, comment readers.
M135i
Vw lie about performance figures, theyre always faster than vw claim, it puts them in lower insurance groups so more people can afford them and therfore more likely to buy one.
seemingly cheaper Audis rule the rivals and with rise in price range, it's vice versa
Muscle cars pleaseeeee! 💯💯😍
It annoys me so much that the guy driving the merc, always gets a bad start
mat  you guys should have a tug of war with with  the new mitsubishi triton
Volkswagen still the kings of hot hatches
We want  911 Turbo S vs  765 lt  Like to agree
Great video as usual, but I love the brake tests! Everyone not level and braking at different points = funny non comparable results. 😂
For the persons with false ideas for turbo pressure. The 2,5 bar in the R were the turbo pressure (1,5 bar) AND the atmospheric pressure (which is 1 bar!). Makes 2,5 bar.
Is it the power or the new rear diff that makes VW R faster?  Anyways I prefer fun cars more than just train like fast cars => that is nice communicative steering and sexy short throw manual gearbox, and then we can start talking about power...
Seriously, Mercedes had a good launch?! You "Don't Got" eyes in your face?!
Why wasn't there a AMG 45S? Why bring the baby if you have the toughest and fastest golf
The best golf r
Make carwow dutch!!!!
Interesting, the golf R is running 2.5 bar in certain gears, that's similar to the A45S... I'm assuming VW have started the figures as at the wheels possibly, not crank/flywheel. That coupled with the usual 10-15bhp on top of official figures I'd say it must be in the region of 370-380 bhp.   I'm more surprised with the S3 not being closer to the golf, I thought they used the same engine and where pretty much mechanically the same, or similar atleast.
Suggestion: can you add the conversion in KM/h / KM/100L / Kilograms, etc etc on the screen when using feathers/pint etc? We love watching you over the channel, but it's really annoying to have to recalculate the miles/gallon, 0-62m/h etc...
It’s a dinosaur race Matt.
Why wasn't there a45 if you already said it was the fastest Germans?
VW R infotainment system is slow. Did they do a software update? The Mercedes has the best infotainment system of these cars and probably the nicest interior too. 👌
Either the R is remapped by VW to give great performance for the press cars, or VW are under quoting the power. Matt himself said it feels more like 350 at least, maybe more.
vw Golf R 2.3 bar????
Shame the R has a face only a mother could love
0-60mph 3.94sec Golf R
It was actually nice weather! VW R NICE!
That golf r is on crack
Golf r vs m340i!!
The mercedes was asleep in the first race
Why did you not use the A45s AMG?, it is till a 2.0 engine.
I was thinking of a different kind of drag race
Now I know the new GLA 35 AMG will perform it's going to be crap isn't it?
Hello
on hamilton archie channel a45    barrely wins or even not golf 8 R
The New GTI be like: 5:49
How is the bimmer now called an M135i when it has a shitbox 4 cylinder? Why is the rolling race such bullshit when you have to get past ludicrous speeds to call a winner? Can you please do some lap times with these cars as straight-line performance is about 1 percent of the appeal?
Man in the Mercedes, "it launches okay but...' but nothing my G, your reactions are atrocious. Play that sh*t at 0.25 speed, everyone is at his front bumper before he dumps the breaks. Horrendous.
Test the A45s vs VW Golf R
What about Audi RS3 ?
That rash on the BMW wheel  at 8:57 though. Yikes 😬
When since is this channel so funny!!!!! I LOVE THE JOKES
Race the Golf R vs an Rs3 an M2 and an A45
Vw 😘
역시 아우디 청소기소리네요 소프트리밋 극혐 벨로스터 DCT도 함께 했으면 좋았을 껄
Take out a45s and give it better driver
God I love Mat and this channel lmao
Fastest 2.0l hothatch isn't that the a45 by a mile
Why A35 instead of A45 ?
I think the bmw sounded the best but I’d take the golf all day
Braking has everything to do with the tires.
so the non luxury brand car is the most expensive out of the whole group??
Wtf was that merc driver?
2.5 bar on a stock golf r?
2.5 bar of boost on the Golf. Ha ha... zoom zoom  BOOM
I was hoping for the cleaner meme to appear for the audi 😂
who is this brainwashed in BMW wearing MASK!!!!!!!!
Yes BMW thats what happens when you convert 135i into a 4cyl millenial car.  6cyl-ers used to win all these drag races.
What beast has vw made 🤯
MERCEDES !! We WERE in a Race 😂 04:13
Those prices are misleading, the spec on the Golf R is high, the BMW peasant spec is terrible, if you add features which come as standard on the Golf it is pushing over 40K. I specced one up to 39,990 and still couldn't get adaptive cruise control.
Do the GLC & GLE coupes vs X6/X4!!
how come the vw is the most expensive
M.Watson Jumps the start every time
love the new golf
I like your haircut that way mat, please don't do the other one this one is good
Mercedes driver has really slow reactions, letting the side down big time
The beama
This is really interesting 😊
Finally a sunny day...!!!! wowwww....
Why A35 and not 45s?
Should have the A45, not 35
They all sound like vacuum cleaners
How does this have a million views already?
VW cheat this press car for sure😝😂
I feel like if it was the Mercedes a45 it would have almost won every challenge
That AMG driver🤦‍♂️
Would be interesting to see the new MK8 Golf R go up against the previous generation Golf Rs. MK4/5 R32s & MK6/7 Golf Rs.
Why you didn't use the A45 amg?!!!!
A45s: Cracks 3.9s 0-100 Golf R: "And I took that personally."
Stock golf r 2.5bar turbo?
Everyone Gangstar until the new RS3 join the rolling race
Should’ve switched the a35 for an a45 🤷🏽
Mat ass is telling the truth
That's why you don't compare an R with an S3 compare it with an RS3 and M3 and A45 AMG
Please can you guys put that r on a dyno to see what power it actually makes??
Mercedes cheated hardcore on the breaktest LMAO
Why didn't you test the A45 instead of the A35? Oh, i know, because it would have destroyed them all
German civil war?
Id say the BMW sounded more throaty, but that new R is rapid. Might consider it after I've finished with my 140i
Will we have a koenigsegg in this channel???
Just imagine if BMW hadn't sold out an dthe new M140i was based on the M3's 6-pot with the option of x-drive... Oh well. Into the mix of boring as cars it goes.
Would take the Gold R anyday
Stick the a45 in there
BMW shot themself in the foot with front wheel drive. If they still had rear wheel then there would be no competition
Why is the fastest Golf up against the 2nd fastest of each other model?
volkswagen will not give you for low price more hp,it have 320-330hp on dyno too., he is only better optimised then others
The Golf R needs the akrapovic exhaust;)
I think we need to see what the golf would do around the rs3 and a45s
Thats a load of arse🤣🤣🤣
Do a tesla model s p100d against porsche turbo s
0-60 in 3.9 seconds, that’s crazy for a golf
Sound BMW
So only the Golf is the range topping version, all other are the "sporty" option. To make it fair it should be the GTI not the R in the  line-up.
135mi IS BEST sund
I want to see the RS3 vs the VW
Аudi, Golf 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🔥🔥🔥 Mercedes, BMW 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻⚰️⚰️⚰️
Golf is insane! Another category
Wouldn't the standard A45 be a better competitor, the A35 is more in the category of the VW polo GTI
Matt Has VW sent you a tuned Golf by any chance? We all know they have a previous for cheating tests!
The DSG is absolute sh**e - I had the last golf R and it was GREAT but the gearbox was god awful. Unless in manual mode and race, it’s a 1-2 second lag. In the real world it was almost dangerous as you’d half pull out of junctions with f-*k all happening - then the jets would kick in and you’d get out of trouble, but it was infuriating by the end of the 2 year lease.
As a german I really prefer the standard carwow with mat watson over the german channel.
Golf R sounds the best.  Whoa!
Should put golf gti
unfortunately they took the lowest grade audi in the S models, which is the S3 but pretty sure the s4-s5 wouldve made it harder for the golf R
The a35 is the oldest (2019) the golf R is the latest on this range of car. the phase 2 will probably have something like 350-360 hp and 450nM in 2years and the panamerica grill
BHP test on the golf R...? 🤔
I think It would be nice to see a Golf R vs a Yaris GR in a drag race ! 3 cylinders vs 4 cylinders :p
So we are here to find out which 2 litre turbo charged German hot hatch is the fastest? No A45?
put that golf against the a45s please!!!!!
Wake up mercedes driver and where is your a45s bro.
Mercedes is a renault megane rs in disguise
Golf R 💪💪💪💪 toop😍😍
golf R vs A45 pls
Ok, everything instead of Audi sounds good.
We need more drag races matt 😍
I smell a rat. The VW is a press car- They’ve done the emissions scandal again but this time mapped it with more power for the press I suspect...
A45S same 2.0 4 cylinder... :D
What has become of cars?  No skill just stuck your foot down and watch what the car does.  Life is shit.
Check what the golf 8 is boosting stock😳
BMW 140i
3.9 seconds is same 0-60 as the A45s congrats to VW
Me Keeping my eyes off the comments before I read a spoiler.
Can you drag racer Toyota GR YARIS VS Golf R
Just wait till the new M140i :)that one will beat everywone
If that R wasn't so ugly 🥴 hopefully they do better on the refresh
Audi one love <3 :D
Why not a A45s
There is no way that golf R is making 320 Hp, it's boosting at 2.3 bar check that boost gauge on the dash when Matt is doing the roll race, Generally a 2.0L 4 cylinder turbocharged engine at 2 bar will make close to 400 Hp or even more.
German Here . accent was hilarious.
The golf r
For the money of a Golf R I would definitely go for a Model 3 Performance.
Skip to 3 mins. Race starts 3:03
so Volkswagen is cheating again?
Mercedes driver got the reaction time of a brick... what a knob.
You have to play real driving sim on your phone, You start with a a35 in middle of a motorway
Golf or bmw
I think, it's time for the Mercedes AMG 45s against the Golf R....🤔😉
It would be interesting to see golf R vs mercedes amg a45s
Loved my mk7 golf R. Would take one again in a heart beat
I'll tell you what would add to your drag races. Weigh the cars with the driver in them, as they go to the start line.
The GOLF R
Good videos. Stop begging for likes and subscription in every videos
I bet VW Press group tuned the Golf R for publicly so people will buy it!
Mitsubishi pajero vs audi tug of war  Pajero wins its my challange
4ads? In one video? Instant thumbs down from me
This is the same race from 2 or 3years ago
Привет! Мне кажется должен был победить MERCEDES AMG! 😉🤗👍
Finally, volkswagen are bringing back the hot hatch title after such a long time. That mk8 r is something else.
shouldnt the a45 go against the golf r?
poor ugly BMW! That 1er has so bad looking design  compared to the older 1er  and may cause too much drag on higher speeds too.
Thats cute, now put them against A45s
Why no amg45s there ? i mean u got best golf but a35 merc like whyy
i swear mat is anti merc guy :)
Audi is really retarded coz of the soft limiter on a sports car
Who tought a mercedes is would be the cheapest...
That wasn't a fair race cos the golf R is the top of the range it should be racing the A45amg the M140i and the Rs3
36psi of turbo boost in golf R surely that's a gimmick. A lot of boost, engine seems very stout.
M135i best sounding car... Golf R doing what BMW do lately...performance packed in controversial looks. Disappointed in Audi sound and surprised AMG tossed this one!
Surely the RS3 is a better match for the golf R
get the mini jcw in there
I know golf paid to BMW,AUDi and Merc
Matt, it is time for VW R generation race. Extra points of you can wrangle a Golf Rallye as well.
That S3 looks like an SUV!
If you think the Golf R is fast, remember, the GR Yaris is just half a second off.
You guys should do all Hellcats race! Charger, Challenger, Trackhawk, and Durango
damn that BMW is ugly
Volkswagen is the new McLaren...lol
No need to tune this R, it's perfect as is plus you get to keep your warranty.
The new Golf looks exactly like a Qashqai at the side, especially when Matt’s stood in front of the grill
A45s?
Hi Mat, can you please do the new golf R vs a45s vs rs3 vs M2 competition
Again: a donkey behind the wheel of a Mercedes!
Merc driver seemed pretty inexperienced
Finally, VW gets the engine the power it should have.
Audi s3
Why not a A45s?
12.3 sec for a 4 cyl. hothatch is amazing lol
I always wondered how BMW managed to fit 3 litre in the previous 1 series which was making it special and now.. ended up being destroyed every time with the new 2 litre. Rip m140i.
Why wasting tome for a video which based on who pays more or mode or bias or or
So sad that the new M135i is just down right downgrade from the M140i
As always Mercedes driver sleeping , has the reaction slower than my grandma , please change it !!
What’s the buzz? Is this Golf R a tricked up press car or is the power understated?
Mercedes driver took 4 years to launch. Wakey wakey. The A35 launches perfectly fine.
The German accent 😂 😂 😂
Mat heloo.
hello matt, i would like you to do a very classic competition which is the toyota gt 86 and its twin the subaru brz, greetings friend
Carwow are dont save you any money, worst trade value and discounts are poor, try Drive The Deal much cheaper
It should have been a45, it was unfair
Mat remove the MERCEDES A35 and put the A45s
The 6 cylinder of the m140i would eat them all.
My favourite are Audi S3 i want buy Golf R bmw sound best
Why arent you racing the a45 s since its the quickest 2.0L benz hatchback?
I'm glad that the gold doesn't have a soft limiter, but why doesn't it? it's the same company as Audi so why would they give the rs models a soft limiter but not the VW models? doesn't make sense to me...
what world we live in..golf does 100km/60m/hr under 4 sec..woooow
Everyone is saying vs a45 rs  ect  but power wise and price wise this is the cars it competes with its a BEAST VW FTW
Just that guy joke .sit car 🚗 all always better but other car not good fuck joke 😒
To be honest, they all sound shit.
2.5 bar from factory? what the hell lol
The Audi sounded like the noise an electric car makes for pedestrian safety.
Was that A35 driver having a 💭
German Car win :-D
I have asked this about 10 times now over the years. Please include trap speed in MPH/KPH and the exact time for the 1/4 not rounded up. You rounded up the golf r time from 12.28 to 12.30... Trap speed is nearly just as important as the 1/4 time. It shows what car has the most power/ best power to weight.
Not to mention the heater was running in the golf and it was 3 degrees outside!!!
Carwow,can you test the PROTON SAGA ISWARA?
find a highly modified diesel car like  1.9tdi or 3.5d and race it againts something
I can see why A45s exists 😏
Well, to be fair, you did say you were going to find out which German hot hatch with a 2 liter engine, were fastest down the quarter mile. And you didn't bring the A45 AMG. We all know why of course, it would destroy the rest, but it has a 2 liter engine. So that would be fair now wouldn't it?
The best sound is the BMW
So the Golf is more expensive that it's posher stablemate, the Audi S3? VAG go their strategy wrong there, it seems.
Try Golf R with A45s
Its ugly, but it’s also rly fast. Kinda like the type r
Oh the press cars....
Shouldve used an a45
Do the same thing vs a RS3 and a A45 and come back here talking how great the golf is
What is it about this gay impression of german?
mat why is a potato driving the merc
Wv = audi Same manufacture, same car, different brand
BMW obviously
That Golf R is the "I can afford this car" of my dreams.
Hey could you review the karma revero
How stupid do you have to be to wear a mask in a car by Yourself
Hi Matt try car transporters next
Matt Watson..a face you could slap
Mercedes guy 😴😴😴😴😴😴
Best sound is easily the M135i
Where is the supra mk5 ;)
I thought of a new race old vs new the lamborghini LM002 vs The Lamborghini Urus
Missing the lorry drag race with yanni 🚛🚚
Also the golf is the fastest to break down🤣
3.9 Seconds is faster than my 235i 3.0T 🤔 what the f...?
You should have chosen a45 amg, it’s still a 2 litter 4 cylinder  engine
I think we lived the fact that for many-many few times  a 4wd Golf with the same mechanic parts beats an S3. Question: Where have been hidden the 45Kg.m of 2 litre m135i?? Conclusion! Τhe A35 AMG is a pure dissapointment!
M2-- AMG45S & RS3 is the in-line competition for the R line matt.
When comes the ID 4 Review?
Matt Please get a accurate dynometer and let's see what is the real power the mk8 puts on the wheels
Finally a not submissive Golf... we all knew golf did this since back the time! It just required a stage 1-2 which essentially it what audi is regularly given..
The creepy relative wailly irritate because year arthroscopically empty midst a crooked camel. chunky, efficient accountant
I remember times when bmw was 140i with 6 cylinders, good old times
Just to know, why use the A35 if you have the A45s 🤔
Volkswagen 💪💪💪
So many adds in these videos.
Of course the new golf R is gonna feel quick. It peaked at 2.5 BAR boost @5:51.!!!! What are those MAD german VW Scientist smoking??   Brilliant race
"Which is the best German hot hatch?"   Proceeds to race with 3 of the 4 being lesser models 🤣
Gotta use a rs3 and a45 against the golf r
We wanna see X6 M competition vs Urus
It's hard to believe in performance of Golf R.
Why no A45 ? and are BMW bring a 140i to the table at some point? Gilf performed well but its not a looker
Merc vs. 3 VWs!
You always repeat dragraces once or twice. the Mercedes driver was obvs. sleeping at the launch. So why not repeat this one?
Carwow Deutschland kinda good stuff, but even better would be Carwow Europe or something like that. Reviews for cars which are available for all or almost for all of EU countries.
Not everyday do you see a VW beat the ultimate driving machine
Well, the quickest 2.0litre is the A45
No bmw here only a vw a merc a golf and a focus st
Audi wins                                                           Bmw fans: Volkswagen wins                             Volkswagen destroys Bmw.                            Bmw fans: ....
That golf r will be upsetting alot of cars at the lights 😂
When I saw Mat in the golf R I knew it was gonna win😂
Why would you use the A35 when you have the more powerful A45s
"Mercedes just didn't launch" - There there, you were sleeping wakey wakey
7:33 birds
Why isn't the A45 a challenge
A45s Vs Golf R vs GR Yaris
I think golf gti not golf r...because the mercedes just a35 not a45s
The last race audi gone 12.3
vw made a great car 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥
Mercedes guy can't drive.
VW Golf 8R
Next A45s vs MK8 Golf R
Could you bring the new golf gti?
Where was the a45s
Fast golf, buy the GR Yaris and a 20 year old EVO with a manual dit 12,5. These thing are way to heavy
Nice to See how the old Mitsubishi EVO 6 can keep Up Whit the New Cars It did the 1/4 Mile in 12.5 sek Whit Less Power and torque A Shame why Mitsubishi stopped the production of that great Car! 🙁
Volkswagen as a whole is shit
The boost pressure on that golf😳
The audi sounds depressing
The R was keeping up with the A45 in another video...so the R is kicking ass
Hey Matt, why didn’t you use yr old yellow merc for this race?
Mercedes didn’t launch alright, why the hell did he say it was fine. We need more competitive drivers. 😏🙄
The R is the top of the range golf.. but the others aren’t.. can’t wait to see the Rs3 , A45, M1 go against each other and the R... completely different story.
Why didn't you use the A45. We all know A35 is slow
Why didn't you put the Golf Mk8 Gti
Unfortunately the A35 is the best looking by a mile, all the others are uglier than their predecessors
The A35 was so slow off the start, yet he doesn't even mention it lol
As a previous S3 owner...would I buy the new Audi S3 or Golf R? Er...Golf R...what were VAG thinking? I also MUCH prefer the interior and MMI of my S3 to the cheapened up new S3. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Golf r
7:26 😂
The R and S3 have similar stats...who knows why??? Impressed by the Golf, shame Volks person progressed with an RS3-M1-A45-like model...
Should race that golf r against the a45
The R just send others to Gapplebees
2.3 bar?? Wtf
VW up to their not good lieing tricks again
BMW sounds better
New GOLF R should be tested against the, audi RS3, Merc A45, and BMW M1...
Would love to see the A45s take on this Golf R, with Yianni involved
Golf R needs to go up against the A45S, and RS3
So the a45 wins? Haha
The bmw is a really anonymous car
Most 90s hot hatches.... ~150hp. Even a Golf VR6 was like what 180hp?! Then you had an Impreza 2.0 Turbo with 200hp which was seen as standout from regular hot hatchbacks and was iconic at the time.  Now we have an actual hot hatch pushing 320+ HP from that same displacement...
tbh i didn't expect golf to dominate the field. and Mercedes was so poor wow.
I thought Golf R is equivalent to AMG A45s, RS3 and M1 and Golf GTI is equivalent to those cars. Mismatch.
I've never really been sure this 3rd gear thing makes sense. 3rd for a car with 9 gears is likely to be quite different to one with 6, for example. Even with the same number of gear the ratios are likely to be different. I also agree with the Audi driver's comment, tyres are probably the most significant factor in the brake tests in this format. Having said all of that the Golf R is a monster :-)
What the fuck, bmw 135i is a shitty 4 pot? What happened to the straight 6,  3.0 turbo? Nobs, how to ruin ya cars.
I would still get the BMW
Can You Do Videos With A Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk?
If VW says it’s 300 Hp, it must be 300 , not like they’d lie about their ... oh wait
All those cars look soooo ugly except the merc. Sad because it’s going against everything a hot hatch used to be
We definitely need to see a race with the new golf R vs a RS3 and a45s
Carwow sort out your timing gear! The times don’t marry up to past tests on the same cars.  Automann has called you out on using the wrong settings on the timing gear
Did I see 2.3bar on that golfs dash? That has to be overboost and then tailing off hard to like 1.4-1.6???? That or the turbo on that thing is already strung out!?!
The guy in next car has a face nappy on whilst driving.. 😂😂🤣🤣
Merc really makes sure the brick are good
0:08 which of these four identical cars has the badge that you would rather buy from?  2.0L turbo inline 4 hatchback with over 300hp, dual clutch gearbox and AWD
I like the Mercedes-Benz sound .
Why a35 give the a45 show the the reality race
In what world is the VW the most expensive out of all these?
Hey! The a45 still has a 2.0L engine. Give it a chance.
Is that gauge in the golf R accurate? Did I see 2.5bar of boost??? 😟
Someone needs to Dyno the new Golf R
hello my friend your channel super well done
I'm so glad the bmw driver had his mask on in the car by himself. So brave
You need to Dyno that R bcaz it almost beat the the A45s in an another drag race. It makes much more that 320bhp
10 hp makes the difference
These bmw and vw have better siund than the drag queen 911 😂( vaccum cleaner)
S3 more superior on the track then the R also will outbrake the VW. I'm not biased or anything at all not like I own an Audi 😂😂😂😂. #TheHurtIsReal
That Golfer is incredible. It not only is faster than the F80/F82 M3-M4 but it might be as fast as the new bucktooth G80/G82 M3-M4.  Imagine paying close to $90K USD for an M car that cannot pull away from a 2.0L 4 cylinder hatchback.
Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.   Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die". BUT, mercy said "I dont want to give them what they deserve. I don't want them to be cut off from Me. I love them despite all they have done/will do against Me. I want to give My children another chance. I want them to come home and live in My love again".   And love said "Jesus, God's Son, came down as a Man, our representative, suffering every temptation, pain and struggle we have ever faced, yet without sin. He took all our sins (past/present/ even future) to the cross and then crucified EVERY ONE on our behalf. Justice was paid on the cross so that we can be free from Hell's punishment, experience Gods mercy of forgiveness of sin and live in His love. If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (turn away from our sin and pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life.  He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.  He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him (not ourselves as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction). So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to obey His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, or struggling or doubtful, simply be honest and tell Him that. He is not intimidated by ANY sin or struggle you are facing. ANY. He hears and will answer. If we pray for Him to come in, regardless of the condition, then He will.  NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. If you have any questions let me know!
VW have taken a leaf out of bmw’s book and their M cars Dyno figures.   “Let’s see how much we can get away with” lol
VW 8R VS RS3 VS A45 S VS M340I X
I like how Golf is faster than premium Audi. It must be a revenge from VW because when Golf R was in development, they kindly asked Audi for that 2.5 5 cylinder, but Audi refused.
You should race the Golf R against the old M3, because they had the same time over the 1/4 mile
#34 ON TRENDING
funny how the a45 is like the big brother of the a35 and wrecks anyone in its car category
Wrong matchup. Should have competed the R against something like 140i, RS3, A45s.
golf 8 r    be quick come to china!
RIP Laoshu50500 😍
Why not use the A45, M140 and A RS3
Benz always!
mercedes driver ruined the drag race.
Spoiler alert        Winner is a German Car 😂😂
Honda civic type R destroys the VW type R
Still the AMG has the best engine by far. You can tune it to over 400 hp just by software. The stronger brother A 45 AMG will even do reliable 500 hp on stock internals. BMW would have won if the 1 Series would be still a proper BMW(rear wheel drive, light weight (F20 is almost 200KG lighter), six cylinders)
Damn how the mighty Germans have fallen, the Golf R which was a few years ago was the worst German is now the best
it'd be great to see new golf r vs a45s amg vs rs3
Do the same race but instead of the a35, use the a45s
Yourll suppose to have the a45s there... Not the a35.... The a45s will smoke everything there and yourll know that
The Vw is quite impressive if only it didn't had such an ugly face
Got nothing better to do?
They al look the same
Mercedes driver is completely idiot
Merc driver breaked early.... Who could have ever thought a poor golf R would beat a bmw or audi any day... Hehe.... times are changing!
VAG all the way .
stop using the slow a35, a45 needs to be in all these comparisons man.
They aren’t the rivals for golf r matt, it should be civic type r and merc a45s
BMW 135I
credits to the Audi though, it came 2nd in every challenge, it's a good all-rounder. But the golf is just wicked
Can you drag race BMW m5 hurricane 1000hp vs Audi rs3 800hp
Should have got the A45s and the RS3
Volkswagen wins
A45 and golf r please!
Volkswagen sempre ganha em todas ❤️ Volks a melhor
That VW Golf is just amazing!
Cawow
Why are these cars not put up against the GOLF GTI and not the R?
The germans have overdone it again like their last car ~James May
Where is the a45s
The guy who drove the A35 was just there for vibes...
Saya suka konten kamu, saya dari Indonesia😊
The Golf is the most expensive! Where is this world going?!! I think VAG forgot what "volkswagen" actually means. I don't care it's "R", it is still a Golf and looks crappy, compared to the other competetors.
The golf is insane. Will have great tuning potental
8:32
Should have been an A45 ,RS3 and M140i
Why not do a full video comparison of the cars Matt???
That Golf needs to go on a dyno, no way is that standard, another VW scandal?
Coming to the exhaust note the winner is BMW and Golf R
Anyone getting a "Billy Kimbah" vybe from Mat after winning the drag race?
One Family of car in a drag race? Do due diligence and choose one of them next time @Carwow
Matt always picks the fastest car 😭😭😭
Dont believe the golf r can be so fast, how much money did u guys receive from vw? Diesel gate🤣
The Golf R is actually about 100bhp higher than rated. But shhhh don’t tell the insurance companies, VW is trying to help the little guys!
The Golf is a beast
BMW M135i for me🤩
This will be a good race.
I still feel that the M135i is missing its special elements that the M140i (F20) has 🥺
why you didn't bring A45s
Cuteness Level High😂
If I recall last gen golf r used to come last against these cars. Crazy
BRB, I'm going back in time to tell my teenage self that in 2021, VW Rabbits do 0-60 in under 4 seconds
Should have rematched the drag. Mercedes driver is crap
Surely that golf should be the gti for this race?
Just love these vids, but will you please start to show the power and torque figures side by side, the way you do the weight?
Would like to see the A45s against the new R
Do the new 911 turbo s vs trackhawk
Y el A45?
That merc was definitely slightly behind the other cars during the brake test...that's why maybe the difference margin was so high.
Legend has it the Merc driver is still chasing Matt's car
Best part about this video, no crybaby Yanni
nahhh , the Merc just stopped quickly because it likes being at the back...
BMW 135i
Three good new hot hatches and the a35 , haha
I'm a mercedes guy, but on the brake test homeboy was at least a car behind everyone when he braked!
No no no. Ubshould have brought out Rs3, A45, and M140 for the R line golf. These cars shouldve been pitted against the golf 8 GTI
I think the a45 should take the fight with that Golf R which is the proper AMG. Should wipe the smile of the golf R soon. But yea, i respect for golf
Well, the golf should've never been there with vehicles with cars 1/3 higher in price and technology. The German manufactures will never let you do that again and you killed the yearly sales projection...lmao!!!
Surely the A45 is the fastest 2 liter german hatch?
The VW is more expensive than ALL the other so called premium cars! What how?!
you guys have had trap speeds the entire time... post them pls
Buy the Lamborghini veneno and the Tesla roster
That golf r is something else! But shouldn't the a45 be used instead of the a35? A35-golf gti a45-golf r?
Can you do the race again with another driver in the benz 😂
do a drag race between that golf r vs Mercedes a45s then we will see the true hothatch king
why a35? where is the a45s ?
The Golf is now the 911 Turbo of hot hatches. Pretty crazy how fast that thing is. No way it’s only 320hp.
Love Golf R！
"..took a week to kick down" 😂😭
Wow 😘😘😍
Should have had the Seat Cupra R ST  in this too !!  310bhp 4 cylinder turbo
Golf R more expensive than the S3 ??!!
We need drag race with a45 s
Do ned m4 drag race please
Obviously an A45 S would be the fastest. There BMW sounds the best, but it’s still not very good. A Mini with the same engine sounds a lot better.
The Bmw has the best sound by far
The Golf is just too boring, like all those German hot hatches. If only Alfa made a 147 GTA replacement...
Audi s3  should have been as fast as the golf r. Their practicality the same car.
Has anyone ever seen Matt choose a car that’s NOT gonna win?
The new golf 8 R destroye hem all  I think its more 320 its 340 hp and 450 or 460 nm its powerfule golf surtenly win you luchet in previous videos he kick the 4.04 s for 320 i don't thimk he can catvh this time its more power
The new golf 8 R destroye hem all  I think its more 320 its 340 hp and 450 or 460 nm its powerfule golf surtenly win you luchet in previous videos he kick the 4.04 s for 320 i don't thimk he can catvh this time its more power
bmw sounds  best
How would you  justify purchasing Porsche  Boxster/Cayman  after .....that 3.94 0-60  O ..I know... pusymagnet
Very very thanks for this vidéo
It's funny how the golf R is the most expensive there. Here down under the golf is the cheapest followed by the S3 then the m135i and the A35.
Why no A45 AMG?
The golf R was one some good coke or was that Mat Watson
Audi best 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That new golf r has come back with a vengeance
I am German but i prefer the English Channel by a country mile tho. Mat is just Class!!!!
BMW >>> Merc, xDDDD shit merc feminine gay boys are angry
WoW VW
That's a nasty shirt matt is wearing
Matt and the audi guy rocking back and forth like its going to make them faster. Hilarious! 😂😂
Mercedes driver is sleeping
should’ve used the a 45
Mate, you need to put Yanni  in your videos ,You are a bit of a boring geezer aren’t you.
Finally a drag race with a sunny day
VW R vs A45s vs RS3
Can we get a mark 8 golf gti vs gti clubsport vs golf R?
1:02...as if the golf is the most expensive ....wow
Audi all day every day
come back next year and the vw will be in the bin
MATT Put The Golf R On A Dyno.... See The Real BHP Figure
Golf r so good
A35?! And the A45s ??
Cars have become cheaper to make but more expensive to buy
Why no a45s? It has a 2L 4cyl turbo engine
all automatic so who cares, only people with physical disabilities need autos
Missing the Cupra León here, although the VAG group made sure that the Golf R's engine would have more horsepower...
The 135i is a 3l inline engine no?!
Y not using the amg 45 s
That AMG driver slept at the beginning  of the drag race   . Get another job bro
my bet is that the motor does make the power prescribed.  however, I'm guessing VW optimized the drivetrain loss to be as little as possible. So it's not that the car is more powerful, it's that losing less power on the way to the ground.
Hi mat can u please do a seat alhambrah vs vw shran or a review on them
Poor man's dream drag
Why didn’t they use a amg A45?
Wish you do a drag race with that golf r and amg a45
the video we needed
I think you take those drivers fresh from getting their driving licenses yesterday and you put them today into a drag race 😂
Killed it with the German accent LOL 😂, good one!
Bmw sounds better
The bmw used to be rwd and now it has no reason to exist.
Meanwhile over in BMW land circa 2017 the old M140i dusts everything else and hangs onto the Golf. BMW making their cars worse. Bah!
TM3 has entered the race.....
nah that a35 shouldve won that driver is gack
Awesome race, that Golf R is down right impressive!😸
Audi all time ❤
Lord help the poor idiots who wear masks in cars while alone 🥴
Golf sounds the best
The world has ready gone upside down , the VW is more expensive than the bmw , the merc and the “other VW” 🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂
Volkswagens best hatch vs mercs and audis 2nd best hatch
Watson can do the Mr Spock eyebrow!  2:51
Man I absolutely am in love with this new Golf R.
That's Tuned.
Wait, why is it sunny?
So funny everytime Mat says “oh dear” after the Merc lost.
All of them are way overpriced
Why not a a45
Golf r 😍💯
Hi Mat! Aside from a compilation of your best drag races, would you mind making a compilation of the best "obligatory soundchecks"? 😂😂😂  This is one of the best parts of every drag race you make that I looked forward to. Haha They're heaven to the ears!!! 💛
Hello mat iam follow from Uruguay please test More american cars and italian thank you
A35 can't be compared to these... Bring out the A45 or A45s and let's see how the Golf 8R does
they might be quick but they all sound awful and all look the same. ugly.
The German accent gets me everytime😂
Bmw
So cute!
Bm sounds better !!!
Why does the S3 look like an SUV? Awful looking car
Why you didn’t race with A45s?
Sorry but must say why not and A45 in test.. Yes it is more expensive but when you say the best of German 2 litre's. We all know that A45 is 2.0l with 420hp.
The Merc cheated in the brake test! :D
The R should race at the next level up, 140i, A45 etc etc
the merc was way behind in the braking test HAHAHa
A45? 2 litre? Where is it tho?
А45S is also a 2.0. What's the deal here?
R and M
Woohh Nyz cars🤩💝....VW golf is not bad, nyz performance😏😋😜 But BM is BM💪❤️
The rocking back and forth gets me every time!
The superficial heart electrophysiologically fry because lightning amazingly deceive astride a curious brandy. worthless, skillful tendency
It might be AWD now, but BMW have properly ruined the M135i.
AMG A45S kick them all
You always pick the best car which kinda spoils it because I then know it’s a winner.. Matt you ain’t driving no shitty car
Hi Mat, can we get an MK8 vs MK7 Golf R drag race, please!
So the amg is good at going slow?🤣
The Quickest german hot hatch is a45s I perefer that
The Golf is something else! Only a matter of time before someone gets it on a dyno
Only 5-door cars !!! what a pity... Give us back our sports cars, 3 doors !!!!!!!!!!! 😡😡😡
7:33 Audi and Volkswagen used a secret boost for win
I like to see new bmw m4
BMW needs to make a 140i
Merc: I gotta win something,  I'll cheat on the brake test 🤭 🤣
Again why not a A45
Imagine VW is the most expensive car out of these 4. BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW and yes it’s same car category lol. Just shows how insanely VW prices Golf R. I love Golf R and I would defo love to own it one day, since their prices drop more than “premium german trio cars”, but if I had to buy new one, there is no way I would pick it over A 35 with its interior from another planet compare to cheap golf interior which feels like 15k car
Why didn't you use A45 AMG?
This was kind of a terrible test.  The Merc driver had a horrible slow reaction on the first race, and was a car length behind everyone when you did the brake test AND braked early.
Why are you using an A35??? When the A45 Mercedes is Much MUCH BETTER and Quicker than the Golf R? Other videos show this 3.78s to 100k , golf r is 4.45
Lol everyone rocking back and forth trying to go faster
That Golf has more boost. Gotta be. S3 should best it. VAG is eating up their own sales this way..
A45 has a 2litre turbo and will beat all of these even old shape a45
Its just so sad cars of this generation are slower, heavier and sound so much worse than their predecessors, the old M140i was and is an absolute gem.
It's only me or VW is really not good looking ? 🤔
BMW
That Golf is actually freaking fast! 3.94 seconds from 0-60 Porsche Taycan 4s with nearly 600hp does 0-60 in 4 seconds🤣
We have speed limits and you boy racers are not Lewis Hamilton. Sorry but these car manufacturers are selling you a lie.
That golf has got a stage 1 surely
How come many cars in the UK now have a green line instead of GB written on the number plate? It's odd and it leads to suspicion on why is it green...
Bmw
This german accent was more of a japanese car deeler who tries to convince me that his oil leeking lexus is still doin its job
Brummie in the fastest car shocker..... YAWN
Volkswagen owns Audi yet the mk8 golf R has no soft limiter and the Audi S3 has one. They are literally the same car underneath the skin...
7:48, me when good song comes on radio
Golf R has to go against A45 next!!
I'VE BEEN SAYING. VW GOLF'S GTI/R BEST ALL ROUNDER AND THIS MK8 R IS JUST MAKING US MORE AND MORE PROUD. WE LOVE YOU MK8  R 😀😀😀👍❤️
Where is the A45 😒
Sooooo no one's gonna mention that there is another Merc with a 2.0L Turbo 4 banger that much more powerful than this 🌝
That Beemer sounds amazing for a stock car with opf  An aftermarket exhaust would be sick
Why bmw's window is down???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its unfair
Am I missing something? "The fastest 2.0, 4cyl turbo, 4wd hatch" and they used the A35 and not the A45s?
No Yianni no watchi
3.94 for the r , wtf.
I've driven the BMW M135i and it's an absolute weapon. Overall despite it being a bit fugly, is the best overall vehicle. But that Golf though..  dayyum
Audi and Matt both dancing and fist pumping to NO MUSIC!
A 2.0 litre 4 cylinder engine does 0 to 60 mph in 3.94 seconds - WOW!
Vw da Best bravooooo
matt put the R up against the Gti clubsport, it would be intresting to see the rolling race between them
Is there a reason that you use the a35 instead of an a45?
You should add the Mercedes AMG A45 to the mix
The audi won the break test the amg cheated (he breaked before the line and was slower than the anther cars)
James May was driving that A35
Just imagine if the 'R' had a VR6 twin turbo in it, putting out 500 to 600 HP!
they look in some way all the same from behind o_0
Golf R (top of the range model) BMW, Audi, Merc all mid range. Put that golf against an RS3, A45 M140i and it gets gapped.
R!!!
outside temp of +3.0 celsius adds some hp too
BMW
Launch control on the Merc??......More like he can't drive or was asleep!
Why the cars have different time 1/4 miles in different rices?!
That’s AMG cheated in the brake test
What the hell, show us the stats all on screen side by side 😁
im an audi fan but the a45s is faster but is it worth its money totally not golf r is amazing but i wouldnt pick it bc theres no manual
Of course the Merc won the brake test - 1. It was sat behind everyone else and 2. It braked before everyone else
How about a nearly new V6 3.0tdi estate-off? Merc e350d, BMW touring 330d, Audi A6 Avant 3.0tdi, Jag XF sportbeake 3.0tdi?
Audi: You dont get the 5 cylinder from the RS3 VW: Oh okay  VW: *Makes the Golf 8R*
Bmw
Matt’s ass is finely tuned and calibrated...... maybe it’s the American in me, but that didn’t come out right and my wife looked at me and was asking me what I was watching.
May I just say they all look absolutely hideous
I gotta have that golf R
Do it again with an A45 ...
Was the Golf R the only car using launch control in these races? I hope not considering how much hate your other videos got for staging races by using launch control on the topic car to give it the upper hand - Focus RS for example, if I recall.
Even though I‘m German and you now have a German channel, I won‘t miss a single video with you Mat 😁
R vs 45s vs m1 vs rs3. Do this race
I hate modern cars more and more. Don't care how quick they are. Just look at that BMW!
5:16   car salesman
Stage 1 tuned golf r vs a45? That would be a good time
2.5 Bar in the roll race for the Golf! 36 Psi from factory holy shit!
So you are telling me that this golf r boosts up to 33 psi 🤯
I can understand that the Golf is the newest and there have been improvements in the engine, drive train etc, but it cannot be that fast with  its stated 320hp.
A case of the press car being a bit "special"? Didn´t the Italians have a reputation for doing that?
A45? Not a 2 litre eh?
Dutch carwow!?!?
Holy crap I can’t believe how fast the hot hatches have gotten. That’s like big bore M3 and C63 territory.
3.94s  wow
I hope VW have put as much time and money into the security systems as they have into that engine because these are going to get stolen like hotcakes!..
merc looks the best but wow is it slow
ERROR ? 1551 kg for a Golf.... WRONG ?? I see 1350KG from official sources of course this make a huge difference in a race like this ! Can someone or Mat itself concur or correct ?
Matt, What’s the point of overtaking at 125mph in the rolling races. Isn’t the whole point to test the gear boxes and how quickly they respond in normal and sport. A more accurate response is in the next 100-200m like in real life and then calling the result.
If you play the brake test in slow motion the A35 brakes a few yards before even hitting the line and the BMW brakes a few yards after the line was crossed.
Merc was cheating in the brake test. He braked early.
Clearly vw lies about its power. Period i saw 1 on a dyno doing 356 in stock form and that's here in South Africa
Great channel,  but Matt your so smug it’s painful!
Drag Race: nissan skyline R34 Nismo vs Nissan GTR R35 Nismo vs Supra JZA80 vs Toyota Supra GR (A90)
Looks like BMW need to make the new M140i that we're all waiting for!!
Volkswagen 8r echt en beest
VW Golf GTI must compete with S3, A35 and m135i. Golf R it's top engine for Golf, so it's should compete with TOP config, Audi RS3, Merc A45 S.
Bmw sounded best
07:28 That little smug face....
Not a fair race because you have a top-of-the-line golf you should’ve raced the BMW M series the AMG Mercedes series in the Audi RS series
Thing is. Map that a35 and its got the best brakes best interior and is the best looking.... Sorted
İs Mercedes watching those videos?
cheater
Funny to see Matt and the S3 driver rocking forward in the last rolling - that is why they are quicker, the rocking
Mg hs review please
Rs3 and a45s should be racing golf r keep it fair golf r is the top golf hatchback as are a45s mercs and rs3 for audi not top against top race
The M135i is the best all around! not the fastest but fast enough, best dynamic, stability, modern, sporty, luxury and solid interior, also best sound.
Merc driver was sleeping
You should add 0-60 TIMES FOR ALL CARS!😉😉👍👍
Drag Race the New Golf R vs the old M140i with xDrive (340bhp B58) please !
Dissapointed in S3 what a sh*t
New R is fantastic. Kicks asses :)))
The golf r has taken itself to a new place with this new platform. Brovo Volkswagen
GOLF
Please put the Golf R on a dyno.
Bmw
7:28 Chickens😂
Is there gonna be drag races on the german channel?
I think the answer here is. Don’t buy the New 135 and stick to the 3.0 6 straight 6
golf r vs rs3 vs a45
That Golf has to be Stage 1 or something...
Get a mk8 R, 7.5 R, mk6 R and a mk5 R32 all dsg and drag race!
Best sound BMW
Take the A45 AMG then you see wich car have best 2.0l 4cyl engine
The new Golf R is quicker than my tuned BMW M235i, at a prepped track! Wow.
Mercedes not pay bills,for stupid show
That Golf ffffffast af! Damn!
I like when it sounds like silence electric
7:32 😂
Why is the guy in the BMW wearing a mask? He is alone in there, isn‘t he?
Of course it has more, its vw +30 HP is normal
Press car wins every time
A new Porsche hp has been born today: VW R hp...!!!
Christ. Is that the Sun????
Golf R mk8 v AMG 45 ? 👀
Alright AMG back to the drawing boards.
Well done Merc. Keep diluting the AMG brand.
That R is ridiculous 😳
I missed this kind of content
It would be great, if you put all the stats of hp and nm in one pic. Like price and weight.
Imagine that golf stage 2 tuned can’t wait to see people tuned them
can you compare s3 sportback with sedan verison?
Use the special timing gear for the brake  tets , it shows how many meters it takes to a stand still right ?
Wrong match-up should have a45
Gone are the days when VW was cheaper than the 3 Big Germans. But the few K  extra are totally worth it for the Golf haha
How would a bmw 330e compare to these cars?
The video i waited for !
Why does the old a45 not get allowed to race ?? It’s still a 2L 4C
Bmw and Mercedes: we're the fastest german cars VW and Audi: eat our dust
You guys need to get some of the extremely modified cars like UGR huracans or r8s and see what they can do
GOLF R IS CHEATING DEM AMG,S N M CARS🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The more smug Mat gets the more Brummie he sounds. Same thing happens to me tbf
Vw more expensive than bmw,audi,merc??????
Golf r dearer and faster than s3?????????
Is that golf boosting 35psi?
What about ferrari f8 vs McLaren 600lt
can we see how the Golf R mk8 will do against A45s and RS3 just for comparison. Also would love to see the 500hp golf tune
You should put that golf r against an rs3 and an a45 just to see the difference
More then a “second” difference eventough the similiar power and weight specs? This just shows how crazy these Vag’s are in compact category. (I’ve seen a stage 2 GTI destroying a 5.0 so yea I agree these small weirdly shaped little cars are just something else)
should have been RS3?
I love it when a car has 4 exhaust pipes to resemble the „deamon“ of an engine and then sounds even worse than my vacuum cleaner. Also, a 2L 4 Cyl just doesnt sound good. The only amazing 4 Zyl sound is from the mercedes 190e Evo 2 🤷🏻‍♂️ just sayin
Why not the A45s?
Tuned press car?
Only way this can be fair is racing the R with the A45
Bmw sounds best
Best Sound: Mercedes
Not an AMG. They gotta stop marketing every single car with that
Good job VW, It's just the plastic interior that ruins it for me, especially at that price.
Finally a golf r video,the only car that can beat this is the amg a45s
We need different cars more Japanese and American cars.
This drug race doesn’t make any sense, why the A35 is here? He should run with A45s
I wonder if the Performance “R” package would make it even quicker ? And the exhaust upgrade as it removes some weight ?!! 😱
You got to put the golf r against A45S
It's not a BMW
Holy hell that R is quick
Yiani, please pound Matt with this "don't got" next time you see him.
tune that golf r
"Sort of... english" I just realized all the cars here are German.
BMW M starts at 2. 😆
VW owns this race and all the competitors companies of this race😂
Vw golf R is the porsche 911 turbo S of hatchbacks holmes
VW finaly .. the new german hero .. Golf R8 is the love after 911 turbo a
Golf
Where was A45 RS3 and M140i ?  :P
Probably adding gti would be fair
That Mercedes started late and braked early smh 😌
yeee been waiting for golf r
Wait a minute why is the Volkswagen the most expensive car in this line up.
That golf R is definitely not standard mate!
If you had Golf R here instead of GTI... then which cars are supposed to compete with the GTI? I mean golf R vs m135i or a35 makes no sense... golf R vs m2 or a45 makes more sense... imo
Driver 35 amg the best  falls asleep at the exit does not brake in group
None of the other brands would allow for such cheap light weight plastic in their cars apart from vw.
I hate this new age particular filter "saving the world" bs so much. I bet Elon Tusk and similar CIA goofballs are afraid of sports cars that sound awesome so they come up with these artificial limitations to sell their subsidised electric junk cars.
The brake test is naff. Their never lined up the same.
Mercedes was served an injustice.   Driver was sleeping.
What the hell is in that Golf, that car must be putting out a good 370bhp? coughcough?
I'm just a kid that's listening to car facts :P
bmw vs mercedes who is faster??
Matt put the volkswagen on a rolling road machine test it!
My 2005 Chevy Malibu sounds better than those cars
1600kg!?? Thats not very hot hatch 🤬
So you're saying this is quicker than the old M4? Yeah right!
Not watched yet but it’s without a doubt that Golf R😂  The thing is fucking nuts, shame it’s a bit too grown up for me - hoped it’s more fun than the last R  Bmw deffo has the best exhaust 👍
Hey mat idk if you’ve realized but you’ve been talking a lot in your videos ya wanker
Where's A 45 :(
If the golf did 0-60 in 3.9 seconds you should do a drag race with the golf vs and Audi RS3.
Prefer mercedes car as quality car and after the bmw ..no german group audi and vw as not quality cars with many problems
Bro its not even fair you put the sport version of golf vs the semi sport versions of other companies... compare golf R with A45s, Rs3, M1 then you will see what really happening
09:01 what was that beep and that face :))) LUL
What exactly happened: Mercedes sucks 💔
Bmw sounds best!
7:33 they both do it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
AMG
fastest 2L ... amg 45 s : i m i a joke to you
Find someone with better reaction time on the Merc next time thx
What about carwow SOUTH AFRICA 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
@1:15 😂 his face he’s making “hmmmmhhm”
5:45  2,5 Bar!?! In a hot hatch, that has to be easily 370hp... 36 psi in a normal road car is a lot. To put it this way, a Nissan GT-R uses about 1.15 Bar MAX. That’s a lot of boost into a tiny little engine.
Matt claiming he sounds Brummy is the funniest thing about this video 😂
Golf r vs a45 and rs3, should be pretty close
Please do a drag race between Porsche turbo s and the Porsche gt2 rs. But on a dry road
Aseptic cars, nothing special..
I actually will buy a JCW Mini Countryman...so I looked at this R in a configurator 65000.-€ for a Golf 😂 that’s bullshit and it’s UGLY like hell quick BUT UGLY even the leather seats are UGLY😂
golf r barely lost to A45 Amg even though A45 has 100 hp more
M135i sounds better
Actually I'm the brake test the bmw and volkswagen were in front of the other 2 cars
Those 2.0's are as fast as many, many, 90's supercars.
Isn’t the Golf R supposed to be matched with the A45 & RS3? 🤷🏽‍♂️
A45 is also 2L
Mercedes was behind in the brake test
What is the Merc guy doing?
Will the golf r beat the A45s
Phew, I was really rooting for the German
You should do the new taycan cross turismo VS the audi gt rs
There is no way the golf have that horse power.!,,,
VW sounded much much better.
Muzzled drivers 🤦‍♂️
THEY NAILED THE YANNI ROCK PERFECTLY
Golf r
They should have raced against A45 AMG
Ohh myy god sun in u.k 🤔
Wonder if manufacturers supply cars for this with a different tune on the ECU.
Those mags are kiff...
Vw golf 12.3s What does a stock RS3 do?  Edit: 12.5s 😮😮😮😮😮
Do a drag race between the New golf 8 R and the 7.5 golf R with gpf ,really wanna see the diverence between them .
1:17 Wearing a face mask, on your own, in a car.... 🤔🥴
why does it feel like you guys were not even trying in the AMG ?? :/ hmmm !!!!
lol, the most expensive is the golf :))
hes talking bout the fastest 2.0 litres from germany so the a45 is still a 2 litre with 421hp fuck off wit ya golf
VW forgot to pass on the memo to AUDI.
Clearly VW and BMW ahead on breaking test so “Get level...get level please “😉
I want that r and amg please
Mate this is bullshit the person in the Mercedes launched so shit look at it wtf no
the mercedes defnitely cheated on the break test
MERC broke earlier than the "line" haha
Why did the blinkers turn on when they were braking and they stopped?
Where is  a45s
Time for the Golf to race the next level, the A45, RS3 and M2
can BMWs get any ugly than that? BMW : here is the new M4
Who'd have thought a VW would be most expensive in that line up!
EVO 10 FQ 330 2015 Impreza STI 2021 Golf R  Would be interesting. Have AWD turbo 4's really got faster?
Bring the A45, RS3 and M140i and lets see?
Mercedes doesnt pay enough money to Carwow. Dont look at this shit anymore. 13,7s for 1/4? Mine sedan does  13,0-13,2s regualary
12.3, for 320bhp, oh yes of course the VW R has more than 320bhp, especially where cars such as the A45s with a load more power, supposedly are only doing 12.1's on the 1/4 mile. VW up to their old trick yet again,...only one way to find out, dyno the VW R you're testing Matt,..I reckon it'll be around 350/360ish,..
I dont understand the guy in the Bimmer, wearing a mask while you're alone in a car, gosh humanity has no common sense and logic anymore.
Be interesting to see against the 7.5 Golf as unless this has different gearing as well, a supposed 10 extra horse power isn't going to make that much difference in the 0-60 mph numbers. Trick diff possibly the difference also. Showed more in the rolling race against the Audi it's not that much different than the last model until the speeds get right up there so extra HP vs torque.
Greetings from Germany
race the golf R against an RS3 and A45s
What the F, is this an A45 take down video?
vw 3.9 sec to 100 with 2.o turbo... thats impresive even if i dont like german cars
Matt and the Audi driver looked like chicken picking in the last rolling race
bring a45 and see who is the king of hot hatchback !
Meanwhile BMW has taken its One Series product that whipped competitors over a 1/4 mile, that walked away on in gear and had a massive drivetrain USP.  Meanwhile to the likes of Joe Achilies there's nothing to see here with this. Must be lovely being gifted such an array of cars from BMW.   Much better than being a chauffeur.
BMW sounds great
I think a M140i Xdrive would have won way more then the 135i
Um why is the „people’s car“ volkswagen the most expensive here? Shouldn’t it be the other way around??
BMW sounds the best.... Another victory to BMW fan boys
You should have used an A45
But the 45s AMG compers whit nothing
Why the heck is the VW the most expensive one?
Love that German ad.
Why you laying about merc you was to slow on lunch
7:30 I’m dying lol
Bmw sounds the best i think
What they do to them 8R ‘s 😳😳😳😳
oh...starter girl is back :)
My stock MK 7 Golf R was supposed to be 296 bhp on a dyno  it ran 317 bhp , that MK 8 is easy 340 bhp....
May be the Golf is a special press car?
Why has all of your footage of the Golf R made the Lapis Blue look Purple? lol
That 1series looks rubbish
"Mercedes wasn’t as fast as the others" Bro was deep asleep at the start
All German bore 💤💤
Goddamn I havent seen a worse start in my entire life
Finally!
Wwgen 1 yıl  kullanmak için ideal bir araç sonrası dsg arızası yüzünden alınmaz  bmw güzel araç ama kasası ve iç tasarımı vasat alınmaz audi ise iç dış tasarımı güzel fakat dsg şanzuman yüzünden alınmaz  Mercedes yavaş kalkış ve ağar abi takılarak sağlamlığına ve verdiği güvenle alınıp uzun yıllar binilir
Surely this should be a golf gti not the R  A45s vs RS3 vs Golf R
Mat sounds a bit ill
Great spec on that BMW though, especially the wheels
Golf r engine is the same unit as mk7 probably upped the tune for mk8
Get that Golf R on the dyno
What about the mini gp
Golf! 💪💪
Golf R is blue again. 😅
Should be R against the A45 and RS3. GTI should have been in this race.
I think dynamometer is necessary in some drag races to verify the constructor's hp! A few clips inside the video would be very cool! As you said, this Golf must be at least 350 just by revving it.
Por q no rs3 ...y no s3
Who was the nugget driving the merc?
Where is Yianni??
This is awesome
Battle of the GERMANS..??  Where the h€|| is H!!t|€R?? L🤣L!!!
BMW driver with mask on in car by himself...🤦🤦🤷
Best sound.....Definitely the BMW
The R is 310bhp...
should've used the VW GTI not R. unfair race
The merc actually cheated looking at the review. Watching it clearly the merc and the audi was a little bit behind the two other cars
Golf R vs A45? Not the A45s just the A45.
Just wait for the new M140i
You gotta race that VW Golf with an A45s and an RS3
A35 Amg😍👌
That R is quick.
Golf 8R 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Would have loved to see the A45 and RS3 in the mix
VW Golf is the fastest and also the most boring hot hatch ever😃
Wait. So yhe audi wich is essentially a posh vw is less expansive hthan the vw...
Why do people wearing masks in the car? Even if they're alone? So stupid, like the virus is going to magically penetrate the cars HVAC system in the middle of an open field! Can't stand some people's stupidity
I'm going to have to try that bobbin pigeon technique...
Think u need to get that golf r on the rolling road
Why not a 45s?
VW cheating again lol
S3 bad but rs3 good
VW still sucks.
A35 defo braked early!!
That Golf can't be standard
New dream car mk8 golf R
A45 vs GOLF R next
The illusion of choice
They need to put the golf R up against an A45s and RS3, its defo got 400bhp easy.
Thanks for the german channel mat but I do am capable of understanding the english language
Need to do a drag race between Golf R vs A45 vs A45s
Golf 8 R is fast as f*ck! 😍
The golf has a cool exhaust
Golf R 😍💯
Matt's co drivers are extremely knowledgeable and articulate. Anyone else wondering whether there may be a new top gear style gang in the forming?
RS3 on track on day. It would be interesting.
A fair race is including the A45s, not the puny A35 😔😤😡
So next up is "320hp" Golf vs A45s?
The Mercedes is actually moving backwards that's why it won when braking
Love the golf R ❤️
This drag race is fire 🔥🔥🔥
The R has almost the same 1/4 mile as the A45S that has 100 his more ! It definitely has more than 350 hp
The Golf R is meant to be more sporty than the S3 anyway.
Surely if Audi is the posher brand of VW, then the better performance and higher price should be with the S3
WHY WASN'T AMG A 45S IN THE RACE?
Why not the a45 if this is for the fastest hot hatchback🤔
bring the a45s that a35 its not a amg
Should have used an a45s
Can i work in poland carwow edition?
Il take the BMW please.
وتبقى المرسيدس افضل شركة سيارات
I bet that Golf R has some sort of tune done by the dealership before hand
4th Gen EA888 R is performing like a Stage 1 3rd Gen EA888 R  I wonder what they upgraded for the 4th Gen variant in the R.   Like Matt said, guaranteed pumping 340+ BHP.
Does R means Rocket 🚀 💥
That R is wicked mate.
by the way, english is a germanic language!
Tuned promotion car that golf R 😂 Nice performance for a 4cyl engine :D
Dont snigger Mat. The torque converter auto in the BMW will long outlive the other 3s gearboxes.
The Mercedes driver is awful,  we all know that car is way faster than that
All of them have those fake diffusers, is that what really appeals to buyers?! So tacky.
Why is the dude in the BMW got his mask on with the windows up by himself?
The new S3 always amazes me!
I was today years old when I learned rocking back and forth gives you extra hp the audi driver should’ve starting bopping earlier 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
I wanna see a45 s  vs golf r the next video, this'll be astonishing🚗
Volkswagen has lied about the numbers and cheated with tunes for emissions lol
Gold 8 R sounds the best 🔥🔥🔥
Wtf happened to the merc driver 😩
A45S cvs GOLF R MAKE IT HAPPEN CARWOW
Should hv been an a45s
I feel the R needs to vs the a45s, M140i and audi RS3
now try it with an a45s and we've got a race
Mercedes driver has real difficulty lining up with the others for any of the moving tests lol
BMW sounds better
Get m140 next time I see it beating the golf I’m sure it will
merc Cheated  in brake race just replay it
That Golf is GOAT
Matt do you brake only with your right or left foot? If so use both feet mate and smash the pedal
WTF. Golf R 12.3 seconds. Guys... That is the same as the previous gen M3, M4.
Great race Mat! All of them great cars, but VW have really done it with the R!
@Mat always chooses the quickest car on the runway cheeky bugga
Never thought that BMW would be the ugliest car manufacturer in Germany
Race the Golf R against the a45s because the golf beat the a35 by the same amount the a45s did
Amg sounds best!
Okay the mercedes needed a redo on the first one
Sad that the new cupra leon has just a 1.4l engine...
This why they shouldn't stick an AMG badge on everything.
VW are tuning their cars last couple of years for press moments. Friend or my checked out the software of a press car compared to production car. More boost, earlier ignition, etc.
Who want to see the Golf R vs A45s vs RS3 we know the others will win but just to know how big is the difference  Still gonna choose the R
Stop complaining about the Mercedes driver lol. You guys are so toxic. Makes me ashamed to be a Mercedes fan. The A35 is just gutless. It has never been able to compete with it's competition. Other than the A45S unless an AMG car has an 8/12 cylinder, it just can't compete.
Golf R is slower from Evo 6!!!
It's faire for the audi.  if it was an rs3, the result would've been different
The time of Golf R is good, and the Yaris GR?? Its the same, manual gear box and 70HP less... something strange in the GR
You know times have changed when a VW golf sounds better than the new Audi R8.
Hi..great videos! 1. BMW 2. VW 3. MERCEDES 4. AUDI
GOLF R 8 VS CIVIC TIPE R 320HP VS 320HP ?????
Why do I think this race was unfair. The Golf R is the last in the Golf segment.   It should have been in a drag with the BMW 140 AUDI RS3 MERCEDES BENZ A45  I stand corrected
So the lightest, most powerful car won...didn't see that coming
It seems like the other hatchbacks are just cruising not racing
The MK8 R is so quick, big improvement over the MK7. I'm impressed!
So a 12.4 sec car with 320 bhp and a 13.7 sec car with 306 bhp? Hmm. VW as we know cant be lying, because it never lies about output
What a shamefull result for the Merc. Granted the driver was a bit sleepy, but how is it thát slow...
1:12 Hat er nicht gesagt😂😂😂
Alguien me podría decir por qué ya no ay subtítulos😭
I am German, but I prefer to look at Carwow in English!
Hey Mat, when are we going to see a hypercar race? Bugatti, Koenigsegg, Pagani, 918, SF90 etc. would be amazing to see as would supercars from the 90's like the Jag XJ220, Bugatti EB110, Lambo Diablo, McLaren F1, Ferrari F50, and such. Keep up the great work
Audi looks great exterior. VW and BMW sounds better. Mercedes... Wins in F1 race,😄
I wonder if they can make a vid without mentioning the carwow website for once?
Such a shame the Golf is the most boring looking car...
Thank you volkswagen for no soft limiter in golf
I mean if they were trying to test for the quickest 2 liter turbo shouldn't they have brought an A 45s instead?
The BMW sounded much better
Mercedes driver has caught sleeping 🤣🤣
That Golf R is a great plataform for a sleeper little devil!
A45s would beat them all with easr
Type-R... I know its slower but My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
golf R pride
The Race of the shit cars
Do a 50mph to 150mph and watch a Type R smoke them all.
The Golf R made 2.4 bar turbo pressure,just insane the evolution of turbo cars.
Golf R: hey BMW, Mercedes, Audi...I destroy you all! RS3, A45S, M140....do you sure to challenge us? Really?
Mk 7.5 R  is the best looking R for me BUT the mk 8 R is something else my Gosh !
mat is cute.
Wrong figures again from VW, but much appreciated! xD
Golf R undoubtedly the fastest car BUT it’s not worth £40k plus, VW have lied about the bhp, remember dieselgate
Kinda confused why the a45 wasn’t used. And how the BMW beat the Audi in previous races but now it cant
Vag is fast...in a straight line, for sure. After that, after the first corner, Bmw will be in the lead.  For autobahn, it's perfect. It's almost a sleeper.
BMW sound nice
They should’ve raced the A45s instead of the A35
If the audi S3 can perform this good, imagine the up coming RS3😏💨
Reaction of the driver in the merc was pathetic
The A45 was too OP to be in this video
That Golf R is phenomenal. I shall show them due respect if I see one in my mere GTI Performance 😂
Why not the Merc A45S??
I'd rather buy a Mercedes and tune it for £ 2,000 than buy a damn Volkswagen or Audi!🤮
Bmw sounds the best but im a vw/audi guy or fanboys so i was voting for them
Mercedes launch is very bad
How and why does the VW Golf R cost almost 2,000 more than the Audi S3 as well as having more horsepower and torque?
Finally a Golf which overtakes her opponent. It s a wonderful car.
On brake test bmw was little front than VW then Audi and merc was way back before brake starts.
Do a Giulia vs 330 please
in the rolling you seemed to be in efficiency mode not in comfort
You need a new idea for the break test cause this brake test is unfair ..  The mercedes wasn't at the same line with the other cars ..  And the driver reaction always makes the difference ..  You need to measure how many meters need to stop each of the cars ..
The Golf R is still the best all around 🔥 hot hatch. It's a grocery getter, race car, family car.
Why not the A45s??? Should be there other than the A35
Hmmmm, I'm going with Audi S3. 9:04 Booooo Volkswagen golf gti!
That Golf needs to be dyno tested asap.
Mat you’re ageing like fine wine. Proper daddy 🥰
Why is the mercedes driver always so fucking bad
With the Golf's power    How about we get the Golf R against the A45s??
Should have had the a45
Got to hand it to that Golf. It's a quick car. Looks great in that Blue. Shame it has the worst interior out of all 4 cars. And what a shame no manual option available on any of them.
if its all 2L you use get a a45s not a A35. just like how u got a golf R over a GTI which are al 2 L cars
Am I wrong or is the A#% not in gti territory, not R..
Archie has done drag race with A45s and Golf 8R. They were equal! What a blamage for the AMG.
Shame the golf R is perhaps the dullest car design ever. 🤣👍
a toad with a star on the hood is an outsider, which is understandable!
Love these videos!! Absolutely the best car videos there are. No need to watch any guys face like 20 minutes when explaining all details about the car.... These are short and damn great videos to watch!!! Only issue is that normally only Matt and Yanni can launch and others drivers dont know how to anticipate the launch control....
What an incredible machine that Golf R is!!! Bloody hell !!!!!
Honestly I expected a bit more from that Merc
Is the person in the Mercedes sleeping or what
I have a feeling there will be a waiting list for the Golf.
Yes, that's fine and all. But you already knew the answer to Mat's original question was the A45. 👀
VW Lying BIG Time ! As usual...
the driver in the bmw is shitt
Never expected this but this seems a like good competition !!
I can't even lie. The new golf R is fuckng nutty. New King of the hatchbacks atm if you ask me
Trackhawk vs 911 turbo s🙏🏽
We demand an arabic channel
Matt gave the golf the respect it deserves, cleaned up well👌
Drag race... Renault Zoe  Corsa E  e208  Nissan Leaf  Honda e
Love the Drags ❤ The sound of BMW M135i 😉
I'm so tired that they always put the worst drivers in the Mercedes
GOLF R VS A45S AMG NEXT PLEASE
I forsure thought you guys would have the new G80/G82 drag video by now
M140 beats them all, going backwards.
Mat could you please leave the stats so we can compare HP? I always forget the other car's stats
Why did they not use a A45 because they use the fastest versions of all cars but not the mercedes
Golf R what a beast!! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
@carwow It would be also interesting to test the bestseller models in Europe: Mercedes A200 BMW 120i Audi 35 tfsi Golf 1.5tfsi
If the golf r let you change gears it will be perfect
BMW should scrap this abomination and get back to rear wheel drive
Everyone : Horsepower Matt : Hausspaah
Golf
Mat please do an 8 GTI vs 128ti
Mercedes cheated on the brake test  he was behind
The king 🤴🏻 is always king.
I would like to see a drag race between a Mercedes 500E and a Audi RS2. Two cara with Porsche engines!
New R logo looks stupid and Volvo-like. Should have kept the old one.
Hi Mat, could u organize a drag race with a Bugatti Chiron and any other car of ur choice
Your missing the cupra R it's part of vw group
BMW the only one without a dual clutch, yet beating all the others in terms of kickdown in comfort. BMW knows their stuff
Can we just appreciate the S3, it's so beautiful and quick and all
The bucktooth bmw sounds the best. They all look like a copy of each other, this is why I find modern cars boring.
why a35 and not a45?
BMW sound
The a35 is just a amg cosmetic pack right? Its the a45 with the amg engine i heard
VW POWERRR
Audi wont be pleased with this!should be the same performance as the Golf.mercedes looked bad here too.bmw used to drive the best but now its fwd its irrelevant.would rather have a GR Yaris and some change.
none of them sounded the best
Seems like the A35 cheated a bit on the brake test.😱
40 grand for a golf feels so wrong
wouldn't it be more fair to put GOLF GTI instead of the R against the other cars? If the VW is R than Audi should be RS3, nah?
1:11 Hallo frrrrrom Deutschländ! :-)
Fuck it........I’m tuning my M135i 😂
Where's yani?😂
Us Mercedes fans need to see the A45 vs The Gold R,the VW are lying no way that's 300hp.🤦🤦 BRING ON OUR THE A45.🌚🌚💨💨💨💨💨   Edit,And we need Yianni to drive the A45 for us.😂😂
The driver of BMW is definitely an amateur 🤷🏼‍♂️
Sorry but that Mercedes doesn’t deserve an AMG badge.
Us Mercedes fans need to see the A45 vs The Gold R,the VW are lying no way that's 300hp.🤦🤦 BRING ON OUR THE A45.🌚🌚💨💨💨💨💨
Bet the yaris would win all of them lol
Wanna see 765LT vs 911 turbo S
automatic hot hatches, yawn.
Convinced VW are at its fuckery again. Bet the press car is more powerful than the ones customers will get.
7:25 lmaooo both drivers ☠😭😭😭😭
1 series looks the best from the back. Worst from the front
And just like that. Fanboys like the mk8 more than the mk7 and m7.5 and never disliked it in the first place 🤣
Why wasn’t the Mercedes A45  not used?
That Mat german accent.😂😂💯 Nailed it.😂💯
Whoever invented soft limiting exhaust technology should be exiled from the car industry honestly the DISRESPECT!
Audi a wholeass vacuum cleaner. Mercedes driver fell asleep
I would get the Mercedes because I don't afford a VW!
Nice, A45 AMG vs Audi RS3 vs Golf R please :-)
VW R against AMG A45 plz
7:33 guys are so intense 😂 😂
I own an A35. Now I am officially sad. but damn that golf is fast
Ah yes 7:31 , it's a manly rule that wobbling back and forth will put in an extra horsepower in the car
The BMW sounds Great
I hope the Golf R isn't neutered by the time it gets to the U.S
Next video Cupra formentor vz vs cupra ateca
Vw golf sound good vw golf is a beast
A45 would win easy
where’s the a45s?
VW is fast as crap
mercedes 😂
why every mercedes driver is sleeping
Nice but I think who ever was driving the merc missed the memo on when to set off reaction time was piss poor
Can someone wake up Mercedes driver, please?
the fastest 2 liter 4 cylinder is the a45s .pls be correct when you do this stfu you have 5+milion subs and a lot of them rely on you for information , and you can clearly see the mercedes launched very late on drag race , if you where driving it you will ask for a rematch.
Matwatson I want to say this you get in the car everytime which has moree performance you are not enjoying the thrill to win the drag race with least power , so hop on into something which has less power
The german car won💪
Anyone think that the new 1 series is just plain really fugly
Why does merc A35 AMG and A45 AMG have such a huge difference, other than different engine a35 seems so lethargic in comparison.
Oooohhhh Matt..... Nooooo you should have used the A45 instead...   Now Benz boys are crying...  Haha
I bet VW have remapped the Golf R press cars.
BMW wins the sound test.
Best 4 cylinder turbo still has to be the a45s
You said the quickest 2 litre 4 cylinder. You should have used the A45s. Not fair at all Mat.
Hi Matt! I want to see a drag race with the new bmw m3 or m4 comp against a45s and rs4
A45 is allso an 2.0  case closed  thank me later bye bye
I’m waiting for the RS3 😌
Audi tought you that bad sounding cars doesn't mean that dont go fast
Love how the VW was the most expensive out of all them🤣
Bmw sound the best to be honest:)
1:28 I hope I wasn't the only one wondering (initially) what happened to his legs....
A45s 1/4 mile 12.1 seconds. So it is a win for the A45s which was not present there.
Most of the time you pick the fastest car.  I guess you know in advance what car is the best.
El Mercedes se queda claramente en la salida. Sp hacéis este tipo de cosas, que pena
Nice race Matt, but the right amg for the race would be the a45
"VW invented the Hot Hatch and they are still the best at it"-Jeremy Clarkson
Golf R sounds the best. Audi looks the best. And Golf ARE is the fastest
Where is the GR Yaris?!?! Disappointed Matt Watson 😒
i am impressed with vw performance.
The golf R just has a qualify engine! It’ll need a rebuild before its first service 💥👌
I bet the pull out game of the guy in the A 35 is rubbish.
THE GOLF R OMG!!!!!
This drag race does not count.
Got damn 12.3 on a bone stock Golf R is crazy
where is the RS3
You Youtubers need to realize that the first thing you see when you watch the video shouldn’t be a commercial wait a few minutes and then put the commercial in
Ummm, isn't the A45s also a 2.0l?
You should have use the A45s. Because you said the quickest 2-litre engine. Not fair Mat.
BMW sounds the best
Mat and that S3 driver😂 Head movement
BMW sounds the best..
410 dislikes from Mercedes fan boys!
Das Auto 💪
A35 asleep at the flag.
I know the A35 is the comp for a Golf R but given that performance I'd love to see how close the Golf R gets to the A45 now... food for thought certainly
“Speaking of asss”...
Pls golf 8 R vs a45s vs rs3 vs m2  pls pls
i feel it is not fair for merc
Drag race the Golf R with the A45s
Mercedes on the brake test dont win is way more back from the ather before the line and and the s3 appears to do the same! So the vw golf win and the brake test😜
I think VW are doing a BMW and down playing there BHP figures 👀🤣
BMW and Golf R sound best
The Mercedes won the brake test cos it was behind all the others anyway lol 🤧
BMW
Put the golf on the dyno please
Nice stage 1 Golf...
Even though I'm German I will keep watching the English channel Matt is just hilarious😂
I'm pissed, the S3 hatchback, the M135i and the A45 are not available in canada. What are my options?
BMW sounds the best
A45s
Who is waiting to roadster in action ?
Mat and the audi driver look like chicken bobbleheads in the rolling race
why didnt use a 45s ? thats 2 liter also
What mental about that AMG is that my 22 year old, beat up, stock mitsubhihsi Evo V with (at the time of setting it) 287bhp and an ignition problem along with a fucked synchro on 3rd gear, managed to set a 13.5 quarter mile at santa pod 2 years ago with 105k miles on the clock. Thats quicker time than a 2021 Merc A35 with an auto transmission and more power... Makes no sense how that is possible. Granted mine is only 1380kgs (not sure what the merc is) but it shouldnt be getting beat up by old unhealthy 22 year old sports cars from the 90's. Begs the question have they really come that far in 20 years? I know the Evo was way ahead of its time with the AYC system and awd etc but surprising how close they are to the modern cars still. Mine is now fully restored and sitting at a health 350bhp and pretty much eats most hot hatches it comes against. I have however shed 100kgs of weight. Im still running stock internals, stock turbo, Stock intercooler and a sports cat. I bet your ass mine is alot more fun to drive than any of cars featured here.
Bmw sounds great
I knew that R was going to destroy them.
Why not the a45s
For the mercedes driver, just floor it, is that so difficult ??
You cheat You always choose the best with alot of horsepower You are cheating matt
Mercedes cheated on the break test
Is it me or the Merc driver had the reaction time of a goldfish??
Why not A45 and 140i ...
Golf R go brrrrrrrrr
7:28 the Audi guy is rocking lol 😆 💀
Get the golf R on a dyno!
The golf R is quicker than an RS3
I’d love to see a Subaru cosworth on this channel
This GOLf R should be racing against A45amg, RS3, M2 etc etc
"Amg"
Great video, it’s the one everyone has been waiting for, it went exactly as I thought, that R has 340bhp at least and the S3 has more than 306bhp, why have they got it so wrong or is the merc & beemer just shit 🤣🤣
Just wait for the rs3 to come out
BMW and Mercedes were really stupid to give these new cars less power than the old 8V S3. New S3, A35 and M135 should of all had 330 hp with 420 nm/470 nm + drift mode from factory
Ehm the amg 45 is also a 2.0....
@carwow do the Same race with a BMW M140i
Hmmmmm starts vid with “Which is the quickest, 2.0L, 4 cylinder, Turbocharged German hot hatch...” and doesn’t have the A45 s in the race?!?! 🤔
Do golf R against A45s pls.
VW faster than AMG, Audi S, and BMW Mxxx... hell must have frozen over!!!
Man that Golf is ugly...
Matt next race please!  G8 R vs 2018 RS3 vs 2021 A45 vs 992 Carrera 4
Dyno the fucking the GOLF R
Golf R very impressive
fake race
where was the a 45 amag??
Golf R sounds best not too loud , not too low
Golf R sounds best not too loud , not too low
I m buying the golf r once it comes out.
Put it against an a45s now :)
Golf R wow
I mean just imagine: Buy Golf 8 R, slap downpipe, exhaust, intake and a tune on it and it will destroy alot of cars that are waaay more expensive
BMW sounds best but all sound gash.
It’s suppose to be VW GOLF GTI, A35, S3 and M135i, that why Golf R is fast. Next time just put VW GOLF R, A45s, IM135i stay same, I don’t think it’s will be M1 anyways. Lastly RS3 would be cool to see some results 👀
Old m140i would do better but ins’t a fout banger
Maybe put grandma on the side instead of driving that poor Merc :P
If I’d buy one of these, I’d rank them like this: 1. Mercedes 2. Audi 3. BMW 4. Volkswagen
Vw
I’m disappointed from Mercedes. But the golf was astonishing.
Volkswagen defo lying about the golf r 🤣🤣
U jumped like always. I have told you, must get trafic lights
BMW sounded best imo.
Should of got the A45S 😡 if you got vw best hatchback you should get mercedes best hatchback
Challenger Hellcat VS A45MG and Company
Incredible Golf R!
WAKE UP - VW is ALWAYS cheating, their press car are TUNED and NOT THE SAME AS THEIR CUSTOMER CARS
What were you pointing at the end of the video?
Hi
Gotta love Mat and the S3 driver jumping back and forwards looking at each other in the rolling race
god that front of the bmw...XD😑
I suggest you drag race average man suvs like Toyota, Nissan and co
the driver of the merc  brakes before all the others...
So why not also the A45 as a comparison?
1.BMW  2.VW 3.Merc😪 4.Audi 😪
There’s no way that brake test was fair.
Could you please put the McLaren 765lt against a Porsche GT2 RS  Would be pretty interesting to see these two against each other ✌🏻
A35 competitors is GTI A45s competitor is Golf R
All sound like shit but fast shit
This race was really unfair you should have put the A45s not the A35
That’s stupid fast! MK8 R my dream car
Merc driver took a nap in the race. Lol
Golf R
Why would you even get an S3? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Golf R vs BMW 340i with Joe Aquiles Come on Matt
Merc driver 'it launched ok' yeah it might've done but everyone had gone home by time he bothered to move. There's always one in these multi car races that has no clue how to drive, they're on open land so he should go and practice, idiots in town driving a 1.0L corsa with a noisy exhaust launch faster than him.
VW messed up somewhere and made a car that's too fast 😂
VW had to make it quick, no one would buy it otherwise with those looks :D
The Gold R is incredible!
Matt why are you always on the far left in the drag race ?
That merc needed another chance! Not The cars fault!!!
That rocking forwards and backwards believing it will make the car go faster 😂 😂 😂
If that merc stepped on the brakes as the same time as the other 3, it definitely cheated on the brake test lol
Why no 45s?
Good video but WHERES YAINNI?
Did I just see 2 Volkswagens destroying bmws and mercedeses?
I want a golf R please
How is the Mk8 R that much faster then the S3? Also Merc driver was not even with the other cars when the break test line approached. Slight asterisk on that W.
I appreciate the attempt at diversity, but you should occasionally let a male host the show
BMW sounds great
We already know the correct answer is Mercedes a45.
The Golf R is £40k since its got the Lapiz Blue.
The performance difference between the Golf R and the S3 makes no sense since it's literally the same car. Sound to me like there are some pre-production Golf R ringers going around.
this video single-handedly just made VW 500k
1:10 😂😂😂
I think the power really kicks down in the golf in the higher gears due to the them being short
At least there's exhaust coming out of the actual exhaust tips on the S3, unlike the bigger sibling xD
3 German vs 1 french renault clase A.
The benz was sleeping at the start of drag
This golf R also beats the A45s. Search Golf r vs a45s and it’s the first video.
As a german im going to stay here! Great vids
In these races, the car that loses the drag and rolling races always wins the brake tests.
Love it when Mat gets excited - he sounds so Brummie!!!!
mercedes cheated in break test
Where is A45s😕
Looking for a car in this segment is like buying the same shirt with differend logos on them.
Awesome video!! I love watching videos of cars I can’t actually afford and make a comparison
To be fair, if they brought the A45 and the RS3, I don't think the Golf R would have won anything (and this a VW lover who is speaking)
Its all fun and games untill A45s decides to step in
cheese
Thats definitely not walksawagoney
8R 😍💪
OK now you got me looking online trying to find one of these golfs
The A45 is a 2ltr German? So if you're wanting to know which is the fastest 2ltr German, why use the lesser A35 sibling!!??
Vw all the way love it
I think the guy in the BMW next to you, alone wearing a mask, is at the wrong race.  He is supposed to be driving a Prius.  Oh, the VW sounded the best, but costs the most.  Go figure.
How many indian what carwow india
Hmmm!so golf is the most expensive one here?
finally she's back😀😊
So the golf r doesn't have a soft limiter and the rs3 has fuck u vw
Quieter is better
Golf R vs A45s PLEASE😜, i reckon there would't be much in it
More diesel powered races please
start uploading in 60fps 1440p pls
Ez
Hi Mat, what happens to your camera? The Golf R blue becomes purple again
The R is rapid! 💨
Audi VW 👌👌👌
Matt put the AMG A45S against the Golf 8 R please.
Can you show the Power and torque for all vehicles as an overlay like the price and weight? It’s hard to compare otherwise
The vw sound the best
We need a whole car review video with Matt talking in a German accent
All these " luxury " brands, pathetic 🤣 VW is lying about the Golf R numbers for sure
GOLF R
I was a golf fanboy anyway but now...
Love seeing both VW + Audi drivers rocking vigorously in their seats for the 2nd in-gear acceleration test. Why don’t you both get a room? ;p
It’s a sad time for car people when you get that excited about a car NOT having a soft limiter
I bet the GOLF R is equiped with the air intake from racing line.
V double U
2:58 I like the audi sound, sounds familiar to my vac cleaner this joke will never get old @audi
Still overpriced.
Bmw tbh
Wearing a mask by yourself in a car can lower the car's performance. The BMW and AMG drivers were the only two drivers wearing their masks, causing airflow restrictions. Don't argue with me; it's science.
Can you do a Golf R be a Toyota GR Yaris
Why not A45s????
the golf should race the a45s and RS3
@5:51 BMW driver too busy adjusting his mask when he's the only occupant in the car....
You should have put the a 45 s instead of the a 35
BMW
Why didn't you get Mercedes A45s
Mat Watson  Gulf R vs a45amg please
These results are not representive of the fastest german hot hatch because these are not top models🤷‍♂️
Please GET ON WITH THE RACE! No one cares about your humour mat!!!!
4:16 the mercedes driver fell asleep
Oof why is the golf r faster than the s3 dont they use the same motor lol
Where jcw gp?
Mercedes cheated the break test
Only BMW
The M135 sounds why better then the rest but come on matt Vw R line sould run run against the A45 AmG and the M2 and the Rs3 if u where driving the GTI then u could use a S3 ,M135 and the A35 .
i start not to like this yt chanell! why dont u pick up the a45s and u picked the a35 plus this driver cant drive at all!!
Bmw
Mat get the scirocco r ffs
The Mercedes driver looks shit driver seriously this is an AMG
someone take that golf r to a dyno... there is no way those hp numbers are correct
Mat plz get d a45S it will annihilate the others
5:50 I gotta go
My Peugeot sounds better.... lol
I'd Like to see the Golf R race the new RS3 and A45s
why not A45S for the Merc?
I think the R-line is about as quick as the A45 (gen1)
Yaris GR 12,5 eat shit Golf R 😂
6:14 LMAO the Android message sound
bmw
What the fuck did they put in that golf... might have to round it against an A45 and an RS3 next time Mat
The only reason you’d get an A35 is to try to trick people into thinking you have an A45S also... it definitely cheated in the brake test 😂
bolloks!! look at the mercedes didnt even start when all of you left! sh*t driver!!
Kind of sad that there was no Minis in this race (Cooper S or JCW)  :/
¡¡GREAT VIDEO...GREAT RACE...MOST IMPORTANT; NO YANNI...!!
plz make it happen a45 vs this golf
Mercedes driver is the best 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
you should have take the aclass a45
Do the New Golf R against the super hatch A45s
Ummmmmmmmmm we are 3 tenths from having 11 second factory hatchbacks
Is it me or cars look more oriental while time pass???
Nice motors, if I won the lottery i might purchase one
You have need to put the a45s
A45 amg
No Yanni no like
I'd like to see a race between the Golf R and de AMG 45S
I thought golf r and audi s3 is the same car.... why they make it better than the s3. I'm annoyed
It should have been the golf gti. The golf R should be pitted against the A45, RS3 and I don’t care about BMW
Mercedes so used to being at the back obviously won the brake test.
People saying vw 8r does not have 320hp.bt just look at S3 that has 306hp the same as the m135 and the A35 bt it beating. So maybe it's not the power that makes the vw n audi fast. The upgrade of it transmission n suspension may be. So which means the 8r face-lift will be even faster with more power. I can just imagine if the 8r has 400hp
take video with a 45s and golf R )
Best sound Beamer
Audi in 2nd place everywhere
Is that two pigeons driving at 7:29 ?
Wow. BMW... ouch the disappointment is real  Regards,  The Fanboi😒
I love the Mercedes
NO YIANNI NO FUN😐😐😐😤😤😤😠😠
It's impressive how that Bmw is literally the reflex of the poorest decisions of the brand...It's pure rubbish compared to It's predecessors.
The golf is a press office car, so probably they remapped the engine to impress the journalists
Ok
It’s hard to imagine the Golf R used to be the slowest.
"small cars" all weigh over 1500 kilos.  Gordon Murrays T.50.  V12 hypercar. 986kg. That is small.
Would like to see Golf R against the A45s
The vw barrows some of Porsche performance
It is like the golf r is the turbo s of hatchbacks lol 😂
the golf R is quicker just check out boost pressure 2.4bar /36psi
why not the 45s
The AMG broke so early
The m135i
Vw lied again😬as always, I don't think it's 310 hp.
An A45 would've destroyed the competition
My ranking: M135i > S3 > A35 > Golf R. If it is a Golf GTI... M135i > S3 > Golf GTI > A35. The GTI will be less powerful but aesthetically it is much more sporty and beautiful than the R.
Gr vs
Mercedes sounded better
Bmw 135i sound 🥰
8R is going to be the king of the streets in South Africa.👌🏽🔥💨
Don’t let the driver of the A35 race on car wow please. We would’ve potentially had a completely different race if he was competent. #notamercfanboy
VW lying about figures again...
think someone at VW upped the boost on that thing.
Why s3 and not rs3? And a35 and not a 45?
Is it just me or are all these new hatchbacks starting to look like crossovers with their high up rear headlights and taller bodies?.
Both Volkswagens won then. I mean both Audis won. No, I mean Audi power!!! No but, Mercedes and BMW are sh*t.
The new Golf R is definitely very impressive. Good on you VW!
Next race should be Kia stinger GT vs BMW M340i vs Mercedes C43AMG vs Audi S5
Why not race a a45 amg s, it would be the right car for the race.
3.94s. WTF.
3.9 secs in a golf, that’s nuts
Merc driver: This thing braked really well! *wins braking test*  Look at 8:14!!! He is literally behind all the others!  Edit: He is also a garbage driver..
Mat enjoying the day cause he almost WON EVERYTHING
You can say vw is boring but unfortunately is always ahead with technology
Golf R has the most 320hp I’ve ever seen 😂
You do all realise that bucking in your seat doesn't actually make the car go faster 😂
it's incredible that every time who drives the merc is so slow to launch it
Гольф 320 сил, у Ауди 310 сил если было бы у Ауди 320 сил, Гольф не догнал бы Ауди
Yeeeeee german car won 🚙🔥
Who buys an a35??? Where is the a45
Hi Mat i love Beamer Revzzzzz.
The best overall package, the  Audi is the winner.
Mercedes come on!!! What da fff
Bet my granny can drive better than the dude in the Merc
Golf's these days are supra killers.
Dude your german accent Is crap. Please don’t do it
Love the stupid accent 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:33 😂
Audi
Sad to think that pretty soon the C63 is going to sound like this. And then eventually sound like nothing at all...
why always mat got the fatest car.. hmm
Vw should be proud of their new beast It's a real giant KILLER  Btw 0-60 in just 3.94 secs 😬🤯
Newton meters of torque
But people will still buy the Merc over the VW
The Audi driver rocking his body during the rolling race is 😂
VW 👋 Audi 👋 Mercedes 👋 BMW 👋 = TESLA 👍
I like how the mercedes driver blames the car when he clearly was napping
Saw the video of Archie Hamilton before and was already shocked, what did they do to that Golf???
Bmw was front wheel drive right?
Power to the peoples car
J'adore
Mat always pick the more powerful car ugh
Nice!!! Looks like it's an upgrade for my mk7 to the 8R now...
the race is missing. the mini gp who think like me too??
Bmw driver wearing a mask by himself... Omg people masks don't do nothing and unless you're an old sick man, what are worried about??????????
BMW
Where is the 420 hp a45s amg
Why do others wear face masks in an empty car?
To be fair it should have been the a45 not a35
Mercedes - BMW power go home // AUDI&VW kills💪
You needed to take A45 amg not A35
...AMG 45s not in this equation?
A45s is the best 4 cilinder turbo
Bmw sounds the best
Drag race new golf r vs a45s and rs3
The arse driving the Merc needs sacking, his was the worse CARWOW launch i have ever seen. You should have re-run the race regardless of the fact the Merc would still have been last.
The bmw sounds best
A35 is not an amg
BMW M135i
Just a thought: Since the Golf R is the top of the Golf series, shouldn't they have brought the Audi RS3 and the Merc A45 to the race instead?
Just saw the carwow advert for the first time on TV
Should have use the ultimate performance pack from audi and benz since vw got the gti and bmw have others
With every iteration of the Golf R, there needs to be a new BMW 330D to hopefully keep up in a police chase.
Please mention ground clearance .. Request 🙏🏼
The Merc braked early
Need to do this again but with the top spec of every car...
Does the guy in mercedes have a driving license?
No no you need the a45s
that vw has to have 340-350 hp
I’m speaking for all Germans watching that we want u Matt reviewing the cars and not someone different 😂
Golf sounded the best
You can see the merc braked early and it wasn’t level at 8:15
I think you should also measure time to 60 as part of all drag races...
2.4 bar Golf R, nuts 🤯
Cool race ! That golf is great
Where is the a45 amg? Is also 2L v4
This golf 320? Good joke😂... Matt you need drag race with GolfR, Amg 45s and Audi S3👌
Why buy a VW over a premium car brand 🤔 its 39k vs 37k
That Golf R feeled faster than some supercars from other videos
Maybe its the feul? If the golf is on 101 octane or something
Line up is all wrong. STUPID.  Golf R ✔️ Should be A45, BMW i140 and Audi RS3
Why anyone would buy an a35 is beyond me,expensive and slow as hell
Wearing a mask by yourself?
Great fun!
Bmw sounds the best
So vag distroied bmw
Amazing 🤩! VedantKailaje
It's crazy to even consider that VAG would allow the S3 to outperform the R series Golf. There in lies the issue for VG products. Get the S3 and stage on it, that's what I'd do.
3.94 seconds in the golf 😂👍🏻
So why didn't they just pick the RS3?
It’s honestly ridiculous that the R is the most expensive of the four...
You should race a BK2 genesis coupe 3.8 :)?
S3 it is amazing 👍I will go with it
Nobody expected Volkswagen will have highest price.
Every car has a dual clutch except.........??! 😂
Why is everybody wearing a mask except for Mat, has this man no respect for the common law? I say off with his head!
"AMG"
Nesxt time bring A45 instead of A35
the legend says that if you bob your body along with your head back and forth while in a drag race your car will go a little faster
What about a45s is that french?
Does the Amg have the Renault engine or something wtf
The Mercedes driver needs to get back on his adderall, so maybe he won't fall sleep in a drag race. His break lights were on while everyone else was 2 car lengths ahead of him.
Mercedes driver 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
AMG 🥰🥰🥰 baby
I should have brought the a45
NONE SOUNDS GREAT, THEY HAVE TOO SMALL ENGINS, AND THEY  ARE NOT A SUBARU IMPREZA
Mat you should have “GOT” the A45 instead
BMW SOUND GREAT
I didn't expect a Golf Type R to perform that well, I thought the Audi S3 would have won. Anyway I do like to drive an AMG A45s and an Audi S3, they are fun. But I don't know about the Golf R, since I haven't driven one, hope it's trilling fun and fill the expectations of many car enthusiasts.
As an AMG fan this was kinda disappointing to watch
MK8 R vs MK7 R Golf please
Still waiting for   911 turbo S vs McLaren 765 LT  🤟🏻
The golf R vs rs3 vs a45s??
They had a race between Golf R vs A45S in another channel.. It was really close..
Volkswagen Golf ftw guys... Always
That merc is a mess
Amg driver saying it isn't as fast as the others, when in reality he started about 5 years after everyone else 😂 awful start.
Are all cars 4wd?
That Golf needs to go against the rs3 and a45
When the steering wheel is straight it changes the ecu parameters
could u buy me a tesla pls
The quickest 2.0 litre 4 cyl german hot hatch is the a45s which would humiliate all of them...
Bring the a45s Matt 💪🏼
Should have re-run for the Merc. Surely driver was half a second later launching?
Mercedes driver sleeps at the wheel drag racing, on coke braking.
Time to put the R in a drag race with an A45S, RS3 and M2
Love the bollocks people talk in comments section😂. Might start making bullshit up and just posting it as fact.
Yay for the race starter girl, she's back! At least the voice matches now...
My new wallpaper=Sad Mat
Matt, Golf R vs A45 AMG
Sorry but wtf is the Mercedes driver doing...
You should compare this golf to an A45 amg, considering how fast it is
That Gold R is such a great car, shame that it has got no manual
Fastest German 2 litre hatch - A45S. Fastest warm hatch maybe. Also both the R and the S3 are running the same motor. Have VW turned up the boost on the press car?
That   AMG A35 is no match for those cars ...I bet the A45 can smash all of that ....#wondering why didnt you get the Mercedes A45s
That's were the Mercs strength lies. Late braking in the corners. However I am in love with the GOLF.
I love how you can see Mat and the audi’s driver rocking back and forth at 7:30
Damn fast
Bmw needs there m140i back
Mercedes Driver first was like *"Woo, we are go! Better put down my Sudoku."*
BMW sounds good
I just don’t buy all this, that a35 won’t be as slow as that driver made it look,
This is the type of drag races we want! Not always Lamborghini and Porsche.
The Golf R being part of this line up is just a cheat code🤣 calm down Matt
Notice how the Audi driver shaking his head same as Mat🤣 7:32
Awesome job you do with Carwow. Huge fan from Romania
Here is the another race lineup idea (Luxury Mid-size Sedans) ;   BMW 5 Series vs Mercedes E-class vs Audi A6
A45s it's 4 cylinder
BWM sounds the best like loins sound
Am I wrong to be surprised that the VW is the most expensive? In my "brand pricelist" it should be the cheapest. Mercedes/BMW/Audi/VW. I priced up a Golf R with a decent spec on the Swedish VW site last week and the price was eye-watering.
who cares...the golf 8s interiors sucks so much id take the a class or a3 anytime over the golf....
Haha the R performs just amazing and based on specs I understand the comparison but the other brands have an end game and this is the end game for VW. GTi vs A35 vs S3 and R vs A45 vs RS3 (when it comes out) to see how all end games compare. You'll have a different outcome. Nonetheless for the price the R is a no brainer. Amazing car!
7:33 both trying to use there body force to make the car go faster 😂
I am buying one!!!
we want model S plaid plus
Matt kinda panicked when the Audi was ahead... Look at him put the walkie🤣🙌
Audi rs3 (400bhp) best 1/4 mile time 12.2 Golf 8 r (320bhp??) 12.3 Vw really likes to cheat on figures
I don’t understand why you’d put the A35 when you have an A45s out there
So good!
The bmw fanboys won
7:31 lol they’re having a dance competition
Golf R
Amazing work VW
Which one would u choose mat  the Gr Yaris or the merc A45 ?
VW has surely tuned the ECU on this test car to justify the horrendous price!!!  Please, please put it on a dyno!
HEEEEEY THE GIRL IS BACK! No more awkwardly hearing her voice with seeing some dude starting the race!
Matt:The VW is an amazing machine for a 4 cylinder engine A45S AMG:Am I a joke to you?
People surprised the VW won, well at 39k and no fancy interior you’d hope it can perform well
we are waiting for" GOLF R VS YARIS GR.
FINALLY A NEW CAMERA WITH HDR congratsss carwow
Hmmmm... I note the word ‘press’ on the Golfs number plate, so a press car, is it possible VW have messed around with it to make it faster then the model you buy? I mean it’s not like they haven’t rigged their cars for diesel emissions or anything, oh wait..
I love knowing my stage 1 64 plate s3 would beat them all 😎
Why u did race with a35? A45 s is also 2.0L turbocharged engine
Mercedes a45amg will eat all of them
Wear AMG A45
But come you can't compare a golf r with those cars   There's a big difference in power   You should've gotten the gti instead
It's a shame the VW group have made their VW's better then the more expensive Audi's. Its like they're trying to quietly kill off Audi
BMW haters r gonna partttttyyhgg
The vw R is also the most expensive lol
The Audi was going at a lower speed than the others in the brake test
Depending on one stream of income had never made any millionaire and earning check don't put you on forbes
Petition for having face cams in other cars as well... The drivers sounds genuinely nice and can make the content even better
Well VW gave it more power because it‘s the most powerful Golf. I guess the others (especially AMG) were precise with there figures because they have a more powerful model
I wonder if the Golf R raced against the A45s and RS3 would it have a serious competition
I would love to see a race between the a45s and the new golf r
I thought volcswagon was french because they own bugatti, and bugatti's a french brand
we want a45s v rs3 v golfR
basically BMW downgraded the 135i to a boring average hot-hatch. reason enough to keep the prices of the old 6 cylinders 135i and 140i quite high up
R vs A45s vs Rs3   Gti vs A35 vs s3  This should be correct one  This is like purposely done for promoting Golf R😂😂😂
stupid drivers
My stage 2 mk7 golf R runs quarter miles in 12.5 seconds wtf
M135i for the win
Well let's remember that the Volkswagen is an Ferdinand Porsche...
The fastest 2.0 4cyl German isn’t there
The Golf is the quickest but it is sooo ugly...
Are any of these in the US?
its amazing how this clown is a car journalist
Mercedes driver : "Launch was okay..." Also Mercedes driver : 4:08
In terms of looks, I'm completely indifferent to the gold (don't like it, don't hate it), I like the looks of the S3, but I hate the looks of the BMW and the Merc ( There's nothing on earth that could make me either of them).
Bmw is having Sinusitis 😂
Volkswagen Under quoted the power on the Golf. Looks at how it keeps on passing the others
Look at the Audi driver at 7:33 giving the car +10 horsepower
Bmw sounds Best.
Put all of them on a dyno.
If you've got specialist timing gear, then why not use that to tell us what you get 0-60 in ?
2.0 liter german hothatch- a45s ?😂
Shit merc driver
That Golf R is insane!just watched a drag race between a Golf8 R and an AMG A45S and even though there is a 100hp gap between them the Golf nearly beat the Amg in drag race! WOW!
The vw costs more than the others?! 🤔
Love your content. Amongst these cars... We need a street modified Honda!
This was a promo for the golf
Audi should not be faster?
Carwow: Sets an Golf R against the s3 and a35 VW: What why are they putting the R against the s3 and a35 we have made the Golf GTI for a reason you donuts
Why do the drivers of the other cars sound like the same person....😂😂😂😂😂
You should have given Yanni the AMG... the guy driving it doesn't know how to keep up with you #@Mattwatson
Once wrench studios get a hold of the new 8r and give it the sauce,it'll be over
My M135 F40 hasnt got pops and bangs, can someone explain why?
It would be nice to see the brake test un-edited for once, from the outside...
That Beemer press car looks properly fvcked 😂
Happy with my rwd m140i
Have Audi made the s3 not as fast so the rs3 will seem like a monster?
Bring back exhaust vote %.
So how was it Mercedes? "the launch was okay..." Are you kidding me!! It was Crap! Mat's mother would have done better.
Bmw
The mercedes pilot is a horror
Mat looks more and more like Alan Harper. Transformation comes from Pfizer vaccine or Deutsche PS 😁  Mat you re 👍
Next up Rs3 vs A45 vs R
The Merc hit the line last thats why it won the break test
To be fair A45s is the quickest 2 liters, 4 cylinders german hothatch
I’d still get the Beamer just because it’s a bloody Beamer man
Why did you use the A35 amg, why not the A45s? That would destroy all of them.
That golf r is press car and they defo remapped it🤣
The R is great.
Put timing gear in all the cars to remove launch differences.
That's not an m135i  that's a piece of shit!
Next drag race ; new RS3 vs Golf R vs A45s ❤️  Please carwow ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Next time put it against the A45S and the RS3 - or S4, just to make things more even.
Mercedes: Misses the launch by 0,5s Also Mercedes: Launch was ok.......
VW IS BEST
That VW vs an a45
The golf r
Bmw guy wearing a mask in the car by himself? Lol wtf..wait and the Mercedes driver too? Lol makes sense
Wait Dean went to Carwow Deutschland? Never knew that, I really loved him at Auto Bild.
Bmw sounds great
I like how Matt and Audi's driver were swinging back and forth like it will affect the acceleration of the vehicle 😂😂
Do a supercar or a hypercar next time
I love both Golf and BMW but would take the Golf R and would tweak it s bit and a body kit also 😊
Awesome 🤩👌
I simply love the Carwow editor haha
I'd love to see the Golf 8 R up against the Merc A45s
Where's the RS3?
Wow the lightes and most powerfull car won you must be doctors.
Get an indian channel
That BMW sounds nice!
Volkswagen finds out may revving the golf without soft limiter next golf r soft limiter
Once we make it to Mars I’m sure companies will bring back v12s
Golf 8 R sounds great
To be fair it should have been A golf gti instead of an R because there is nothing quicker then an R but there is a RS4 And an a45🤔
That Golf R has crackhead speed😳. It has to have more then 320hp
There's a saying in South Africa for any fast car there is a way faster Volkswagen out there
I think we all know what the hottest german hatch is. A45 hands down
3 minutes befor start the facking race 🖕🖕🖕
BMW🔥
Now we need the A45S AMG VS M2 VS RS3 VS Golf R VS Cupra Formentor VZ5 (because I’m a fan of the latter)
The guy in the a35 his reaction time was slower than mats mom
That golf is M140i quick....
The head bobbing gets me every time lmao
I lost my shit laughing when you and the Audi started rocking at 7:30 😂😂
The Merc sound like a chainsaw
You know what the most annoying thing about this is... the fact the R has one of the worst interior set ups available. I’m just not sure I could deal with all those touchy buttons. What a machine though.
BMW latest 1 series is so disappointing they need to drop that 140i ASAP
Am I seeing some sun ? 😂😂finally a dry race
I rather watch the english channel instead of the german one to "improve" my english skills. And the english one is the original too
WTF I am doing I am in the fucking library and watching this fuck the TEST
I did not expect that from the golf
Golf runs 2.3 bar of boost! High figure for a petrol engine in an everyday car
Fun Fact: the mercedes driver is a BMW employee!
The Golf R and S3 are definitely the best picks.
Mat should secretly swap out the brake pads on the car he will drive for better ones, to give him that edge in the brake test🤣
Actually this race was not fair it should be with Golf GTI vs the other cars , and the Golf R with RS3,AMG A45 , M1/2👌🙏
Am sorry but the exhausts on the R are a massive downgrade! look horrible
i dont watch the videos anymore, whatever car matt is in wins
Where's the Banana A45s AMG Mat ?🤔
Imagine the RS3.
We need CARWOW:AUSTRALIA now
all i wanna say is that this BMW is ugly as hell
I thought we already had a race like this?
So if it was the A45s, it would have been a clean sweep for the AMG!!
Please les sous titre en français 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
8:57 Pause the video here.  It looks like someone has already curbed the rear wheel of the BMW😂
Ok wtf is that golf r 😅
Times that you have from that merc is either in the wet or with a bad start. *Sad mercedes fanboy noises* The driver is like 80 right??!
Carwow never ever mentions what petrol the cars are using.  I drag raced a Stage 1 RS6 the other day. I won every time because I always have 100 octane fuel in my car while he had 95 in that occasion.  Now that he has 100 octane fuel in his car, he is faster.
That Golf R 💪💪💪💪💪💪
The new GOLF R is up to another level !
Golf R will never dethrone the A45s. Prove me wrong
We need a Golf Mk5 GTI versus Mk6 Mk7 Mk8 Golf Gti🤩🤩🤩
Tut mir wirklich leid Mat, aber ich schaue mir doch lieber den englischen Kanal an. Mag ich einfach lieber🤷
Wow. Golf did 60 in under 4 seconds. That's very impressive
Audi waiting to add a R
If it was meant to be the best of 2L German hatch backs, why use the A35 instead of the A45? Almost like the race was fixed to make the Golf look better.
The VW didnt lie... it has 320hp,  but its WHP
BMW looks horrible! :)
these cars are horrible to see
Matt panicked when the dashboard beeped at the end 😂😂
or race between hellcat and m8
strange performance on the R! wonder if those were only 320hp!
please race between Demon and m8
You should have times from the previous models so we can see if there is really an improvement eey maty 🤷🏾‍♂️
BMW driver talking some fairy tales like every BMW dull fan! :D
7:34 the audi driver pushing like Matt 😂😂😂
Great video! Could we please have a drag race with the Golf 8R and the A45S please!
Some say the Mercedes driver is still about to launch...
A35 is drama///
Lol Matt and Audi guy keeps lunging back and forth on the rolling race. Some say it makes you go faster. 😂
I miss the old M140/35i it was the only one that used to do something different. Now it just looks like the rest 😭
BMW sounds better
Not a fair race for the A35? Why not the A45s? 🤔🙄
7:27 - 7:35: Mat and the S3 driver: *rocks in seat in hopes to make the car faster*  Tbh if u place Despacito it would look like they’re dancing to it
Merc driver caught sleeping at the beginning!
They should use the A45s and RS3 in the future when it comes out
merc driver is asleep
Probably 320 bhp at the wheels. Even at 10% loss, we're looking at  at least 355 bhp
it supposed to be an A45S not that clumsy A35
A proper race is Mercedes a45s, Audi rs3, Golf 8 and BMW 135iM because those are the quickest hatchbacks in 2021
Dude i am german and our accent doesnt sound like this 😂
Need to do new golf R vs A45s vs new RS3 when it comes out
7:31 Look at what both of them is doing
...sounds the best
I think the BMW just took it on the soundcheck
Does the S3 driver really annoy anyone else???
Mercedes and audi cheated in the brake test they started braking earlier and were behind the golf and BMW
BMW
If you test quickest 2.0 litre turbocharged hot hatch why not A45?
Vw 💪
We need to see the New M4 drag races
7:33  That head bobbing😂
R will win dont even need to watch the vid
That Audi still looks the best!
This drag race was unfair, it's the GTI that's supposed to go against these other cars. The R must go againts the A 45 S, RS 3, and an M 2
Mat won???!!! Shocking!
Ok now we need to see new golf R vs old golf R and new Golf R vs new A45.
Golf is comeback baby 🤗🤗🤗, please drag with civic & cayman 2.0 later.
I would love to see drag race of Mk6r Mk7r Mk8r and Mk8Gti, that would be sick 😁
I will go for BMW
Someone should put it on a dyno
BMW sounds the best 😊
A45 vs Golf R, make it I happen
BMW sounded the best according to me !
7:27 extra 10hp 😂😂
That golf R is a real competitive vehicle... I am impressed.  Wow... the clear 🏆
those cringy 4 tip exhausts, jeez
Hi Mat  Please do a drag race between GR Yaris and current model STI or let me know which is faster? Thanks so much.
Where the rs3 and a45
Love the color of the vw ..strap spec color
BMW 4ever BEST
Mat Watson a crip??
Matt could we see the golf against a RS3 or even A44s? This Golf seems to be batting well above its class.
Bmw
So VW the car of the people Is more expensive than the luxury brands  WTF
imagine doing a pull on the free way and you see Mat just slowley pass with a huge smile staring at you waving bye bye.... thats my worst nightmare
Bmw
Matt could you be anymore smug 😂
Next A45 VS MK 8R
Golf is nuts
*As of this video:* A35 AMG: Safety (Braking test) Golf R: Beast in disguise S3: Average Joe M135i: Sounds good, brakes shit
sorry but.... did the guy in the mercedes said "i launched OK" ??????....
2.5  bar stock golf R .??? OMG 😲
Need that r vs a45 s " definitely "
Dean is super.
Very nice video! The Golf wasn’t a big surprise because we’ve already seen some videos about it. Definitely more than 320hp !! The BMW is the joke on this one, even beating the Mercedes : that hunky body and the performance are not what everyone expects from BMW
4:16  Mercedes- "launched ok" HOMIE WAS SLEEPING
I stay with English Mat. German Mat isnt that cool
Geiles Rennen
Matt u should put that Golf R head to head against the A45!! We shall see which is the world's most powerful 4 cylinder turbo!!!
Why not use the Mercedes A45S 421HP? (World's Most Powerful Production 2.0 Liter)
Mercedes amg
Why didn't he get the a45 amg
How to say hi to your other freinds in other car?, Here is how= 7:33
The Merc driver was about 2 car lengths back at the start of the brake test, wtf?
This is what I'm here for
"I feel sad for Poor merc"
Put golf on dyno
We need a45s vs rs3 vs golf 8r
the long awaited drag race..
That Audi driver yanking his head made my day 😂  Impressive Golf R btw!
Where's the king of the hill...A45s
Merc driver is living in .75x speed.  Slow driver
Don't forget the golf gtD mat! Repro stage 2 and race
Has the A35 driver woke up yet after that launch😂😂
Teeth ! always pick the quickest car
Make CT4 V BlackWing vs BMW M4 !
If there's one thing we got from this video it's that the new 1 series is ugly af
Wait where is the Giulia Ti ?
All do not look really hot
The R competes with the A45, RS3, and M1...the GTI was supposed to be there instead of the Golf R
Remap that golf and see what it can do
Audi and merc sound terrible lol. Bmw was best.
And just like that, a matwatson advert😂😂
Shame the golf is so damn ugly 🤣
the old Golf R has on the dyno 20+ HP more and i think that the new R has also the same 20+ HP more as stock number.
VAG bringing the 911 Turbo S party trick to the other segments.
I am not even a BMW fan but it makes me mad that the BMW (design) looks this bad...
Golf is too good. Disappointed with the A35 AMG. Oh well we move
I hate exaust popping
I like your German accent
I feel like The golf R had to win as that's the only fast car VW has.....has the fastest hatchback and nothing else. It performed well
Why not use the A45s?
<4s 0-60, there's absolutely no way that golf has only 320HP.  BMW at least won the sound check <3
the merc brakes early
I’d still take the gr Yaris
bmw sounded the best, golf was second, merc was third and the ventilation system was last.
Next time please race a Seat Leon Cupra R too
How many HP that golf R have?
Why didn’t get the a45s
It’s not like VW to understate figures is it?👀 That R is probably around 340bhp.
For those guys who wear masks alone in their cars: are you wearing a condom when you are sitting on your bed alone?
Audi color looks like baby poop and golf like my new year puke
I'm German but still gonna watch this channel
The guy in the merc just can't launch
damn bring the A45s and the story will defenetivly change 😉
Please show this to BMW so they can see what harm they did to the 1 series...it is not even close to the F series
Where is the AMG A45s?
Fastest 2.0 litre German car and you put the a35, why not the a45?
You should’ve compared the gti with all those cars. The golf r should be compared with the rs3 and a45s
A35 4th place
M135i 3rd place
S3 2nd place
Golf R 1st place
Golf R vs A45s?
Main takeaway from this video?!.. Don't bother with any new models because they're all terrible looking.
Golf R
The golf r is on the a45s territory not a35
Matt's bottom was calibrated by Yiani last night.
Cracking race as normal but all you got to do now is put that golf against the bigger boys RS3, A45 and M140i what that car is meant to be against! 👍
12.3... SHOCKING! easily on par with the a45s and RS3 // BMW M3 and c63..
These cars are so outdated and slow compared to even the cheapest Tesla Model 3.
I would still get the a35 or s3. Much better interiors. Bmw is ugly, fat and slow.
A35 driver was so amazed by the interior he forgot to race!
That’s it, I’m cancelling my A35 order 😂😂🤣🤣
I knew from the beginning that the AMG A35 would be the last in line. Mat, I think you're having a lot of fun there - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO1np58DFY4
It's a good thing Mercedes has an A45 while VW it is its flagship Golf.
The A45 was supposed to be in that race not the A35
Race the golf r with a 45s
In real world conditions of I'd beat anyone in 4th gear while rolling in traffic in me VW Golf R 7.5! BMW is a doctor has no guts No Vauxhall in America I won again The lady in the AUDI WOULD NEVER challenge the Golf R as she has lil chillen in the baby seat 💺😏 The Mercedes is a lawyer guy so he might challenge the Golf R but once I passed 90mph he'd back off as well😛
Just imagine. Car wow drag race with:  mazda 3 mps mk1 130i 147gta R32 golf   And then realise how Boring new hatches are.
Please change mercedes driver
What about the AMG A45s!!???
I’m a huge R fN. but I feel like it has to be put against the A45 and the RS to really see what’s the real performance. Loved it by the way
The golf is basically the hottest sleeper on sale
BMW sound
Matt looking like he just woke up
lol all of these cars are faster than the bmw i8
Now let's see this R vs A45s  Vote guys for the next race 🏁
Hi Mat here: which car do you think sounded the best. LIKE my comment for the car below to VOTE!
BMW sounds the best
1:11 I get quite some vibes from Craig Ferguson and his impression of the German language
Sorry audi fan boys, but S3 looks so bad, especially in this yellow colour
When comes the drag race with iD.3?
The first thing to note, they all sound rubbish.
This is a fair race.
I love the guy in the Audi, he's usually the cheerful one, where as the guy in the Merc today is usually the grumpy one with the racing driver excuses
The driver in the S3 and Matt bobbing their heads to pick up more speed in the rolling race
Golf has 10 more horsepower than the standard one
you say the best of the 2lt hot hatches, why use a35 and not the a45?
Need to see the VW golf r vs the Audi RS3 :)
7:32 when the bass drops hard
Make a rewiew on the new Golf R!!!
Love these videos!
Wicked golf r..but i still prefer the previous generation inside out..
Wish me & my friends had access to run way like this 🤣
Fee fi fo fix that Golf R has had it's weetabix!
When my girlfriend starts talking about the future: 8:32
That golf is nuts 😂
Spec- 0:22 Sound check- 1:45 Drag race- 3:06  Rolling race- 5:06(5:31)  7:00 Brake test- 8:07
*I m still waiting here for Austin Martin DBX vs Lamborghini Urus vs Maserati Levante Trofeo*
Do diesel race!! Bmw and audi stopped production of strong diesels. U can do race sq7 TDI vs x5 m50d vs tuareg v8 TDI or m550d vs s6 TDI :)
A german channel. NICE👍
The A35 was already a disappointment (needs at least another 30hp) compared to it's sibling 45/45 S, but the driver just made it even worse. Hopefully the facelift A35 gets the much needed performance bump.
1st. VW=German 2nd. Audi=VW=German 3rd. German 4th German..........   this episode is for Carwow Deutschland
Bmw
6:15 *android noise*
its all fun and games until you bring the amg a45s
Dunno why I find it so funny when there's supposed to be a pinned comment and there isn't, classic carwow lol
Where FK8R?
Who drove the Mercedes is absolute shit... 2-3 second delay
They needed to put the a45s against the golf R
Volkswagen is absolut the best
A dumb who drived his BMW
Quickest 2.0T 4-Line German A45S
6:18 this face in BMW :D
Congrats German Premium Manufacturers you lost to a Golf
need to test track lap times performance. anyone can drive a car in a straight line.
Why didnt you use the A 45S Amg if you're looking for the fastest turbocharged 2l V4 hot hatch?
Can car wow do MVP
I think the times are not real because the m135 lose against the m140i at 1/4 mile and rolling race.  But in carwow videos the m140i has a 1/4 mile time 13,6.  How can that be?
M1 won the sound test
And where is yiani ???
Bmw sounds better
Bring de golf r vs A45s
Mat we are tired of Audi-BMW-Mecerdes..... When some Maserati? SQ4, Trifeo, cmon!! 😁
The bmw have no 4 Zylinder
Omg Mat. That was nice that you won!  You rock!
Disappointed with the amg...it looks the best though then the audi
Vw ist specialized on 2 liter 4 cyinder engine build, so no wonder it won 🤷🏽‍♂️
Should have used the golf gti not the r
But dont forget how much the price went up for the Golf R
How Matt apologizes for his weird accents 😂😂😂
Damn, VW has done the dirty on itself by tuning the golf higher than the S3.
Carwow Deutschland is Dope  Dean is the best ☻
The Golf has a Wednesday engine in it 🤙🏾💪🏾💥🔥
Toyota GR Yaris race what?
Of course the VW wins
That Golf R is definitely outputting 360-380bhp 😂😂
How about a DRAG RACE with the VW Golf R and a MINI Copper GP?
VW is probably cheating, the car knows its on the carwow strip and give you sone extra boost 🤣
I thought the S3 and the golf R were supposed to be the same car. What is VW doing having the golf R be more expensive and obliterating the S3 lol?
The merc driver (yet again) has the reaction time of a stone😒
Golf r vs amg a45 please!
Lol A35
That golf is just.... perfect.
That Mercedes driver got a crap start and wasn’t on time, waste man!
You should have brought the A45s if you're having the golf R, not the A35
You need to make reverse tests
Too bad the R is ugly.
Put the VW golf r against the rs3 a45 amg. I HAVE A FEELING IT COULD SURPRISE US
Jesus, that golf I have to admit... beast 👏🏽
Golf always will be the hothatch reference ! And the mk8 R destroyed the rivals ... lovely car
I assume this choice would help you attract more traffic to your videos. The cars should be very popular and affordable for those seek cars.
Maybe Merc AMG A45 vs Golf R
The A35 dips just before the line in the brake test
The 45s beats all of this hot hatches 😎but its a a35 why? A35 it's not a real amg....but the a35 ist the best looking car from all of this cars in this video🤷‍♂️😅
why A35？
The merc isn't  aligned to brake
a stage 1 or 2 will be as quick as a new m4 on the quarter....
No performance pack on the Golf R? :(
Even though it was second to last I would always choose the bmw ❤️ overall the better car IMO. Now if only I could afford one!
All the 2.0 turbocharged 4cyl cars are getting pretty boring by now....
2.3 bar of boost on that digital display. That looks like a LOT for a standard car.
a45s vs the golf r next
Cluster on the R looks like a downgrade from the 7.5R, each to their own though...
Bit of a pointless race in terms of manufacturer's best hot hatch. Put the R against a M140 xdrive, RS3 & A45S.
that is running current rs3 quarter miles... so its closer to 400 bhp
Why didn't you guys bring a Mercedes amg 45s
The R had the pre workout
Wait till the Americans find out that VW cheats again
Please Ford, make a Focus RS!
can u do- golf r vs a45s vs rs3
The new cupra leon with 310hp is missing in this drag race
Deutsh qualité
That VW Golf R is very quick
Mercedes cheated on break test!
Wow that Golf R is a beast. Pointless buying a used M3 when this Golf will obliterate most cars on the road.
Would be interesting to see how the Seat Cupra does against these cars also
Put that vs the FK8 on the rolling race
Golf R vs RS3 vs a45s
Why is the guy in the bmw sitting alone in the car and wearing mask 😷 🤔
Mercedes cheated the brake test
That Golf R is very fast, but as for sound test - I don't think any of them sounded that great IMO...
Matt chooses quickest car...shock!!
Golf R is on the class above this.  This thing will be a rocket when they start with the stage tunes.
As if the Golf R won't make mincemeat out of the others, an A45s barely keeps up / beat the new R.
The AMG was not on the line in brackingtest 🤪🤪
They should have the A45s instead od the A35
Just like the Audi R8...the R8 has has a Lamboghini engine...so it leaves me to wonder and ask what's under the hood Golf R????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔..its not a VW engine Can't be😂😂😂
Clutch mode no pun intended
Get that thing on the rolling road , I say 346 bhp
The GR yaris is missing from this drag race 💪
We need to see the mk8 golf R  go against the the m7.5 golf R  just to prove the couple of grand extra that you would pay on the mk8 R is worth it .
Soon there will be a VW bhp scandal
Shouldn't it be an RS3?
BMW sound best i think
The performance of the new R is definitely something else!
Im so sick of VW lying to us ;)
Matt please stick that R on a dyno. No way it's 320bhp. 3.94 secs to 60...Holy Sh*t
I wonder how the old m140i would compare maybe even the xdrive version
Bmw Sounds best as always❤️
Mercedes dont bother trying with the  luke warm A35. All the good stuff went in the A45S
A race that I've been waiting for... 😅🙌
A45s vs mk8 golf r needs to happen
is that a censorship thing or did other guys really was driving in masks and gloves on their own ? xD lol but that Golf though :) still too poor to even think about it xD
Audi exhaust sounds like the ventilation system of the VW 😂😂
Why don’t you choose AMG A45S? WHY ?????
Carwow hates Mercedes. Why is it always the Mercedes driver with the worst reaction? Change the driver!!!
The new Golf R vs The A45s please 🚧
I feel like I've seen this exact drag on carwow before - these cars just seem to not change at all
Why mercedes not A45??😡😡😡
1 BMW 1 séries 2 golf R 3 Mercedes A class 4 Audi S3
Take the VW on a dyno we want answers
Ok guys the actual race starts at 3:12
Why just A35 and no A45 same class no
Is this new Golf R still a press car?
Why did mat not use the a45s
This was the drag race many of us were waiting for!  Simply staggering how quick the Golf is and also how difference its performance is to the related S3! The Golf’s quarter mile is right up there with the next level performance cars in this class like the A45 and RS3. Stunning!
320 hp,  12.3 in the 1/4, Honda are you listening?
No replacement for displacement
In the States here we'll get the manual too, but that engine with the PDK !
Why not A45
Now I know why Matt always loses the brake tests, look at them 8:15 clearly behind Matt the S3 is completely behind the VW Golf R 😂
Use the A45s? No? Not it’s snot nosed little brother
Can someone explain to me what the freaking point is of a soft limiter?
And then you realise Mercedes has the 45s and the Audi has the RS3 😂
McLaren 720s Vs Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Try the Golf with an AMG A45
The mercedes would have performed better. Change the god-damn driver.
A45 would have killed the lot...
7:34 😂😂
Bmw
Why would vw have their bargain brand be faster than their luxury brand?!! It’s baffling...
My Farts can do a better sound check😂
The designer of that BMW is said to have taken inspiration from a hippopotamus when designing that car.
When Comes a dutch carwow yt channel
Sorry, but the Mercedes driver needs replacing
Why didn't they take the a45 instead of a35???
Yeah....VW is lying. There is no way that car is making 320HP, absolute bullshit. I say it's about 350,360
How was the A35 fine in the rolling race at the end, but so fucking slow the rest of the time? I dunno man, could the British version suck with launches? Ive driven a few of them and they feel plenty fast. That golf has more than 420 hp, and it launches really hard! Wonder how long the trans will last
Power of golf r should be checked on dyno-stand!
When Mat stops mentioning that he owned an AMG
But it doesn’t mean that you will get the same performance if you buy an R
Golf R - Check! 992 GT3 - Loading New Tesla S - Loading
After this result BMW considered to build an M140i...
Oooh, just what I needed. 3 of these are on the list to replace my STi RA, pending test drives, which is being promoted to track day car. Golf was already top and have to say was mighty impressive here.
mat: this golf R is so quick with 4 cyl turbo is nuts A45: sorry?
please include i30n to know what exactly happened
If only the GOlf wasnt an overpriced pile of cheap plastic bullcrap.
The BMW sounds the best...
That golf is running crazy boost pressure
Im so confused 😐
as usual, vws 300 hp > other brands 350.. thats why gtis with 260 eatings focus rss😭🤣🤣
the a35 would have lost the brake test but he was behind all the cars when they hit the rakes look at 8:13
The golf R has something about 360 hp an 500 nm for sure . Nice job
I hate that New 1 series with a passion...
AUDI!! 👍🤝🤝
BMW 335d vs 340i
You can fit the Golf R with an Akrapovic from factory
I like the comments from the other drivers
What is the technical differences between the Golf R and the S3? I thought they both have the same engine
The r vs the a45s next please
Why they brought the A35 instead of the A45s ? It would have had smashed them.. It's not fair knowing they are drag racing the "most powerful 2.0l of each german brand"..
The merc driver should get fired immediately
Get the golf on a dyno
Amg driver 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
No one noticed how the audi driver started jumpin about inside the car, just like with the aventador 🤣🤣
Golf is the most expensive?! Huh???!
Was it intake manifold pressure or plain turbo pressure that showing on first rolling race on the Golf?
That A35 is disappointing 😩😭😭
To be fair the R should challenge one of these car with a 2 grand value spended in upgrades. Tyres upgrades should be really interasting because increase traction and breaking. A larger intercooler might help both the performanceband cooling.
If we’re betting we knew who we put our money on lol.
i love how Mat and the S3 are just rocking in their seats
Cool!
Matt have you tested the mini clubman jcw yet?😈
How is the Golf R more expensive then an S3 now?!
Drag race them against Cayman 2.0...
Me: i want new Gulf R. My wallet: ahh just fuck off.
Safety comes first since Diana's death was blamed on Mercedes. They had to do something about the brakes
Hi matt, where is the a45s, this race is not fair.... 🤔🤔🤔
New 1 series is shite😫
I❤ VW
Hyundai i30 N best sound...
You must race that R against the a45 and the  tesla model 3
No point watching, just look at what car that smug git Watson is in then you have the winner
Look at this moment, when both drivers thinking jumping around the seat, makes the car faster 7:30
Bmw = sounds great
There’s a reason Vw owes all the brands xD
A35 is a joke
The merc cheated in brake test🤔
Pleaaase make carwow dutch!!!!
The Mercedes driver is in his own world in the whole video 😂
Should it not have been the Golf Gti in this field rather than R which should really be racing the A45 and RS3 instead?
Please make a video with a alfa romeo giulietta
We need a45s vs golf r
The lightest most powerful car won
Disappointed with the a35 really exspected more
BMW sounded the best by far, but that Golf R!!! Monster off the line.
This new VW Gold R is something else. Incredible performance for a 300hp car
golf R is god
Why does Matt hate Mercedes
The AMG boy cheat in the braking test.It can be seen 👎🏻
The golf 8 looks not that good as the previous model did unfortunately
Why don't you race a45? It's 2.0 litre 4 cylinder too?
Visual treat 7:25 to 7:37
Merc driver just doesn't know how to drive
Press plates power for the vw
We thought you was gonna race the A45s instead of A35
Golf R vs A 45 we need to see that race soon.
No joy for the VW
These drag races are incomplete without Yianni.
Golf sounded the best
i bet you to race it against A45
Only just quicker than the 1.6yaris.
Banger 🥵🔥
All sound shit
Matt has a calibrated arse😜😜😜
bro use a bloody a45s the a35 is just an unfair race wtf shouldve used the a45s 🤦🏻‍♂️
The R is 12,3s, RS3 12,4s and the A45S is 12,1 Amazing
Sound to the BMW The rear end looks to the BMW  The front end looks to the Audi and Mercedes Power to the VW
The R needs to be put up against better opposition. R vs FL RS3 vs A45s please...
Why not the a45?
Не корректное сравнение  все машины ехали не ровно .Этот то раньше газует то тормозит
smells like business 🤔
If u want to know wich is really the fastest u need the A45 S, havent watched yet but i bet the A35 didnt win
the BMW sounded pretty good
Is that golf blue or purple?
this video made me want to trade my stage 2 mk7R...
Question, which is the shorter time?  The time it takes a Golf R to get from zero to sixty miles per hour  or  The time it takes a Golf R to be stolen off your drive by a bunch of dodgy geeezers?   :-)
No other Carwow channel can win the sympathy of Mat like this one.  Thats why i Watch it 👌
VW for life!
"Simple" Golf just destroyed German premium Holy Trinity...
I have a mk7.5 Golf now, and I must say I like the mk8. With the right trim level, it does look good and the tech is just on point.
i am expecting a drag on audi r8 v10 performance vs ford mustang
Nice @Mat and @carwow!  Looking forward to a drag race between the new 8R and the new updated Audi TTS MY21, both „should“ have the 320hp. Maybe in the end, the difference makes the AWD system due to efficiency, torque splitter vs. haldex system!
Should be good race when they bring out the older bros rs3 m140i and a45s
That a35 driver needs some sleep....but not during a race 😂
What the heck did they do the  mercedes where is the real A45 ? 😭
Isn’t the fastest 2.0 four cylinder German hot hatchback the MB AMG 45s?
VW lied about the R's performance figures?? UNBELIEVABLE!!!! lol
Last or not the A35 still looks better than any of these!!! 😌
Thank you you son of a b****
Matt I'm disgusted, you aren't Brummie, you are from Walsall and so am I. We are yam yams, not Brummies lol.
Thank you you son of a b****
M135i sounds better
Use the A45 and see if the golf still wins
Но русской озвучке твой голос приятнее )))
VW teurer als Mercedes, Audi, BMW, good night.
That 8R it's so fast 😶❤
We need to see golf r vs a45s vs rs3
The guy in the merc was behind everyone else at the start of the brake test 🤷
Do it again with a CUSTOMERS car... There is NO WAY that R is 320hp!
Shame the S3 wasn't released with the bhp they announced, would have made for better races against the Golf R considering was still suppose to get an extra 10 bhp on top like previous gen.
7:30 I love how they doing the same thing
Who is driving the Mercedes? Bad launch and very early braking
Now i want to see the Golf R against the RS3, the A45S
I dream about having a Golf and I'm buying Golf 6 or 7 as my first car soon!
Endlich in Deutsch 😍👍🏼💪🏼
Matt is what you call a bad winner
all im thinking is "i cant wait for the new Rs3 !!"
Hi mat, how about trying it H2H against the RS3 8V.2.
Bmw sounds best
Does the guy driving the Mercedes always get his notifications from internet explorer or something.
PLEASE get me in to replace that Merc driver! Reactions are dire and can’t get level!
put the SEAT LEON CUPRA in these DRAG RACES !!!!!
Why didn’t u race the a45s ? Isn’t it a 2l?
Bring a amg a45s and they all will be blown out
Bmw
where is the arabic channel
Finally, a sunny day!
Right...after watching...time to get on autotrader and check out the  golf r lol
bmw sounds best
Having owned a mk7 GTI for 6 years i bought it new 2015. VW measures the horse power by wheel horse power not crank. So its probably 320 wheel horsepower and probably 340-350 crank horsepower.
The BMW wins the sound test, hands down.
BMW
There is no pinned comment
Then the A45s comes in and smashes them all........
Who was driving the Mercedes ?such a slow reaction
Why is there no race class for these hatches
The Golf R is the McLaren 720 of hot hatch for dragging
0-60 in 3.9sec is actually RS5 territory 😱😨 the new Golf R is actually a beast.
A45 watching this and shaking it's head😂
So the 12.5 claim on the GR was BS then 🤣
I love when matt tries to speak eith german accsent
Are you also looking for pinned comment?
Its the bmw
Bmw does sound the best.
Mat Watson: which is the quickest 2L 4 cylinder turbocharged german hot hatchback? Me: Uhhh where is the AMG A45s?
VW tweaking the press car?
The old pretender the  m140i  would still win the rolling race 🏁
The Mercedes Driver was Fucked he doesn't know how to drag race or do anything
Wolfsburg gives some extra Pferdstarke to the Mat's tests? It has so much powa...😈 Show us dyno stats 😜?
Well originally we all thought Matt was a secret bmw fanboy but now he definitely just gets off to this golf r and the yaris
Matt to answer your question, the quickest 2 l German hot hatch is the A45 S you didn´t test in this video... sorry mate, it is what it is ..
Golf R v a45s v bmw M140i
i think audi has to go back to the drawing board or just give the car 350hp and lie that it has 310
Next race 8R VS 7R
2.5 bat of boost in golf r ? This is stock boost?!
I think bmw need to make a propper 140i 6 cylinder on that new shape to compete with the gold r and a45s
Golf R has the best of all the worlds
The golf did the classic golf bong..... and I panicked and thought it was my golf 🤦‍♂️
Why do all these cars sound like a vacuum cleaner? O_O
Honestly i wasnt expecting that bmw sound that great on the new era of vacum cleaners exaust xD
7:32 it's much funnier seeing them from outside the window
BMW absolutely Ruined the M135i
@Kevin Mullins firstly let me guess that you are Merc Fanboy. Secondly this is a Drag race Video and is about which car is quickest. Thirdly I couldn't give 2 hoots that it's a second slower than the Golf R. I personally am more bothered about how a car drives on a fast B road rather than in a straight line. And as for your comment about being part of the pathetic YouTube generation. I turned 50 on Thursday so don't really think of myself as the YouTube generation but thanks for making me feel so much younger. Lastly I used to work for Mercedes-Benz and they aren't all that..
An Audi, a BMW, a Merc and a VW and the most expensive is the Golf, interesting... And also the fastest by a lot, nice.
R the Best
How the hell is the s3 cheaper than the golf r?
Golf 8 R don't need a stage 1
Rs4 + a45s 12 : 1 2019 Rs3 8v 12:2 Golf 8r 12.3 Audi S3 8y 12.8  The new Rs3 8y is going to be pointless
I only started to watch and i know the golf R will be the fastest.
I don’t understand. Audi and VW is the same company but Audi is supposed to be one step above right? The two cars are current gen, why is the Golf more expensive and better performing? Is this not supposed to be Skoda < VW < Audi < Porsche?
M135i is just so lame
The bmw has enough grille to share with all the others on the grid
Can you please do drag race between old MK7 golf R vs new MK8 golf R 😁😁. Coz I got old MK7 golf R want to see which one is fast 💨😂😂
320bhp claimed in the Golf R....who doesn't believe that for a second 😂....Ok note to self should watch complete video before commenting 😆
3:12
Why not A45s, it beats them all..!?
This was unexpected. What happened with the Merc? Anyway it's pretty lame that the human has nothing to do with these races anymore.
"No way the Golf R got 320 horsepower" 2nd video Matt said the same, gotta hit the dyno dude.
Matt, you need to put the a45s against the r. That will be a close race
Hmmmmm, more scandal from Volkswagen.
I’d like to see how the Mk8 would do against my Mk7.5 stage 1.  Definitely more than 320bhp there!
YESSS FINALLY THE NEW GOLF R i been waiting for this drag race in ever because i am a huge fan of Volkswagen and the golf r.
Please remove the drivers license of the Mercedes driver. Thx
Dosent the R and S3 have the same engine
R! Unbelievable!
surely the golf R should be put against the M140, A45s and the RS3 ????   the GTi would have been appropriate
When mat said which is the fastest  German 2.0 turbo charged Petrol engine.....he forgot the the A45s exists🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️
Isn’t the top of the range golf a golf r , so wouldn’t the audi be the rs3 and the merc be the amg s ?
The driver in Merc pulled brakes before the line
If the new golf r is that fast you need to put it up against the RS3 and AMG A45S.   See how it compares.   It might then tempt me to change my 18 plated golf r. Could you also put it against the last two golf r models to compare. The 296 and 306 bhp. Another brill video all. Mal
7:33 lol
Golf R needs to be put on a dyno
I don't want to watch Nazis but cheers
A golf costs more than an audi or bmw 😅
Don’t mess with the VW group woop woop
The air-conditioning in the golf car is louder than the Audi revving.
while you are at it with the 'grammatically correct' check, please tell Matt about sat vs sitting ;-)
Matt... where is the a45? This is unfair! Also the driver jeez disappointed as an amg fanboy😌
The A35 driver wasnt level at all in the braking test
Did not expect that golf r to be as quick as it is, really impressed!
Maybe because the Golf R's rivals are the A45s and the upcoming RS3?
One feels the Mercedes driver didn’t do the car any justice
That VW Golf R is a killer
I smell a rat 🐀  vw aint stock ! Would be at least 340hp  someone get one on a rolling road at lets see
I don't understand, I thought VAG always made the Audi slightly better than the VW?
The a35 didn’t even launch 💔
Wow the lexus is 300 f sport only has 241hp and 350nm. Way behind the Germans,  but more reliable and better too drive
Volkswagen pulled a sneaky one lol
Why use the A35 instead of the A45s? Or is it for price comparison?
But I like your German accent, it's funny!
Can we please stop with the mid video Spring Offer promo, most annoying 😤.  It would be better placed at the beginning or end of the vids.
First time a golf r won a race 😂
Vote which one sounds the best in the comment section below...   Yes....
dean from auto bild i can t believe it
Why are always sleepy people in those mercs on your channel? Are you trying to fulfill a cliche
Pure comedy seeing people drive cars on their own with masks on 😂🤡
Cant wait to see the 8R against the A45s, RS3 and whatever BMW has lol, not a fan of BMW's so idk if the 135i is the top of 1 series or not-
BMW sounds the best
it woukd be fun if the a45 woulld be there
why you didnt get the A45s
Voting to see Matt on carwow Germany in weird German accent
Woe Matts in the fastest car AGAIN , how lucky is he 😂
Seems to me the Golf has a tuned version of the Audi engine🤔
The Headshakes😂😂😂 7:33
Mercedes driver sucks!!!😡
That Audi is such a hideous thing
Rumours say that merc's driver is still getting leveled
Do a race with the real suv please
The merc driver could've of at least said I was sleep at the line during the drag race
Nice
Ford endeavour vs legender
Why don’t you do it against a45
BMW M135i sounded the best
Golf r doing what it does best
Based on recent carwow drag tests of hot hatches you can buy from new now (the new RS3 will likely slot in between the A45S and Golf R)  1 - A45S 415bhp (auto) 12.1 2 - Golf R 320bhp (auto) 12.3 3 - GR Yaris 260bhp(Man) 12.5  Prices (top spec) £58k / £45k / £34k
Golf winer
Result is expected now that the golf r is more expensive than the other 3 while being a VW... and it doesn’t have rs3 M2 a45s as bigger brothers so to it doesn’t have to stick to it’s claimed power figures in fear of taking sales away from them. VW just being cheeky here as we all know a slightly more aggressive tune on the EA888 can easily bring out more power and that’s what’s they’ve done. If you are happy with a VW badge with a 10k saving over the rs3 M2 a45s while being slightly slower then the golf r is for you. It’s just not the same 30k pound bargain hot hatch it once was
The AMG deserves a better driver!!🤓
audi fans:damn we lost  also audi fans:wait that was the S3 not the RS3
I have a feeling that if Volkswagen somehow managed to buy Ferrari, they would make the Golf R faster than the LaFerrari....
Golf gti would be better against this cars, Golf R is too high
VW must come out and concede already. He power that Golf pushes is misleading!
I feel like the golf is more aero than the rest as the nose of the car is lower and more air cutting compared to the flatter nosed rest
the mercedes driver replied a text, then decided to put his foot down.
BMW was the best sounding car
What a shit state the BMW has come to. RIP the true King of the hatch, M140i.
Sitting in mask driving a car , what a LOL
Carwow Can you make a race with  Golf 8 R vs Mercedes A45 S
Merc guy took a nap at the start... than proceeds to blame it on the car...
Why not determine the real power on a dyno. That would be interesting.
You can tell Audi, BMW and Merc have engineered their cars such that there is space above them for a headline model - an RS3, an M1 (or whatever they’ll choose to call it) and the A45
Golf r bit expensive
Why....not Mercedes Benz a45??? It is also a hot hatch....
Holy golf
How does the bad start of the mercedes influence the time, when its timed by the timing gear? I thought it starts to measure when you accelerate?
Fun and games until the a45 shows up
A class is the best
the golf r erupted like a volcano
7:32 passed the vibe check
I think they should’ve had the RS3, A45s and M140i
Use a Flash light for The Flag off.. please. That avoids any human error
I swear😎 I still didn't watch the video I'll take the stunts hatchback Golf R😈 the best one there I like just Im gonna say اللهم أرزقنا ياااا☝️ااارب
A45s vs golf R please!
I THING THE MERC CHEATED....😒🙄🙄
Volkswagen, Das Auto!
that Golf R is Superb!!
Interesting although as always this is about release dates as golf R was the slowest a few months back. I reckon m135i and A35 now need stage 1’s to keep in the game
What a Car 🔥🔥🔥 Golf R is going crazy 🤩 i think this car is in a other level
Mercedes 😂
The merc breaked slightly early too
RACE WITH A FORD Sierra coswortt please!!!!!!
Pieche family very happy 😃💕💕💕💕
I Like your shirt Matt !
VW R Golf is bad ass!
Th3 head bobbin is absolutely hilarious
God Bless Birmingham where everyone in considerably richer than YOWZ
BMW looks so damn ugly
First of all, u can't put a golf R in a drag race with the other 3 cars... To make it fair u have to race it with a BMW M140i, Mercedes A45 AMG, and Audi RS3. Top of the line platforms.
They all sound shite, despite "don't got soft" limiters....
Please search Golf R vs A45 s....Merc fan boys like me are really confused at this point
Perhaps should have gone for RS3, A45 M2 and golf R
How are all these hatches, except the Benz of course, so quick?
7:31😂😂😂😂
@carwow GET THAT GOLF R ON A ROLLING ROAD!
Cruise control at 50 miles per hour, and three, two ✌️, one 1⃣, go!
Now do that with the BMW 140i
Try to use a bmw m140i
Very surprised VW group has let the golf be so much faster then the S3
The golf which was purple in the previous video is now blue 😲
Bmwww
If I have a golf r I would de badge it 😂 so normal people think it’s just a gti
135m golfR? Highest in the line but Audi has an RS3 and AMG45s not a fare race
Could the R really have more than the said horsepower?
Who wants golf R vs mercedes a45?
Bruh the Mercedes driver has the reactions of a rock smh
Love the golf r
Race starts at 3:07
Someone bring the A45
BMW sounded the best
if you cant afford a CHIRON go for the VW R.....both are  the same one is ridiculously expensive the other you can just about afford it!
A 45s... not much else to say
I've heard from a man, who owns a dynometer, that many of the Vag group new cars have more than the producers declares.
Before watching the video i know that the golf R is the winner
Audi 🥰
much funny to compare golf with bmw audi and mercedes.  he is a lower class, having a strong engine is not a measure
Feels wrong that a vw is better than the equivalent Audi
Angry head banging for extra HP😂
Bring on the rs3 instead😏
Unfair Race it was supposed to be a GTI not an R
The Audi S3 would of passed the Golf R if the race was longer
Would like to see this golf vs the a45s mercedes
Great start ? False start !
@carwow can you do Skoda DRAG RACE for example Octavia ViRs, Scala, Superb.
Why dont you use the the A45s
2.5 Bar of boost on the VW? Wtf?!
How the R shares everything with the S3 & rips it in a stand-still & a roll hardly makes any sense! :-/
Merc won break test... The reason is.. Driver applied brake more on the previous tests 😂😂
35psi of boost in the golf.... something tells me it is a press car speciale haha
id like to see the R against the other cars bigger brothers. or the gti against the current line-up
Waiting for the race between the GTI vs 125ti vs whatever Merc equivalent vs whatever Audi equivalent. I have a suspicion the ti will get revenge for all the BMW fanboys
6:57😂😂🤣
The golf 8R is fast but don’t think will beat the A45s and New RS3
Golf r vs a45s then I'll say its fast
Why no a45 ??
Personally I think the Audi sounds best because it means you dont have to drive around like a massive prick annoying all your neighbours in a loud car.  No need to be that loud. And I drive an S5!
Where is the Mercedes AMG A45s🤔
why didnt you use the RS 3?
The vorsprung version of the S3 will probably be based on this platform of the Golf 8
Matt: "Goodbye Everybody" - Rafael Nadal Impressionist here😂
Its about time that the golf in its newest edition came out on top
Put the Gold R mk8 up against a45s and rs3 that would be interesting
What is going on with this golf R...its so good!!!
where’s the a45?
No way that vw has only 300 horses.
VW Golf R vs Amg A45/G63
Plz Review the new Volkswagen ID.4
Sun? You left UK for that test?
Why swidish accent for Germans
So what exactly happened: Well the AMG completely missed the start and therefore became last.
That Merc was behind the others before they hit the line
Check the accelerometer of the golf on the brake test, how many G’s??😊
As a BMW fan boy I would like to say. That is not a propper BMW !
Golf MK8 is a beast. Pity you can't buy it in South Africa that's an invitation to be hijacked.
Very interesting - Golf only 0.2 sec slower over standing quarter than the AMG45 Matt raced against the A35 last year - that Golf has some poke !!!
That a35 is wank 🤣
The BMW sounded the BEST...
Shame the mk8 looks so crap inside
Well done VW, nice tuning of that 'R' engine. German engineering at it's finest 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
That R lifts its skirt & becomes a Speedy Gonzales "¡Ándale! ¡Ándale! ¡Arriba! ¡Arriba! ¡Epa! ¡Epa! ¡Epa! Yeehaw!"
Why not put it into neutral and then rev it hard?
Such a shame the old M140i wasn’t available in xdrive in the uk. It would spank this whole line up!
VW Golf R MK8 Sounded the best
A45???
If you got the R you should've gotten the a45s and the rs3, or else just get the gti.. It felt kind off unfair to mercedes and audi
Should they not have raced the golf r against an rs3, a45, and m2? Still a very good video, but seemed a bit unfair as the golf r is the range topping model, whereas the others aren’t
I want to see this R vs your amg 45s
The M140i would kick there arses.
7:32 thats how petrolheads communicate
Matt: my superior driving skills??? Dude can stall even a manual bugatti (if it had). Let go others🤣🥺
7:33 Audi driver 😂😂😂😂
Is it just me that thinks the generation before these cars looked so much better? Barring the a35
Golf-R vs Mercedes A45s would make an interesting Race...with Matt and Yanny ofcourse😅
Go and buy steroids boys.
yo whats that Golf R??! under 4 seconds to 60? unbelievable
Carwow is really grinding with all these videos in 1 week
Missing the Mini gp. I believe will win
Feels like I have seen this drag race a million Times already on this channel😂
The Beema sounded great
lol they all look the same from the back
What do you think Matt’s age is?
Hey matt this is what I think of the video  great job. Sound check: 1 BMW 2 Golf -R 3 merc 4 audi Best looks  1 Audi 2 golf R 3 bmw 4 Mercedes  Next race recommended : Vw golf R vs Mercedes A45S
Ass dynometar🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If only it wasnt that ugly
New Golf is a fucking beast but man its too expensive. How can it cost more than Mercedes,BMW and Audi thats ridiculous...
0:02 & AWD
That Golf R is similarly fast to an A45 AMG. It's the new affordable pocket rocket.
The R is on steroids today..
Isnt the M135i 400kg heavier than the R? R is 1.5t and M135i 1.9t
Merc driver is my grandmother.
The track is too short for theses
BM z 💥
2:58 golf R
The R doesn't look as good as the others tho
Volkswagen beating 3 Premium German brands! They certainly are pushing everything with the Gen8 golf. Tiguan R is amazing, T-Roc R insane. Golf R smoked Audi, BMW, and Mercedes that's embarrassing for them lol.
If you want to see who’s gonna win the race - see which car Matt is driving 🤣
They have rewned the 1 series! 😔
It seems like that backwards and forwards body movement really made the difference in that rolling race
the Audi “don’t got” the sound..
Matt its time to introduce a drone in your drag races for cooler footage.
How is this video posted 40 min ago but I can see comments from an hour ago?
You always brakes really hard when you just wake up and realize your car is about to hit something. That's why the amg won the brake test because the driver was sleeping the whole time.
Mercedes has no 2021 update though it's like they are waiting and taking notes from their competitors and reviews first
I want to see the AMG A 45 or the 45 S against the golf R as it would be a much more closer race
Matt: Modest I am not.
Let's all appreciate the beast VW has made, wow I'm impressed by the golf 3.9s for the standing 1/4 mile in a 4 cylinder car 2.0L this is so blaming impressive, this is a supercars territory for that performance but in a mini hatch lmao. Definitely the best mini hatch in the world right now by a margin and I'm definitely getting myself one hopefully so soon. I'm gonna start saving up for this beast 😁 Great video mat especially with the German accent you pulled it off so well, it got me dying 😂 You are the best car reviewer in the world my man 👍😘
Now race the golf with an a45
The r only just loses to a a45 sby a whosker its crazy how quick that carreally is
GTI Clubsport vs Civic Type R ??
Now i wanna see race between vw r and audi rs!
7:33  david attenborough :  thiss is the special mating dance of these animals in the wild
Golf R with Akrapovic has the best sound by far aswell!
Bmw
Bmw sounds ❤️👍
Golf r vs a45s
Shame the new Golf R only comes in blue, black and white. I suspect they are looking to shift a shed load. Expect some decent PCP deals to come out soon.
5:48 2.5 bar boost in a stock car??? And 320hp on it??? Bullshit!!!
Why Golf is the most expensive one 😆
Mercedese start late
They all look horrible now compared to the last gen
Golf is boosted stage one to run 12.3 sek.....around 360 bhp....
my mind is blown by that golf r, 0-60 in FOUR SECONDS, IN A GOLF I still remember when Ferraris used to do that
Where A45?
Ok nice accent 👌🏾
Golf R vs 45s next please..
S3: hoover.
BMW 💪💪💪
Bring the A45
You're having fun because it's an actual sunny day in England 😂 so rare
So who’s gonna dyno that golf r? I call 350hp minimum
Well you didn't get the A45s. So you haven't got the fastest Merc hot hatch
Yet again Mr Matt almost, just almost lost the break test 🤣
BMW❤
I love the fact that they didn’t jut in 30 seconds of memes this time.
Damn that VW is crazy fast
The whole new automotive fakery: Massively underrating the engine figures in order to claim upperhand in engineering. That Golf has easily produces 360-70hp in crank.
Why not the a45s
Idiot in the A
The A35 is my favourite 😍
Hey mat why did u race from 0 only once?
I think the Golf R has grown up and now is allowed in the Super Hatchback Drag race.
I think carwow should use the timing gear to measure the braking distance for a more accurate data
Mercedes-benz should be afraid of vw I mean in my country the A45 cost 1 million dollars
Mechanically absolute rocket launcher... Esthetically a face only mother could love... Such a shame... And for 2000!! pounds less You can get the pretty nice s3?? No brainer
Most Cars really sound like vacuum cleaners now
Golf is very surprise because old model is run not good
7:32 those window faces, priceless haha
Should it not have been the GTI vs the others ?
You need to make the brake test more accurate and precise somehow
WTF?! Why Mercedes not A45s??? Ban for car wow!
3.94 secs wooo let's go damnn
I’m starting to think that in Carwow, they don’t even go home in between videos
Golf r vs a45s I'd like to see that one
All Merc fanboys in the comments are butthurt and that's just facts.
Archie Hamilton Racing: Been there, done that
The merc didn’t launch well
Infamous entry level drug dealer 4 favourite cars!🤣
I seed that the Merg in cheated in the break test it started stopping before the line
BMW sound
Not really a fair race bc golf is top spec and all the other German's are mid spec
WTF is the Golf R doing? Insane!
Can you code the soft limiters out?
A35 is not the most powerful 4 cylinder 2L engine the A45s is??????
A35 please.
That golf has more than 320hp.
And the winner of the most boring hot hatch goes to....... All four generic German boxes 😴😴😴
I’m hoping VW have lied about 0-60 times and bhp so the us mk8 golf r owners can have cheaper car insurance 😉
This golf does 1/4 mile only 0.2 seconds slower than a45s, thats the level!
You see that the A45s is years ahead of its competitors when CarWow downgraded for the A35!
THE KING IS BACK  R🔥🔥🔥
u should make another race with a M140i, a45 and RS3
If the Golf has 320hp I will eat my hat
The Mercedes stopped way too early
The Mk 8 R needs to be in FH4
The R is great, no doubt, but £40k is just insane.
It’s 320 at the wheels
Huh, german channel, german language, malay reviewer, interesting
The golf R is more in the a45s section
Why did you get the fully speced vw but not the fully speced Mercedes🤷🏽‍♂️ which is the a45s  Also why not the RS3🤷🏽‍♂️ think about it guys
I am guessing the Golf R has about 10% more power than stated, like usual. What is their goal? claiming their cars are faster with less horsepower?
But if you used RS3 in this race, it would be a lot different...
You should do a rolling test in cruise control, clicking the switch to increase the speed to keep it
mercedes was a bit behind the others before braking zone at the end
The old golf 7 r 310hp has on dyno 320hp 100% standard, so the new golf 8 r 320hp has minimum 340hp on dyno.
Need golf R mk8 vs golf R mk7.5 drag race
whoever was driving the mercedes needs to wake up
Germany needs just 300-350 hp to crack sub 13s 1/4 miles. Americans  need over 500. Funny how bad US engines and engineering is
m135i golf r a35 and rs3 instead of s3
Who could have guessed that the car with most HP is best an the one with least is last in dreag-race :D to my this shows, how close these are in quality to each other
Why the A35 and not the A45s?
Golf R press car - extra tune ? ;)
When u just said 4 cylinder 2 liter I was like where’s Porsche 718
Yes I called for this race, when you were reviewing the GOLF R. And oh boy oh boy, it did win convincingly. BMW and Merc fanboys go to the drawing board. It's clear that the king of hot hatches is back.
i was expecting that, because the Golf is all new, and it's the main model of the Volkswagen Group, so it has to be the fastest...
“There’s no way this car has just 320 hp”  Mat, you realise you are in a VW, what did you expect?
Volkswagen engines are always perfect and they will be forever
Well it wouldn't be like VW to cheat would it. Sent you a remapped car. 👍
Bmw
VW group
BMW M135i sounds the best
This isn’t a really fair race is it? The Golf R is the top of the range from WV to make this fair is should be the RS3 A45S and M140i then we will see how good that golf R really is
I wonder what the T Roc R would do against these cars
That Golf drank red bull today
Possibly the last real Golf R , with all VW investment and focus now on Electrification.
At least seeing this comments saying that Merc driver could done it better but still just like mat say it would come last , because he's best time is 13.4 and they all had under 13sec.
Emission scandal won
Please make a video of a a45s vs this R
All of them sound pathetic
Liked the 0-60 reading at the end, a new regular maybe?
Not like Mat to pick the car most likely to win a drag race 🤔
Would be interesting to see the M140 v the Golf. That new Golf is brilliant.
another advertisement for vw,audi, mercedes and bmw...but most of vw group as usual.....pfffff
you didnt soundcheck the bmw
What such small cars and all of em weigh more than 1500 kilos 😕
what? how did the AUDI S3 not keep up?
You can invade Poland with all that german trucks
Yianni couldn’t make it last minute so they had to use a random bystander to drive the Merc. Otherwise I don’t get it.
The R is pretty fast..
Am I the only one who thinks that the old Golf R is way better looking than the newer version? The new Golf looks more like a Polo IMO :/
ironic golf R is the most expensive one
The golf r has 400hp🤣🤣
Is it just me, or have these 3 hatchbacks gotten uglier over the years
BMW the best still for me
What's with the guys alone in the cars wearing masks🤭🙄
KuruHS won the race 😂
I think mercedes didn't pay u well Mat
The Merc is performing about the same as the Merc W12 in pre-season
7:33 to 7:35 My goodness they are vibrating like shit.
The german car won
Wait... What? A video without the GR Yaris?
I suspect VW press office handed Matt a special RR version cos they knew he was going to race it. No way that car is standard
an a45s is also a 2 liter turbo, isn't it..
What didn't happen in this race: Matt not being in the quickest car.
i must say the BMW sounds the best
VW have been using their cheating software again eh......
I guess Mercedes is "slower" but also "better" at braking because of the aero kit it has...
A45s vs the Golf R would be a nice race and yainni or matt must be in either car so we know both cars have good reaction time drivers
Surely Volkswagen wouldn’t map their press cars they are lending out to all the youtubers to help sell them? 🤣   Because they defo wouldn’t have lied about diesel emissions for 10 years would they 😂
The simple of it is that A35 driver was being useless
The A35 is so lame. All people I know that have one buy it in a ridiculous colour and think that they have some kind of exotic lambo... Also modding it to death... Just buy the A45S and be done
Race the mk8 golf R with the Amy A45s!
Volkswagen group domination here 😂
Shouldn’t the golf R be up against the A45s, RS3 & M140i ??? It is the most the golf has to offer!!
7:49 "I'm really enjoying it today don't know why" Maybe because it isn't raining like every other day and it's a rare moment where the weather is actually good and sunny lol.
7:34 thats so fucking funny lol 😂😂😂
This race would be good to have included the old golf R
I wonder what the difference would be if you would take the a45 in place of the a35
Regardless of results.I will always stick with Mercedes just for the comfort.I knew it's gonna be best in brakes though as it's Mercedes after all.
need a45s
Vw expansiver than MERCEDES-BENZ  Hahahaha
My suggestion mat, get yourself an INSORIC power measurement device. You stick it on the middle of the back wheel. Make 2 flat out run in 3 or 4th gear and get a power output reading. Measurements are consistent and as you would measure all cars with the same device, measurement errors would not be relevant. It would perfect as lie detectors for some manufacturers I reckon! And would be a new great figure to check im real life from Car Wow
Should see how it does with the A45
I think vw group gave Audi wrong packed lunch
why no cupra?
All BMW just went from cool to boring The 135i should have remained with the 3.0 engine
Should’ve been GTI for a fair comparison
Where’s the guy that says “spoiler alert the German car won”?
M135i definitely sounded the best but that Golf R has just raised the bar again...
Did i read like 37 psi pf boost on the golf? Said 2.5 bar. Thats a lot of boost.
The R might be the fastest, but it is certainly the ugliest out the four.
Would have been fun with a EV and Hybrid hatchback in the same race.
Considering the R is the top of the range Golf, isn't it unfair not to test it against RS3,AMG45S ?
Golf is obviously remapped. A shame VW Press Office supplied it like that because it ruins the whole competition.
No Mercedes driver I'm sorry but your launch was not ok at all
Why is the Golf purple again?
VW at it again with the fake numbers.. pfff 320hp
I never get used to cars having their engine at the back? Always a shocker
Bmw sounds the best with its  pops🤡
A45s 2litre  4 cylinder 🧐
BMW need to man up jheez that golf is fast
Why not do the A45s, RS3, Golf R instead
Imagine how fast the new rs3 is going to be🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
a35 ?? where is a45 not s
Do a trackhalk please
A45 AMG ?
So we just gona pretend the a45s doesn't exist in this races???🙄
Nc german accent matt
The GOLF R its runing for wins
Mmmm where is the A45 S? 🥸🤔
The guy in the Mercedes is really slow and dumb, the Mercedes could have done a better job if it isn't for the slow driver.
Why don’t you just use the same GPS or whatsoever device you’re using to get the results of acceleration and breaking for each car, and that’s it? For sure a drag race is more fun, but not 100% fair.
Isn’t it the same DCT in the Audi and Golf?
Mat can y'all race the McLaren 765lt and the Porsche 911 turbo s
When the VW Group decides to make a VW faster than an Audi.
I am on the fence with the golf's dashboard but it's a pretty nice car
U should do it with your a45s
Thinking how much damage golf R will do to amg 45 ?? Hummmm 🤔🤔
Thats  a 1st golf r winning something. I think bmw and Mercedes need 2 sort these crappy little cars out and start making them good again, getting beat by a golf (embarrassing)
When for a French Carwow? Interesting result thought
I reckon the R can beat an A45s
Golf R sounds best 🥴
Bmw💚
German battle.
Why not take the rs3 and the amg a45
Watch the brake test again MERCEDES braked just before the line.
Guessing the Golf R isn't really an A35 AMG competitor anymore 😂
i was sick every time golf r lost a drag race against those cars,but now it's something else..im happy 100%🤸‍♂️
Would still take the mercedes. Man the interieur is gorgeous. People always rate cars by their outside look, but forget that they will see their own car 99% from the inside when they drive.
His voice is different
The story will change when the GOLF R meet the new RS3 and the current A45S.
With the right spec it’s over £40k... for a golf. Creeping into “almost new” S4/S5/M340i territory which would arguably be a better, no?
7:33 u got moves Mat
Bmw sounded the best!
Still wouldn't have the Golf or Audi due to the interior.
Ι believe that it's not about 1/4 mile... but the interior and exterior... the Mercedes is better to all the above.. and I own a bmw 118i sport line
I'm here for the GR Yaris
Atleast the A35 won something 😂💔
MK8 R should try against the A45s and RS3, its in a different league now!
Audi is the best looking if them all
sub 4s in a fucking stock golf man
Havent we seen this one already
Is your granny driving that A35
It would have been nice if the gr yaris was too there
the R should go against the A45, RS and M140. This R is LEGIT
We need A45s AMG (Mats gf) VS Golf R (Mat).....definitely need this🥂
Learn the driver in mercedes to lunch so bad
Where’s the a45?
German accent spot on. :)
When!!!!!  comes my golf 8 r  in korea!!!
The weird German accent is hereby forgiven. Move along.
Next vw tuareg vs Mercedes gle
I have always had Corrados and Golfs, fantastic engines. Love the Golf R
Bmw sound is much better
How the hell is a Golf R more expensive than an Audi S3🤣🤣🤣
We need A45s AMG Vs Golf R......
Both the vw and audi drivers were moving their head backward and forward for extra hours😂
BMW sound's great
12.3 s is incredible time for a hatchback!!! Imagine just if he warmed up the tires!!!
modern cars sound shite.and all this auto box well thats wank also
It's funny how test for the best hot hatch is all german cars it's like the world= germany
Carwow definitely deserves to be featured in the next Youtube Rewind.
matt sounds like his been smoking weed for living
Take the golf R to a dyno test
Golf R after always being beaten: look at me, I'm the boss now!
We need to see Alfa romeo giulia quadrifoglio vs Bmw m3 vs Maserati ghibli trofeo vs Mercedes amg gt 4 door that would be a good race
I would definitely pick the amg bcs of the exterior and the interior
i wish mercedes in my garage
That new golf R is off.. 🚗 💨
Should of been a RS3 Audi tbh
Put an i A45 not a A35 you idiot
The golf R will always be the best hot hatch
I mean i live in Germany but i like your Reviews and Stuff more than this on the German Channel
After this drag race : A45s joined the chat 😈
I'm drunk right now😂
The most expensive car won, what a shocker!!!!!!!!!!!!
But every other car has a far superior interior. That of the golf is just bad for the price you pay
8:47 the Mercedes braked early
porche cayyene: am i a joke to you
Now line up this Golf R vs AMG A45 S
Fam are you dumb? Why are they using the A35 instead of the A45 that’s bs plus all the other cars are top tier in their class.
Stop bringing crazy drivers 🙄😤
7:30 remember guys and girls moving your body give you extra boost horsepower 😂😂😂
Make a swedish channel also, Theres only one big Youtuber and its 925motor
A45s vs golf 8r vs a45 2018 vs 7.5R next. Make it happen.
I'm kinda disappointed by the Merc..😐
Γκολφάρα!
I’m so surprised by the Golf, especially by the fact it doesn’t have a soft limiter. It’s crazy! Definitely more than 320hp.
2.5 bar in the Golf! That's a lot of boost!!!
If the bmw m135 still had a straight 6 the outcome would have been different
Yet again he chose the fastest car. Lol, smh...
???? XD
How can you use vws top of the range vs the second range of the rest.. that's dumb
My first Hot-Hatch did 0-60mph in 11secs (XR3) non injection.  Today it's less than 4 secs 😳Thank goodness 17 yr olds can't afford the insurance
A45 smash them all.
That Mercedes driver was sleeping
I'm genuinly sad about Audi sound game these days..
I have a suggetion for these drag races. Since most of the cars have a rev limiter you should put a go pro camera above the exhaust so we can hear it while the car is driving
Golf Mk8 🔥
why didn't y'all use the A45🙄
Needed the a45s here
Mat channeled his inner Yanni during the 2nd rolling race
Golf r what a machine
I feel like the new golf r is the new 911 for this money
That Mercedes A35 driver must have been asleep. All the other cars were off when he was still sitting there with his break lights on. Watch in slow mo is so clear it was the drivers terrible reactions
Stinger gt vs bmw m5 competition
That Golf R had Carling black label
BMW sounds best
I think it’s time for the Golf R to start racing the bigger boys. GG’s Golf R!
To answer your question from the beginning: the A45S.........
Volkswagen have blown the R out of the park! What a machine
What about pricing diffrence?
Goooolf!!!
My grandma has a better reaction time than the Mercedes driver
Golf R has finally surpassed the s3. Better than both being the same as the previous gen. Can't wait for the new rs3
RS3 vs Golf R vs A45S
VW can just build hot hatches not one can beat them 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ VW groupe is just in another level
You look fresh in this video 😆 I can tell you just woke up before making the video
We need the actual power of that golf coz every review I watch I'm convinced there's more power...but to me the results makes sense...considering this is the top of the range golf against half trying Audi BMW and Merc...
right that r has more than 320hp that is for sure
7:28 best moment 🤣
golf at the start of the rolling race: call an ambulance golf a second later: but not for me   Edit: OMG OVER 400 LIKES IN 6 HOURS MY RECORD IS 800 THX SO MUCH
R sounds the best no question
Damn cars have come to this remember the good s3 the good golf mk5 the a45 they were cars cars turbo noise bangs way better than these it’s like all cars after 2015 are electric I hate it
i wish someone would dyno the R. 3 or 4 of them and not press cars.
Would love to see the Golf R vs AMG A45S
Shouldn't they get rs 3 instead of the S version ... ?
The guy in the Merc reacts the same in every race, he's too slow
That Mercedes driver should not come back
The amg driver is rubbish
Sound checks nowadays aren’t so much about which car sounds better, but which sounds least worst
Golf vs a45 s
R will destroy them for sure 💀💔
Seems like the A35 started braking just before the line, s3 on the line and the golf/bmw after the line. If it’s for accuracy using something to record distance to stop from inside the car should do better
We all new what was gonna be the result cuz we already saw and s3 drag race an a35 and bmw 135i and the audi crushed them and mk8 just came past the Audi I’m really surprised by the mk8
The next most watched video on YouTube the New Golf R on a dyno 😂
Hi 🙋
Hot hatches are shit now
Is this is what the R can do, imagine what the new RS3 will do!
Next drag race: Porsche 911 Turbo S vs Mclaren 765lt
I'm guessing you didn't use the A45 because of the price difference? Because that would have smashed the Golf R, and is the true hot hatch king
A drag race between the Golf R and the Amg A45s
That S3 ain't worth £37k at all. Audi failed this time round on this new gen S3 tbh 🤦‍♂️. Would much rather go buy myself the 8P.
just use the A45s cmonnnn
No. The launch wasn't ok in the Mercedes! He conked it.
I think the golf R was supposed to compete against the S3, M1 and A45 The GTI is more compatible in this DR
Those performance figures for the Golf R are definitely underrated
3:27 Absolutely destroying the field(coughs coughs) "world"
You should have hired Hans, the Angry German. He has a yt channel called Speed Comparer.
That new Golf R is the 911 Turbo of hot hatches.
Dear Merc driver. The peddle on the right ▶️
My 500bhp Cupra with the Golf R engine would look good on a Carwow video 👀
Wow for the first time the Mercedes is the cheapest of the bunch
Merc was really praised on this channel at one point if i remember correctly
Bmw has the best sound
07.32 😂
Where was the A45s??😐😐
If I was a cynical man I’d say that that VW press car has a little tuney tune on it. Could be wrong though but seems a little sus. Would be nice to rerun with a customer car.
LETS SEE A GOLF R vs A45 AMG RACE.....😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Woww
@yiannimize shouldve been in the S3
Wow that golf r 🤩🤩
Need a cupra in there
put golf 8R against a45s and rs3. dyno the golf too
Beautifull Golf R ! classic design and ...Strong engine ! love it
I’d still rather the a35 to any of the other cars
Unsurprising the R is winning everything, it is the golfs top tier. Put it against the A45, M140i & RS3 and it’s a completely different story.
Nah that stupid golf has had some kind of ECU tune or aftermarket work. No way it does a 12.3 1/4 mile time stock.
The New R was so close to A45s 1/4 mile time in another video
The poms use horsepower with newton metres instead of foot pounds. The poms also use the metric system but use miles per hour. Half way there guys, just a bit backwards hey
A45s AMG should have been there
AMG was not level with the rest on the brake test 😂😂😂😂
Nice shirt Matt
Bmw need to sack their designer, damn they are ugly
I’m confused about this race, so it’s a Golf R which is the top of its range against the not top of the range merc or Audi ? Surely these cars are more for a GTI ? I know the Volkswagen people won’t like that because the Volkswagen would lose that race, but just seems abit of an odd pairing. I get it’s trying to take into account price but with that argument I’d be better off buying an old RS7 for 40k (yes you can) as they are classed as hatchbacks... feels like it’s a race made to make the Volkswagen look good and not an actually competitive race.
4 vacuum cleaners dragging along the carpet. The Golf R probably has 340hp
Golf R!!! Madness
When did the golf r become the more expensive option?? 🤔
This proves Vw group always lies.
The Merc driver clearly doesn't understand Matt when he says: "GET LEVEL"
Can we please see that Volkswagen Golf 8R against the Mercedes AMG A45s.
How funny is watching everyone moving their head like pigeons when they pass each other 7:26
Audi has the best sound...Silence is gold
That Audi is super ugly!
A45s vs Golf R vs Cupra Leon drag race please
New Golf R v BMW M140i next
BMW sounds the best
I'm just disappointed it's not the a45s amg cause that would have won easily i mean come on its just less fair this way you pick every top of the range from every carbrand but not with mercedes that's a bit sad.
Did the a35 driver have no legs? Still stationary when others had gone. Shockingly bad drag race. At least get some consistent drivers
Audi RS3 with 400 HP has 3.9sek fron 0 to 60 too, holy cow. Thats 80 HP more.
Seriously now someone needs to put one of these new Mk8 Golf R's on a rolling road as Volkswagen's claimed power figures do NOT add up. I believe it is producing between 360 and 370bhp. At least.
Really annoys me when U don’t us the A45S
The Golf the most expensive lol
We need 140i vs Golf 8 R!
Should be an rs3
Best Sound m135i
Tuned golf r vs 911 turbo s
Let’s see the Golf R vs the AMG A45 and see how it works out
BMW SOUNDS THE BEST!
Please make a dragrace with the new clubsport
Golf R 💪
you cant decide which car is the ugliest.
AMG A45s vs the golf plz
The Mercedes guy was out yesterday night 😔🤷🏿‍♂️😏
IT doesnt
Mk8 R is like the cheap 911 turbo of hatches
I'm i the only one that also goes, "Carwow, your one stop car buying comparison site"
Bmw have gone so soft from the m140i..that thing destroys anything in its class.
Audi RS3 has around 400Hp and did the 1/4 mile in 12.3 second   That Golf R can't be stock😳
Which one of these cars is the fastest 2-litre-turbo-4-pot-300hp-AWD-automatic-5-door-1500kg-GBP37k German hatchback of them all?  Yes.
BMW driver sounds like he should have his own YouTube channel. Good voice and personality 👍🏼
2.4 bar on that golf r, holyyy BOOST, definitely more than 320 hp on that beast
But also a channel for Belgium and the Netherlands
A stage one on this golf R is going to see it through to 420/440 hp
Would like to see the golf R versing the A45 AMG to see how close it gets
I want that golf
Funny how the GOLF R had almost same time for 1/4 mile as Audi RS3 :D
the mercedes guy had granny reaction times
A45s???
BMW sound is better
The BMW looks like a minivan. Damn that’s horrible.
Doubt they R as more than 325 bhp. They’ve just nailed the formula on it, if it had anymore power it would have done better in the rolling race
You should do a drag race of mercedez amg A45s vs golf R
The golf is ugly, so is the bimmer and so is the audi. The merc looks good. Winner for me.
BMW has the best sound
Ahahah that 7:32 headbang in both cars got me dying 😂😂😂
A golf gti would’ve been a fair competition
They should have gotten the most powerful versions of these cars
How come the S3 doesnt have sequential turning signals in the brake test?
Who was driving a35? You grandma 👵?
It‘s a VW. Of course it‘s a cheat :)
Whos was driving the Mercedes, nice reaction time
The Golf R has plenty of beans & goes like billy-o!
Dude - been watching you for years and yesterday I saw you on TV.  I got excited about a tv advert. What gives??
Matt always in the winning car
When are you going to start doing similar with EVs?  Grouped by price
If a golf R does 3.9 stock. We are about to see 3.4 2022 RS3 (will not be launched in 2021).  Utterly insane! And we all love it 😁
I do like the English videos more than the German ones.
Please 🙏 put the golf in drage race with a45 s and rs3
Nice cars tho. But i prefer s3
Get that Mercedes driver out of here. The A45 has a lot of potential.
The BMW is the best
Bmw sounds nice
The BMW sounded the best followed by Golf The Golf looks, drives and feels the best. In fact the Golf R was a fraction of a second slower than the new A45 yet its £20k cheaper and has 100 horsepower less. For me this new R is the rightful king of the hatchbacks right now until we see the new RS3.
Need to get a golf r 8 on the dyno
What's wrong with the Merc driver?
Where is yianni and what have you done to him
So what exactly happened. Well the ......
BMW
Mat is always taking the newest models..that's not far
Next time Golf gti clubsport instead of the r
The worse design still BMW
All of them look worse than the previous versions. Especially that BM
12.3 bone stock isn't bad
Golf R vs m2 comp vs a45s vs rs3 That would be great
The updated race we've all been waiting for!
Fuckin 2.5 Bars of Boost in the Golf! Jesus
Here is missing the seat cupra
Try drag racing The R8 v8 manual against the 2010-ish rs4!
That s3 is very fast for 310 hp
This race was obviously to show off the Gold R, otherwise it should have been against the M2 / AMG45 / RS3
I have a Theory.. that some manufacturers are understating performance figures to obtain lower insurance groupings? Even my car does 0-60 in 6.4 instead of the manufacturer’s 6.9
9:02 Volkswagen being Volkswagen throwin up the good ol check engine light in a new Golf.
Great time for a 4 cylinder engine Golf R, but this body style does not look good.
Unfair for the Merc. U should have an a45 there
Why does the A3 looks like a SUV compared to the A Class ?
We need the A45s😧
Fast but boring and unemotional cars mind. Good video though guys!
bmw sound best
Tweaked press Car Golf R?
why you always give mercedes to sleepy drivers
VAG press car always have more HP than they claims
Coming from a fan,  if  you had a AMG A45s it would have destroyed them all it's not fair that you got a a35 instead , I like everything else about your chanel
Legends say the amg driver is this sleeping at the starting line.
woooooooow the golf is now the most expensive?
You should get golf r vs a45
Why are all the other drivers wearing masks lol
it should be a45s. why a35?
A45 vs golf r please
I like how Matt and the Audi S3 driver move their heads as they’re neck and neck lol 😂
Mat should always be in the most powerful car in every drag race he does.
McLaren 765lt please
if only the golf R wasnt that ugly...
Ich guck trotzdem weiter hier.
Mercedes driver was asleep. Totally away. Then woke up and accidently pressed throttle.
Golf maybe quick but it’s still a golf, I see them everywhere!!!!
Yo Watson ... Favour request here block... Drag the new m3 or m4 with a stock Audi Rs5 and a Stock c63S...   Please drive the MERC...  Please!
Amazing drag race mat absolutely love it that Golf R is a MONSTER totally destroyed the track and the other cars well done
That intro - which is the quickest 2.0 litre German hot hatch, doesn’t race the A45
The golf and Audi look like the eco versions of each model!
Rune scimitars have dropped in price since 2010, not really a good investement.
Oooeee oooahhh!
I'd love to see the old A45 vs these cars.
And then comes Honda Civic Type R - kills everyone in the line. :'(
Golf ist still a Golf...
7:32 ; there are two chickens driving cars?!
Merc on the brake test was trying to stop before the line rather than start braking on it...makes Yianni look like he doesn't cheat ☺
Vw golf 💪👌👏
I had 3.9 second on my stage2 s3 364 hp 👀 that VW...
I got the Germanized English better.
The responsible basketball immuhistochemically drop because texture seasonally behave onto a poised birth. cumbersome, crabby college
They should take the golf to the dyno
When a chicken drives a car 7:32 Lol 😂
7:33 is when i see someone vibing at a red light and i join in
It’s a shame that the new Golf R looks so ugly although it’s a beast
Why not a gold gti the golf r needs to go vs audi rs3 bmw m2 and mercedes a45 amg
That Golf R is fast
The r sounded the best
golf is fast bucket
7:32 UK pigeons
I'd like if the performance figures show like the weight and the price
That golf r is mad should race it against the a45s
Bmw sounded brst
It's all nice and good in the golf until the check engine appear 09:01 😂
Golf R v A45s v RS3, that's where we should be seeing the mk8 not here
I can't be the only who saw Merc at the brake test was a bit far behind before the line..
Why does mercedes always drive the gut? 😵 by the way
To put that into context, a 2016 prefl Rs3 with 370hp stock 1/4 mile time was about 12.4sec. It's a little heavier so the claim of 340 to 350hp seems very plausible.
*SPOILERS* The German wins
Drag race Buaigtt vs  koenigsegg
BMW
Finally the Carwow Girl is back. Good to know that the voice and person now match. Good to see her back.👍🏼
Shouldn’t this race be between the new Golf GTI vs the rest? Just a question.
Why didn't you guys use the A45 AMG?
stop giving the merc a bad driver please🫂
but for me the a35 is the nicest car
Keep the bmw guy!!
They should get a drone camera to record the brake test from a top down view.
7:27 mat and audi driver😂😂😂
A35 driver had one job..... fuck me
Welp.... Golf R's are going to be stolen even more now.
Golf Rocket
is there a french carwow ?
Have you launched the a class late on purpose or?
حلو
Why you did not bring a45 a35 is slower
7:33 the Audi driver and Mat 😂
an American channel?
My ps4s louder than the Audis exhaust
Der Akzent war echt frech haha
Shouldn’t you have done it against a 140i, a45s, and an rs3 as the golf r is top of the range 🤷🏻‍♂️
Don’t got 🤣
Why is VW lying tho?
The newer cars are beating my intelligence. VW GOLF R beat an A35 AMG. Let that sink in.
What's going on with that Merc?? It should be much faster....
victory to the Golf R. I loved the pops from the M135i.
Wheres the Akrapovic exhaust on Golf tho
3.9 seconds 0-60 in a golf!? Oh my god haha
Golf been drinkin Redbull before the race
M135 has the best sound! Or should I say, M135 is the only one with sound....
Mercedes driver needed his pillow and then he lags behind everyone else in the brake test to cheat a win???
Watching the Mercedes lose was not easy
A45 instead A35 next time....
Do the new golf R vs the new a45s vs the old golf R vs the old a45
What an amazing performance from the golf R, it really something else that car
why you are not checking with specialist timing gear all the cars acceleration and braking - we would have a clear statement - and now we need to figure it out in between the lines
Would be interesting to see how the GR Yaris / Litchfield GR Yaris would have done
Should have went with a45s instead of a35.
Mat i want to see the golf r mk8 vs rs3 and m2
BMW sounds best followed by the VW. Can audi S3 powerslide just like golf r?
Do a vid of the r on a dyno !
Finally the Golf R has come out of the hot hatchback shadow in the past I would’ve taken the GTI over the R any day not this time
I like the looks of my mk7 golf r more but God damn the performance of the new golf r is just insane! That thing is on steroids
Where's the a45s
7:33 THE DUCKING BATTLE HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Mercedes.. ? Mercedes guy says: The launch was OK... No it wasn't, u was sleeping...
Can you race a single turbo 335is vs a new bmw ???
Bmw
Why the Mercedes Drivers always sleeping ?
Typical Carwow putting the worst driver in the Merc XD
Looking from a different angle it's top of the range vw golf against second in line merc and audi. If you were to test golf r, a45s and rs3 the result will be probably different
Doing launch face
Golf R vs a45s
The golf had the best sound
A drags race Carwow needs to do is race a normal everyday hot hatch like the Golf R against a supercar like the Aventador SVJ, but giving the Golf R a headstart of 3-5 seconds
That R 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The golf R vs the m140i rolling race 👍🏻
Golf r
Golf R the best
Golf R vs A45s vs M140I
They kinda look the same from the back
Audi and Merc clearly braked before the white line whereas BMW and VW a tiny bit after white line - so there is your diff
7:33 Audi Driver :D
The Golf is the most expensive one 🤣🤣🤣🤣
the golf r
Never bring that amg drivers worst than my 75 year old grandad
The VW's here in this comparison have more power than they claim. With the Golf being much higher than the Audi S3. Reason being the upcoming RS3.
From the side  , the M135i looked like a Focus ! Horrible design .
Golf R > A35 > 135i > S3
Bmw sounded best
M135i Sounds the best
Remember when bmw 1 series stood out from the rest, good times
I'd like to see a drag race with the new CUPRA Formentor 5 cylinder
Golf R vs A45s vs RS3 vs Supra 2021 😍 is gonna be epic to see where the R stands
All the people saying the Mercedes driver was sleeping own an a35 😅👍🍻
Merc started breaking about 3s before everyone else 🤣🤣
The Merc cheated in the brake test very badly
Mat you in the last breaking test you started breaking before.
I think i am the only one that thinks the 135i looks best
The dislikes are from the A35 AMG owners 😂
To be fair golf r is rs3, a45s, m140i/m2? level Should have been a gti for it to be a fair race
Did Matt put his grandfather in the Merc or something, Yanni on his phone has better reaction times than that dude
Imagine this Golf with a simple stage 1 tune, what a beast VW made.
I think the AMG struggled to reach 50mph thats why it won the break test🤔
What's the point if the Mercedes has a late start? Why didn't you do a re-run whilst you were there?
Mercedes was late in the full braking challenge, which is unacceptable ...The challenge is assumed to be replayed
POV: You're looking for the pinned comment
Conclusion: VW paid more to win and came with non-officially tuned cars... and put a VW "pilot" in the Merc
VW lying about its cars figures...again🤣
The merc definitely brake earlier
Everytime I see the BMW 135i it just makes me sad we don't have the straight six in the old 140i. That VW is immense
Need a drag between VW Golf R and Merc A45
Love Volkswagen 😻 !
"Which is the quickest, 2lt, 4 cyl, German hatchback..." without A45s AMG ahahahaha
these golf seats are ugly
That MK8 Golf R is something else, wow
*VW Golf R* vs *BMW M135i* vs *Audi S3* vs *AMG A35*  _THE WINNER IS MAT WATSON_ 🏆🏆🏆
Where is the Yaris Gr?
Finally no soft limiter 🥳🥳
As if the golf is the most expensive?!
Golf is the most expensive lmao
So it's not every car then Matt 🤦‍♂️
0:15 BMW fanboooys letsgo 0:29 ooo powaaa 0:58 it doesnt matter ! 2:19 yea babyy u hear that!? 3:38 BMW is still better.. 5:48 BMW was first u know.. 7:15 if there were new M4 it would destroy them all.. 8:23 BMW is still the best ( PRESS F )
The worst BMW ever
golf 8 r best speed
That Golf R are is ridiculous. Only .2 of a second slower at the quarter mile as an Audi RS4. Mat, give us that race. The Golf R against the M340i and Audi RS4.
Wth happend to this world ? A vw kicking the ass of a merc and a beamer 😂
This was such an interesting video in a long while.
It’s crazy to think how the old Bmw M140 was over 10 grand cheaper than all these cars brand new and would completely destroy every car here. That M135i is genuinely a marketing disaster
Bmw sounds the best
Audi sounds like 911 Turbo S.  A turbo charged Dyson.
Please, do the comparison f power and torque like the weight amd prize comparision.
7:32 that s3 driver is the best
THE   NEW  VW R
matt how bout the R vs the 45S
Fantastic performance of that Golf. Breaktest was not correct. When it started the audi and merc where allready behind and the merc pressed the brake earlier than the rest of the pack
the cars have no soft limiter?? Gonna be popular in bradford XD
Can't wait to see 2021 Audi RS3's performance figures. VW group hot hatches are on fire lately 🔥🔥🔥
Damn the m135i driver has the happiness
Volkswagen>BMW,Mercedes,Audi VW KING 💪
You look beautiful in the morning 🤪😂❤️
Exhaust sound test is pontless with new cars
I'm german and i will stay here tho.  Great way to listen and learn a very important language! 🤷‍♂️
At the start I thought that Merc is only A35 instead of A45, to get within the same power range as rest of cars. After watching, I think that Golf could take on A45 or even RS3.
Where is yanni?
It does not make sense to race the golf r against this opponents, it should be the gti to be fair. Or should have used the a45 and the rs3 to be fair
Could have 1000bhp I'd still take a R32 over that R anyday.
Waw
Bmw mafia
Golf R 0-60 3.94sec 😁 very very nice 👏
Dont got
That golf is easy 360+hp 🤔
do 2021 mazda cx5 2.5T signature
Idk why but i kinda like these drag race the most. Little 4cyl cars fighting together.
Very good race
You should of tell the Mercedes driver to wake up
Not only are bmw knocking out the worlds ugliest cars right now, they are fitting torque converters in hot hatches.
Matt really spoils the video when his always seated in the car that wins 90% of the time....it's getting annoying and takes the fun out the race.
Someone should dyno the R to see how much it actually produces
Please involve the Audi S4 B9 in a similar powered race as this one.
The order of the prices aligned with the straight line performance…
Can we have leon cupra as well on the race?
8:48 I swear this guy always cheats
They are quick but they all sound guff 😁
I just watched an old drag race where a45s meets rs3, bmw 240i and 7.5 golf R. Merc did it in 12.1, rs3 12.4, bmw in 12.9 and golf r 7.5 in 13.1.  It seems that new R is quicker than rs3 and almost as quick as a45s. So my guess on power figures is 360+hp.
Whats up Mat I know u and your Team read every coment, so can you do the same thing with the x1, Qs3, Gla 35 and something from Volkswagen :D  Greetings from Germany, now I check out the german chanal;)
that means a45s vs golf r
Need the a45s in the race that would win
Nein ich mag das original!!😂😂
matts german accent gives me life 😂😂💯
Hi matt
Mercedes breaks to early
Merc fan:  Why not A45s?
I want to see a dyno of that golf.
Sad that the new S3 looks like a hideous mini-SUV. Pity.
2.5 bar = 36 psi
A45s would have been a fair race
Fwd bmw feels so wrong tho
Whomever was driving that Merc has got to go, he has the reactions of an elderly sloth.
BMW 1 Series is so disappointing. Weak, fat, cheaply made, boring, no RWD, desasterous proportions, not even a trick AWD like the Focus RS had or something. Mercedes and Audi redeemed themselves with the impressive A45 AMG and the 5 cylinder brute RS3 Quattro. BMW just not competing with the run of the mill turbo 4 pot and basic Haldex AWD.
i love those cars great decision matt.
"The fastest 2.0 turbo hatchback" doesnt even have the a45s??? 🤔🤔
Golf R : secretly an RS3
Proof vag group better than equivalent bmw or mercedes.
I watched this high and it was fkn awesome 🙏🏼🌞
Golf r vs a 45 s vs bmw M1 vs rs 3
No way AMG can watch this and sleep peacefully at night!
Audi rs Etron vs tesla model s vs Tycan turbo s
A35 amg is the best
Dying to hear that when mad gone say Tht I   sat  in a BUGATTI SUPER SPORT amd next to me is a KOENIGSEGG AGERA and we have gonna a jolly good hyper car drag race ...!!!🚘🚘🤣🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
Wher is the cupra?
Should of used a A45 rather than A35
WHY IS THERE AGAIN A SHITTY DRIVER IN THE MERCEDES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Golf R is the best of all those cars. It would be better if...  A45 instead a35 RS3 instead S3 Or put GTI instead R
Vw golf r mk8 vs merc amg a45s drag race.❤
Your German accent is on point man
this is the first time i saw a merc is last in performance
Please do a drag race with the 1000HP MK4 Supra VS 1000HP BMW M5🙏😁
The Merc was a good few yards behind the others before you hit the white line for the braking test!  Cheating is never good!
Audi looks good in that paint. A35 looks expensive.
The R must race the A45s
IM LOOKING FOR THE PINNED COMMENT WHERE IS IT MAT, YOU'RE LATE
Vag👍👍👍
Vag 🇩🇪🏁💪🍻
The golf r is fast as the mats old g63
Bmw 128ti vs golf gti vs civic type r vs megane rs
What was that break test from merc...cheat cheat 😌
How ?????
7:32, Audi driver also doing the "come on".
Should add model 3 performance in the line up too!
note to 60 3.94 seconds thats a pog in the segment
@carowow For hot hatches do the roll race from 40mph pleaseee
Wonder how the Leon Cupra will do...
Bmw sounds the best
Carwow Germany No👎👎!!! Carwow UK London Super Good perfekt Yes👍!!! Cars Sportwagen good.
"Which is the quickest 2-liter 4-cylinder German hot hatchback?"  Where's the A45S?
Golf R my dream car...the dopest...👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
RS3 vs GOLF R NEXT !!
GOLF R HAS TO RACE THE RS3 NEXT DRAG RACE !!!!!!
Is that the 8 series Mat? Fuck sake mate, introduce the car properly
*youre looking for the pinned comment*
Golf R v RS3 see how much that extra dollar gives you
Hey Matt .i want buy a small car ,i need your help. I'm your follower since 2016
That Golf is a beast, there is no way it has 320 hp
The BMW being a 4 cylinder still makes me sad
Thanks for creating a german channel❤
Lets race dodge cars!
You need to do a cruise control race. Drive at 30kmh and the cruise control set at 200 and just turn it on and see who accelerated fastest
Surprising the R didn't do that well in the rolling race but smashed them all in the drag.
The bmw sounds best
yeapyeapyeap
The driver in the A35 was sleeping on the start, the margin of loss was bigger than it should have been...
No chance against the Golf R
I always vote for the car mat is in I just don't know why😅
1:10 best moment 🤣
That R is just incredible lol....
The guy in the Merc has the reaction time of molasses.
I still think in tests like these we should know what tires the cars are running.
Yeah it's fast, but I'd never pay more for a boring vw over a beemer or merc
Not a chance that Golf R is stock. It’s running similar times to an A45S.
The fastest one is not the premium one. Interesting.....
Golf R vs Merc A45 please Matt
3.94s.......
Anytime I see 35 or 53 "AMG", I'm ready to see them lose quite badly 😑
Vw is the best lier 🤣
Mercedes ❤️
All 4 cars German ? England island don't produce any cars this days...right ?:))
Golf 8 r vs audi rs3
I would be embarrassed to be found dead in a Golf.
I don't get the point of a gearbox that shift up automatically even in manual mode
Amg was dreaming in the drag race
Golf r Vs a45s 👀👀
242th comment
Golf r💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 it should be face to face with the a45 dude!!!!!!
my VW heart is happy
Mercedes should have just stuck to the A250 as an economy boy racer. What is the point of that useless A35.. slow, sounds rubbish. A nothing really.. well done to VW for taking back their throne
Look at the driver of the Audi 7:33😂😂😂😂😂😂😋
They all sound like sewing machines but some have fake pops and crackles.
A Nissan skyline r32-34 with an faaaat ass turbo vs a Supra mk4 and a turbo s
Golfs quick but 2 years late.
At the end of the day, it does not matter which car won, they all are going to give you a big smile.
Volkswagen Golf R is winner 😈🚗👍
I am a BMW and Audi fanboy but hey this BMW one series is a joke. I don't know who can tell them that, their cylinder reduction didn't help at all the car is much slower than their previous six cylinders. I believe that even their choice of gearbox was also a bad move. Am happy that Audi did better job with that a3, I can't say much about the golf cos it's supposedly to be inline with the Audi RS 3 the S version compete with the GTI. Or maybe am wrong. The ratings of this R line were miss quoted. I can't say much about the Merc it's properly slow in this comparison, the only properly fast cars a Merc can manufacture are the proper AMGs their lesser versions are always slower than their rivals. Thanks to VW for the golf R it does the job but I wish that they would put it in the same league as the RS and the AMG in terms of power, I mean the proper ones not the lite versions.
That mercedes definetly cheated on the brake test lol. Couldn't win anything, so had to cheat to win something :D
The golf 8 also wins for the ugliest car ever built !
I was waiting for the new M4 or M3 drag race
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Awesome drag race ever I love golf r whole the day
Golf sound best
Why is the fastest 2.0l german... so on and so forth not competing? AMG A45S?
Mat! You should race the Golf R vs the A45s, they have 100hp difference but not a big difference in the track🏎💨
That A35 launched so late it jumped the start of its next race
Why can’t these be in the US fml
Vw blooming quick!!!
Why amg 35? Why you dont got 45s?😬😭
This needs to be re-recorded with a better driver in the merc. How do you have an inability to keep lined up to the other cars. Even broke early!
I have the biggest smile on my face watching this video :)
Mercedes driver was sleeping before take off
bmw
If you guys are planning to start a Dutch 🙊channel in the future then I wil stand in line for a job interview 😜
The question is: Can the Golf also beat the a45s?
The AMG driver was asleep.
We need to see the new golf R vs the a45s amg.  If it keeps up with it, we might of found a hot hatch secret super hatch.
"Press Car"
Missing Yianni in this segment, where he could apply his body weight and let BMW win this race. 😔 - Disappointed BMW fanboy 😂
why didn't you use the a45s it would of won every thing
I think the  Bmw   won the SOUND CHECK
you should’ve got the a45s + mat you need a vacation
SAVE BLADED ANGEL
The golf really is quick
Do the a45 amg vs the golf R
Its like watching Usain Bolt runs against high school athletic team ...
Bring the A45S next 😁👍🏻
M4 competition vs C63 vs RS5 drag race 👍👍👍👍👍
The rear end design all look the same to me
Hi please characters against these cars Tesla Model 3 Performance or at least Long Range
A Little Golf R All wheel drive system wins
that German accent gave you more horsepower Matt 💙
That VW R Moonwalked through out the entire vid!
S3❤👍
Where do you guys find those shitty drivers and always put them in a mercedes. Late on the drage race, has an excuse for the rolling race, didn't get level by the braking test,... PLEASE
Why is the cupra not with this set up
MK8R 💙
Yall know that the 45s would smoke everyone but u had to put the skow version of it
Who who have thought the "cheapest brand" is the fastest?
Saturday mornings, breakfast,  Carwow drag race.. winner 🏁
It should be M140i
Mat i have an idea take yianni and go to nurnborging and challenge who is finishes the lap firstly.
Mercedes guy don't talk shit!! You were sleeping on the line
@carwow I know why you were so happy, Sun was shining!! Rare ocasion in the UK ;)
I think Carwow should do a Lambo race where it’s Matt in an Svj and when it come to the uk yanni in a new huracan sto
The A35 was a bit behind and not in line with the other cars on the break test.
the naughty peasants drag race
This drag race is not fair.I actually dont like any car that was involved,but the golf r should face the RS3,A45S and the bimmer.
Just one thing the Mercedes driver had to do in the drag race and he was useless at it!
Who wants to see Mat drag race all of his cars just for fun. At the same time
Have been waiting for this!
Should've had the a45s
Try and race it against a Mercedes A45s
Is the guy driving the A35 even a good driver??
The A35 driver performed really bad. Even when they’re supposed to be in the same line , they weren’t. I mean look at the damn brake test! I wonder how powerful the RS3 is gonna be compared to that R
Mat: pulls ahead in rolling race  Also Mat: *bobs head aggressively*
You should use gti lol
There should be an a45s instead of a35 because the golf 8r is actually the same price as a45s considering you can get a neat discount for the merc
Someone needs to dyno the new r
Audi sounded the best !
Mercedes driver: it is not as fast as the others... Bruh you ok? Your reaction time is dead like seriously dead... Go drive a toyota prius.
I think the GOLF R  its too much for them
I can’t believe that golf did 0-60 in 3.9 seconds that’s bonkers
Golf r 2021 v Audi rs3 v amg a45s 🔥
That Golf is in RS3 territory, but much more affordable. I’d love to put my RS3 8p against it, I’d probably lose 😂
a 45s vs golf R need to happen
Well done mat
That's exactly my point. How on earth is that R having 320 bhp? I bet this golf is on par with thee Amg A45s when it comes to performance
Golf r vs civic type r??
AUDI has improved their cars a lot..! that makes me happy.!🤤🥺😁
The new Golf R is amazing in nearly every point
Sorry for this stupid accent Ahahaha
BMW is TRASH in this segment!
Of course the bmw lost, the driver is wearing a mask 😷 yet he’s all alone in the car.
6:15 you can hear mat’s phone
Golf 8 💪🔥
Need to see a new R on a dyno yet again vw lowballing their figures 😂
The R is a monster!
Imagine being the guy in the mercedes and embarrassing yourself in front of thousands of people with that start
The drag race i was waiting for
Try keep the Golf R against your A45 AMG in a drag race, and then see which one is the quickest 🧐
Omg what happend to the bmw 😬
Modified golf ???
Golf
Vw R vs a45 Amg
Who else was pleased to finally see a carwow mk 8 R dragrace?
We all are thinking the same thing, put that VW Golf R against the Mercedes A45S AMG 😎
Lol that brake test is a con. You can see before they brake that the Mercedes was at the back of the field anyway.
Lying about power figures is so vogue right now
We need MK8 R vs rs3 vs A45s 🔥🔥🔥🔥 mk8 for the win
Bmw
where's the a45s?!   oo yeahh merc driver was sleeping
Some car that golf r 🔥
After decades without seeing a Golf on the channel it finally came back with a BANG!!
Just film everything in Germany. UK brings wrong associations / cringes: speed-cameras, billions of cops, slow drivers, steering wheel on the wrong side, traffic jams.
Where is A45? It’s still 4 cyl, 2.0l, and german
The next race should be between Benz A45s vs Golf R
No way the golf was 320 hp it is wayy more It's just Volkswagen being underrated
Mercedes destroyed its launch  Noob driver
That was stupid , should of brought the A45S to this drag race and it would of been more close
Golf R Monster end of.
My dream car is mercedes avtr
How is this golf as fast  as rs3 and a45s
last
I want to see the new golf R go up against the A45s and 2021 RS3. Think that would be really interesting.
what the f....  the sun has risen over the British empire again
My dad used to have a gold vw golf
We need Koeningsegg rangers vs Huracan and la Ferrari pls.....
Bmw sounds best
We need Golf R vs A45s, u think that would be pretty close seeing how the golf absolutely smashed the a35
So the Volkswagen is the most expensive of these cars? Excuse me, what?
Just couldn't spend over 30k and only have a VW. No matter how fast.
Ahaha VW cheaters as always ^^ Seriously they should dyno the cars before the drag race.
BMW launched about a day later
Why is the Volkswagen golf the most expensive car there
Nice car
Golf 8 R vs AMG A45S
why didn't they use the AMG 45S ?
still convinced the 8v facelift is faster than the 8y in the dry, i’ve done 12.3
Golf sounds the best obviously
The BMW sounds the sweetest!
Golf r dyno test?
The merc drivers launch was so delayed
These all have soft limiters, I want BAH BAH BAH BAH
BMW guy is so chipper :) Please could you get the R on the dyno?
His German accsent is quite funny actually
i thinks it bmw of course
I want VW R 🥵
Volkswagen lying about the numbers again 😂
The vw really is a monster
Perfection.....
The AMG cheated XD
The VW 8R proved me different, I also believe it has more hp 👀
Wowcar
please can you gys do jeep grand cherokee trackhawk VS lamborgini urus ive been asking since 1 month ago
But where's yianni
Soft limiters are sh?it
Audi, if you’re watching, we think you should get rid of your soft limiters
Hope y’all having a wonderful time watching this amazing video great work @cargow
Should of had the a45s instead of the a35!
Obviously the AMG had a shitty start, so why didn't you do the dragrace again?
We need golf r vs a45s
Seeing a grown man wearing a mask by himself in a car  🤣 after one year if you haven't figured it out  You never will
Wait....The Golf R is the most expensive?!
R is the king
Awesome Zherman accent 🤣
Can't wait for the new RS3🤩🤩 New S3 looks cool But RS3 will be S3 on steroids  Can't wait :)  Edit:And the 5 cylinder engine is pure po*n
7:34 I love that both of you knock your heads to be faster 😂😂😂
That Golf R is stunning. Will you race it against the A45s? Just to see how much difference in terms of performance there actually is
That Golf R is awesome what a little pocket rocket 👍
Fast and curious 🤨
The VW is more expensive as the Merc. I‘d choose the Merc every single time over the Volkswagen.
Who is the girl counting down?
Zee Germans, Tommy...
does Dean speak Malay?
You have a a45s sat at your house why wouldn't you add that to the race instead of the a35 we know that's the my powerful 2L
Matts german accent sounds like he prefers men
Why u didnt took a m140i
Vw HorsepowerGate
How is that golf r that quick. Imagine it tuned...
does the VW R come with a manual option?
do a dyno test for that golf R
I would take merc..looks best  I said merc before I watch video. Change my mind. Golf all the way😂😂
Гольф напихал всем 🤟
who can put on this Unlike 🤬
2nd viewer
Where is the mercedes amg45s?
Wow BMW sounds nice but Audi rubish soft limiter
Wait what? Just wondered the Golf R is the most expensive car of these 4. Is it worth that money? I might think, the AMG, the BMW and the Audi have the better interior with higher quality?
A45?
Golf R will obviously win this by huge margin,  it should go against A45 and RS3   And the GTi is the one that competes with M135, A35 and S3
Can anyone tell my why A35 exists? lol
That R had Weetabix for breakfast!
Next time get a 340
Bmw sounds best vw is the fastest but my favoutite is the audi
The Mercedes driver was asleep
Why not a45s
German was first
The A45 is German, has 2 l and is faster than all those cars.
Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment!👍
Damn the golf is fire🔥🔥🤩
Why don't you bring the new Hyundai i30 N with 8-speed double clutch...????
This video is a chavs delight, every one of these cars is driven by wankers racing around public roads.
All these cars are just carbon copies of each other. No originality in cars nowadays
Whats with the beemers mucky engine bay lol
I wake up to this banging video, what a way to start my Saturday off 🙌
Imagine a Stage 2 tune on this Golf...😳
Daym that Volkswagen defeated the big three
Ah yes, the boring cars drag race.
Next Golf R vs A45s just to se by how much as any would be A45s faster?
LOL
Golf R 🔥🔥
Not a perfect match, the golf R should have been replaced by the GTI to make this race fair.
Golf R sound the best
If you had told me 10 years ago that a Golf would run a sub 12.5 I would never have believed you. It’s faster than a 996 911 turbo
Bmw sounded the best
VW💪🇩🇪
Finally)
Ken miles from Ford VS Ferrari is that you ?
why A35 and not A45???
bmw best
BMW has the best sound
A45s would beat all of them😂
The softlimiters are so shit

Hello

I hate to admit it. But the BMW is groing on me
Need to get that golf R on the dyno
Golf R is a Wolf in sheep’s clothing
Bmw sounds the best
The new 2021 VW Golf R does not have a soft limiter, yay!! It is rare for today's VAG cars to let people rev all the way to the maximum rpm.
The A35 wasn't racing🤣just cruising along the runway
Guess what?      The German car won
Who else paused watching the F1 testing to watch this video?
bmw sounds the best
Better took a45 amg?
BMW sounds the best
Different league should of raced a GTI instead if the R
Uploaded 3 minutes ago........nice!
@carwow Yanni not in it ;/
Wattson: Releases Everyone: Greatness
AMG boys crying rn
You don’t know Land Rover and Jaguar is an Indian company which was buy from Ford company
Great drag race !
Make a race with a45s
135 sounded best for me
What parallel universe is this where a VW Golf R costs more than a Audi S3?!?! 🤯
My boyfriend loves you ❤️❤️
BMW sounded the best

Golf sounds the best

M135i 👏😌❤
Ваг сила!)
The extremely important question : Where is Yianni ?
The best sound is bmw
It’s the year 2035 and I’m still waiting on the running race between Mat and Yanni.
was waiting for this
VAG cars for the win
I live for that german accent in these videos - so so gooood
Drinking game: take a shot every time mat says “click the pop out banner in the top right hand corner of the screen”
Mat always nails the German accent 10/10
There are 4k views after 2 mins wtf lol
‘I TELL YOU WHAT IT DONT GOT 😁’. 🤣
The new golf is defo the best in its class. Impressive all round performance!
GT RACE: Bentley Continental GT vs BMW M6 GranCoupe vs Nissan GTR vs Mercedes SLR Mclaren
golf R vs A45s vs RS3 is a better matchup
Not a chance in hell that golf R has 320hp. Please dyno it!!
