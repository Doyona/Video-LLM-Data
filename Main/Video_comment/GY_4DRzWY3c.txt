I am italian and i am looking England Italy  at the moment England 8 Italy 8  Force italia
Great plays by Dupont.. the past 2 years going strong, but against Italy its a different thing. Ireland is on a low mainly by injuries. Tomorrow he might shine but to win the 6 nations is a long way to go. France doesnt have a winning mentality.
French rugby = Champagne I love watching their sparkling rugby
That's a whole rugby field there on the tryline area
Hmm France showing consistency ? I wonder why ? Shaun Edwards
Dupont is a player you create on rugby 08 with 99 everything.
Hope we , England, are taking note. Play what’s in front. It’s not the NFL.
Why is the Italy team so poor?
common WorldRugby, bring the relegation, if you want a fair competition and want to grow Rugby worldwide...
60
Even though they lost. Italy did score an awesome try. Fair play by the winger.
🇨🇵🇨🇵👌
*Italy unfit*
che vergogna,  8 a  1 . Ritiriamoci
Italy looks unfit and disorderly. They need a new Defence coach.
ma perche continuiamo a fare figure di merda da ormai una vita bastaaa ritiriamoci non è il nostro mestiere
Siamo troppo scarsi comunque sempre forza Italia
The scariest part, this is not even France's best team indeed!
Italy need to be removed from Guinness Six Nations
Another great performance by the Italians better than last time 👀
Lose? Of course, France ita ready to win a WRC but Italy Lost 2 try at 10m to France s line  an 1 for stupido foraward passage. This Is  a very Italy handicap.
The quality of "Les Bleus" are X8..even..  X10 compare to last year...The BLUE BEAST is emerging.....
Harder Faster better....STRONGER! GO FRANCE....my money is on them for 2022 RWC...in France... you shall see!
And that, was a French side shorn of some of their 'first name in position' players.  Dupont and Serin are wonderful 9's, yet it's the pack that gives front foot attack ball. Once that happens they simply use their wizardry and the backs swing into lethal, smooth attacking mode. Italy were ok; good in patches. The English were made to look piss-poor, on their home patch, by Scotland.
I dont think the Italians know or care about playing rugby tbh.
Festival ! 💃💃💃💥💥💥🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
Dupont is one of the best player in the world
🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
Good game by France but let's stop saying that they will be favourite of Next World Cup. It's in 3 years from now.  3 years ago, France finished 4th of 6 nations. Everything can happen in 3 years. So it's really promising and I'm glad as French but let's not put the cart before the horse and let's work quietly and humbly regarding where we were in the last decade. Look forward to see what will happen in this 6 nations though ! But Good game !
This game will only reveal itself in the next few weeks? Italy look like they're much improved but the french..... jeez
What's the deal with Italy (#17 and #19 I think) clearing out a la NFL for their try? Is that allowed? Didn't really affect whether try would be scored but weird to see them decking opposition defenders off the ball
Not impressed at all. Against an All Black team or even a super rugby team, France would have suffered a lot more and lost.
It's tragic to see Italy at this level for so many years. There are quality players, however, but not enough of them to make a competitive team. Unfortunately, this is likely to last a long time. In 21 years of 6 nations, the record over 107 matches is 94 defeats, 12 wins and 1 draw.   en VO :) C'est tragique de voir l'Italie à ce niveau-là depuis tant d'années. Il y a des joueurs de qualité pourtant mais ils ne sont pas assez nombreux pour faire une équipe compétitive. Malheureusement ça risque de durer encore longtemps.  En 21 ans de 6 nations, le bilan sur 107 matchs est de 94 défaites, 12 victoires et 1 match nul.
Azzurri in 6 Nations are massive underdogs with 28 defeats in a row and then not so sure 50 points scored by France in Rome are significant. More impressive the 11 points scored by Scotland in Twickenham, I believe.
Great job France love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️🇨🇵
The French were barely winning against the Azzuris before this game. This is a much improved and skillful show of what the French team actually is
Sans commentaire   une victoire écrasante des bleus
I want Italy to be strong.
The staff of french is awesome. Every player know his partition. This team is clinical
When they play with this heart even if they dont win all the games I like them! Allez les bleus!
The difference between Scotland and Italy this weekend - Scotland decided they would play as equals.
I invested a lot of points into France for my fantasy six nations team glad they pulled through
People talking about WC winners from 1 match 3 years out , just stop.
Masterclass in French Flair...also how many more years do we have to watch Italy get bodied for 5 weeks in winter?
Thanks for posting!
Dupon ....Amazing !
Dupont is the most talented northern hemisphere player since O'Driscoll
Ryle Nugent has the sexiest voice
stop fake crowd please.... stupid
On est enfin de retour après 7 putain d'années de disettes. Ça va enfin saigner pour les rosebeef.
Tomorrow Wales 28 Ireland 15
I don’t think Italy have played a worse game than this one. Disgraceful!
Let's hope France win the WC
Winner of France v Scotland will take the tournament
France will win this tournament and move up the world rankings
Italy needs to be replaced by Georgia
Thumbs up to make the 6 nations a UK (+southern Ireland) only tournament. Much better without France and Italy - keep it English speaking.
Sure don't bother showing Italy's disallowed try
Well done.France is actually pretty good with the ball skills. Love from South Africa
The French look sublime. Maybe in another decade gli Azzurri will have the ability to at least go toe to toe w. their Alpine cousins. Until hopefully these new faces develop and get more opportunities.
France have really impressed me the last year or so. Come the 23 worldcup i think they will be real contenders. And thats hard for me to say coming from a Kiwi.
Fullback for Italy did not have a good game
the "french flai"r is back !!!!! they have a very dangerous  young team now ! favorite of this tournament..!!!! they preparing the world cup at home  careful this team is going to be terrible !
France were majestic, and so good to watch.  As a Welshman I’d love to see them go all the way this year, barring the miracle of our being able to!
It’s not even fun to watch Italy anymore
Many people felt England are clear favourites for the championship but the favourites for me are France. Even before this 6 nations started I think France are a much better team and it was clear after England's loss to Scotland. France are the team to watch, not just this year but for the next world cup
Anyone would look good against Italy they're still rubbish
that step at 2.55 was filthy
28 and counting...
Le vrai défi arrive la semaine prochaine face à l'Irlande de Jonathan Sextoy
Italy’s only try coming from a forward pass. 10-50? Relegate Italy to Six Nations division 2 and let in someone else!
Italy devalues ​​the 6 Nations, on the other hand, even when Word Ruby will continue to allow a team to be made up of so many players from other countries, it is a shame!!!
Heureux de revoir nos guerriers sur le terrain avec la même envie et réalisme, ALLEZ LES BLEUS ❤️🇨🇵
Italy as always last place and all loses guaranteed. Disgrace
I know this was a blowout, but the shit France pulled on the pitch today was a thing of beauty
Italy fuck you jajajajaja
France stands as the clear favorite for this year's tournament.  England's level of play was poor as hell.
Furia Francese 💥⚜🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵⚜💥
Tout le monde dit, en particulier nos concurrents britanniques, que c'est juste l'Italie et quil faut voir avec une tout autre opposition , donc je suis allé revoir les scores de l'Italie lors du dernier tournoi et ils n'ont pris qu'un gros éclat face à l'Angleterre ( 56 points encaissés ,33 contre l'Irlande ,26 ,26 et 25 face à l'Écosse ,le pays de Galles et la France respectivement) .. Visiblement ce n'est pas si aisé que ça que de passer 50 points à l'Italie surtout jouant à domicile ..  Donc pour moi il ne faut surtout pas minimiser ce genre de résultat ..
Dupont ci hai fatto un culo a tarallo...
they run in a straight line and score multiple times. Get Georgia in, i'm tired of this shit.
wassup english "jOkEs"?
WELL DONE SCOTLAND!!! WITH LOVE FROM FRANCE!!! CALCUTA CUP 150th ANIVERSARY GOES TOOOOOOO...SCOTLAAAANNNNNDDDDDD!!!
Dupont is literally a cheat code
Italy, the fakest tier one nation in test rugby
This game is yet another piece of evidence that proves Italy needs to be kicked from the 6N. They do NOT belong there...
The scariest part, this is not even France's best team
毎度デュポンのサポートコースが神がかってる
On peut faire de bonne choses  avec cette équipe de france bon après c est Italie faut voir ce qu il vaut vraiment face au pays Galles  ou écosse  ou encor l angleterre mai c est bien bonne victoire👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
One more think shocking scotland beat England in twichenem there crazy
Le tournoi cette année et pour les bleus 👍💙
Dupont is a masterpiece
Merde j'ai raté ça...
France win the 6 nations 😌
Bravo au coq français
