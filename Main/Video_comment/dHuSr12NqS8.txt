Great song :-)
the simpsons is meant to be fun
This song gives me chills every time I listen to it, too bad it’s not on spotify
this is one of the saddest songs I have ever heard. wow. I am sobbing
The feels... they find you and WHAM got you crying when you least expect it
This was the first video of Dodie's I ever saw. I've been in love with her music since 2020, and can't get enough ! What a talent <3
find the paralleles in this cartoon - its only a weird mirror.
there is a simpsons episode where bart cant pass a test, and he gets so frustrated with himself since he studied and tried to pass, and that gets me as well.
I cried for like 3 days when Homer's mom left and he watches the stars. What a great show.
Same here. It's called a heart. I never threw it away.
i still come back here to feel real things. yall adorable for feeling that loud
fuck you dodie i love you so much.
OH, MY GOD!!!!! Who is this sensation?!?!?!?! I just watched this b/c she liked a video about explosions
Amazing.
...I guess the: 'did I understood you correctly in/with.......' behaviour has gone out of style?....'costs' too much time and shows a spur of dullness ?.....whilst some editors striving for perfection seem to have the potential to ruin the world at the same time..... ;-( .....maybe a paradoxon mankind can't solve on its own and need ai conputer assistance? to evaluate the least worst options of error reproduction....? ....I really doubt that 'Spedition Zufall' has it/the solution!?....logistics is/can be a real curse in todays Germany ;-(
Love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻
This song is genuinely so relatable though 😭
Dodie with glasses omg
Wow😭😭😭
I cry at your crying;  hold on.
i just watched the episode you were singing about!! (season 14, episode 17)
dodie is the most creative fucking person on this platform.  what I would give to live in her mind for a day.
I nominate this for the anthem of the planet.
i come back to this song to much
I loved the song your voice is amazing
PLEASE RELEASE THIS I LOVE THIS SO MUCH <333
okay so is this just the universal dysfunctional family song because I sometimes also cry at the simpsons when homer strangles bart or lisa feels neglected
This feels like the kind of song you sing halfway thru until you start to cry
Genius
I listen to this like 5 times a day cause i'm -obsessed-
True beauty.
It’s ok to cry when a cartoon resonates with you. You shouldn’t feel dumb!  You’re only dumb if you cry at Family Guy.
Hello. Can you please post it on SoundCloud.
Absolutely spectacular
someone give the poor girl a hug
OMG please release this on Spotify I love this song, your my favorite artist 🤩🙌❤️
I cried at this fuckin song bruh T-T
YOU ARE AMAZING. I found you through 'Secret for the mad' i stayed for the beautiful person behind the mic, you're such a pure soul.
The thing with having watched her for so long, is that I think she's more of a writer/lyrics person than a singer. Her style hasn't evolved or changed since I first heard her years and years ago. I'm not saying she's not talented but that her talent is writing lyrics....musically, she's sort of been stuck at the same place forever...like since 2009
Oh I cried at a song about the simpsons
I wish for you continued genius but more joy.
DUDE OUCH HJOLY SHIT GIMME A WARNING FIRST
That's super clever!!!👍
Why?
Can you give the sheet music for this song?
Oh my fucking god. Have you actually.... done this? You are awesome.
Your so effing adorable.
Stop! This should be illegal! Why is this a bop and why will I start unironically listening to this???
I've felt the same thing, though not to tears, about Family Guy.
“Cause that cartoon family isn’t mine” I remember this exact feeling with Family Guy, I was walking home from school two years or so after my parents’ divorce and my best friend and I were talking about how there was no way Brian was actually dead because everything resets by the next episode (we were sophomores in high school and hadn’t discovered drugs yet so family guy was our guilty pleasure) and I all I could think while I looked at the spot where my dads car used to be was “when is my next episode”. Thanks dodie for the tears and laughs after realizing that everything worked out in the end.
this is... my favorite song of dodie by far
I'm not crying about a song about crying at the Simpsons you are.
Voice so heavenly it can solve environment pollution
oh I cried at a dodie song, but I don't feel dumb at all, because the song is real and honest and sad and I holds so many emotions even tough it's only 1 minute and 10 seconds long
“Cause that cartoon family isn’t mine” same :D. But at the end of the day, my parents are both happy, and that’s the important part!
I’ve never seen the simpsons but i relate way to hard to this song
Just found "It's the end of the world... " and now this! :- ) Thank you for sharing your talent, voice and music.
how wonderful would it be if this was secretly on the album
do you watch the simpsons on disney plus as well?
Dodie ik you prob won't see this but this made me realize just how much you remind me of one of the women who helped raise me. She is v obsessed with the simpson's for this reason. (Also when you did the hand washing song at the beginning of covid I started thinking about this but couldn't quite put it into words)
Very nice!
why am i hardcore vibing to this song-
Wait what episode is this based on?
let me remind you that the simpsons is meant to be fun ;)
What a great ability to be able to write a great song about every little emotion...
.... I’ve been listening to you for such a long time- I. I’m 16 now and I think I was like, 11 or 12 when I first heard you. Correct me if I’m wrong because my ... memory isn’t the best due to events that occurred but I’m fairly convinced that you were my favorite creator like... ever. And I still look up to you.
SPOTIFY NOW PUHLEASE
10/10. See you in Bristol next year!
i love you dodie
This is one of the most amazing twists someone has done on any song, I can’t stop singing along. Your musical creativeness is truly something to admire ❤️🥺
nice. also sorry to hear about your vvs, hope it clears up soon. see you on the vloggle!
The level of genius it takes to write a song like this is so unbelievably hard to express.  Nostalgic, touching, relatable, and makes empathy shoot right out of my eyeballs... GOSH DARN it Dodie.  You are a gift.
I enjoy everything you make. Since becoming speechless so many times when listening to things you conjure, I thought I'd just say ... Thank You for everything you create.  (Back to being speechless again).
I loved you sings a lot more I'm from Brazil 🇧🇷 and I met you a little while ago kisses 😄
Let's be honest who hasn't cried at The Simpsons
not me sitting here thinking 'yo why this sound familiar'
this is so nice,,I love it so much you make really bice chords dodie!!
Bruh I have no words to explain how I feel when I hear her sing. It’s so calming and smooth it’s unbelievable and beautiful. I wish her the best in life. Highlight of my day when I get to listen to her.❤️
Yes
Who needs The Simpsons when you can just cry at this song.
Is it bad that I cried listening to this song? My parents were divorced before my first birthday, but it still...hurts? Idk how to describe it. I guess I still think about what could have been if they’d have stayed together. Still a VERY very pretty song, though 💕
what instrument is this because it’s wonderful
I could listen to this on replay all day
it’s difficult to realise that you relate to this song so much   she is so bloody talented it’s absolute pog 🥺❤️
I always cry at the simpsons ,,,, ugrrhhh why didn't I think of this idea for a song LOL jk I love you
Me too, now I'm crying about a song about crying about the simpsons.
...I cried at my older sister's wedding video last night because my dad did her wedding and he left nine years ago as of 10/8 😅 he played his guitar and sang I Will Be Here and I hadn't heard him sing seriously since before he left. A bunch of childhood memories came back and I bawled my eyes out. Thank God for my amazing boyfriend who was there to hold my hand through it (and my sister who gave me a towel with lavender essential oil on it to hold until I was okay lol) ...okay I'm done XD
crying at a song about crying at the simpsons. noice
I caaaant believe how much i relate. For the last 4-5 months ive been watching the last 11 years of the simpsons on random repeat and that episode actually brought me to tears <3 there have been multiple so far, but that's one of them <3 amazing song, amazing lyrics, coincidentally relatable and I love how you go along with the theme song :-)
Let's not forget that 'The Simpsons' is a show created by a set of very witty writers/comedians and especially the first seasons often had a deeper emotional grip and appeal
Bootipul
I thought this would be funny but awe it’s actually sad
Honestly took me way too long to notice the theme song I there so smart
so cute song
I cried at I cried at the simpsons
I constantly cry when watching  the Simpson and i don't why
Wait the opening melody is the simpsons theme in waltz time
This woman is a genius! I loved the song, it's sheer musical art!
ngl theres a clip from the simpsons that always makes me cry where homer tries to regrow his hair and it comes back and he loves it until it all falls out again and marge sings to him 'you are so beautiful to me' bro that hurted my heart in a good way
Watch "Last exit to Springfield" and you will have Simpsons fun again
YES THANK UOU I thought I was the only one who projected their fucked up family issues on the Simpson's
Thank our Dodie.
bruh dodie back at it again with the bangers..... in other news season 2, episode 1, "bart gets an F" makes me cry every time i watch it
Allie Goertz vibes for days, beautiful, I love it
Well that was devastating
::hug::
oh
god that "that cartoon family isn't mine" really hits huh
NOOO HOW IS THIS ONLY A MINUTE. I WANT MORRREEE
D A N K M U S   is gonna love this! They remix Simpsons episodes all the time and makes them into music!

Was not expecting to be this emotional

Wow fuck this just made the simpsons more depressing
Chicken nuggets

She weaves the theme song into the song I LoVE It
i really wasn’t expecting this one to hit so close to home
Bisa aje lu ya mbak!!
Spotify link please
mmmm so short but so RICH that chord progression is EVERYTHING i LIVVEE for your complex arrangements
I thought this was a reaction I'm crying now 👁️👄👁️
I don’t think you’ll ever see this, but this song just hit me in my feels and made me want to thank you. Your music has really helped me so much throughout everything I’ve been through and I know this is TMI but it’s literally stopped me from ending my own life a couple times so I just wanted to say Thanks so much for putting out your music
Ok but I need this on Spotify so I can listen to it all the time
Love to you!
That lydian wink, love it
Me: thinks I’m going to be early YouTube: I’m about to ruin this girls whole career
I CRIED AT THIS DODIE GODDAMMIT
me realising I've been listening to dodie since I was EIGHT
Great songwriting - really really great. Lyrically, harmonically and melodically, a perfect little song.
Bro I cried that episode too and knew what you were talking about immediately 😂😂
0:00
Yup I’m in love.
The Simpsons has so many good sad episodes like that one, I love this, I’ll probably have to sing it often!
Well damn, now I just cried at you crying at the Simpsons.
Dodie, Simpsons are meant to be fun
what the hell this is so good!!!
this is written so cleverly and beautifully you literally blow my mind ugh
so many fucking levels to this..  holy shit
What about Sideshow Bob?!!???
bro this related to me so hard rn
i miss you and tessa singing together
*melt*
I didn’t expect this but I needed it and now imma go cry at the Simpsons   THE WAY YOU INTERTWINED THE EPIC MUSIC IN THE THEME
im obsessed with how subtly she weaved the theme song into the melody
Honestly it didn't sound like you had any air behind most of the beginning notes. Were you running out of air?
Honestly it didn't sound like you had any air behind most of the beginning notes. Were you running out of air?
I hard relate to this song
Petition for this to become the new albums "I have a hole in my tooth"
Hope you're ok!
Legendary
I attempted a couple of weeks ago, and this song feels like my reason for sticking around.
Blahh
the emotion that she put in a 1 minute and 17-second video! She is so talented, I love her!
I know the feeling :( my parents are divorced so...
Really impressive use of the theme.
Nothing like a playfully deep waltz on a Friday afternoon. Cheers from Canada Dodie.
Love it!  👏🏻👏🏻
dodie deserves a middle part
Matt's shows will do that to your I mean look at jurassic bark. The futurama episode and every time I see that dog waiting I'm a mess
Love this!
12 uploads over 12 days...u know what the number 12 is good for?? Number of songs on an album...? Js. . .
I love this - and can’t stop listening to this
❤️
damn why am i sitting here at 6 am crying over the divorce my parents have had since i was 2–
DODIE!!! Ur brain is beautiful - you also ofc (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
Beautiful, quirky, and relatable.
🖤
oomf ;-; ghorl, stop using my heartstrings as a guitar T-T
Sequel song to this about "Mother Simpson."
This is fantastic. As are you. Keep making great things!
PLS PUBLISH THIS
❣️
PERIOD QUEEN 😩👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
BRUH
I love you sooo loud!!!!💞
Oh my god amusing and lighthearted cute and touching and bitter and sad and relatable all at the same time????????? Genius god-tier songwriter Dodie
Brilliant!!
Bruh, how TF does this already have so many views???
oh flashback to when i bawled my eyes out at an episode of That 70s Show when the grandma and kitty are fighting and then she walks in on the grandma crying and I decided to go to therapy cause i knew woof i should not be this sensitive to the family dynamic of a sitcom without some underlying issue i need ASSISTANCE
Well I mean I still cry every time I watch the episode "Kenny Dies" from South Park. Kenny dies in almost every episode until that point but the way they just handle it in that one is what gets to me.
I stepped off of social media about 4 months ago and now I realize how much I miss you and watching your videos.
Now, all that's left is a Simpsons drama with this as the theme song...
Awesome!!
Yesss. Love this so much
sometimes i wonder if i should watch the simpsons from season 1
i LOVE this song i LOVE this song
she needs a bf.
I freaking love you
Yeessssssss
Everytime I imagine entering heaven, dodie is the voice that welcomes me
Dodie is definitely HATCHING SOMETHING
this is beautiful
Wait! I thought you were stormfront for a bit
Lowkey this hit different cause my parents are currently "separated" and I don't know if they'll ever resolve their issues. Thanks for making me feel less alone <3
beautiful song and also I love your glasses frames so much!!!!
This is genius. Witty, beautiful, sad, meaningful, sweet. Love!
IS THE CHORUS SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE THE THEME SONG? Omg the subtle genius
You're so freakin talented 🥰
😍
That's a creative vocal melody there, kinda like - HEYYY WAIT A MINUTE.
I've cried at plenty of Simpsons episodes, especially the ones focused on Lisa. I think I relate to her a lot.
This is beautiful
When your dad beats your mom and you come to dodie for a therapy session because you can’t get help 🥰❤️❤️❤️
i have also cried at the simpsons before, once in a while they get very real and it somehow hits really hard.
..
I saw this on Instagram first and, although incredible, I didn’t want to watch it again here because the feelings were way too real, in the end I clearly gave in I mean it’s Dodie
wow she’s really been making me cry since i was 13
Felt this so hard. I live in a family where my father is psychologically abusive and no one really gets it. He doesn't hit us so it must be okay. But it's not. It never is. And so I felt this.
shut mouth hammock
a masterpiece from dodie once more
I've definitely cried at The Simpsons multiple times. Any episode about Homer and Lisa's relationship ruins me.
This is fire
This hit me right in the feels
Turns out I've been waiting for the 7th for 5 months now
I love how the melody at some points incorporates the Simpson's theme song...
This remoinded me of a sad song about a bunny, flappie
I guess I'll be watching this video every day until October 7th
I literally love this so frickin much dude. especially since I think I heard a little bit of the melody of the show in this. Thank you. Didn't realize I needed this
which episode is it tho
People often wonder how an artist writes a song. If you tell them it just came to you out of blue (a subconscious experience of life), it'd be hard for them to comprehend. Songwriting is something where you step into a blackhole and free fall. However, you feel safe because it's an expression of truth. It's like a river flowing and then you just canoe joining the flow. Every moment in life has its song. And thank you for your beautiful expression. It makes a difference every time a soul is moved by it. Love to you, my friend <3
Sad little girl.
I like it's bad that I know the episode, i-
cartoon trauma.
I really hope she puts this up on Spotify🥺
The Simpsons can make someone cry in 20 minutes, sure, but dodie can make anyone cry in just one minute D:
I need this to be longer and on Spotify ASAP
This has been stuck in my head all day  Also the 'cause that cartoon family isnt mine' made me cry
I almost cried at the song of a girl saying that she cried at the simpsons
Can we just appreciate how beautiful her glasses are. Where do you get em?
Lol dodie this is like the first dodie video I watch on YouTube and R.I.P
okok- aye
hi))
You are very talented and pretty. :)
Love this🙌🙌🙌🙌
Brilliant
BRUH YOU LOOK LIKE MICHAEL REEVES
I cry at the simpsons  😂😂 omg I love this and EVERY video you do dodie. ♡︎
what episode was this about??
i found you when my sister recommended you to me like a month ago and OH MY GOD you amaze me every day with your talent ily
WOW. Sent me into feelings I'd forgotten, from an episode I'd forgotten. You found a way to harmonize exactly how I felt as a child, watching this episode, that i'd buried away as an adult....Simply amazing. <3
dodie could punch me in the face and i’d thank her 😊
Once again Dodie makes me cry
ahahah so cuuute
this is great
WHY CANT I GIVE THIS VIDEO MORE THAN OND LIKE?!?! THAT MADE ME CRY SO MUCH❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼
Now, I'm just thinking... Is this the egg that's supposed to hatch?
I'm working on a song atm called "I cried at 'I cried at The Simpsons - original song' - original song"
Today, I "re-discovered" Dodie's song "mashup" from 2017 and I am obsessed with it. It's so good.
i love you, nothing else to say, goodbye 💕
Little diddy about homer and marge. Her heart was as big, as his stomach was large.  That song plays in my head all the time
What a voice.
Je t'adore
This is beautiful !💗
I once cried at the Simpsons movie. The bit where Marge leaves and Homer is sad to The Carpenters "Close to You"
I have never watched the simpsons and I fucking loved this song so bad AAAAAAAAAAAA
HEY i'm the person who wrote that longass analysis of burned out being about a divorce in the original video's comments and this makes me really sad
Dodie always seems to have a way of using silence as part of her instrument.. It's captivating
I think it's quite brilliant how your mind entangles itself with existence so deeply, when you suffer from a condition that dissociates you from it.   It's like reaching for a last breath when you're drowning
Nostalgia is a crazy thing
💯💯💯💯💯👏🏻🎶🎶😘❤❤❤
REMINDER: The Simpsons is meant to be fun.
her facial expressions as she tells the story/sings is everything to me.
I cried at this song fuq
Every single time you release new stuff I'm blown away over and over again
ok
god, i remember that episode! the bit with the little toy (i think it was a starfish?) when they're dividing up their stuff and then it breaks and the beans spill out and bitter sweet symphony plays is what set me off. maybe it's a silly thing to cry at, but i definitely did.
Well done, Dodie, or as Homer would put it...D'OH-die.
I’m crying but also looking forward to the vlogs
I've never actually watched this show, i love this song tho!! Good job bb ♡♡
I love this
beautiful
MECORE
I can relate to this so much...
I literally watched this episode today. Two very different worlds aligned for me in a wild way
Can somebody please tell me how to play it, I'm so bad at learning by ear!!
This hits me so hard at this exact moment. I grew up a die hard Simpson's fan and my family bonded by consuming media.  My parents just separated and live apart, and my heart hurts so bad. Thank you for putting my feelings into words.
This is iconic 🥰
Excuse me, is this the simpsons theme song in the background???? Dayum
I cry at diary of a wimpy kid so don't worry about it
Dodie is this cause you were brushing your teeth and humming to the pitch of the buzz??
It's okay to cry at cartoons that's a normal thing. ;w; And also should be normalized more. Still a short but beautiful song.
Is this on Spotify?
Hug!
this is sad
dodie hello pls cover folklore
I RELATE TO THIS SO MUCH WHAT  I M A G I N E  THE SONG I RELATE TO THE MOST IS ABOUT CRYING AT THE MCFREAKIN SIMPSONS But damn this is so good tho o.o
I need this in apple music
Can someone tell me which episode this is? I really want to watch it now
i cried at this song
I think I share a heart w u
Ever since Dodie blew up and got spicy famous i kinda felt like she wasnt relatable anymore, like she was out of reach but every now and then when she uplaods something like this, i remember that everyone is just human (hehe love the album but pun not intended) and she deserves every bit of her fame and popularity. You are awesome Dodie. I will never stop being a huge fan of you and your music. Can't wait for the 7th.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
this is so beautiful! reminds us that deep sadness can peer through and show it's face anywhere 🥺🥺🥺🥺
simply beautiful
"can someone remind me The Simpsons is meant to be fun" Me when they keep predicting bad futures that end up true.
major ethan gruska vibes!! I love it so much.    hits kinda hard though
dodie you're a gem and incapable of not being so in touch with your heart and in-tune with the music of your soul 😭
i love this. i have goosebumps and im crying.
ouch.
WHEN I NOTICED THE THEME omg ur so good
ah what a dork. just over 2 years since i saw you in concert (don't worry, i still feel guilty about that night bc anxiety). i hope to see you again sometime in the future. loved this song, very sad.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
bruh wtf, i'm tearing
YESSS DODDLEVLOGGLE IS RETURNING EEEE
Using the theme song of the Simpsons in an original and creative way! Dodie you are absolutely a musical genius! 😊👍🏻🎶
Love the flat 6, flat 7, 1 chord changes !
Aww it's okay. *HUG*
OHBMY GOD SHES AMAZING
holy shit I have now cried at you crying at the Simpsons my heart my feelings
i can’t believe you made a serious song about the simpsons hahahahah love it
Love how this will be the last thing I hear before I sleep what good end before my eyes close thankyou dodie.
literally 4+ years of watching dodie and she still manages to impress me with her little ingenious ways to make you feel such deep emotions
Doodie be bringing in some nice tunes 😤
my favorite songwriter writes a song about my favorite cartoon, and it’s amazing (and kinda sad too)
I love this........

reminder: the simpsons are meant to be fun
beautiful
Omg I love this I’m one of the few people who have already seen this u r amazing and like my idol I love you so much❤️❤️❤️❤️
YOU ABSOLUTE GENIUS
Recently your music has had a free-flowing vibe that really reminds me of Ethan Gruska. Your writing continues to improve and mature and I'm so excited to see what you do next.
i listened to this i listened to it again i sent my sister the link i listened to it a third time
MARRY ME
This is so great
WOW I wasn’t ready for this song, it’s so pretty and relatable.  I hope Dodie is doing well. 💛💛💛 She deserves good things.
don't worry, i cry everytime they show Bart crying (especially that episode when he tries to get his grades up. Even seeing gifs of it makes me tear up)
This is brilliant. And sad.
So relatable
“that cartoon family isn’t mine” it hit too close to home
I would like to give you a warm hug
i cried at this song and now i feel kinda dumb but its just broken home things i guess
I relate to this on an astronomical level.
This fits too perfectly. Art imitates life
Dodie I hope you are doing well love. Wishing you peace love and positivity.
Instant chills the minute you started to play 😂 this was so brilliant. Thanks Dodie!
0:40 I quit my work with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Genius
Liv if you see this, i know it hit hard for both of us. I'll see you around <3
what episode did u guys cry on i cried on the one where bart got a f after studying
I love your voice!!
this is gonna sound dumb bc this is a song about crying at the Simpsons but thank you for always singing what i feel and making me feel less alone
So heartbreakingly beautiful. I always love your videos, Dodie! ❤️
Oh wow i had the same dilemma whilst binging a few early seasons last week. 😳☹
I'm never gonna hear the Simpsons theme tune the same way again 😭😭
You are absolutely amazing Dodie!! I love you so much!!
I love The Simpsons but I find myself crying to their episodes way too often. Thanks for this, Dodie❤️❤️❤️
I love this so muchhh.. I'm crying
i cried at the song that dodie wrote crying at the simpsons
0:57 I stopped my work thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I cried at the simpsons aged like 8 when Santa threw fish guts at children and I haven’t watched it since :)
How dare you make me sad. Thank you, that was a very creative little song.
the way she made such a good and sad song out of crying at the simpson’s
Me: actively watching the Simpson’s for the very first time  YouTube: recommends this  FBI agent: 👁👄👁
I felt this so hard. I've cried at the Simpsons as well.
why are we not talking abt the message at the end I'm so excited
beautiful. thank you so much
0:26 my entire life changed because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I love how you used the theme song?, and this song is too relatable to me😢
Me? Crying at a song about crying about the Simpson’s? Yeah
Finally, a song that can join Everything's Coming Up Millhouse on my list of sad songs about The Simpsons
I love how subtle the theme tune is incorporated  🙌
i dont even watch the simpsons and i’m crying so thanks dodie
Damn...  Who's chopping onions again
October's gonna be like the 12 days of Christmas, but better

Took me a while to realise it was the theme song - blew me a way!

please stop making me cry i can’t do this anymore please help
Reminder: the Simpsons is meant to be fun
i cried at the simpsons and i feel kind of dumb. homer and marge had a fight and they thought were done. miscommunication led to living apart. i found myself hard relating to lisa and bart.  ooh, 20 odd minutes of not getting on. marge even hired weird al for a song. i must admit i almost forgot for a while...  that come each end, they’d always be fine, cause that cartoon family isn’t mine.   oh, i cried at the simpsons and i feel kind of dumb. can someone remind the simpsons is meant to be fun?
Why am I cryinh
oof this is so good
:-(
'that cartoon family isn't mine'  okay i know so many people have commented on that line. but like, i started crying cause i genuinely felt that
her voice is so pretty i can't
I'm amazed by the way you write. Life sounds marvellous through all your songs. Thank you for that
„I almost forgot for a while that come each end they‘ll always be fine cause that cartoon family isn‘t mine“ wasn’t a lyrics I was expecting from a song about the Simpsons but ... damn. Oof. Just wow.
reminder: the simpsons is meant to be fun
didnt think i would have liked this  song
You are so brilliant
❤️❤️❤️
I have come to the conclusion that I am in love with this woman
What a pretty song !
🍕🥓here's some pizza and bacon .. it makes everything ok. 🤗
art
Omg I love your little song so much! You can sing anything and it will comfort my heart instantly <3 <3
You made me so emotional
You're BEAUTIFUL dodie
I swear Dodie could sing my least favourite song, and still manage to make me like it!!!
art.
Aw Dodie, cartoons are great. They’re wonderful and fun, sometimes sad and serious. All of it is important
I cried at the Lego Simpsons episode last night. Also felt stupid but not at little less lonely now.
Love it!
Beautiful 🥺✨
absolutely beautiful. I don't even want to know the chords because that way it'll stay magic . . .
This was literally uploaded as I was watching the Simpsons 😂😂
absolutely ADORE this i can't wait for the 7th!!!
the way this woman possesses some sort of magic and can make me feel better just with the sound of her voice
oh shit. feeling targeted here man
I did not know that I needed this 😂😂❤️😭
How is this so beautiful? You’re incredible and a genius for being able to write a song about something so silly and simple yet so real and kinda deep as well as using the theme song. I’m amazed. Fully blown away.
YESSS the LYDIAN MODE and ALL THE FEELS!!!
wow . wow . wow . songrwrittting skills .-.
I LOVE these little songs dodie makes
You shouldn't feel dumb. The Simpsons is meant to be fun, but fairly often, they throw in a real message into their cartoon.
Wow, this song is so brutaly honest!
I will never watch the simpsons the same
I love how the "I cried at the simpsons" line sounds a little bit like an arrangement of the intro theme!
the way you manage to make everything sound beautiful is honestly beyond me 💓
omg. the chorus is the theme song! this is amazing.
Ach dodie, alles wird gut!
Is this Dodie's White album period?
the!! simpsons!! are meant!! to be!!!! fun!!!!
this is so amazing and heart-touching omg you did it again dodie i didn't think i'd be feeling things over a song about feeling things while watching simpsons
Sometimes I'm concered if Dodie actually goes through the full weight of emotional ups and downs that all of her songs present because the emotional roller coaster of her discography has so many mountains and valleys I wonder how someone might manage it all.  And to think a Simpson cover made me finally ask.
*cries in lydian*
woo!
I think I cru each time I listen to your sad songs
I'm gonna end up weeping and this hasn't even started
<3
Ok I relate to this on a personal level...
INCREIBLE, la creatividad que tenes, que locura
Well now I'm sad about a show I've hardly ever seen... But it's not really about the show
Miss Dodie- this is actually amazing-
AAA LAST WEEK I CRIED AT THE SIMPSONS. it was that episode where lisa was upset about her sun teacher leaving and homer went and comforted all of the kids individually and holy moly sir it touched me and brought me to tears
She’s doing a thing again, she messes with our minds again
the odd feeling of pain from this song is unnerving yet insightful into your life. bravo
DID SHE SAY A NEW UPLOAD EVERYDAY STARTING THE 7TH?!!? BECAUSE I THINK I READ IT RIGHT BUT ALSO I BLACKED OUT A LITTLE FROM THE EXCITEMENT AJSDHFBEBS
Omg that got way to real for a song about the Simpsons.
You could literally sing a song about eating a sandwich and I'd probably still be emotional. Wtf.
Hard relate to this one
This is amazing and now I'm crying.
aa shoot I came here cause I thought Dodie had A.I. do a Dodie cover that include the simpsons smh lol
Oww♥️♥️
I LOVE YOUR CREATIVITY ♥
Beautiful song dodie I cried at the Simpson in this one episode called The Substitute, where one of Lisa’s classes gets a substitute teacher who’s great and wonderful to Lisa, and in the end he leaves and Lisa is very sad about it, but he gives her a paper and tells her that if she ever doubts herself she should read what’s written. In the end when she opens it, it just says “you are Lisa Simpson”.
When she sang the line "that cartoon family isn't mine" I let out a loud Aaaawu dodie🥺
Lots of love! This song hit hard, love it so much!
Honestly, I’ve cried to The Simpsons a couple times myself lol. I love the song by the way!
I WAS BABY SITTING SO IM LATE 🥺🥺 (I love u dodie! This song is amazing 💞💞💞)   Relating to the Simpsons is a mood... ALSO AHHH THE 7TH!!!!!
Every dodie song is underrated Dodie. is. underrated.
Now you’ve got to write a song called I cried at I cried at the simpsons
12 Days of Dodie, can't wait!!! I've never kept up with the Simpsons, but thanks for the lovely song, you talented lady.   P.S. You look stunning (you always do!).
🥺💞😭
Honestly...I did the same thing  Edit: also I missed ya!❤️
There's no need to feel so dumb There's also no need to cry Because for all the laughs and fun What matters most is they try  To treat you like a member Of their quirky little town Even only if to remember To turn a frown upside down  But still you felt something Perhaps a feeling, blue Just know that that's not nothing As long as to you it felt true  To feel like you're a member Of their quirky little town Even only if to remember To turn your frown upside down...  So whether you're a Lisa or Bart Or maybe even Maggie, dear Just know you're never far apart From the family you choose to be near.  Cheers! 💜
That cartoon family isn't mine indeed... I'm a 32 yo male and I always associated with Lisa. Not too awkwardly. I was racially and kinda gender blind as a kid and my memory starts from the age of 2. Now I know what makes people different and I still don't see any difference. I related mostly to female characters (and I still do) and I'd actually love to hear your song about Sailor Moon. :D  Or the misunderstood Webby Vanderquack from the 90's show. But I'm actually here because you're one of the most talented people out there and your music brings joy to my life. Greetings from Bulgaria and please, excuse my English... :D
Red Letter Media just released a video about a Simpson ep. that predicts 2020, and here you are with a Simpsons themed song after I just watched RLM....maybe I'll watch the Simpsons!
Easily the best dodie song ever.
i cried at a song about crying at the simpsons
YESSSS OH MY GOSH YES IM SO HAPPY YOULL BE UPLOADING AGAIN!!! How are you?
Me feeling dumb crying while watching hancock.  I love this song and the arengement.
THE WAY SHE USES THE THEME SONG IN IT DODIE YOU GENIUS
dodie could write a song about a spec of dust and still make it beautiful
I wish I was able to write like dodie! It’s unbelievable 🥰 xo
🥺
1: i like ya specs g  2: 0:44 brUh my jaw dropped ;-; (in all srsness this is such a good vent song babes)  3: uuuhhh can i ask why twwwwwwwelve.... is it what i think it is or am i assuming too muuuuuch.... idk abt you kind sus of a rrrrrrrrrelease? if its not don't stress abt it take as much time as you need (vh ٩(^▿^)۶)
awwwwww, Dodie, come here! GIve me a hug! (Lol just kidding,  don't mean to come off as creepy)
I can relate... found myself a week ago crying about Frozen songs (didn't even watch the movies yet). Elsa acts like having depressions when hiding in her room and Anna wants to play with her; the snowman (I forgot his name) is the cutest little thing ever having the most hardest dream to come true and I feel sick that his dreams are meant to fail. Also the power Elsa has while "let it go" made me cry, because I often don't feel like I could handle my life and she tells me how to do it. I often don't even have goals in my life so seeing the snowman (?) makes me in a strange way jealous and sad and shows me how low my self-isteem is and also I cried he had dreams but those couldn't come true. I wished that even his could come true when mine doesn't.   I am sorry; this is a way too long comment about sadness and depression in a movie made for children.
those will probably be the best 12 days of my year
Oh my god I love you
I cried at Dodie’s song- original song
Reminder: "The Simpsons" is meant to be fun
Babe!!!! This is so good!!!!!!!!
Awesome, Dodie! lol ... How did you know? Marge is sending you her love!
bro this hit so hard.
I like your songs but i always feel like your voice could be a little louder and more present - but i think im the only one👻😂
dodie is like the little big sister I always dreamed of 🥺🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🌻 so much love dodiedear⚘

I LOVE YOU
Oh I picked my nose to dodie singing and I feel kinda gross
I didn't expect this song to make me feel that way
What is this person! Where do I sign up to be more like this person! Omg I'm crying 😭
The theme tune melody I'm losing my mind
Dodie is a gift from god
Greets from   Nord  Deutschland    (NOT  BRD)
came from twitter hehe I love how you used the Simpsons theme in this, so sorry about your experience <3
I love the interpretation of the theme song into your melody!!!
That was incredble and really hit home!!!
i fucking love u
I LOVE THE TWIST ON THE ORIGINAL MELODY. THIS IS SO AMAZING!!! ❤️
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A HAHA FUNNY SONG NOT A SAD SAD SONG
doddleoddle this is goodddd
I CRIED AT THAT PART TO AHHEBRNF
I’m probably the biggest simpsons fan in the world. This one means a lot.
Oh my gosh twelve days of dodie coming up
i have never seen one episode of simpsons yet this still made me cry :)
a MAZE ING
would you be so kind as to post a new song soon please
Why am I crying
My last name is Simpson 🤧🤧
i cried at a dodie song again and it feels good
the egg is beginning to hatch and i am so so so excited
this is so nice! i love the melody referencing the main theme and the Ab-Bb-C cadence around the flat side of the circle of fifths! and the lyrics!
Write 100x I will not cry at The Simpsons again.
The fact that this is sad and happy all at the same time and it’s the tune of the simpsons... dodie you are a GENIUS
Any song that you write is amazing. You inspire me, I write songs now too ❤️
hello i just want to say dodie is my favourite person in the whole world thank you bye
welp. isn't that a big PHAT mood. ಥ‿ಥ
" I cried at the Simpson"  Me too dont worry bout t
listening to this while my parents yell at each other hshdjsj
My mom's been out of "visiting her sister" for a couple months now, over my dad's birthday, which she never does haha I'm not crying
Hey Dodie love your music and your cover with Jacob Collier❤️ personally I think your voice would go well with Aidan Gallagher🙃
Love how you've baked the Theme Song notes in :)
🥚
This is so beautiful, though—
I started crying at this song
I never even watched the Simpsons and yet Dodie still managed to make me sad over it :(
Dodie I swear to god, you could make a heartbreaking song about accidentally tying one shoe tighter than the other.
THIS IS SO GOOOOOD
Ouch.
Dodie, your music... 🥰😭🙏❤️ Your sound, not only your beautifully delicate voice, but everything together, creates a sound the feels like a warm hug and a soft, comforting hand on the shoulder of my inner child. Thank you so much for that. 🙏❤️🙏
I wish I had that singing voice! I just sound like a frog suck in a microwave.
dear gaia give this beautiful human being more recognition!!!
AHHHH DODIE OUR POOR BBY CRYING FROM THE SIMPSONS 😭😭 ITS OK      WE HAVE TISSUES   but will be out of them soon tho *sob sob* 👁💧👄💧👁
This has to be your cleverest, most tongue-in-cheek song yet. And I love it 🤭
With your last three videos you have managed to become one of my favorite songwriters. You are a poet!
Ok but this breaks my heart
I- I love it I grew up with the Simpsons so I feel this
She liked my tweet today and I ✨screamed✨
I cried at the song dodie made about crying at The Simpsons.
I cried at a song called I cried at The Simpsons
So you cried at the Simpsons but not bojack horsemen.
damn okay yes
YESSSS CONTENT
DODIE IF YOURE GOING TO DO THE HIDING SONG THING AGAIN I STG-
Aww this is amazing but holy fuck you okay
ohmygod is 🥚 coming???
I have cried at the simpsons MANY times, and that episode was one of them. They do stuff sometimes that reeeeeally hits you.
You cried at the simpsons  I cried at this song 🥺
Reminder: The simpsons is fun
I don't know if this is the meaning of the song but it reminds me of being young and listening to parents fighting. I feel like family is something most artists don't write much music about. It is always about love relationships but not about friendships or family. I am not judging. This is just me thinking xD  I loved the song. ♡
Where are you from?
0:43 umm ouch, my heart.
I love you sm omg, although short and about the Simpsons. You make it so easy to connect because dealing with parents divorce is hard, i know, I'm sorry.
thank you for sharing this with us dodie, it was very beautiful.
omg this is so 🥺🙁🤯
lydian is a v nice touch that makes my music brain v happy
ahh I'm so excited for daily dodie
“White people dont have a culture”  Umm then explain this sweetheart
this came out seven minutes ago and i've already watched it five times it's so heart wrenching i can't get enough
She wrote a song about crying over a funny cartoon and killed it, how the FUCK-
I cry too when I see the new seasons... Cool little tune, though.
VLOOOOOGSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Doddiiiiieeee youre beautiful
DODIE POSTED SO I AM HERE
Oh I cried at a Dodie song and I feel kinda blessed
Omg I can into this thinking it was gonna be light hearted Dodie REALLY. You're to good sometimes
well now this song might make ME cry
Dodie, you make me fall in love with you over and over every time. ♡
OKAY FROM 7TH OCTOBER UPLOADING 12 VIDEOS  EGG ON 19TH OCT?????????
i love how you used the start of the simpsons theme tune aghhh
Made my heart go D'Oh
Can relate..oops
Oh my goodness that was gorgeous
This is so good and so sad at the same time
This is brilliant bravo
This is honestly amazing
I cried at Dodie - original song
time to play this til I hate it
love the way you squeeze the actual theme melody in there too, very clever!
YAY  IM SO EXCITED FOR MORE VIDS
Dodie: cause that cartoon family isn't mine Me: holding back tears
That is sooo beautifull wowwwww
absolutely incredible dodie! how do you always make such beautiful and meaningful songs!!
THE THINGS SHE'S BEEN HINTING AT FOR MONTHS... IT'S FINALLY COMING?! 👀
oOF this hurt
idk if its her intention but ive always been able to find her songs so relatable. Like ive cried watching things im probably not supposed to be crying to, but sometimes they just hit different... :,) she makes me feel better about it
Make me smile 💚💚💚
oh my gosh  i'm in love
wait okay but does everyone remember that simpsons movie when marge taped over her and homer's wedding video?   BECAUSE THAT HAD ME BAWLING
YOU'RE AMAZING
jesus she's so fucking talented
I feel so privileged to have watched dodie on her journey from teenager to this beautiful woman today 💛 love this pretty but sad tune 😘
you’re so talented omg
I was like “okay...” when I saw the title, but someone explain to me how this is SO GOOD. The subtle theme song melody, the words, ugh so talented! I love when dodie posts little songs like these <3
Yeet
I feel like i have to say something so hi i'm just here to express how blessed by the gods i feel by dodie uploading
daily videos on the vlog channel from the seventh!? i can’t wait!!
u always know just what to write about to make me cry too ;)
hi
I refuse to believe Boris Johnson and Dodie is from the same land.
Great song.  I cried at the Miley Cyrus movie, don't be embarrassed
Oof
Stunning 😍😍😍
I just finished reading your book, it is so amazing and helped me through a very angsty last couple of days. So many tears, so much relating, discovering and feeling not alone in the world. Thank you for what you do ❤
my volume was all the way up and man this was still so calming
I always cry at the bit where Bart fails even though he prepared and studied really hard for the test. And the bit where Homer sits on the car roof and waits for his mum but she never comes...
I cried when they went separate ways in the film so I get it 💙, this song is awesome
it’s so strange to think i’ve been listening to dodie since i was like 11...
I meam eventhough its a fun cartoon they put those topics in because they know its sad an relatable i guess anyway sUe tHem fOr making you cRy
Oh wow I’m early ok everyone pretend I said something clever
“cause that cartoon family isn’t mine” made me CRYYY🥺
I LOVE YOU DODIEEEEE
CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY FOLKS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GIFTED A DODIE VIDEO
I didn't know I needed this song in my life until now
i was mid panic because of college and corona and dodie really just heard my plea for help, wow
NOOOOOO I DIDNT WANNA CRY TODAY
hey! I saw you in SLC a year ago today and I miss uuuu
I'd say it's very valid to cry because of a couple fighting, even if that couple is cartoon
Well I- now I'm gonna make a song called "I cried at a dodie song" bc...wow I relate
Dodie > everyone else.
dodie idk how but ur songs always seem to fit perfectly into what i’m feeling :( i’ve been dealing with a lot of family stuff recently and this hit hard. thanks love <3
Listening to this because it's much better than my online class
a video evERYDAY!?!?! 😱❤️
👁️👄👁️ wuau, good job 💖 Saludos desde México
that simpsons intro quotation tho !!!
I cried at a song of crying at the simpsons
YES
2 MINUTES GANG???
💜🖤💜
UH DOES THIS POSTING EVERYDAY THING MEAN SOMETHING ABOUT THE ALBUM??!?!?!?!? AHSHSDHFSJDFHJSDH
feel you, I feel like these days I can cry over just about anything ✨
why did "cause that cartoon family isn't mine" make me cry so hard edit: wait nevermind stupid question - because that cartoon family _isn't_ mine
This hits hard
It's like Bill Wurtz but in Times New Roman as opposed to Comic Sans
me after crying while watching megamind lmao
You're the best songwriter, i love this lol
the most relatable dodie song obviously
Might be in class rn but you bet I’m watching this :’)
Lovely 💖💖
Oml yessss
only dodie can make the simpsons theme song melody sound incredbly sad lol
okok-  this girl made a song about The Simpsons and still get’s to make the song touching and beautiful ;-;  one word: underrated
I thought this was a meme, but damn this is sad
Remember that episode when Homer thought he was going to die because of the pufferfish? That was legit sad and I cried.
12 videos every day???!!!!! what have we done to deserve this?? ilysm!!!!!!!
Not liking the Simpsons is not a reason to not enjoy this cute autumn breeze of a song
Boi, is this song fast! Is what I thought when I first watchef then realized I still had it put on 1.5 speed
well this little tune took a bit of a sad turn damn
I was literally writing an essay about a meaningful piece of art (one of dodie's songs) when I got this notification.
I cried at Avatar the Last Airbender and I feel kinda dumb.
it has been 1 year since i know you, first song i Heard for you called"6/10" when i heard your voice for the first time i could really say you are so talented and i'm so glad to know you , always be happy , love you doodie ❤️❤️❤️
A video everyday from 7th!? Fuck yeah! Also thats such a beautiful song dodie
This hits deeply as of late. I grew up on the Simpsons all my life, and recently my family life is slowly crumbling from beneath me. While it is heartbreaking to swallow, I love how you used the contrast and effect of the simpsons to relate to personal life. This is beautiful
A song about the Simpsons that talks about the trauma of divorce. Girl I love you
Amazing 💕
12 videos??? Blessed.
dodie youve written 12 videos a day in the description I assume that's not what you meant
💕💕💕💕💕
why did i think "12 videos every day" meant we'll literally get 12 uploads per day
THE OPENING LINE IS THE SIMPSONS THEME
OMG I LOVE
That chorus is genius
Wait this is actually kind of sad
also vedober
I really like this it’s an interesting topic for a song! I wonder, do you reply if I’m early?
Yayy

Oh I didnt even realize how early this was posted
This....this actually slaps
It took me a hot second to realize that it’s to the tune of the Simpson’s theme song and now I feel both stupid and in awe at how smart dodie actually is.
Yikes Dodie why you gotta call us out like that 😬😬😳😳😳
Omg something to do with the albums maybe?!?! Can’t wait! Also love this lol xoxo

I cried at every Dodie song. Her voice is so surreal❤

Aw dodie it's okay if you cried at the Simpsons! Also very clever how the melody sounds like the theme tune.
Beautiful song as normal  You are so amazing  I love you🥺❤️
