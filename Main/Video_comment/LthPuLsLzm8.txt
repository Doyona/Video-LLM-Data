In the part where Zoe shows the room when it’s done, she’s like fitting in to it so perfectly, because of her clothing 😂😍😍! The room is so nice, just per-fect. ❤️❤️❤️
Well done! It looks really pretty :>
This is the loveliest video ever and the room look absolutely beautiful 💛 can I ask where is your purple floral midi dress and your sage dress you had on in the video from? Thank you 😊 xxx
nalas like what’s going on???
Aww I love this vlog but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t going to miss the old style vlogs where you’d go shopping, or do your trips with Mark, your vlogmas etc. I will miss all of them but of course realise people grow up, things change, babies come lol. I don’t like change though 🤣. I love the nursery though, it’s beautiful ☺️
😍😍
Long time viewer here... you both look absolutely glowing and just so happy and excited. Alfie can’t even wipe the smile off his face. Makes me so so happy and excited for you!! Endless congratulations
Zoe you really need to buy a nice chair for the baby room
Assume you would get this comment very often, but i was just at this section of the video... Reeding to your newborn /baby /infant is really importend to develop ther speach and it also gives them quiet time and bonding time with you and in the very beginning they love your voices because they are used to them from hearing them inside the belly❤️
I love the nursery it’s beautiful and so cosy
Anyone else realise that this years vlogmas is gonna have baby in it too?!?!!
this was everything! looks amazing! and was i the only one who got teary eyed watching them assemble the cot? so crazyyy
I'm crying 😭😭😭
It’s an amazing Nursery for your little girl.  The wallpaper reminds me of Mini Mouse ears 😂 The vintage dress I thought was lovely before you explained about it. I was going to comment “love the vintage dress”.  Love the Teddybear your Mum bought.  Saw her yesterday and she’s so looking forward to meeting her Granddaughter.  You and Alfie definitely matched the room colours in last shots ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
How wonderful that you're both sharing this time .. its exciting to watch!  Adorable room
Just a tip from a childcare worker, I also have a 3 week old, don’t make the room too dark that they learn to only sleep in pitch black, you will want/need your baby to sleep in all different situations and locations, which won’t always be pitch black, and if that’s all they are used too, they won’t sleep, trust me it makes things hard when kids at work won’t sleep because it’s there is some light, and I have no doubt it makes life hard too.
Omg love the nursery! Every little detail! It just fits and it is amazing to see you guys so excited for your little one! I really wish you a smooth and hopefully easy birth and a walking on clouds feelings for the first few weeks! Love to have seen you guys grow up and now going to be parents! Sending you lots of love ❤️❤️
top shelf idea: place photos of close friends/family members there, so baby will get familiar with those faces easier ! :)
Im  just so happy I am part of this family for almost 10 years now!
the thing i loved the most in my nursery was the rocking chair, laying back and rocking a new baby is the best feeling, i feel like it would totally finish off this beautiful room and you can sit back and look around the space you created whilst rocking your baby :) just think its the best feeling personally
don't send the wallpaper back! my brother and i absolutely destroyed our wallpaper when we were kids (he took the same room when he was born and my parents made a different room mine). by the end of him being a toddler it was awful. definitely keep it.
Baby girl is gonna have the NICEST rooms with these two as parents!! She is so lucky <3
I’m so in love with the room, can’t wait to see the little princess 😍👸💜
Ahhhh! I feel like Zoe's pregnancy has just zipped on by! Seem's like just yesterday you two were announcing your pregnancy. So incredibly happy for you two. The nursery looks like a dream come true and can't wait for little girl to arrive! Wishing you a speedy and healthy delivery Zoe and Alfie!  If I had any advice to give, this one stuck out to me from my sister when she had my nephew: Internet mama's can be horrendous. They'll constantly be telling you what you're doing wrong and point it out 24/7 which can be upsetting especially with post pregnancy hormones raging. Listen to your body and baby and know you're doing things right and you are trying your hardest because you know your baby best! Obviously you're used to internet trolls but don't let any internet mama bears get in the way of this amazing chapter in yours and Alfie's lives! ❤️ Much love from California! xo
Love u. And oh,can't wait for autumn and christmas videos with a baby!  🤍
i love this little family!
On the very top shelf have her Name ❤️
Love the room your…. Congratulations mom and dad, she is a lucky girl ❤️❤️🙌🙌
Are you going to be sharing her going home outfit, hospital bag, etc at all (before or after she arrives)? I know she's going to have the cutest outfits 😍
I still remember when they announced that they were dating 😭♥️
I love how excited you are 🥰 I’m sure she’s gonna love the room and watching this video when she’s a bit older
Your baby girl is going to have several outfits a day! So many gorgeous clothes....love your nursery and the joy on your faces. Sending you love and  best wishes for a good labour and delivery of your baby girl. Kate 🥰🇦🇺
This is such a beautiful nursery, it must be so exciting seeing all of the pieces you've picked out or have been given come into place ready for your little one to enjoy. As a September baby myself am with you on the knitwear as the favourite bit! X
🥰
I like Alfie's teeth
I’m not gonna lie, I got really emotional watching this. I’m sat here watching it while my 8 month old little girl sleeps in her room and it’s brought back all the memories of getting her room ready. I cried putting the cot together with my partner cause like you, we were first time parents and it was all so exciting and nerve wracking at the same time. Your little girl is going to love her room, it’s beautiful, thank you so much for sharing this xx
it is unreal that I have been watching you guys since I was 13, I will be 23 next month, I have watched you both grow together and it is so special to me that you are sharing your parenthood journey with us. I am so excited for you guys, you are going to be wonderful parents <3 I would be lying if I said I wasn't the most emosh when you guys announced that you were going to be parents. also, this time feels like it flew by! She will be here so soon and I cannot wait to find out what name you've given her!! xoxo
The white Dulux colour is probably winter mushroom. Its one of the most popular whites we sell and it is pretty grey .
Such a beautiful room!! Such a lucky baby girl <33
It’s soo soo exciting to see them soo excited! And the fact that their baby girl will be one those lucky ones who get to seee her parents wedding, whenever they decide to get married ❤️❤️🥺🥺  can’t wait to seee her now!!
Isn’t it such a weird thought that your kid will be able to watch back all your memories from years ago? No one really has that opportunity, at least the people that are my age since my parents grew up before cellphones existed. So odd thinking that they can literally see you grow before giving birth to them!
Such a gorgeous nursery - loved the colour scheme and wallpaper. You've done an amazing job decorating it - I wish it was my room! haha You two will be amazing parents xx
you should put her name in the top shelf!!
At some point during the end of the video I remembered Zoe's joke "We'd be disgussssssting together" and seeing this now makes my heart so incredibly happy and fortunate to be a witness of such kind of love
I love everything about it!!  And I love that you both matched the colors of the room lol
Congrats to both of you. I’m so happy that your family is becoming bigger. I know that  you guys will be amazing parents. God bless y’all both. Much love ❤️❤️
Seeing the room come together got me so emotional! I'm so excited for you both!!
All the very best for the arrival of your daughter. I’m so excited for you. Enjoy this special time. ❤️🇦🇺
I absolutely love how excited alfie is❤❤❤❤so special that he picked out things for his baby girl sooooo sweet
Maybe you can add another pole in the closet underneath for any extra clothing storage
Am I the only one crying while watching this? Can’t believe they will have a little one this christmas. They will surely have a small stockings for baby deyes ❤️ so happy for them oh my gosh I’m crying again while typing this.
The nursery looks absolutely beautiful!! Y’all are going to be the most amazing parents! I can’t wait to see your new Angel baby girl and know what her name is!! Eeek!  💖😇😄
Yes read to them from the beginning and they will enjoy read when they are older.
I love her room. Throwing off a 70s vibe ✌🏻
You guys have done amazing with the room.
Omg I cried through most of this...its just such a divine babies room. Like a room in a childrens story book or movie. The colours and the light its soft and gentle and just soooo gorgeous. The bookcase Reminded me of the movie " youve got mail" just so quaint and I feel "Kathleen Kelly 😉" would have a babies room just like it...Im hoping you know the movie. Awesome job guys xxxxxxx
OBSESSED 😍
love the colour scheme of the room, layout, bits & bops. not too crazy bout the wallpaper tho. the orange looks too jarring when compared against the green
So pretty!!  Yes, you’ll need a rocking chair for baby girl! Can’t wait to see y’all with a little baby girl ❤️
Watching this after watching you both since the beginning just brings my heart so much joy and warmth. I could cry and I'm not much of a crier. You're both going to be incredible parents with incredible families. Best wishes and can't wait to follow the rest of the journey x
I love it!
🛍
Is it weird that I'm jealous of an unborn baby...?
Imagine Zoe’s baby filming a vlog herself in this room at the future 🥰
Still crazy to think that you're entering the next stage of your lives! It's gone so quick
I wonder if her name is going to be sage..... haha
zoe, wanna come decorate my room?
The nursery looks absolutely gorgeous, u did an amazing job with the colours (I love love love the minty colour 🥰) Can’t wait for baby girl to arrive! 💕
It's so beautiful!!!
omg that is baby nursery goals! can't wait for baby girl to be born!!!! ❤️❤️
I absolutely loved it, made me so emotional 🥺 I'm so happy for you guys and also very exciteddd
Happiest video on the internet right now. The progression of the room and your pure excitement and joy. I was smiling so big ear to ear the whole video. So happy for you all and thank you for sharing this! The energy was magic ✨
I love this so much! So excited for you two! Btw I can see you guys naming the baby Marigold for some odd reason. 🤍
You guys!!!! I can’t believe it is almost time. The room is awesome. Congratulations again.
This video makes me so happy they are going to be the best parents ever I wish them so much happiness and love xx
It's so cute, omg it makes me so emotional
omg this makes me so excited - not long now! It looks so soo good! Baby girl is going to be super fortunate to have you both as parents🥺❤️
WHY AM I SO FUCKING EMOTIONAL
I was given a teddy bear just like that as a baby, and it is the only childhood toy that I have kept to this day! I'm sure your baby will love it. I want to get one for my baby too!
It's so cute, i watched Jim' ans Sara's nursery tour yesterday and it feels alike as you have the same changing table and some mural decorations are the same, yet it still feels very different !
Im so inlove! And im so excited to see ur journey with this baby girl 💗💗💗 much love and hope u will be showered with so much more blessings. 🥰🥰🥰
I’d deffo add some cute sun catcher stickers to the windows to shine some rainbows around
Following zoe and alfie for about 7 years now and every vlog they post this just makes me more excited !! can't wait for baby girl to come  <3
The changing table is the same as Jim Chapman one
Such a happy video! Loved it
The room looks absolutely beautiful,  Won’t be long before she’s here - such an exciting time for you 🥰
Soakin in all the first time parent excitement ♥️ So much fun. Happy Days
My little heart 🥰🥰  This was sooo lovely, such a gorgeous room.
Just as beautiful as I imagined it would be🤍
omgg you guys, this is the cutest thing ever!!! everything is so beautiful, I'm glad you  didn't go for a theme but a color scheme, I think it's easier to change things around when you get bored of something lol. I love that blue/green color, it's really nice, the canopy is so freaking cute and the art gallery is my faveee 😌💜✨ well done guys!!!
This is the most beautiful baby room ever
I bloody love the colours of this room! xx
The room turned out beautifully. I love it, I can't wait to see you guys in there with your baby girl. Maybe get a little rocking chair to sit and read to her ❤️.
Do you guys still have some of the stuff you’ve bought in previous vlogs from years ago that you had bought for your future kids? Like the stuffed ostrich? Loving the baby room it looks amazing! Can’t wait for you both to have her 😊
Ahhh so well thought out love the room!!
Love the aesthetic of the nursery, the mint, pink and orange just keep it so fresh and light! I'm sure you can't wait for her to get here already!
AAA its so cute🥺🥺 i love the colour scheme! 💗
I'm glad that you shared her room with us! My favorite part was the canopy over her crib Plus, the color scheme is wonderful. It looks nice and cozy and ready for your little girl!
It’s beautiful I think you guys nailed this 🧡
Absolutely stunning Zoe
I am literally no one to the baby girl but I am soooo freaking excited 🥺❤
Just watched the Vlogmas video where Alfie carried that baby around the Christmas market... And now he's about to be a father 😭
I think i will cry when the baby is here 🥺💕
Awww that room is so cute 😍 🥰 . She is gonna be like a little princess in that room. And all those little clothes 🤗 . That's to adorable. OH ZOË  make room for CHRISTMASDRESSES 🥰🥰❤ ❤. Maybe a fun idea to Ask a pictures from everyone in the family and place them on the pinboard. Such as pictures from grandmother and grandfathers and uncles and aunt's. And Guncles such as Mark and Joey . So you can make a ritual with " goodnight " so she learns the faces with the names. ( I did that with my son) . Basicly you are learning them not only the names and faces. But also.. " oh he or she is on my wall so I can trust that person" . I cant wait to see photos from her. But I do understand it if you would say " I wanne keep her face private " . Ohw this is so excited 😊 🤗  enjoy your last few days with Alfie. 😘 BTW you look so beautifull pregnant. I was 38 weeks when I had my son. But I looked like a WHALE 🐋. 🤣🤣 greetings from the Netherlands 🇳🇱  (Anne) Miekje
Here before this gets a million views 🤣🤣
Oh my goodness, you’re going to be able to decorate her little fireplace for Christmas 🥺🎄
2:58 hes already nailing THE dad stance he’s totally ready
It’s so crazy to think about all the years of videoes! I remember when you did Alfies makeup way back in 2013 or even further back! The  nursery is beautiful! I am so happy for you guys, and you’re going to be amazing parents🤍
With the left over wallpaper you can use it as scrapbook paper or for picture frame collages. Btw I love the room and so happy for you two. Been following you since I was 12. I’m now 19. Congratulations on everything
Predicting the name Autumn after the clip of you going through the clothes!! And how cute does Autumn Deyes sound 🤎🍂
Perfect x
Such a great Vlog 😊🌺🌺🌺🌺
I love it! She’s so lucky, she’s got the best bedroom ever and two loving parents who have excellent taste in decor. 😘🥰
Is it me or at 10:38 I can see a sign with a letter ‘ N’ on the left ? Maybe a hint for the baby’s name ?
Love how Zoe and Alfie matched outfit colour with the room wall colour when doing the tour 💚💕
I’m super happy and counting days for baby girl to be born, the room is fabulous and the colors are so comfy and cute! I have a twin boy and girl and i think these colors will suit their room so much!
It's PERFECT 👌❤️ How Exciting 🐣🍼
When people come and visit you should take a Polaroid and add it to the pinboard ! So it becomes a collection of photos with her and all the people she will learn to love ❤️ and then you could keep it for her when she’s older, or scrapbook them
Been waiting for this one!!! ❤️❤️
Literally the luckiest newborn ever! God bless you guys
Such a lovely room ! You’ve done really well xx
This made me emotional. So so happy for you guys.  It is such a lovely nursery! ❤️
That room is BEAUTIFUL, it makes me cry with happiness to see you so excited and loving. That little girl is already the luckiest. She's coming to the world in a loving beautiful family.
Perfect! That galery wall....
It is so precious!!! Beautiful job! So excited! 🥰
Waw sooo cool, Im also excited 🥰😍🥰😍
GUYS I'M DYING OF EXCITEMENTTTT AAAAH
I'm so excited to see her!!!! 🥺🥺🥺
The room looks absolutely stunning - baby girl is already so loved
I literally remember watching you doing car boot hauls on your parents floor years ago I've watched you for that long - now the fact you're having a baby it's such a special event and I'm so happy for you both! Stunning room too! 🥰
It’s awesome I love it, she’s a very lucky little girl to have parents like you. 💗
The mirror is a good idea for you and the baby. They’re curious seeing themselves, but also when you’re walking and bouncing them on your chest or shoulder to sleep, the mirror helps you see when they have fallen asleep or still dozing
beautiful job guys!!
Cutest baby room ever…omg!! So excited for you both!! 💕
Such a lovely room - I think you should have something with her name on for that very top shelf x
I'm so excited for you both and want to wish you all the luck in the world with baby girl! This video has 100% made me ever more broody but for now I'm just vicariously living through your process. The room is beautiful and is definitely going to be ideal for her x x
I grew up watching your YouTube videos and this just made me so emotional 😭
Lovely
This is the ultimate dream room for baby girl, the colour scheme is so lovely 💖
Congratulations!! Absolutely beautiful baby's room,  😍  great job! Thanks for sharing!
You look soooo happy 😊🤍
Looks absolutely gorgeous!!! Can’t wait to see baby girl ♥️
My heart 🥺 Not long to go, my 2014 heart is crying right now ❤️
As someone who has watched both of you since before you were even a couple..this is wild! What a beautiful life you have built together❤
This is sooo cute! I absolutely love the color scheme in the room!
Looks amazing 🤩🥰💛
Genuinely cried watching this. Watching the two of you grow together as a couple as I’ve grown up myself has been so inspiring and now starting your family with your precious baby girl on the way makes me so very happy for the both of you. Wishing you all the best in this next chapter of your lives xx
So cute! So excited for you both💕
butterflies. beautiful room! and so so so excited for you guys 💖💖
You should put framed photos of you, alfie and her on the top empty shelf :)
You should put some photos on the top shelf (maybe if here when she is born?)
zoe: "what are you most excited about?"  alfie: "the socks" LOL
Oh my goodness!! It turned out better than I imagined it to be! Love the color scheme and the stuffed animals in the room, the books, the outfits! Honestly it’s making me look forward to when my husband and I have our kids!! I’m so excited for you guys!! This room makes it all seem so real!! Not that your belly didn’t, but being prepared and having this space for your baby girl all ready makes it seem like she’s coming tomorrow!! I’m so happy for you both, you guys deserve this happiness, love you guys! 🥰💙
Such a beautiful space!! You should take a square of the wallpaper and frame it, that way one day if she outgrows it or whatnot, you’ll have a cute art piece that’s also sort of momentous💛
I'm so excited for them. I've been watching Zoey since before they were together! Now they're having a baby and they're going to be the perfect family. So proud of you guys! I'd love to have a life like yours one day💓
I remember watching you and Alfie all those years ago and been SO happy with every new challenge, and how you've grown up together. I'm so so excited and happy about this new chapter in your new life. You'll do AMAZING!!
Watching this warms my heart
How can anyone possibly not like this video? I LOVED IT
Absolutely obsessed with the new room! Did such an amazing job and i cannot wait till she's in the room. Love u both xxxxx
This is by far the cutest baby room I have seen. I love it! I would for sure be spending a lot of quality time in there even before baby girl’s arrival.
the cutest video ever!!
Why do I want to cry while watching this 🥺 this makes me so excited to start a family one day
I love this so much!! I am incredibly excited for you both and can't wait to see Baby Deyes!!!
Guys the nursery is beautifull , the colours are so cute and lovely ,can't wait to meet her and so excited to see what her name will be xxxxx
So exciting so happy for you both! It’s gone so fast the room looks BEAUTIFUL I love it so much 😍

This is honestly so beautiful guys 💕 the colours are stunning!!!! So excited for you both 💕
i was just reading through my old journals from when I was younger and found I had written "CONFIRMED: ZALFIE IS REAL" at the top of one of my entries in 2013😂 it was such big news. so heartwarming to see the beautiful life you've built together and your gorgeous family growing.
Keep the wall paper, you can replace strips when needed cause it might get ripped or something
She is almost here and I can’t believe that they will soon be parents to the cutest little girl
I’m so intrigued to see how much you actually use the nursery!!! Please updates us 6 months, 12 months etc
SOOO happy for both of you!! I can feel the love and excitement for baby girl! Love this 💖💖💖
I am so so SO excited for the baby and keep my fingers crossed for easy and quick labour! the room looks so cosy, I'm jealous haha
Oh my goodness how beautiful is that purple dress on you!! I’ve followed you for almost 8 years now, crying with such happiness ♥️
Yaaaay 😍💖✨
