Damn, puberty hit him hard
Muscle man is that you? 0:07
I came across your channel yesterday, I’ve now watched a lot of your videos and Oml I’m enjoying the stupidity of these “speed-runs” haha. Absolutely hilarious stuff! It’s so funny how people fake these videos, say that they’ll edit a certain out and not do it 😂 it’s so funny!  Anyways, I’m thoroughly enjoying all of this nonsense, new sub. 😂
The 3rd one is hilarious
Is bro my teacher for anyways 7:03

When I’m sad I just watch ayundaru to feel happy again

Did you notice on the second speedrun he starts on level 7
Bro in the intro sounded like muscle man from regular show
Really hope the thing at 5:51 is a mod as it looks really interesting
The intro got me combat killed and left the server☠️
That's not TaeKwondDo because I do it and it looks nothing like it. It's probably some other type of martial arts, and people who use TaeKwonDo in public to go beating up people would always wear their uniform as it is disrespectful not to. Amazing vid tho keep on making videos like these!!
That's you
I love it when you say what in tarnation
the last one is you
Ok The Last One Was Hilarious 🤣🤣😂 What Was That
me realising hiding a fake speedrun is harder than doing a normal speedrun
Funny 0:07
LOL
4:04 do we get 7 exp bars or smth in start of the game?
8:38 wow, what a battle
It’s not fake It’s funny.
You suck
whats even more fake then the speedruns is your videos 🍥
For the hotbar it is possible to start with a differnet selected slot in a new world

fake speedrunners literally have ADHD lmao
“10 years in the caves made you a fucking miner” -Knee She Key
Why do I feel like it is always the children that cheat?
are these ACTUAL speedruns or just people who "speedrun" , bc they are so obviously fake it cant be real speedruns right?
I love your content ayundaru i am a big fan i watch your videos everyday Keep up the great work ayundaru! Edit:DAMN MY KEYBOARD
5:02 he fails a bucket
holy fake bro ur literally just not even getting these online ur hiring people
i can't believe they think other people are stupid enough to believe this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro killed a zombie with a sword then crafted a sword?
You have to give the last one credit, Darkeater Midir ain't no easy boss, as a matter of fact i find it to be one of the toughest i faced in DS3
hahahahaha wohhhhahahhahahhahahahahahhahaha w
That last one could be an update
I think the reason they make these speedruns a lot is cuz of ur channel (not all of them, but probably most of them cuz I like to make up Minecraft speedruns I never did ending up on ur channel)
the secod "speedrunner" miss his mlg but he dint lose his life
I question people's commen sense if they think these will ever work and hope they see these videos and realize how dumb they were because my brainchild and committed sepuku
No another day another victory for the OG TAKING DOWNS SWEATS THE IMPOSTORS AMONG US
6:37 for anyone wondering, that guy was playing smash bros(yes, steve is in smash bros)

He rkod the enderman
I liked my owned comment
1:50i love this part 2:37 this part too
These runs are just getting ridiculous at this point
1:11is that un snow-covered grass?
As a roblocs player this is legit
The banana man is legit
The start 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Insulting other speedruns: Nah Insulting his OWN speedrun: Yes
I didn't know muscle man played minecraft
Minecraft player:fake pig doesn’t drop gapples.Pre-Ks:Wait y pig no shiny apple?
you know who else fakes minecraft speedruns
💀 if you look closely here 1:55 you can see a other obsidian block building obsidian 💀💀, aswell as this end frame portal building a enter portal 2:39 💀💀
The first SPEEDRUNNER, what is his yt
I think you’re just jealous of their minecraft speedruns😏
This is just disrespectful to all legitimate speedrunners everywhere.
hear  me there is someone stealing your videos and puting them into shorts they name is monarchW
8:34 OH OK. I'm kinda into it. That's a genuine good one.
A self building nether portal not sus at all
Props to you for your sacrifice on your braincells just to entertain us
0:00
Even if the speadrun was fake at least they got the dragons gender right 5:29
at 6:26 the game was super smash bros on the nintendo switch
The second one made me die laughing
Minecraft Steve dies in a drunk driving accident
his sarcasm is so good, i cant tell if he actually doesnt know if steve is in smash bros.  (no really im bad with sarcasm)
Like honestly, I think these videos are just Clickbait just to get views from kids 😂 😂
First one was def satire
You made one of them
Everyone was totally Legit
More real than dream
if you aren't already you should consider being a speedrun moderator
Just imagine being that stupid to try pass any of these as legit speed runs :P
Smash bros Mario kart i need to update my game
Whats the name of the channel i wanna laugh at him
As dream (and not a nether portal) i can comfim the last ine was legit
He didnt say on the 1st one that he spawnded with lvl 6 (i know who cares)
I'm too lazy to press the subscribe button
They didnt drink 50 cups of coffe they drank redbull
Speaking of why doesn’t he have 1M subs
muscle man just dies 9 seconds into the video
I’ll help you hit 1 million bro
they were playing super smash bros. ultimate literally
That’s super smash bros 6:23
The speedruns make me wanna make a true speedrun
4:08 Spawned in and already 7 levels?
1:11 couldn’t help to notice but this sounds like train wreck of electro swing
Why muscle man doing a Minecraft speed run 💀💀
5:08 - So 1 million subs = turn into monkey?
I dont even play or like minecraft but i saw one clip of these videos in Tiktok now i need to watch them all 😅
7:56 STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When he was playing a random game, that was his😂
On the first one there was no cover me in debris advancement when he got the netherite armor 😂
My eyes burn...
6:10 pretty sure that’s his video
Bro got that Muscle Man voice in the intro.
bro the beginning got me laughing bro
The video didn't even begin and I'm already dying
Bro the last one was sick
Lol
Lõõç œû5

5:51 Anyone know, what is name of this mod?
I'm curious what mod they used for the cool wither boss, gave me quite the dark souls vibe
is nobody gonna ask about that wither clip?? is it a mod?
This is your speedrun
6:06  AA AAA AAAA AAAAA AAAAAA AAAAAAA AAAAAAAA
That intro is priceless as always
Waa fürn komischer typ der speedrunner🙄🤦🤷‍♂️
dude in the last one played the every game on steam 💀💀
The outside of the subscribe button turned rainbow
5:15 the subscribe button outlines in rainbow on my android
Funny thing is a person like him accidently showed his username in an apparently random speedrun
0:07 bud no joking💀
6:18 super smash bros
I'm pretty sure he fought Alduin in that last one.
Why does he use the same footage with his Minecraft character jumping and punching in front of video feed over and over again? He does it so many times.
Anyone would need a therapist after that to recover these kids cheat
the second run is something amazing, some of the best idea ever, and the final bos in dark souls style is the cherry on top, nice job
I choose "They get a banana" and appears someone with a banana skin!
When there’s multiple questions in a YouTube video, I always pick the dumb one
1:49 nanotech nether portal

"Minecraft steve just learns Taekwondo" 🤣🤣🤣
As a minecraft fan I can confirm that the 3rd one is real
I like the last one I would count that as a speed run
wdym
The first was so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
These fakes playing on computers: (wasting their time making cuts and edits)  Me on mobile who can just pause my screen recorder whenever I want:
He drank prime
what mod is that at 5:53
Random kid: OmG GuyS WerE goNNa SpEeDruN MInEcRaFt!! Bender from Futurama: Welp, if no one's gonna beat their kids, guess I'll have to do it.
Me

Me pls I have a channel
Muscle man?
That sword 4000
The one witj the mulit minectafts is also in the vid, how to beat minecrafy the right way.
6:09 I swear that was you doing that
The second player spawned with level 7 stating he already played- if it wasn’t more obvious the speed runner: “OMg ItS InVISibLE HEroBRinE WhO spLAshed BoTtle O ENChantTings”
Did you submit your fake speedrun?
8:22 wtf
if you look carefully at speedrun #1, you might spot something irregular, and it's not the incredibly unique and real seed. NO! their timer doesn't exist.
2:13 now, the blazes might be uncommon, but if you speedrun long enough it's bound to happen! but they did it on a hypixel server? >.>
Muscle man playing minecraft 0:00
Turn to our lord and saviour Jesus so you can enter his kingdom of God and change your and others lives and souls amen ❤❤
Did bro drink 5,000 cups of coffee?
Bro is reacting to his own videos
This is the video that made me love you like I was like how how funny another 1 of those stupid stupid youtubers making this horrible content I Scroll past it not even caring who it was made by I went off to go find another video then went to search But and then I don't even know When I found your channel but I just Just came across you And I didn't even realize what Has happened back in The day I didn't even realize that this was the same youtuber I clicked on the video and then saw And then I clicked on it and I loved it I clicked on your channel And then Saw the great content The great content you've made And then all the videos Inspired me Can I just kept watching your video until the curfew went on You don't even know what a curfew is I bet Well basically at 10:00 for me It shuts down and I have to guess a code To get it out I've done it in a few times But my dad it So I hope you read the this entire comment and I don't care goodbye oh and have a good day... Oh and I forgot Make sure to never fake a speed Runner A speedrun I'm not telling you that you did it just make sure you did it And if you ever do just please never do it again
As a Minecraft player all are real nothing wrong here 😁👍🏻
What's the song called in the beginning?
you deserve more subs
the start...
It'S jUsT a CaNoN EvEnT 4:03
I 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂5
why did the guy in the start sound like muscle man 💀
Are the speedruns meant to be real??? Or are they made as jokes
MUSCLE MAN!? WTF
The only players who can beat Dream and Technoblade
TOTALLY LEGIT🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Bro check this out. I feel like this will happen. So. A speed runner started playing but instead teleported in the end.  !?!? Then just became in front of the ender dragon . But then instead Became Infected upgraded titan speakerman.  6700 hearts . Then iutsm just teleported to the over world. Then a Real speed runner joins then saw iutsm in-front of him. Then he ran away from iutsm shooting his 2 blasters to him he teleported to the nether iutsm followed him and then he was stuck in a nether fortress A invisible  player helped him mined away. Then he found escape from the overworld iutsm decided to go to the other side then he became in the bamboo forest while the speed runner was at the destroyed village   HE WAS NEAR THE TITAN. Now remember the invisible player earlier? He also became a titan . Utsm. Also upgraded. 800.789 health .Then iutsm found him and fight him And...                I will continue this when you make a new video
It’s always kids that fake there speed runs
My favorite part of the whole thing was the battlefront 2 section because it is literally my dad's favorite game
I did a speed run once and I had the eyes of ender but just before I went through the portal i literally fell into lava.
The second one had 7 level
1:48  that’s a fake fake speedrun
bro the first one... when he entered the nether it said [VIP+] man did that on a hypixel smp...
Bro is an actual minecraft speed run inspector 💀💀
MC Speedruns in Ohio 💀
0:06 we didn’t even start the video☠️
The last one is actually him because if you see the video from two months ago then he was playing
I don’t believe these are real
Bruh i can't believe he used a smash bros dlc
Last one was real
6:15 lol

*Promo sm* 💘
ⁿ⁰
I think that’s a bit more than a couple blaze rods 💀
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT MINECRAFT WITHER MOD
As a girl which plays Minecraft, they should know what really is a speedrun and Herobrine is a creepypasta character and not a speedrun helper, btw awesome video as always.
Glad to see some variety with the thumbnails now.
Faking fake speedrun lmao
Bro for the first speedrun he could have used the end crystals on the obsidian and I would not hurt as he has a rotem of undying
😡
Totally legit speedrun😂😂😂
5:52 Bro what is this mod? It looks sick.
When Will U Come Back?
The second speeprunner already has 7 XP!!!!!!

Ayundaru why dont you make more videos on ayundaru 2 I love to see you play
These look pretty legit to me! I’d say your going crazy because pigs can drop a stack of god apples
Why did Muscle Man speedrun in the beginning
Bro is that muscle man from regular show in the first clip
I AM PRO SPEEDRUNNER I NO LIE
More like lowest IQ minecraft players. But then what do you expect from kids.   Makes you wonder, if they’re this dumb playing minecraft then how dumb are they in real life?
So I'm pretty sure the first one was them making a parody of McYum's parody of fake speed runs
6:03 "That boss- pah that boss was so easy that was a piece of ca- AAAAH-"
HE'S BACK
Bro, can we get a link to that last video? Actually wanna watch that sleed run, soudns legit.
ACTUALLY, spawning in a village isnt impossible. TWICE in 1 HOUR of generatimg worlds i spawned in a village. One in a fountain (not a well) and another literally right next to (touching) a house.
4:37 it sounds Iike sh-
😶🍌God 🤔
In the third or fourth speedrun the first transition into a different game was Super Smash Bros ultimate
If the speed Warner weren't goofy enough this goofy goober decides to be oblivious to know what the hell is Super Smash Bros ultimate
Some of these just seem like they are fake on purpose  This goes for the over videos too
3:12 the moment I saw the VIP+ tag previously in the nether, I knew it was a public server aka Hypixel
keep the work up! is so good! luke
Dude, you're trashing kids...grow up
0:07 “muscle man is that you?”
0:00 Muscle Man?
I can say as a Minecraft player the last one is 100% real
He said speed frunner at the space ship
dragon steve next vid from him
0:08
Doobadadodususysu da dududdu    Dududadu
Lol862 which is the current bedrock wr holder and his run is fake
6:44 Bro made a phantom minecartbooth
Not to mention the 2nd one has 7 levels when he spawns
I had the Best minecraft speedrun
😅i can't believe he watch his own fake speedrun
love how that guy staright up fought ds3 midir
you obviously made these
bro how do fake fake speedruns
0:07 not even 15 seconds into the video and it’s already funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You know the guy that was going in other games was cheating but it was also kind of cool Not gonna lie     That was actually YOUUUUU😂😂😂
1:56  "builts"💀
"the same amount of enthusiasm as if i would hit 1mill subscriber"  deal. we expect now, that you bring out a video were you just escalate exactly like the speedrunner. over the reached 1 million. the video must be at least 2 minutes long, and only deranged overenergetic rambling over the reached milestone.  its not that far away anymore.  do you accept the challange? (its more like a suggestion..)
The Last one got me WR no cap
999,936th view
Bro at 0:05 it's weird
Bro went into smash bros
Even i wasn‘t able to figure out wich battlefront hero you modded to steve.
The second guy needs 1.2 million chill pills
Ah yes minecraft has smash bros, mario kart and yakuza
Sir, i think you dropped something shiny, do you know if its yours? I think it is.👑
YOOO what mod is 5:50 from!?!

6:29 ⬆️
was the start of the video meant to sound like muscle man from regular show?
1:11 floating villager house top
The last one is pure gold lol
ItS JusT THe SEed BrO
What’s the clip at 5:50?
Bruh what? What?
i lit guessed right on 1st
why you stage your videos?
I was thinking that even though the last one was fake it was still funny to watch ngl
The firsy one is legit
The Scream💀💀💀💀💀
i am personally embarrassed by these guys
At 6:52 didn’t you use the same thing 4 the first fake Minecraft video
Why did the guy in the intro sound like Muscle Man from Regular Show
The first one was made by a 4 year old kid for sure dude.
I need the name of the last “Minecraft” speedrun
got the rank vip+ also the ENTIRE video is fake
You deserve 1m subs
banana man ba banana man
domens
The game switcher one was the most creative shit ever, props to him
You told me too so I subed
The first one had ranks?
Hey, Ayundaru, Remember me? I subbed since 41k.
Uhh somethings wrong with youtube again i clicked on another video but it just changed the comment section
0:00 best speedrun
Let’s go he’s uploading again
I knew that it was his video because i seen the video a few times.
The first video Soo funny 🤣🤣😂
Credit byebye
Holy oogly boogly this was an amzing video
IS THAT DARK SOULS AT THE END LMAO
The dirt in the fake fake speed run looks like ltns lawn on the top
Let's appreciate the first speedrunner and his friends at least know how to build the end portal  For the thing in 6:20, I'm pretty confident it's Steve in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
No way he used Smash bros to get full diamond 😂
I mean that floating potato was sus but the rest is no doubt real
E .D
Hahahahahahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊😊 you shuld play try not to laght
It’s invisible herobrine!!!!!!!
the sad thing is that real speedruns on set seeds are faster than these pathetic fake ones
Im ded bruh
That first one had to be a joke. There's no way that kid actually was trying to submit it as a real Minecraft Speedrun. I'm pretty sure he himself noticed how beratingly obvious that was and the invisible herobrine thing had to be a joke too because there's no way he thought that would actually be accepted.
What is he talking about it’s real bro
The last one is very legit tbh
https://youtube.com/@Ur-ass_Gaming                        His videos are very legit😮
HE RETURNED
Did you kniw that bake beans
The last one was real
The debug stick grass 💀💀💀
e
the last one was probably a troll 😂
the funniest part of the first one is that its in a hypixel smp
can i make a fake speedrun for you? unguarunteed though dont expect anything cause im prolly making pether nortals with world edit
These speedrunners need to take skills. As me. I quitted minecraft because I suck at the game other than just cheating minecraft.
But this kid entertaining us lol
HE CAME BACK
Why does the first kid sound like violet from the incredibles
Bro even though I HATEEEE fake speed runners it’s so funny
The game on the 3rd run is super smash bros ultimate
hi
bro just went to smash bros ultimate dlc pack 2, jailbroken/hacked mk 8 deluxe, GTA5, hacked star wars, AND FUCKING MODED DARK SOULS. bro's speedrun can't be more legit tbh
As a minecrafter all the speedruns in the videos are actually Real I'm from ohio
Finally after so long he uploded again😀
I Need this category speedrunfakeany%
Can't wait for "The Funniest Fake Minecraft Speedrun You've Ever Seen" and intro probably gonna be like: fake minecraft speedruns are hilarious because they're terrible at editing
The first one is obviously satire  Edit: *Sigh* And the second one  Edit: Third one too  Edit: And the fourth
Unpopular opinion but at this point it feels like he’s just staging them
That last one is comedic gold
JaVa AdIsION?????
Bro loves netherite
Analyzing your own fake speedrun. Amazing.
This is what happens when you let a game journalist's kid play any video game what so ever
Bro really had elden ring or whatever that was😂
The first ones real wym man
Good to have you back! I missed ur videos
Bro youve made like 50 videos with the same exact name💀
the intro is absolutely incredible
L O L did he seriously mistake, saying said the word shield and said $hit 😂😂😂😂 💩
I know why the second  Speed runner has so much energy He made coffee with  Red Bull instead of water now he can see sounds
what mod was that wither in
These speed runs are obviously real! They just have great gaming chairs!
How many people believe these?
the first one was so funny XDD
maybe thats y thats y a guy said he saw aliens in the us
This Is My Favorite!😂😂5:50
Funny
You think that's cheating watch grox's speedrun and tap grox speedrun
muscle man in the intro
You can't be a real Minecraftian if you haven't seen the Banana Man
1:11 ISNT THAT THE RAREST BLOCK IN THE GAME
jubu dudu
The last one was soooooo real
8:09 you can say he was space out to end 😅😅😅
i think all of these are jokes..
at the last one i swear to god i almost broke my phone when i saw that there wasnt a dating simulator
im the goofiest goober in everything
Hello, WHY all speedraners are kids?😮
btw the first speedrun is supposed to look fake on purpose lol
First 1 was 100% aa joke NO way ☠️☠️☠️
The yakuza section was amazing.
BRO STOP MILKING THE SAME CONTENT
Average ayundaru speedrun video  -"fake minecraft speedruns are hilariously ___"  -"UuUh ThIs OnEs LeGiT"  -include fake speedruns that were made as jokes  -make some low effort thumbnail  -get 10k views
6:26 its super smash bros
the first one was literally on a hypixel smp server which was pretty funny
NGL the one with the bar didn't even feel like they were trying to actually speedrun
8:03 bro doesn't know what battlefront 2 is
honestly, the minecraft speedrun with supersmashbros+mariocart+whatever that karate thingy was is pretty cool
when you let 6 year olds on ur gaming PC
A legend back
I think your help Boyer I think why did you do that? I was sick under your bed tonight and Calloway said no ha OK paste that what you gotta do❤😂 😢😮😅😊
th reason why the pig dropped golden apples is because it hate them but didnt chew so they got stuck in its throts
It is not impossible to spend in a village I have before
i love the intro he just ended up sexing his own trhoat
I’m the first one I guessed the BANNANA as a joke but yea
The cut to smash bros mario kart and kazuya 💀
why was the banana so funny?!
bro is literally busting fake speedruns that are a joke 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Yes I found it…
The 16k liker
There is no way the last speedrun's off the mark
FACE REVEAL!!!!!
This just feels like mobbing children, I don't like it. The ending is good, just the beginning sucks. But your acting is at least so good that I can't say for certain that this is a joke
Best fake Minecraft speedrun beside linusstudios
how dare you say that the first one was fake, it's obviously real and it is speed running history. don't you even dare disrespect anything of that level again.  EDIT: omgg thank you so so so so much for one like
I like the part where u ask ur friend to make a video of a fake speedrun
You should add fundys speedrun to this video series 😂
6:09 i love how he used his own video as a "fake Minecraft speedrun"
0:05 that's me 😂
Ngl I wasn't expecting to hear Trainwreck of Electroswing. A welcome surprise
5:52 mod name?
You have 1 video per 3 month but with this edit and commenting is worth it
912

The 2nd FAKE speedrunner started with 7 xp levels 😂😂
Bro fought bedrock wither😭
you are right bro theyre cheating
Elden ring
The first one speedrunner is a 6 year old kid💀
His own speed run should be submitted under "all games 100% random."
Do you love Israel?
Funny how fake speed runs are now not even fast enough for the world.record unless they reset the the timer because of herobrain Cause mojag forgot to say they removed him  World records like 7 45
As a minecraft speedrunner I can confirm that the first one was absolutely legal
He was in smash then Mario kart and then... IDK and then star wars / samus? And then IDK.......
Ayundaru your video is funny entertained me very much keep it up
That he explained the fakest speed run that killed pig and apple dropped down in reality someone was on air and was invisible who dropped an enchanted golden Apple

6:21 That's SSBU, the game the last 4 letters of my username are derived from.

bruh
Congrats on 700k subs
Damn I'm pretty sure that 2nd one was legit tho... Ty so much for using my vid man, keep up the love ❤
The first kid is jealous. He saw the Minecraft speedrun world record and was determined to beat it. Instead of using time and effort, he just decided to cheat his way to beating it. I'm sure he didn't even set the world record lol

Hang on that 3rd person one is a different vid entirely as a joke
I will pray for all those Ender Dragons
funniest video ever
Do you see banana man?
Noooo
WHY IS HE SHOWING HIS OWN SPEEDRUN
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
2:11 ~ a potato flew around my room ~
Who is Jonneny and where is Michael?
Smash ultimate

Normal day in Ohio (☞ ͡ ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ ͡°)☞
I have been so addicted from watching your videos. I hope you are enjoying your day.
As some one that never beat the game yet i feel real pain in the vid and i died like 1000 times
Wait someone played dark souls to beat minecraft:and he beat midir

0:00 Mucle Man joined the chat
the emeredstone block
Hi
The one at the bar steave was I think knarfy or something
sweeping edge toggle would be so cool on bedrock but mojang is too idiotic to understand that so they just want to make a complicated combat V2.0. Addons have much potential but for $$$ they are restricting them. #FreeAddonsForConsoles
When we need him the most, he returned
Lmao
love your videos they are so funny hope you reach 1 million soon good luck with youtube  and stuff.
That kid is so bad in speed run already speed run in third times a Road because you smell like shit
Ayundaru during the second speed run: “he has about as much enthusiasm as I would if I hit 1,000,000 subs”. Me: I believe in you 😊
HOW DID YOU NOT NOTICE HIS FRIEND WAS HELPING HIM BUILD THE NETHER PORTAL
Why does the first speed runner have jump bost
the one at the start of the video💀
LETSSD GOOOO AYUNDARU UPLOADED
“In record time” proceeds to show timer almost 2 minutes behind the wr
I loved how he sang the dream speed runing song lol do do boo doo goo ala doo  as he makes the worst portal ever!!
is not impossible to spawn in a village and in night, one day i created a new minecraft world and i spawn next to a ruin portal village with black smith and in night.
Last one was actually fun tho I appreciate the effort they put into
6:09 is a masterpiece of satire. Good god, it's actually really well put-together and it's funny too.
Can you make other video other than fake minecraft speedrun?
honestly, these videos make me laugh more than anything else on youtube combined
When I first saw this video it was released ten hours ago oh my God I love the fake speedruns and you finally released a new one keep up the good work man love you videos❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
PoV: your trying to get the most comments
bro this is just a fuckin joke u take this too seriously
What mod is that wither from at 6:01
As a random player that only have 1.13,i can say all are legit
What that’s the parasite, God oh and he was in super smash brothers
At this point, people be faking speed runs so ayundaru can roast them.
finally 10 years later
I was waiting for this! Thanks😊
Imagine trying to tell this guy a joke
I love the inclusion of Smash Bros. Ultimate!
Yknow that last one is kinda creative
the beating up an enderman game was Yakuza zero for those wondering
5:50 totally legit
where do you even find those bruh
It's been so long since he posted a video like this, that his voice is deeper
100% video cover will always be in the the end 56% who played to play the wrong footage 98% that the ender dragon will be a kind of or.
Terible
Let’s let him hit 1m
in the first spedrun at the bigining there was a person and hole in the Box
Goofiest goofer
I’m pretty sure that village in the second speed run is in a grox video
Bro has been dead for a krilion years that he get a crown for that💀💀
lets go the fake speedrun exposer is back!1!1111!!!
6:20 super smash bros ultimate Minecraft dlc I have it that why i know what this is
Bro hello do you remeber me
Floating potato 🥔😂
YEEEEESS NOW MY DAY IS COMPLETE😊
7:24 Steve when no body is playing Minecraft 😂
i lost soo many braincells watching ur speedrun bro am out i have headache
Banna man is here watch out marvel
nah am out bro am out
no way.i laughed so much my lungs are hurting me this speedrunners are soo goofy
6:21 that is SMASH BROS. Ultimate.
Respect to the second speedrunner for calling the ender dragon "she"
wat was that scream at the begining? it was like aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaouuuuuaawaa
This is what minecraft has became
Glad to see you back man
on the first they were playing on hypixel smp D:
...☠
8:47 that speed run was so funny they should accept it by default
Ikr they are so obvious
“is that a flying potato?”
I actually thought it was really welfare before I knew it was you who made it even though It was silly there was good edenting!!!
Hi everybody
wait.. but the last speedrun was how you play it, it was real. i don't get it
Ayundaru is using the mute operator video as a background now
I do taekwondo I am a first degree black belt
This is hilarious
You are doing very good keep up
FINALLY YOU CAME BACK
I hope 1st speedrun was a joke
Yay your back! :D  Edit: all of this is funny
1st one even if they didn't cheat, it wouldn't count due to it being in hypixel 2nd one was completely illegitimate. 3rd one, was probably created by a expert animator, I respected that one
Yup 😂😂😂😂
That last one was awesome
They aren’t ‘terrible at cheating’, it’s obvious satire
The first one had to have been meant as a joke xD
5 hours
I love this video. Love watching these. Congrats!!. When the world needed him the most he returned.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro the start that guy ded
hello new video
2nd was on hypixel thats so funny
"Post scam Logan pall" gets me every time!
3:38 if you watch closelly then you will see a face
No kidding the moment you mentioned apples I got a redit notification for a post also mentioning apples
i really wanna see a full video on this 5:50
Potato
Vid link pls
xD
"Goofiest goober award" ☠☠☠
FINALLY a new Video ( I missed this format)

Very funny video 7:52 good background music choice!
HES BACK
I just started watching and I alr know I’m gonna lose my braincells by these kids
Did his voice get deeper?
I like this is the first day of Minecraft
5:50 what mod is that?
I wish I was them😊
A couple more blaze rods😂
who did you hire for that top tier muscle man impression
Yo he is showing his last vid
“This kids going places” I think his dad is going places
THE INTRO STOP
We waited...and waited.....but WE GOT ANITHER SPEEDRUN VIDEOO
the first one he magically got 6 level before everything
that intro was just so you could make that thumbnail
Toxic kid XD
6:23  bruh that's a video you uploaded titled the real way to speedrun mincraft
0:06 i thought that was nuke explosion XD
First screed run Is one fake
Not the smash bros😂 AND YAKUZA 0 💀
Let's gooooooo
LaSt oNe wAs lEgIt rEaL
FINALLY SPEEDRUNS ARE BACK
Nice❤
anyone wanna check out my speedruns? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mUBTLz-1hc
the last one cracked me up so much
1:56 this felt more like a moan
POTATO Is mine favorite phase🤣🤣🤣
I can’t wait to watch this
So someone will make speedrunning the fake speedrun?
welcome back dweeeeeb
THIS IS SO FUNNY GOOD JOB!
What was that wither boss fight
Juan_clean is the best banana player in minecraft. How could he spawn another one!?
the 1st one must be satire
*1st speedrun ends* Me:Well that was funni. *-D₹ÛΠK §T£√€-* Me:   {{System Message}}:@Harbin_07  °died of laughing so bad bru° 4:29 dude got adhd.                     1:17 that was a pinatá not a pig
I'll only subscribe if you make a channel just for fake speedruns
Bro the first one was funny  Like if you agree  👇  oh and here's a funny one too.     That boss was so ez- AAAAAAAAAH
You should make more of these vids
2:10 A 100% normal speedrun oh and that potato normally shows up his name is bob
Oh yeah the first one is legit
Remember the time you commented on my S3 video?
I have reason to believe the speed runs were made by him
I would absolutely play whatever game the last guy was
That last one was more impressive than any real world record
finally you uploaded one of these
It's so sad that this youtuber got to the point where he creates fake runs just for clout...
Yo can I play your version of minecraft?
cool vid!
Early 0:15
HES BACK HE WAS GONE or i think
These people have to be prankigng the speedrun moderaters.
Can you give the original audio for each one? Then do comments after the original audio is over?
Muscle man impressions are always for me
I think the custom wither is from BastiGHG. Cool Video!
fun fact: these "speedruns" are slower than legit ones 💀
When the 4th speed runner was inside that weird third person area (first one) He was actually in super smash Bros ultimate as Steve was added
I KNEW THE LAST SPEEDRUN WAS HELLA FAMILIAR
2:45  he could have just used crystals :/
Yours was real but it had increased ender pearl drops
hi
As a person who plays exclusively minecraft bedrock pvp, I can confirm that these are all legit.
This dudes sanity is on that low level
i swear i think i choked on air watching the first speedrun
For the second "speed runner" he also spawned with exp
Roses
Roses
Claim ur 3 hour ticket here
This the most ligit speed runs😂😂😂😂😂
I’m a veteran and I would say what you said exactly what you said and your so smart at finding secrets
HE LIKED NO WAY- faints
Ah yes the first one VERY LIGIT
Casually hires the mussel man voice actor
1 speedrunner: was cringe  2 speedrunner: was toxic and screamers  3 speedrunner: was using YOU’RE method to beat Minecraft
The last one is a perfect example of top tier trolling
As a pro speedruner i can say this is the best speedrun i have ever seen
Hey you know who else does fake speed runs
As a Minecraft player, all of them are legit.
HES BACK wait what 9 HOURS AGO? BUT THIS VID WAS ONE HOUR AGO. WHAT? WHAT?
bro finally got next video
267
Ayundaru who's Johnny?
3:25 KRIS GET THE BANANA
Bruh
The first thing that speedrunner was in was Smash Ultimate
6:10 no give this guy a real speed run he TRAVELED THE RELMS OF TIME AND SPACE give him so credit and live him alone
I laughed to death when the speedrunner sing the dream music LOL
oh ignore my other message
3:14 would you believe me if I said that I knew that it was going to be the banana?  I just knew it had to be the banana because the dying part is too obvious and also how is he going to die with that many totems of undying and the getting the record part would pretty much have been impossible because they have to kill the Ender Dragon first  I am not lying I actually thought it was going to be the banana and I was actually correct
also that was in your last video
I missed your funny videos, so glad your back :)
I’m pretty sure they have a good gaming chair not cheating. Like if you agree.  👇
*wow it’s so legit*
He really made fun of himself
Thumbnail: Sniffer block
I love these videos
6:13 This whole area was 100% legit, just the new crossover event.
thes people are bad at the game lol thes people I love your vidoes
Hello
It kinda make sense
you know it’s a good day when ayundaru uploads keep it up man ✊
😅😅hi 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Ahh, the dreaming speed run tactic my favorite!
5:50 What is that
Props to the last speedrun for creativity... I've never seen anything like it lol
😢😂😅
OMG i almost forgot this channel how have you and Jonny have been man?
The minecart one was legit I swear
I love the Mario kart music around 5:20😂
Good video 👍
the first one is either stupid, thinks the mods are stupid, or is like 3.
Be is back yesssss

I love this video. Love watching these. Congrats!!
Me when speedrun 🗿
Fun fact: one of the speedruns is a video called "how to beat minecraft the wrong way."
Want more
wasup
Goofy Goober Award 💀

i wished everyone that finds a totem would call it a "weird ogre thing" like in the other episode
The last one☠️
HES BACK THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND ❤🎉😎😎😎

Hi

The first speedrun is so funny and the way the speedrunner attempts to sing the speedrun music. Still a good video though.
He is back

You really like Mario Kart don't you? 😅
Do hanabi yaki 1:09

the intro is probably the most sane minecraft speedrun
Congratulations to Everybody who is Early and found this Comment💫
I love watching this kind of videos tbh
That dude was so good he couldn’t leave the house and got 19  totems
Hi
Oh wow, once again he entertains us amazingly! I honestly can't believe how incredible these were. Edit: It's just hilarious to see your own *real* speedrun in this.
I cant believe how many of these go on the minecraft speedrun website
