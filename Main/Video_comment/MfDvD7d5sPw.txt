Tom Nook waiting for Lauren to come back to her island: B*tch better have my bells.
Killed it!
14:12 Best costume

Love the Bratz doll one 😊💗✨
I LOVE YOU
Literally no point of putting a mask with the custome cause no one is actually going to wear it your outside anyways
Literally no one wore a mask during Halloween.

I did a group costume with some girls in my class one time and we were M&Ms. let’s just say they were jerks to me so it was pointless and now whenever I see someone dressed as an M&M I get flashbacks to that horrid day
happy halloween
What happened to rye RUFF!!! Censors?
U should have used the bag if bells as a trick or treat bag
0:47          somebody need to hear that
Who else is kinda living for brunette Lauren in the brats coustume
how could u talk about tom nook :((((
I definitely needed this.. I’m tired of repeating costumes every year
we also just did a Bratz Doll Inspired Halloween Costume its so perfect for a last minute Halloween Costume
Do a rue inspired costume
Every one : wow good  Lauren : oh B*TCH
Kk Lauren looks so effing good with brown hair tho!! Like damnnnn 😍
Lauren: AnDDdDddDdDdDDd contact, I didn’t do anything 😂
I have trauma from one episode of bratz where their skin was pilling of i......i.......i.......just cant thank u bye
can i jus take a moment of appreciation to lauren's bracelets. soo cute!!
Let’s just wait till Lauren finds out that Tom nook also wears a sweater during winter
I LOVED THE EUPHORIA COSTUME
Love that the hair colour didn't matter after all that since you couldn't see it because of the coloured lights
Lauren: Tom Nook doesn’t wear shoes because he’s a tanuki Also Tom Nook: wears clothes Me : ummm
I LOVE how Lauren is reminding us to VOTE by wearing a bracelet that says vote.  I see you sis <3
I love Halloween
Laurdiy I think ur the bear from The Masked Singer. Are u the bear???
can we be clear there is no actual purpose of a mask besides propaganda?
Thank you for bleeping out the curse words
Lauren you are soooo pretty
Where did you find the bratz logo transfer?
Hiiiiii
13:03
Lauren can you please do Medusa in the next episode please
omg the makup w the bratz look- BOMBB
I love you Laur. Please answer. 💙
I like how Lauren’s content just kinda grew up with all of us. Like she’s one of the only YouTubers who I’ve followed for so long, almost 4 years I bet. Maybe longer.
Furries have taken over animal crossing          Sorry I am one of them UwU 🖤🐺🖤
Animal crossing!
it’s the lana mask
he ISNT A RACOON    he is a tanooki
Who else got the YouTube premium ad with Lauren in it, before this video?
Petition for Lauren to do an M&M costume
Hmmm....... I thought she was Colleen Ballinger in ESCAPE THE NIGHT WITH JOEY GRACEFFA!!!
I was able to access my locked snapchat through the help of *fixedtools ón IG* he's the best
you sound a little sad and less happy you ok 🥺
I almost quit to and it’s because I followed so many insta accounts
Try and do a deer or a fawn
You could put a white mask under the mesh one😁
how she go from m&m to bratz doll lol
Please take this before God in prayer.  Halloween is devil's day and everyone who celebrates it, serves devil and worships him.  Please repent of this.  Jesus Christ said that no one can serve two masters.  Please check your heart and repent before God in serving devil.  If you serve devil, you will spend an eternity with him.  If you serve God, you will spend an eternity with Him.  God bless you
You are such a good painter!!!! Those leaves on Tom Nook's shirts are bomb!!!!!!!
You could have used the bell bag as a candy bag
I would love another video that has animal crossing in it  Maybe a gaming video with Lauren  Idk I’m just an AC fan girl

I LOVE THE VOTE BRACELET BABE!!!! Let's do it, f trump!!
Where was the scary costume?
I'm really enjoying this #LaurenAfterDark
where did u get the bratz logo doll i have been trying to look for that exact logo for so long and i can’t find it
I thought that Lauren bought that Tom Nook shirt!!!
EUPHORIA COSTUME ALL THE WAY SIS!!!! IT IS  SUCH A VIBE!!!!!!
lauren: make sure there's some stretch to it me: oh so like i could just wear it and iron it on that way my brain:  me:  my brain: me: riiiiiight
You put the mesh mask on top of a normal mask

Oh my gosh! Congrats Lauren for being #43 on trending!!!💗💗💗
In the uk Halloween is just nothing it is cancelled which is sad 😢
The Jules costume make up?! You killed it ❤️🔥
Hot glue white fabric in the mask
I lowkey think you should have kept your blonde hair for the bratz costume and had a full Chloe moment
girl you said discord and i got so excited hahaha - i swear i love discord
For the Tom Nook tail you could hot glue a brown pon pon to the shorts
I checked you out. Now check me out. Wanna be friends
Moose barks a lot in this video😂😂😂
Lauren, I’m gonna need a diy among us costume stat! 🥶
Grandma Cocoa likes ur outfit
OMG OMG DO AMONG US IT WOULD BE AWESOME
The only creator who cares about wearing a mask-
Was I the only one confused when she cursed and u could hear it? Lol, like no bark???
In Korea
Love the dimples, you know I have 7 korean stepkids
I am OBSESSED with the Jules costume! It's soooo goooood.
Where can I get a colorful furry jacket like that???
My favourite was the euphoria costume! I love how she used different coloured lighting to film it!
Can you do some stuff from the shadow and bone series? Please!

My newest song is finally here, let me know what you think https://youtu.be/98VvFI-XZbc
When Lauren said I don’t like tails because it reminds me of furrys I had like war flash backs to my Halloween animals phase
Can someone please tell me what song she used for bratz section ... googling the lyrics isnt helping me sadly
It would be so cute if you made the bag of bells into a real bag and use it for your candy!
Trump is the last man standing in the way of the satan worshipping cabal harvesting adrenochrome on a global scale from kidnapped tortured murdered children.
I thought you were excited they were mesh I was abt to sayyy LMAOOO then I continued watching :)
When she said an m&m I was like we are twins

Bratz one is the best ! 💕✨

Among us next 🤔
I love these videos but I'm a bit of a bigger girl and don't feel comfortable wearing crop tops or super tight dresses. Do you have any ideas for more size inclusive costumes? Or even just for people who are self conscious but still want to get a look similar to yours?
Why is this even trending? I don't remember anyone asking for this video.
13 on trending!
THE BRATZ COSTUME IS MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
where can u watch euphoria
This brings back memories
https://youtu.be/RGgkkBYHZCo
Bro did u lose subscribers lol?!?!
still waiting for you to come up with "And.........CONTACT" merch
#Hallaurween
Como tienen tanto suscriptores mucho blabla y nunca va al punto 🤷‍♀️
I don't like the video :(👎👏👀
the beanie & crop top combo is iconic... LA weather is confusing
I just used the same color chalk on my actual hair and it didn’t fully wash out... I’m sure it will eventually fade though...
this is the best series
You can't carve a pumpkin✌🏽❤✨
Lol your ideas are fantastic I did a video also with Among Us costume, canceled culture costume, Karen costume, etc haha I like your ideas too. I don’t know how I didn’t think of those ! Good video .D
LaurGaming
0:37 way to be subtle
Did anybody see the transition from blonde hair to brown hair I love it but just asking??
I’m a dude and don’t know wut to b for Halloween any ez painless cool costume recommendations y’all have thx u🙈🔥
OMG my daughter has that pillow in the back is so soft
Ok but like if your going trick or treating yo could make the bells your candy bag 😏
Is it just me or have if the bag of bells be your candy basket that you truck or treat with would be SO CUTE
Psalm 34:19  Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
lauren looks like that one character in the boo madea movie, the grandma!?!? Lololol during the bratz part
It's a mask cover. You wear it over another mask.
Ok so if anyone is looking for a tennis skirt I found one at spirit Halloween and it’s great quality
Those bejeweled masks are what all of my coworkers wear and its mildly upsetting
I LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEEE
She is absolutely stunning..
This is how many people think Lauren should go brunette again. ;-P
Can you do clue characters?? For hallauroween!
Llllllllllllllllooooooooooovvvvvvvveeeeeeeee  The bratz costume 💕💕💕💕💕💕
It’s the most wonderful time of the year 🎃
We couldn't even see what the final Jules hair looked like with that lighting lol
What I can't believe is that she doesn't have a cricket yet for doing all the words and things lol
Didn’t know I wanted to dress up as Tom nook until now. But I’d make the bell bag my trick or treat bag
HEEEEEY! If anyone here supports the LGBTQ+ community you should come checkout our videos, we won’t disappoint!😁🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Little kids watch this channel yet she swears every 4 minutes
She is so Beautiful and so sweet everytime I watch her videos I always smile go girl!!!

Im doing a Bratz Doll even before seeing this vid! Great minds think a like

I WAS WATCHING 2013-2016 HALLOWEEN VIDEOS YESTERDAY!! YASSS thanks queen!! 💜✨
Lauren: Euphoria Me: Jungkook?!!!!
Lol I had a green m&m costume back in the day.
I like how she isn't afraid of showing herself anymore! She is getting more and more comfortable and confident now!!
OMG moose didn't talk as much!!😱Btw who else loves that this isn't a kids channel any more?!?😂
Those nails tho 👍👍👍
😈💜💜💜💜💜💜
She could wear the mesh mask over a really mask
I wish that I hadn’t bought a costume already
YouTube notification be like heres a new video pysch it came out 7 hours ago... smh
I love it all ! you're my fave!
I have been waiting! Yassss :) ❤️❤️❤️
okay since winter is almost here, i would love to see lauren chochet a blanket or just try crocheting
Omg you should do a Harry Potter/wizarding world inspired Halloween costumes/diy’s
Ahhh the Tom Nook costume is soooo cute!!!!
My favorite videos of the year from Lauren
I have really been enjoying watching your videos through all this
Wow! Look at name finally getting to a video on time!
me wishing she made the bag of bells into a bag for candy
#HALLAURWEEN 2020 🎃
is it just me or does lauren’s face so much darker then her body...
Any recs for a post breakup Halloween costume?
You should do among diy costume ideas
Love this video, love Lauren, BUT does anyone else think the top of her beanie looks like the tip of a.....you know 👀😂
Laurens backpack: *Jules* Laurens necklace: *Lauren*  Which is it??? Lmao
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg love these costumes hope everyone has a good holiday and spooky season this sucks we in this together #halloween #spooky season #quarantine life 🧡💜🖤
OMG I ASKED FOR A BRATZ COSTUME!!!
Love your costumes
Lauren’s hat...😶
i thinks rlly cool video would be creating harry potter characters in your style
Bratz
Absolutely incredible
OMG Lauren! You need to go brunette!
Hey girl if u have seen Hamilton can you do a Peggy costumer
I thought she was a death note fannnn because I saw the necklace and my weeb self thought it was an L necklace but then I was like wait...
But I still love her videos! She is amazing
I used to watch her videos a lot! But now my parents do let me watch her as much because she swears a lot more and has changed her feel🙁
What's better... Like: Among Us Comment: Animal Crossing
laurdiy with straight hair an a beanie totally gives me her 2016 vibes and im loving it
My brain: omg decorate a yellow pillow case as the “bag of gold” to collect your candy in 🤩
Yesss! This is too stinky cuteeee!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
for animal crossing you shouldve taken inspiration from others and decorate your island :)
these costumes are so cute! I am so looking forward to next week's batch of costume diy ideas!
Some nude biker shorts would’ve also looked real bomb with the Tom nook costume
Me literally going in a cow onesie and a pink cowboy hat 4 Halloween thinking: Wooooooooooooow!
Lauren's beanie don't look right👀😂
LAUREN!!! PLS ISLAND TOUR PLEASE!!
Friendly reminder to buy directly from sellers instead of shopping on Amazon! Jeff Bezos has increased his excessive wealth while Amazon employees have been exploited during this global pandemic!
omg I love halaurween every year! the tom nook costume is so cute!! 🥺🍃💕
Jermey was going to break up with her just for that?! Wow I would be like “Bye did bye” PeRiOd SiS
Please do a cheerleader
Where a plain mask under the rhinestones
Pandemic means it’s global. No need to say both 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
I think i saw a popcast link like half an hour back with the try wives... Where did it go??
Who else thinks she should also make merch with a picture of herself and alittle moose over her mouth (and I’m talking about his dog moose) bc everytime she swears there’s alittle moose and him barking
Tom Nook waiting for Lauren to come back to her island: B*tch better have my bells.
The euphoria look is 😍🔥
Lauren, girl you can find cheap skirts on Shein aka tennis skirts lmaooo
i think she tied the shirt so she wouldn’t  have to paint all of it hahaha love that
cute among us costume 👀
Why is everyone obsessed with Animal Crossing? I get it lol, don't come after me. I'm cool with it, I just wanna know why lol.
can you do a among us costume?
In the animal crossing costume you could make a bigger money bag, don’t close it and put your candy in it
the mesh masks are mask covers. they are meant to go over your mask
Omg the reveal of the Bratz look with the dark hair and maybe the make up style too(?) gave me major baby LaurDIY vibes... lmaoo
OMG during quarantine my girlfriend was “selling” things through Nookazon and she showed me message from Laur asking for the rattan collection and my girlfriend was only showing it to me so I would see that someone was interested in some of her items and when I saw “laurDIY” I yelled at her “LAUREN? /THE/ LAURDIY?” and she was so confused. And then you visited her island and I almost fainted lmfaoooo
My favourite was Jules in Euphoria
love how lauren goes "aww" cus when my boyfriend told me about the animal used to reference tom nook and the nooklings, they said it was the animal with huge balls.
please do an among us costume
The Lauren necklace in the jules costume is 1000% my fav part lol
you really went back in time with the bratz costume
Lauren reminded me of early youtube Lauren in the bratz costume, i think its the brown hair
You came out in that brown wig and I was like who the fuck!? When am I?
I love how u go as Jules but still have ur luraen necklace on
My sister loves your channel and today is her birthday so she was really excited to watch your video that was released today.
Just post your dream address from animal crossing :)
Yessssss it’s finally #halaurween
More house flips?
I don’t know any real people who talk about Euphoria, the only people who hype up that show are youtubers and I can’t trust a review from Internet personalities.
Lauren’s podcast isn’t a “little scandy” it is literally downright FILTHY!!! I be like 😂😵🤪😳🤣 And I love it!!!!!
it is 35° in iowa so just LOOKING at her wearing a tank top is making me so cold
how do you get these ideas omg! so creative
Amazing
I love the Bratz costumes 😍😍😍😍😍😍
for tom nooks shoes you should wear ugg slippers
early :oo
Who else thinks Lauren should dye her hair dark brown✋
Love😚
❤️❤️❤️
I was about to get so mad with her wearing a mesh mask but she did so good. We love a responsible queen
My costume this year will be a regular shirt with a sign: 2020 And a mask. This Year is scary enough
i literally look foreword to these videos every year
for the first one i would look for a khaki tennis skirt and then tie or crop the button up shirt
For the mesh mask wear a black or white or pink one under it would look so cool
The julius outfit couldn't see the pink hair as it was too dark or the name or colour of the backpack, the brates was my favourite out of the three as they were the only one I new sorry.  Look forward to seeing more next week. Halloween in the uk is cancelled 😞  😃😍💖🎀👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👋👋👋👋
I LOVE THEM!
finally i have been waiting
YOU SHOULD DO A FEMALE JOKER
I just watched ashley's (bestdressed) animal crossing tour and she said the same thing about comparing hers to insta haha I've never played but I felt the same when I used to play the sims. 😁  Ps I was a green m&m when I was maybe 6. One of my fvorite photos of myself to this date. 💕
Love you sooo much Lauren 💖🌈🦋🦝🦋🏵💮
TOM NOOK ONE OMG
her bracelets are so strategic and i freaking love it!!! so smart!!!
I wish she would of done some scary looks

🎃🎃🎃🎃👻👻👻👻👻
You really reminded me of Nicki Bella in the bratz doll costume
Love the bracelets, girl! #VOTE!
Lauren: andddd one more DIY....a bag of bells!!      People who have never played animal crossing: ......say what?
hii my birthday is in 2 days which oct 20 it would make my year if you said happy birthday!
Awesome video 🥰 🥰.
I was a bratz doll one year for Halloween. Love these ideas. I want to dress up this year
The tapestry you had behind you for your Euphoria costume is the same tapestry that I have in my room!!!
Hi Lauren! I just want to say I'm so excited for this year's hallaurween series 🎃 I love your videos and they literally make my days so much better! ❤️ Thank you so much for the amazing content you put out! 🥰
“Lauren” necklace on Jules 😂❤️
You literally come up with the best ideas
Throwback to when Lauren had brunette hair  Throwback to when Lauren had pink ends
I look forward to this every year ❤️❤️
omg you should do costumes for Jeremy
Which song do you like the most from blackpink(the album)????
Was playing animal crossing during lockdown but I got to the point where I was really frustrated with my island so I stopped playing
I love how Lauren is growing up with her fans and she is inspiring 8.87 million fans and making videos for them on 3 different channels
YUSSSS HALLAURWEEN IS BACK
SHE DIDNT BARK OUT THE WORD SHIT 😱😱 highkey proud
3:00 so idk if it's there on purpose but USA DIY babes please read lauren's top bracelet and remember to do what it says!!!!!!!!!!!!
Could you try to do an among us costume next week? I'd love to see that!
Do Among Us ones
#prettylittlelaurs❤️
stay safe and be kind everyone❤️
You should play among us it's so much better than animal crossing
My friend and I had a break up and we always did couple Halloween costumes, I didn’t know what to do but I woke up this morning and saw the notification thank you so much😭💖
I want merch that says "what the" then the moose face you put over your mouth when you cussed. Maybe just the moose face too. Because it's like an inside joke, because it represents the growth, but also just looks like a cute puppy.
seriously, where is the "aaaannnndddd contact" merch?
Clicked fast....
A brown hair Lauren is whole new vibeeee💗💗
oop yes
Omg I love the animal crossing one and the mask is key, stay safe :)
SHOULDA DONE AMONG US COUSTUME
Since when did she swear lol
Love the video keep up the great work and videos
Omg this inspired me to make my costume animal crossing themed now
I wish I had a drop of the creativity you hold. So talented, I loved the video!! 💛
I love you Lauren
So excited for HALLAURWEEN! These costumes look crazy good 😍
