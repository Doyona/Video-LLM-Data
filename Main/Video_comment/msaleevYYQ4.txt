As soon the kid sold the toy I new it was the white lady. She said that he didn't care about that toy and clearly he didn't.
Bro I was dying when number 1 was telling he’s story then saying hamza AHAHAHAH
Number 2 of course
number 5 and ziggy share the habit of puttin their hands in their pockets
i kneww it 😛😛
9:44 was gonna say it's so cute how Niko was keeping Ziggy entertained playing rock paper scissors but I honestly think it was to entertain himself and him losing just sent me 😭😭
‏‪24:00‬‏ I know that boy is mixed 😊❤
Not Ziggy actually giving y’all a hint nodding his head and y’all ignored that ? Omg 😭😭😂😂😂 9:19
10:53 HOW TF IS HE BORN IN 2014 WHEN HES 8
23:45 the guy kills me😂😂😂😂💔the way he stepped forward
2:00 what is he even doing there 😂😭
21:00  i know its the man
Bro ehy they voted out the mum its because ziggy is nlack and the mum is white😅
It’s number 4
I actually thought she was the mom when she spoke of the toy but you guys bringing up the Za convinced me, basterds you fooled me
Te dad
13:39 Aj😭😭 24:14 why is aj always under the table😭
I think its number 2
3:10  I feel like it’s the last girl😭 it’s just a guess
Sharky asked me to say who I thought it was and I think it’s the woman in the white shirt and glasses
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN! coz the lady told us he isn't attached to the toy! And the kid went off and SOLD the darn thing! 😂😂😂😂
4
Number 4
This reminds me of the KL show
Watching at 21 minutes it's easily number 5 cause she said hamza doesn't like the toy and hamza sold it to Niko and zay is a short for ziggy
Am i the only one that thinks ( fee ) has a slight resemblance to lauren german ( detective chloe decker from lucifer )
11:02
5:26 i felt so bad for him in this part bless he got made fun of because of what he looks like
4 is the dad I could tell Immediately
bro i love this content!
7:12 🦭🦭
Noo hamza🥀🥀
“what’s the dads name?” “david”  lock it offffffff that’s a lightskin baby
IM CRYINGGGGBSUSJE HAMZA
Wow
Literally knew after answer two that she was the mom. He literally nodded after her funny story
When i heard him say hamza i was like thats my name
Big UP the NDL!!!
number 3 is the father duhh
i knew it when the kid sold the toy and the mom said it
Bro the mom was wow , I couldn't have guessed it, they're crazy actors those final two I was convinced it was them 😂😅😅
Funny enough I knew from the beginning that was her mom❤
Niko went on traitors!!
Fyi, swans aren't vicious. They may bite but it's not that bad by the way.
She was my guess when she said it wasn’t his fav toy and that it was his teddy bear
I know it from the beginning cs they have the same accent
Yo Einstein geused my name
5😊
He is 8
Hu it’s 2016
I knew the second the toke out number 5
4:13 MY NAME IS HAMZA
The girll
ITS AINSTEIN THE MOM JUDT STOLE HIS SKIN
No 4
These guys are so stupid. She calling him Zay was all the proof they needed. And she was flowing
24:17 am looks like an acorn
Okay so at first because of looks and I hadn’t heard #5s story I thought 2 or 4 but as soon as she started speaking I guessed it was either her or 4 and then I was second guessing myself but I always thought she was one of the best choices but great job man
18:31 I looked at Ziggy he looked so fed up
Wait hold on what one of them has a kid
Wallahi the second he sold the toy I knew they voted out the wrong person
I have four kids and when she talked about the toy i knew it was her. Kids today dont have a favourite toy they have to many toys. Plus what they play with today can be forgotten tomorrow but having a teddy in the bed is speciel. Teddybrown (bamsebrun in Danish) is my sons need to have "toy". Good day to ya.
9:44 NIKO and ziggy playing rock paper scciors and niko losing got me on the floor
8000 commets
I’m convinced it’s #… I forgot….. the last girl to stay standing
Mum whi5e shirt
humza had me dying wallahu
Ziggi is 10 now. Hello 2025
I thought was number 2!!!!
6:09
Dad 4
My name is also Ezekiel
I KNEW IT, FROM TYE DAMN NAME
4
4:07
wait who is having a kid
I LITERALLY KNEW IT WAS 5 SOMEHOW
Definitely number two❤😂🎉
If an Indian kid had played this game, chances are their parents would have been knocked out in the very first round 😅
I knew it pretty much from the start and especially when the two ones left read their letters, it didn't bring up any emotion in Ziggy. Then I knew his mom truly had been voted out😁
I knew it the whole time it was her
21:06 it’s the woman number two
Brooo
4:02 6:33
The mum
I think it’s da dad
2 is the mum
I thinks forst
We have o be honest they eliminated the mom because she is white and siggy is black we just have to be real😅
The little boys sooo adorable
It was definitely number 5. But now its number 2
I think it’s number 5
Commenting at 21:03, it is the last man standing   Message mentioned his name and was directed to him... He was the first to say the name Ezekiel... Has to be him
i actually knew it, she was the closest
HAMZAA HAHAHAHAHAHA
4
Clocked at the intros. When Ziggy introduces himself the way he speaks is very like his mum. The toy and him selling it solidified it.
I think its 2
I knew the entire time she was his mom, because right from the beginning, every time number 1 and 4 tells their stories about "their son" they always used pronouns, she always addressed her baby by his name. When she said "Ray" though I wasn't fased, I just thought that's one of her children's names. Also when she said his friends are going to watch this video and didn't want them fighting over which one's the best friend. Another thing I could tell was that when they said she's not the mom, I could tell she was hurt by that, I felt she took that feeling seriously, and I assumed it's because as a white mom to a black child, when they are in public people assume she's not his mom.   I just kept saying the whole time, that's her baby, from the hospital story to giving him a biblical name Ezekiel, and her husband's name is also biblical David.  Number 2 was good though, I thought she has a baby somewhere, I just knew the baby wasn't in the same room as her.
the best video
5:52 is it chunks BC he is married
Lets meet the child that sounds crazzy
I KNEW IT AHAGAYAA
Niko give me your shades
His mom seemed legit the whole time lol. Especially the answer to the best friends question 🤷🏾‍♂️
Why is the mother look familiar
21 minutes in, 4 is the dad. he doesnt talk too much, but he makes up for it when he does. to me, thats what a dad would do
Ziggy got all twitchy legged when she was talking about his friendships and about the football incident. He physically reacted to both of her stories.
number 4
1. The real parent gave a whole backstory to the name, which means its either trrue or she is just a really really good pretender who thinks about every step, the moment she started going on about the story and not even flinching I knew it was her, a little bit of doubt if maybe she had really thought it through.  2. While the favourite toy was being explained, all the parents tried connecting things, “I told you right? Transformers, this is what it is” trying to describe him as this sweet child who is just all in love with something, but not everything has to be connected, they were all trying to PROVE they are the parents by justifying stuff, the real mother, she was actually just telling you how he is. How he isnt the type to get so attached to things, which actually matches the context, because ziggy himself didnt really seem like the jind to get all googly upon seeing something like his favourite toy.  3. When the names of the best friends were asked, she pointed out that the kids will watch and heartbreak might occur, which is SUCH A SPOILER. I mean, who would think of this whn they are pretending to be a parent?  4. The last two parents were honestly really sketchy, the mam kept trying to PROVE she was it and sir was using a little bit of that GenZ slang but then at the same time calling himself old in that rhyme, so the picture of the father doesnt really sit right, plus he talked about his likes and dislikes when a father who is trying to prove he is a father wouldnt care if they like marvel or dc more, if their child likes marvel, they will TOO watch marvel, if it pleases the child, so not knowing about marvel, thats sketchy.
As a person that is named HAMZA, why did my uncle Einstein mentioned my name, then again i feel honoured 😎
I think it's #4 based on him smiling when #3 was telling his story.
Bro he is 8 and they say he is born 2014,2025 😂
I KNEW IT
I think it’s the woman
Guys who is having a baby
4
I instantly left the vid 24:19
It’s four
I knew she was the mom when she opened her mouth and he nodded along
i thnk its the womN
Soo far its funniest beta squad video ngl
😂😂😂Hamza
Wow impressive
I think its number 3
20:58 I think it number 5
Ziggy did an amazing job of not giving it away, But I knew IMMEDIATELY the White woman was his mother. The child is obviously biracial. But more importantly they had the same energy and spoke like they came from the same household. She was very calm and seemed very parental. And as a side note, mom was incredibly comfortable in a room full of Black folks.😂😂😂  The Black lady did not have a mother vibe. Plus she was doing the most which made me seriously doubt her. The young Black guy didn't match the child. It would be very unusual that 16 year old parents would have a child who is this well adjusted only 8 years later. Also parents that young would have been likely split up by now. Ziggy is giving 2 parent household.  The older White guy seemed too old even for adoption plus he didn't know Ziggy's name. The other Black guy was the right age and had a strong father vibe but it didn't seem like THAT was his kid. Boys Ziggy's age usually still sound like their mothers (since their voices haven't changed) but they begin picking up phrasing or mannerisms.. or something from their dad if he's present in the home. I didn't see or hear anything in Ziggy matching that man.  Great show everyone! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
6:34 it was at this moment, he knew he had effed up
This was so easy
I thought 5
I knew she was the mother the whole time. It was really obvious when she said Zay. I was like, Oh, she said her second child's name.or something 🤣😜😘
0:36 perfect🤔🤔
😂😂❤
24:16 lol the way AJ is hiding😂
She said his favorite toy is sentimental to her then kid sell it without hesitation 😂
He was looking at his child reading the poem
I knew it was her from the jump. It was the way she just looked like this was her baby, she loved him. Her eyes were self assured because he was hers.
I like this.. but, but, it is making these people lie outright 😂😂
10:46 when the parents said his birthday year most of them said 2014 but when Ziggy came in first he said he was 8 so that means they were lying about him being born in 2014 kids are 10 like me but in the start he said he was 8 but the first parent said 2015 so in 2015 you are 9 so all of them were lying he was actually born in 2016😂
Oj low key lookin like tyler the creator
Ziggy was pretty good, no give aways.
I thought it was the usher look alike! But now i see it
9:28 GOOD BOOOY
Kind of mean spirited😬
His mom is the white lady
Have they ever seen a Jamaican cockroach🪳 They are big and they fly.
I said she was the mom from the very start
I knew that number 5 was the real parent from the start, cause she said everything like so fluently and it just felt so real for me!!
The number 5 lady has a son Ziggy's age for sure but number 4 is the father
The making ups stories is crazy 😂😂😂😂 the durack guys 😂😂😂
ngl I think its the mom
Hamza
4 😀
Posted at 21:04 I think it's number 2.
The last girl is so giving enchanted story vibes. Example if Bell from beauty and the beast was a mom
Its 4
Anyone here in 2029? 👇🏼
My gut instinct from the start of the show was the lady in the white sweater. Now it's down to her and t he guy in the leather jacket, who I started to think was the real dad. But I'm sticking with my gut. Pressing play again now to find out!
I thought that Albert Einstein
I knew it was number 5
I think it’s 5
I got it right.
I always get right I knew she was the parent 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
dami un grrr un ge
24:20 “I forget that people are human.” HAHAHAHAHA

Nah raaa man guess what in my school there is guy called toby and rueben and they told me I know ziggy

I’m not trying to be offensive or anything but in our language ziggy means poop
that was actually unexpected!! so fun!!
i think the man is the parent. 21:04
Ziggy in Arabic is poop
Omg it was so obvious. She spoke like she didn't even hestitate and it felt like real love when she spoke about the chocolate cake🥰
I think it’s the guy that’s the parent at 21:29
22:44 bro they destroyed his favourite toy💔🥲
24:02 The way he just melted in her mom's arms😢❤❤❤
Can’t be a beta squad vid without an abnormally older person😂😂
I knew it, it was between 4 and 5 for me all the while.
Just me this is very similar to Kevin’s show with Denny herm Arron and a special guest or just me?
My guess before reveal: I think it’s the woman
21:06  no. 4
Niko is such a vibe 🥰😊
no child? okay cold
Number 1’s reaction when he realized that he called Ziggy hamza got me on the floor dying and then number 1 tried to keep going with the story but couldn’t stop laughing.
I love how hamza is my older brothers name
24:11 damn

I find Chunks to be a bit uptight sometimes and won’t let the jokes flow. ☹️
am thinking its mother in the white sweater,last round
2:54 Bro is that thierry henry? 😂
i knew it was her because ziggy looked so embarrassed everytime she said something about him lol
No way aj shabel has a child
lol❤❤
Fun fact Niko is the father
the fact they didnt realize when number for said he was 37 and had ziggy when he was 28 while ziggy said he was 8

At the end of the vid AJ went to his normal hight

There Comming Backkk ❤😊
I bet the baby is Nico’s because during the box he was taking care of that baby like he was his mom

The answer about his friends made me sureeee it was her lol! Can’t believe I finally guessed one right
Where is the next vid😢

The women
11:57
Hamza is the name of my brother 😂😂😂
100% einstein
I CALLED IT FROM THE START nah me and my brother was watching this and we both picked someone from the start and I picked 5 and he picked 2
13:54 the hand under the table 😭🙏
4
Omg, 4 was good, tho, but I did think the real parent was the mum when she said he's not attached to toys.
Hamza?😂😂
SPOILER if you have not finished video             You could tell she was the mom because when they had to tell funny stories about zigy she said the cake one and how he ate it all or whatever and you can see him he shook his head like a large amount 9:15
mig mm utmt umtmt 😢m e❤❤
My name is hamza
I knew it was her kid
I KNEW IT WAS HER 😭😭😭 BRO YALL COOKED
I think you could just tell based off how both of them were dressed
If someone is smiling why point it out
The one in the middle is obvious lol
If u use ur ears then ur gonna hear the same guy who got to the end say he had him at 28 while being 37. Ziggy said he was 8
After mom eliminated his face went down poor boy😂🩷
21:27 ziggy is the man's son for sure 😢
I think four
Number 4
…..
😂😂
U get back got me
I knew it the moment it hit minute 13:51 he has exactly his mom’s face!
How did they not get that she was the mommm 😢 the guy beside the lady to the right literally said ziggy was his first child and then that there was a child before him.
Number 5!
She knew the real meaning behind his name. That's either a remarkable coincidence or she's the mother.
Number 4
This don’t work in all instances. My dad was a drug dealer jail bird. That not my style. That didn’t pass on to me
Hi, used to love DC and marble
you know what else is massive ??
WHEN I SAW HIM SELL THE TOY SO EASILY i was like NO IT HAD TO BE UER
can't help of lawrence's lies 😆
I thought it was 5 when he said Ezekiel Matthew 😂
Yeah no, u guys are straight up 🐂 ies
It’s giving Albert instine
I also guessed it was 5 because I thought they looked the most alike. Same nose!!
yoo number 1 is kinda....🥴🥴👀👄
The fact that I watched all 25 minutes of this... even though I thought it was a COMPLETELY different type of video... Applause for making engaging content. I misunderstood this as a video of trying to figure out which adult was the parent and which adult was the child?
Is know.... Zay could of been Ziggy's brother, WAIT.... IS THAT WHY ZIGGY'S NICKNAME STARTS WITH A "Z"?
Go with the guy on last almost about the swans
Love this amazing
I KNEW IT FROM THE BEGINNING ❤❤❤
YOO ITS ZIGGYS BIRTHDAY 🎂
I knew it was five.... No ones listens to AJ 😂😂😂
I Think its number one ! 21:20
mom is not the one
NUMBER 4 DEFINETLYYYY
Wallah I knew it!
the 5th one for sure
HAMZA😭
2
Einstein was tolling 😂
It was super obvious since the beginning that ziggy is  part white 😂
I knew it was either Einstein or 5 because he looks mixed
Hamza is crazy 😭🙏
The way he went : imagine if he said you voted out my dad in round one 😂 got me rolling down the stairs
i had a gut feeling that she was ziggy's mom she was most believable in my 12 year old brain
She was obviously the mom!!! I wondered if 3 really lost his son :( I’m sorry 😞 if so 🫶🏼
Number 5
2
I knew it
IM NOT EVEN KIDDINGMY BDAY IS ON THE 8TH JAN 2015
the person  who is having a baby is  chunks      sorry if i spelled his name wrong
When he sold his toy I knew it was her
number 5
its the way niko actually looked like ziggy's dad
i knew it was number 5 the second i saw her. the boy looks mixed.
Just the way she spoke about him convinced me
Ziggy is one of the most calmest and adorable child I've ever seen
I feel so bad for Einstein :(
I had it right
Spoiler blocker
Niko tryna be Jamie from top boy so bad 🤣
Tell me how are new but the fact that the mom said  he wasn’t attached to the toy then sold for 10 pounds after just  u know she’s the mom lol 😂🎉😢
i need 1 so bad, my daddy fs fs
I think its 5 or 4
number 2 . This is actually hard Sharky  questioned  if we could  comment before they revil the paren this is so hard . Have a good day Hamza.😅
I already knew it was five because ziggy was looking at her every single time she spoke
i think it’s five
I love how they called her out for saying different names after she literally said she has 3 other kids so she probably got them mixed up
Its 4  Edit it was 4
23:44 That got me 😂🙏
⚠️ SPOILER ⚠️       Ngl I think is number 3 the way he said Ezekie- I mean Ziggy  like saying his real name gave it away (before reveal)    (Edit) Erm- so..I WAS EXTREMELY WRONG..but I kinda love the mother son duo..?🥺
2:42 bhupendra jogi 😂😅😊
NUMBER 4
Don’t feed ducks bread please! Their favorite food is peas 🫛
The woman i tjink
Its 3 I think
I got it right, that name thing is definitely a thing 😂😂😂😂😂
Mathew
Number  2 sounds like a jamaican
I knew it was number 5 because she messed up the name. My mom has 4 boys and calls me all their names before getting to mine lmao
you guys are the sweetest. apologising nonstop for getting mom wrong.
Y’all were actually being really rude to the grey haired guy :( he was literally talking about how his son passed away and y’all kept cutting him off. So rude
4:11 “his name is hamza” how does it go to Ezekiel to Hamza 💀😭
i think its 2
😮👏🏽well that was unexpected
I was like so sure who his real mum was
😂😂They should trick the squad by bringing both parents 😂😂
I knew it was the woman, the boy kept his head down as not to give it away but when he did look up several times, I saw that he looked like his mum. The boy basically looks like his mum.
Number 4 was my guess. I thought  his mom was just a veryyyyyyy gooooood I mean extremely good actress 😂😂😂
lmaoo, that thumbnail!
Sharky is so cute lol
The hamza got me dying 🤣
I knew it wasn't number 5 cuz The kid kept on nodding.His head like use your common sense😂
Ngl I thought it was 4
I Knet The second she spoke she was The Mum that Episode was stupid
I rewatched the video and still thought it was number 2 was shocked 😂
Knew it
Ziggy 😊😊😊😊
4
I knew it was her this whole time
i knew it was her
I KNEW IT FROM THE START IT WAS NUMBER #5
4
i haven't seen the end. js sharky said to say who I thought it was. i think its the guy in the end two.  edit: WHAT THE FLIP
28th of August 2014  is my birthday
Whatttttttt my birthday is January 8th 2014 lol
Whattttttt
Niko x Ziggy???
Enstine 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think its the mom
But it was not and the mother got it wrong if he was born in 2014 he would be 9 in 2023
I know it was sus because in 2023 you would be 8 if your were born in 2015
my 24 yr old uncle is named Hamzah 🤩🤩😍😝🤑
Bro it isn’t zingy it’s hamza
24:10 AJ’s true height
8th january??? thats my birthday :))
You saw Niko performance the parent is definitely Niko
His name is hamza got me dying😂😂😂😂
wow
The fact Niko is the only person that genuinely looks like Ziggy 😭😭😭😭
2:47 I can not stop laughing 😂
I think it is number 4 aka hamza's dad - serena
I knew it was her I totally knew it I swear, almost from the beginning I knew
I think when she slipped up and said zay she probs said that cos she said she had 4 children and zay might be one of there names and ziggy and zay sound similar and parents mix up names a lot so yahhhh
To me, none of them seemed like parents even lol this one was tough, but not because more than one person seemed to be the parent hah
The Hamza joke throughout the video is just legendary
I noticed when she told the story about Ziggie going off during football his body language went really ashamed. That was the only time he reacted to any of the stories. But gotta be honest apart from that I didn't think it was her
Are they having a child
This is the moment of truth 9:15
Is no one gonna talk about how they said someone of the beta squad is having a kid
January 8th is my birthday broski
I think it's 4
@5:27wtf is wrong with AJ.🤣
I knew it was her from the first round, she described him as exactly how he seems to be. She kept describing his personality instead of things he has done like the others. She went In to close details to describe him unlike the others who just said he did smth
Number 5
I wish I could be in one of these 😢
I love my nickers and sinker them mother fathers are so nice
i honestly think it’s the girl with the white shirt
I figured Zay is just a nickname. Or another nickname
Number 4
i think irs no. 4
Mum
19:17 woww i knew it, it was ?? Don’t wanna spoil 😂
LALALALALALALALALLALALLALAL❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I LOVE WHEN ZIGGURAT SAID HE HAD TO POOOP 😂😂💩🚽
when the guy mistakes ziggys name to hamza k absloutley lost it 😂
Nah. I thought that Ziggy said at the end ,,Thanks for the 10£"
4
Sharky said he wants a child🤭
THE BLACK BLOKE
I think it’s 2 ❤❤❤❤❤
Bro am stare at Ziggy 16:50
It was Einstein
well things turned around i cant belive it was number 5!
i think it is 2
I think Kenny is having the child
I think it’s the dude

I knew it
Aj always saying shit😂😂
Dad

Keep it up guys l love your contents 🤩😘
2:20 2:33 6:39 6:44 15:30 15:48
21:08 I think it's man
I definitely thought it was number 4 from the beginning and was so positive at the very end that he was the dad. Omg ooops😂
27:09 was so funny😂😂
6:01 ONE OF THE BETA SQUAD PPL ARE HAVING A BABY?
I’m here in 2024 and I still don’t know who’s the first beta squad parent
Fee: he’s not that kind of guy he really have the… Nick:A Guy he’s a kid! made me laugh soo hard😭 and when she said Zay-Ziggys 😂 15:20
It was obviously her come onnnn
Octopus prime
im in 21:04 and im guessing its number 4 because his stories felt so real,  while other parents stories felt memorized.  edit : holy shit. i was wrong...
Commenting that it's number 4, before I see the final votes 😂  (I was wrong, way off) 😂
tf is henry doing there
23:45 JAW FELL TO MY ASS NO WAYYYYY
The chocolate cake gave it away
That women not white one
Whats the vid name
Kevin langue and beta squad should Calab!!
One of the beta squad members might be having a baby that's why they are taking a break ❤
I think 4
When the kid sold the toy for 10 pounds, I thought it must be 5 since she said he's not very attached to it. She even looked surprised seeing the toy which was choosen as fav. Ofcourse kids usually don't have such attachments to their toys, their fav toy changes all the time.
Love.this 🎉
I love you

i was sold after she brought in the whole ezekiel shit, no one's going to randomly know that for a kid they don't know the name of to begin with💀and absolutely no one except 2 tied ziggy to ezekiel let alone brought up anything to strengthen their stories when it actually came to the kid and what parents would consider important or "fun facts"  absolutely fumbled
5
I new it was 5 before they started.
11:00
How do they always find so wrong People like mister Einstein guy

2

Number 4 is the father
Number 4
I knew she was the real mom as soon as she said he doesn't really have a favourite toy, and that his favourite thing is just temporary only a real parent would say that. Also he sold his favourite toy for sweets so she was right 😅
11:50 everyone got quiet and nobody laugh at his joke 😂😂😂😂
WWWWAAAIIITTTTTT I DIDN'T IT'D BE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@21:02 uhh  i think its 2???
This was obvious lowkey
To be honest how do I sign up for this shii
I was literally shouting at the screen when they voted out 5😂
I knew it was #5 since the beginning, I don’t know I js had a feeling
I swear it’s Albert Einstein who agrees?
I knew who the mother was immediately by the way she spoke about her son. Y’all are slow
Sharky:How old are you Ziggy Ziggy:eight Sharky:perfect 😂😂😂 Check 36 seconds to 40 seconds into the vid
Loved the video
I really love the way they all think the parent of the child is still there😂even after she has been eliminated 😂🤣😂
Bro ziggys birthday January 8th is the same as mine
The way Niko was playing with ziggy 9:44 😭❤️

I didn’t watch to the end yet 🤓   and rn i think it’s number 4.   (i me here btw 21:08)  i’ll edit it later  NO. WAY.  I THOUGHT IT WAS (THEM) FROM THE START BUT THEN (iykyk what happened to them) AND IT WAS THEMMMMMM?? NAWWWWW
6:31 6:33
of course number 5 was the mum!!!!! wtf
Idk, I think this whole thing is putting celebrities on a pedestal that should not exist. Like yes use your platform, but the Isral-Palestine war is a very delicate subject and has weight on both sides. Historically, it’s neither sides fault(like one didn’t just conquer the other) and I don’t know enough personally/intimately to be like oh yeah this side is right and therefore can kill but the other isn’t and so they can’t. War is awful and terrible for both parties, especially ones like this one- where not only is land involved but also religion(the sacred/holy sights for both Islam and Judaism are in that region). If someone doesn’t want to “pick a side” then that should be their personal choice, even if they’re rich or famous. Like maybe some have relations or relationships with people who are both Palestinian and Israeli, and saying something might hurt one or the other. Instead of saying either Pro-Palestine or Pro-Israel we should be advocating for Anti-War(which I’m aware is many people, I’m more talking the ideology of Pro-this or Pro-that). Now am I saying to avoid speaking about it completely? No. However, we don’t know the circumstances or situations in peoples’ lives even if they are a celebrity. Doing this implies that somehow celebrities are this moral guide or that they know what should be said or right simply because they have the status that they do. Please understand that I don’t mean any disrespect or offence to anyone, just wanted to say this :)
m
Boo on a thinking number 4
4
Spoiler block
My dumbass thught he was talking about gengis khan
5:50 I dont need to sub and get u to 6 million, I already know it's chunkz bcuz he looks kinda pregnant
WHOS THE BETA PARENT
Number 5 is a Giant W, Praise Jesus

The fact that he sold his favourite toy for a 10 dollar note 🤣
2
Its kenny hahahaha spoiler master keeps going
i think its number 4 guys
𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝕕𝕒𝕕
As a mother I knew it was number 5. She wasn't trying too hard it just seemed like she was honest the whole time and the things she said was only what an actual parent would say about their kids. Especially the best friends part haha
You giys can't even think he said he was 28 yrs 😅and now 32 that means zay mist be 4yrs
I thought it was number 2 - Carleen before the reveal.
i knew from the start it was number 5. when it was just 2 and 4 left, it didn't seem like any of them was the parent
Is Sharky having a child because sharky said “I want a child now” and aj said “you already do” and then sharky replied “shh don’t say that on cam” or something like that Soo idk
Oh shit its 5
Or #1
Actually #4
shes the mum #2
Mano, QUE
she was so obviously the mom bc she got his name mixed with his sibling and she knew that was his bath toy and the actual toy he’s attached to is home safely
i knew it was her!
I knew it was her!
its  OJ belive me hhh
I think the guy but i forgot his number
Congrats to king kenny for having a baby!
5
Who is having a child  🎉😢 tell me
number 2 not having kids but being really convincing was really impressive to me 😭
Number 4 is my guess
the lady
My teacher is named Hamza
23:40
YALL R DISRESPECTFUL DAAMMN
im sorry but the guy talking about the justice league injustice show and the injustice legos just hurts to listen to because they dont exist
10:45
17:30 That indian accent
Spoiler  2:57 he is 37 and if he had him when he was 28 that would make the kid 9 or 10 and the kid was confirmed 8 so idk how this dude lasted until the end
Gg
Oh
i think the woman
I was shocked myself 😮😮😮
Beta squad: tell me one thing about u and ziggy Number 1: well when hamza- 🥶
I wanna hear the letter ziggys actual mum wrote
I knew it was the white woman.  They look alike.
The buys
I think his new favourite toy is that 10 pounds
I really want to see a colab with dhar mann and the beta squad
Now I have to watch the real moms again
5:47  so??
I knew it was her. You can always tell a liar.....they rarely blink.
Knew it was her instantly as soon as she went in depth
At the beginning I thought it was either number 4 or 5 but at least after 5 said "za" I would have voted her out as well. 4 truly convinced me.
I KNEW ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A!!!!!!!!!!
Lies no way there having a kid lies
The guy's poem made me cry I was so surprised he wasn't the dad!!!! 😭😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️ This is why I love watching these because there is always a reminder that we can't judge!!!!
I knew it... when he sold his toy, he didn't even look around to see his parent's reaction because SHE WASN'T THERE!!
its 4
Black women
AJ brain is really the size of a pea man🫛😂
the first #1 one not being able to lie WAS SO FUNNY
I think it the mum with the whits sweater
WAIT ITS 9 MIL NOW WHOS THE BETA SQUAD PARENT??
i actually guessed number 5 even up until the end  😊
😂😂😂😂😂
it was os sad when you made fun of that old man he looked so sad broo its f@cked up
I was skipping this video 🤣 every time but today I watched it omg it's hilarious 🙌🏼🙌🏼🤣
Two
5
I knew no.5 was the mum , her stories were too detailed are realistic
I thought it was number 5! IT WASSSSSSS! I KNEW ITTTT
2
I knrw it was 5 , after that chocolate story and how he was named
I thought it was so obvious that Ziggy looked like his mother
I think its 5
2
2
I think the parents #5…?? 😭  AHAHAA I KNEW IT IN THE END
Number 4
I think its 4
When the guy said the younger brother and not Ziggy's brother's name was kinda sus
10:51 literally my birthday- 6/28/10
sharrkkkyyyyy
BRO MY FRIEND IS NAMED EZEKIEL
2
#5 was very detailed with her story’s it’s her for sure, and I would say #1 knew the woman was his mother so he copied her BFF answer.
WOW 🤯
I knew it, she was so calm ,you can see it when everything begins
I thought it was 4
I initially thought it was here, till she said Zay. She knew the toy wasn't his favorite anymore. And you look up to recall.
I knew it was his mother from the beginning 😂 her stories about him made the most sense and she gave a lot of details.
i honestly thought it was the lady who slipped on the toy
i could tell it was her by the kids reactions lol he seemed so proud when she told the chocolate cake story and so embarrassed when she told the coach story
No2
The whole video I was between 4 and 5 and then y'all voted out 5 😭😭
ziggy is so cute🥹🥹🥹
i knew it i knew it was her!  her stories sounded so true to me
i knew it lollllllllllll
I know him and his mother irl y'all
The dad bro
Wait one of them are having a kid 😧
i think its 4
Niko... Going from the thumb
HAMZA
24:20 yeah dw AJ its hard to realise ppl are human when u are an alien
20:57 nah def 5
0:37  why did sharks say perfect??
i did not expect it to be number 5 bro 😭 I was looking at the skin colors
i love this video eveytime they brought up einstien i cackled
einstein tried to step forward for ziggie which i think is wierd and maybe einstein tried to kidnap him
6:33 that part is so funny 😂😂Hamza
DID ZIGGY EVER GET THE TOY BACK]
i think #4
2
I knew it! 😂
4
EINSTEIN IS THE FATHER]
DAD
SOOO many signs it was her
Just found out that i was cheated on gotta heal
i thought number 5 just talking abt any of her child stories
i really thought its 4 damnnnn
I know this sounds very typical but I actually felt number 5 was the mother. The story of him not being attached to a particular toy is not bad like they said coz it makes sense. the boy literally sold the toy Niko gave him right off the bat. However that is subjective because he might not even like the toy. Can't blame the boys tho, the stuttering could've thrown anyone off
Is it true that one of the beta squad members is having a baby!?
It’s definitely #5 lol
Nyla is really quick witted and articulate for her age.
Wait i'm late who in the Beta Squad is having a kid??
I forget people are human wise words aj
Are they muslim?? Love beta squattt
Did anyone else see sharky break Ziggy's toy At the end
Wait who’s a dad in the beta squad
OJ is jokes😂
I just knew it was number 5! First, when she told the backstory of naming him and knew what Ezekial meant. Then her story with eating his dad's birthday cake. What solidified it was that she argued that he wasn't really attached to his supposedly favorite toy. Lmao just after she was voted out, Ziggy sold it to Niko for all of £10 🤣 After that, I was ten toes down convinced his real parent had been voted out.
Number 2 is mom
I knew it since the beginning i kept saying it's No:5 cuz most children's resemblances their parents so look at them both more calm and disciplined and they almost wear the same way and talk the same way, am saying this because my father is a judge and i like to be politician but I'm more good at judge as always many people claimed me judge cuz I resemblance my father in most things 😮
Lol i guess 4..but makes sense since he was using stories of his nephew.  I thought she was explaining too much....but if she has adhd or dyslexia she would easily trip up words and give tmi.  when she said something directly to him i was like shes mum. Should have gone with my gut
STOP laughing AT MY UNCLE HAMZA IN MOROCCO 🇲🇦
What was with  Niko’s “OJ!?!?!” 😂
I think its 4
Who is the dad
the fact that sharkz actually didn’t voted for number 5
5 has to be the mother
Number 4
10:29 the way the kid act was so realistic i was sure that shes the mom
You guys should have asked the birthday again for real man 😂
I thought they had it right
I think its the girl (number 2)
5 Zay is closer to Ziggy than Hamza she did say she had more than one kid my mother mixes up our names all the time
It’s #4
it’s #4
Why Is Niko Nicky so annoying? Take him off the squad.
Idkkkk
Idk if it’s 2 or 4, I’m tweaking rn cuz 2 could be persuasive but then again she might just want to make sure you know it’s her kid, I honestly thought it was 4 for a while until the favorite toy thing came around since he was kinda fumbling on the dc explanation, they both could be great parents but I’ll guess the parent is 4
Niko is the father
NAHHHH NOT 1 CALLING ZIGGY HAMZA 😭😭😭
AJ just has a huge personality that's why, these were hilarious!! 💙🖤❤ Y'all
i think it's the guy
NO BUT WHEN I WAS A KID I GOT CHASED BT A SWAN CAUSE I WAS CARRYING BREAD SO HEARING #4'S STORY MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD 💀
It was a great video
I knew it was number 5 😭 my mom calls me my sisters name all the time sometimes I think she forgets my name
He looks just like his mum.
2
I knew it because the kid emotional when they joked about it
his name is Ziggy chunkz thats not his real name hictor khan;oh no hes got me what can i think of what can i think of oh yes hamza his name is hamza had my laughing on the floor fr
They are soooo dumb was it not OBVIOUS!!?? The stories were TOOOOO SPECIFIC. She had the nerve to say the best friend was controversial and the toy wasn’t his favorite cuz he’s not sentimental like that…  What does Ziggy do next round? SELLS THE “favorite” TOY 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
def the dad
It’s 4
1:07 1:55 4:10 6:34 13:44 20:29 23:48😂
til this day i still think that Niko is the parent
The most ironic vid ever
I realised that the real mom was the mom because, come on, she has 4 children, I mess up my sisters names and my mom messes up sometime me with my sisters so a slip up is very easy
BRO I JS KNEW IT WAS 5!!!
Nah Hamza was better then ziggy
2
if 4 is 28 when he had ziggy and ziggy is now 8, 4 should be now 36 but he is 37
I just cant stop laughing
2
I knew it was number 5 from the first question I don’t know why I just knew
didnt number 4 say that ziggy was his only son and then said that he pushed his younger BROTHER off the bed so he disciplined him that means he has 2 sons
the woman
You know each time ziggy's mom said something about ziggy, you should see ziggy's face, like if you see ziggy's face, then it'll be obvious who the mom is
dc man
WAIT IM SO LATE OMG WHO IS HAVING A CHILD? HELLO WERE AT 8M WHO IS IT
I KNEW IT WAS 5– I WAS LIKE “She probably just messed up her words”
I think it's 4
tava na cara que era ela
AJ hiding under the table and saying "i forget people are human" was so cute
I KNEW IT WAS 5
Yoo I got it right
4
Not sharky going “perfect” when lil bro when “im 8”
I KNEW IT WAS 5 FROM THE VERY START ISTG NO LIE IM CRACKIN RN
Sorry guys for my dad he looks like albert einstein im Hamza 😁😓
I thought number 4 was the Dad because he was the only one to mention Ziggy's real name.
3
Chunkz is having a child!!!🥹
Spoiler alert the parent  was number three
I think It number 4
I watched this in Jan 8th
Any of them would be amazing dads Form Niko playing rock paper sciccors to them saying sorry for swearing but I do think it’s Kenny or sharky
Number 4
niko has a bond with ziggy that is unbreakable
4 was living in my head rent free
The accent gave it away for me
Mom
4
I think it’s #5
I feel like it’s the mum from the last two
I knew it😂
My name being hamsa:
I think it is 4. Dude acts just like how a dad would act about his young son
I saw chuncks on a add
I KNEW IT WAS HER
3:59
2
bro when #3 stepped up and sharky said "bro you get back" that had me rolling
I haven’t finished watching it but they messed up voting her out loool…she was the only one that said it was his favourite “right now “ then he sold it…the other two stuck with the sentimental priceless stuff…plus she was the only well spoken one there
Transformersrobotsindisguise
How can you not see the face of the child and the number 6 come on
2
Girl in the white shirt
number 1
#2
I think the last person in the line is his ma  Edit: I'm not surprised I actually got it right because you could see Ziggy's face when she talked
I GUESSED HER FROM THE BEGINING!!!!!!!!
Maybe the woman  or the Man the letter tho sounds so good n sweet but mother it sounded so real
i knew it that it was her
i felt real bad for 3 cuz he got humiliated
The fact that Sharkey broke the toilet the end 22:51
I KNEW it was 5; reason being was that, she said it wasn't his favorite toy, but just the toy for when he's having a bath. Not most kid would sell their favorite toy😂
Hamza😂😂😂
Lil man was hustling at 8😂
Number 5
Hamza😂😂😂
Guess it right this time. Because at the toy round she doesn't have any story to tell. And the other two made a story to back the previous point. But most of kid toy doesn't have a story, especially a simple lego like that.
Day 17 of asking you to visit Sarajevo
#2
I knew ittt
I definitely thought it was #5 after her talking about the toy. Kids change their toys all the time. I can't believe you voted her out. 😅
dang, I thought it was number 4.
def 4
It was all clear when he sold the toy😂
futrue me is 4 actually the father bc i stand w him
I think it's five since she gave the meaning of the name  Edit : I was right
Little man forgot himself and agreed with his mother by shaking his head.
The no 5 really pretty
BRO WHY DID I READ THE TITLE " Match the PERVERT to the child" Im crazy today smh
broo i knew it was number 5 ziggy looks a lot like his mom
I am also named Ziggy
The swan guy
24:20 , same aj
its number 4 all way
I was thinking 5’s the mom because they speak with the same features if that makes sense
SINCE WHEN WAS ONE OF YALL HAVING A CHILD 😨😨😨
NAHH ZIGGY WATCHING ALL THESE PEOPLE LIE ABT HIM IS CRAZYYY
Bro its so obvious its mr Einstein.
Boooooooooooo boring
I died of laughter when the 3rd guy said Hamza 🤣🤣🤣
" i forget ppl are human" 😭
number 2
its white sweater lady
Also, I love youuu Sharks. 🦈❤️
08th of January is actually my birthday! 😭😭
It was obvious, they both speak british lol
I think this is the first time I’ve seen them get it wrong they always get it right
I’m still convinced niko is the dad
I think this has been my best for this year
21:00  I think that its either the #4 because the story with the swan was convincing and he looks like Ziggy or it was the women that said “Zay” that got voted out because i dont think saying Zay by accident isn’t enough proof and also Ziggy knotted his head when she was talking       I HOPE IM RIGHT 😭
niko and ziggy is mad cute
The mum man
Nikoletta is my name
I thing it’s the white shirt women.
From the beginning I thought it was 5 🎉
My guess js that girl that got voted out just a bit earlier!
Its her
Lol, he looks like Niko's son.
#5 DUHHH SO OBVIOUS BROS
I knew it was her cause she said she was religious and adopted him to give him a better life and also named his two best friends when the other guy copied Toby’s name
number 5
BIGGEST PLOT TWIST
I think it’s four…
"short for ezekial" *Total drama fans enter the chat*
I could've bet it was #2 she a real good actor with those stories
It was definatly her from the beginning
Before the results, i think it's 4
What did you score here that looks really good?
it is 4 ❤😂🎉😢😮
damn number 2 wasn't even a mom? she's a great actor lol
I still dont know who is having a child!!!!!
Sooooo sharky's having a kid?? 🎉🎉🎉🎉
It was obvious bro
They were being low key rude to the old guy yeah he wasn't convincing but that was just rude the way they acted
I knew it 🎉
I knew it 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm thinking the guy....
Ziggy and the parent has the EXACT same smile 😂
Nah cause if they didn't have a funny story as a kid that they could replace Ziggy in they had not childhood
from the beginning i know she is the mom, when she said how they gave the name ezekiel. when she said about ziggy hospital and about what she said about the doctor. that could not be a part of the lying or a trick. but these guys are clueless about it. and u could tell she is very genuine about how she told the story about it
I knew from the beginning who it was. I was so mad they voted her out lol and then afterwards he gave up his toy for 10 pounds and I was like “yeah! Because she wasn’t lying when she said it wasn’t his favorite toy!”
I was convinced it was 4 from round 1
the gasp i made at the end was crazy
THE GUY 21:03
its number 2
Lol i enjoy watching this😂😂😂
Hamza ??😂😂😂
A.j under the table 😂 hilarious he must hv been embarrassed af
i knew it was her from round 1
NUNMBER 2 IS THE PARENT
I fucking knew it was her. The fifth lady! The stories! That's how a mom talk about her child. The coach thing, had him apologize. I knew! You cannot make up stories like that!😂
I knew it! ❤
23:47 i knew it
21:03: I think you voted her out.
3
Its obvious she said "Zay" because she fumbled the word's "Ziggy's favorite". I do that with words sometimes
It is def Einstein ❤
SPOILER     i honestly thought it was 2 or 5. 2 said her son had a sweet tooth, which he wanted to buy sweets. 5 was right about the toy + the fact about the name "ezekiel". i cant get how 4 stayed in after he said "ziggy tell them the toy is priceless" like... he just sold it HELP??
The only trick would be if they were apparent with more than one kids. We always call each other the other ones name so say in the wrong name is it always an indication that they’re not the parents
Hamza 😭😭🤣 Too hilarious
I guessed the correct parent straight away.
Damn number 4 you fooled me
Before you go, could you please talk about "Quantum Theory" lmao
I loved AJ's interrogation tactics in the movie captain phillips. He played the somalian pirate very well!
i think its number 5
I knew it
Poor hamza gotten his dad voted out in round one 😂
I already know that when they reveal who in the beta squad has a kid its def gonna be sharky, and Aj called him out😂😂
You can tell that Niko is the one expecting, he has not done any videos with the gold diggers and stuff like that and you can just tell that he is good with kids. If it’s him I think he will be a great dad ❤❤❤
For me a going wiz de man
I feel like it’s number five even after they voted her out I still feel it’s her
I'm laughing so hard my cheeks are aching. 🤣
Number 3
28th June is my bday
I just have to say it I got it right on most of the videos I think that goes for most of us, but why are they messing it up so much 😂
I SAID FROM THE START TO THE FINISH IT WAS HER!! YOU GUYS ARE AWFUL!!😂
the mom
THE GUY
How did y’all not get it????the toy!!!!she barely even knows about it 😭😭and he sold it asap 😂😂
I think it’s #2 as the mother
The man with the white tee and black jacket is his pops. My guess
I thi knyou sent herr outtt
I think 4 is the real parent
4
Zigggy6
I am on 28 june born
To people thinking whïch beta member is having a baby it's chunkz
wHEN THE MOM Minced her words and said "zay....., ziggy....." I somehiow figured it was her
I think it's definitely number 1
Niko losing rock paper scissors 😭 with ziggy
23:47 !!!!!!!???!!???!!?!!?[]!!!?!!!!???!1

Octopus prime 🐙
I knew that was his mother they look so alike they have the same smile
i think 4
Hamza
Lmaooo not HAMZA 😂😂😂😂😂 not him calling him that after bro I’m done
13:33 not the father
has to be number 2 fo sure
Cant Be A Beta Squad Vid Without An Old Guy 😂
4
I think it's number five
-"what's your name?" -"Ezikiel." (i am not writing further as its the kids name as well)
I knew it😂😂😂😂
When number one said hamza instead of ziggy😂😂😂 I fainted! He went off the cliff
My name is Hamza
THEY ARE FUNNY ASF BRO IM DYING
4:11 bro my name is Hamza
I think it’s 5 hope I’m correct
And they say they not racist yet this vid shows they are
Saying his name's Hamza with so much conviction is wild 😂😂
When he called him hamza that is the best of Einsteins theories
U know einstein when he said hictor dahl khan I thought he said hitler dahl khan😂
Who is having a child.
FOUR
I knew from the moment she came out Ms. Lady with glasses was the mom. I saw the way she looked at her son from the start. And Ziggy is doing his good acting to show that it's not her. Btw, I haven't looked at at any comments, but just commenting before the reveal. We'll see how this ends 👀!
The Fifth one is the mum 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think it’s number four without knowing.
Number 5
"she's either an incredible liar or an unbelievable actress" sharky and niko finishing eachother's sentences with their singular shared braincell not realising it means the same thing
I think it’s 4..
I think its albert Einstein bc maybe he calls him hamza as a nickname
It’s four 😮
2
Exactly😂😂😂😂  I guessed right😂  She was clear from the start
I think it’s the woman who said he isn’t attached to the toy because he just sold it😂😂
HAMZA IS CRAZYYYY
4
2
I think it is 2
The no. 4 was liyng he said blablahblah and he said that he had ziggy at 28 so hell be 9 so he lied badly
LAWRENCE 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
From the start I felt it was number 4
Its funny because sea lion in french is the translation
“Full of zest” is crazy 🤦🏿‍♂️
Guy
I think it's th3 girl
So who had the child?
No one would ever match me to my youngest! This is a fun way to look at it bc I am so tired of people asking if I'm the babysitter!
kinda weird of me but i guessed she was the mom because her and Ziggy's accents matched 😭
oj
i genuinely thought it was #2. anyone else?
I was staying when a #1 said Hamza instead of ziggy it was really funny!!!!💖😄😄😂😂😂😂😂😂
Icl I knew it was her I just had a feeling
4
why did i think his sweatshirts said horny
Nahhhhh. This vid is not from 6 months ago. I swear I watched this just a month ago
man said Humza!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  bro which street did they pick up uncle from man looked liked he was going for a job interview
When the mother went deep into that backstory i immediately knew and then she said he doesnt have a favourite toy and he only uses it in the bath and then he sells it for 6.50 goes to show she was the real mum😂
as soon as he said “blimming” i knew who the mum was
4
Definitely think she’s the mom
i think it’s 5
Hamza
i think that Ziggy`s father is number four as everything he said and done is something a father would do, i thought of him from the first round bc he said his full name and as I heard that he`s 37 and Ziggy`s 7 and half it made me count and it was 28/29 as he said (he said he had 28 years when he had him).  He just trowed everything in the fist round whithout any question, also, the shirt looks a lot like a dc lovers/fans prices pocession. that`s my answer (time 21:05 of 25:12)
do not check the comments mid way of u watching the vid (they say the winner)  ☠
bro i hate you guys you guys are sad and racist he was about to cry you were teasing him through the whole journey. you guys are sooo racist you guys need to go to church and say your sorry to god.
5
i thought it was number 4
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS IT WAS HER BFFR
I knew it was number 5 the whole time!
I knew it was #5 after the cake story because if you didn’t catch it ziggy shook his head smiling 9:12
I knew it was number 5 when ziggy nodded his head when she was telling one of the stories.
I knew it
Her stories were too deep man. The meaning behind the name, the best friend, the toy attachment, etc. I'm surprised they didn't pick up on it.
I knew that was the mom when i saw his reaction when she was talking
The man
4
5was d one
Hamziggy
Lol I definitely believed she is the mom because she told us what the name Ezekial means and her husband’s name is David. All of it is biblical🥹which I love!💗
3
ok, Dad very good. got it wrong. Nice
its the WOMANNNNN
These type of videos from beta squad are actually really fun NGL trying to guess it along with them
i think its number four
I knew it
I was cracking up in round won when the parents walked in and niko said “ok we have Albert Einstein here”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Its number 2
But they actually look alike facially... i knew she was the parent from time
16:09 My man was rightt!!!!
I was soooo wrong! I swore it was #4😂
knew it was her
i think it’s #5 cs her stories seemed the most natural
I KNEW IT WAS HER😭😭😭😭😭
what you talking bout thats nikos son
I think 4 still haven't watched to find out
Octopus prime 💀💀💀
I think it's four
When the real mum was saying the story about the football game, and how she corrected it to practice showed how it was her tbh,
I knew that girl was his mom when she called him zay idk how that threw them off but it was clearly a nick name 😂 plus kids are gonna be kids you really think they’re gonna have a specific reason as to why a particular toy is their favorite 😭literally if you ask a kid why a toy is their favorite they’re gonna say “letter 4” or some shii 🤣
ام حمزه نعتذر
Hamza 💀
4
So apparently everyone in the comment section knew the real Mother. Stop lying 😅
I think it’s four before I see the results
Would have love to hear his real mom read her letter sadly 😢
Bruh when they claimed she messed up by saying “ Zay “ was soooo dumb. All the other contestants also stuttered but they didn’t mention it
i knew it was her because he nodded was 5 said he was eatin the cake
10:44 that was the exact day when i turned 8 years old
Hamza number one was capping styl😂
Hamza number one was capping styl😂
Before the vid ends… I think it’s the lady in the white shirt. She’s pulling extra details about her ‘son’ that a lot of others didn’t try to do. Idunnooooo
Big upss guys I love ur videos
I felt so bad for 'Albert’   Quantum theory 😭😂
2:16  HE IS NOT ZIGGYS FATHER 😭😭
I am dying of laughter as #1 called ziggy hamza, and confirmed by asking if he could keep lying since his bursted 😅😂
6:34 IM DEADDDDD
Mans said hamza😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When the mum told the tragic story about his birth and the meaning of his name, that was a pointer.
Bro the way Ziggy reacted on the football practice story just gave it away ngl u could see his embarrassed face
Hamza😂😂
The guy is the flipping dad.
4
21:00 I’ve been knowning for the begin bro that 4 was his dad but now I gotta see if I can really predict this shit bro
I think the father is 4
“His name is Hamza” 😂😂
I think it’s number 5
I think what really got me to choose #5 is because of what she said with the toy, but mostly with her saying “Za”. I mean she has four kids, parents are always mixing up their kids names with their siblings or say like one or a two letters in their names wrong. Parents always do that.
4
The lasy
It’s the girl I think
4
As a mom I knew from the meaning of his name that number 5 was his mother. Her messing up his name is honestly more common than you all think and really wasn't that big of a deal if you listened to her other answers.
Hamza😅
The number 5 was the mother
4 all daylong
i was eating and almost choked when he said HAMZA
I always got mother from 5
HOLD UP WAIT A MINUITE DIDNTS NUMBER 3 say he had only one son 9:50
no one gonna talk ab how fine laurence is
im gonna say 2 is ziggy mom
I think its the dad
I lost it when lil bro was called hamza lol
Four
Hamza
they brang eistein back from the dead for this video
3:00 If Ziggy's 8 how tf is he 37 and Had him at 28???
He literally looks just like her lol they fumbled hard. I could tell right away
NUMBER 2
Credits to number 2 though she was so convincing!!
I think its the man
The Hamza part gets me every time
I think it’s the one white chick
I knew it that was his mom
The mum
the mum
Could tell by the accent, as soon as you hear them both, you can tell
Ziggys reaction during the coach story gave it away. He is still a little ashamed of it.
4
2
Black coat
they both had the same accent too it was obvious
this was actually the first beta squad video i watched
i knew it
Number 4
I KNEW IT!😊🎉
Guys acted like their mom never called them the wrong name 😂
23:44 EINSTIEN OMG 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I knew it I knew it broooooooo
The guy smiling 2:18 😭
Number 2
i think its numbr 2
I think it's albert einstien💯
as hamza i can confirm they be capin
Realtopboy fans wondering y Nicosia got Jamie's jacket on
Its gotta be #5. The fact that shes was just like nah it’s not his favourite toy is honestly the most believable answer cuz i dont think anyone lying would say that. Other 2 made up stories trying to link it to his favourite shows.  edit: yea
Einstein probably made Ziggy in a lab 2:16
I'm pretty sure AJ is the same height as the kid lol
2
How does No. 3 look 80, 50 and 23 at the same time
"we are religious" 🤡🤡🤡 monkey
AJ hiding under the table has to be the cutest thing ever. OJ correcting himself from Ezekiel to Ziggy was a touch of genius!.
4
my favourite youtubers :)
i knew it was her from the beginning then i changed my mind
My brother has the same shirt as him
I’m rock (im a man)
4:11 choked onnmy apple juice 💀
i knew it was her lol
Feel like this was one of the easiest out of all the guess the challenges that story the mom gave about his name was just to real to not be her
YES!!! I actually got it in round 1!
21:01 yall voted her out but i still think it's #5
Before seeing: I think it’s 4
#5 was really good but between #2 and #4 its gotta be #2
I knew it was her because you can get a sense of nurturing/maternal vibe from her, she was the only parent proving it.
Tbh I thought it was a plot twist and it was 4 and 5s kid then after watching it more I switched my answer to just 2.
man she fine asf
I knew it was her when I first looked at them
def 4
Awww the way she hugs her baby at the end, so sweet 🥹
Beta squad not really smart lol
Damn I was not expecting that 😂
I just knew it. From the birth story alone it was obvious.
4:05 HOWLING
Number 4
I feel so bad for number 3 he seemed really nice 😢
i knew it from the second he said 'blimming'
i think number 4
The man
if #4 wasn't the dad how did he know his name though and nobody else did
I thought it was the fourth one tho
2:53
congratulations i didnt know chunkz was having a child
I knew it 24:54
4 21:09
I think sharks is the dad
Mum
I KNEW IT ESPECIALLY AFTER THE 10 POUNDSS
I’m so proud of myself cos i KNEW it!!!
Sharky has a child?!?
Here me out, what if Bradley was in this video
bro i dont even know what to say as soon as the video started i said she looks like she fks black guys and i was right lmao
They look very alike, you can tell straightaway that she is the mum
Einstein stepping forward at the end killed me 😂😂
number 1 was funny
All of her responses seemed like those of a parent but I figured it was possible that she was just a really good liar. Still, I wouldn't have voted her out after that mistake. She said she had other kids and my mom is constantly calling out 3 of my sisters' names before she finally calls out mine when she's trying to get my attention. I just think they should've given her at least one more chance
I knew it bro
I think its the dad!
lol no.4 says he had zigg when he was 28 and now hes 38 my boy zigg here is 8 u see whats happenin????  dis boy be lakin
Third one is the mom
BRO THE SHIRT ZIGGY IS WEARING IA MY SHIRT I HAVE THAT SHIRT
thhe woman
I got so into the video that when they started Clapping i also started Clapping
i feel like it’s 2 man
Only way I knew she was the mum was that Ziggy was like nodding along with her stories and all that.
i KNEW it would probably be her, after a short while. It was predictable they wanted to fool the crew with a white parent, but kid's so obviously MIXEY! so if not her, the guy they ended up on, maybe.?
I THOUGHT IT WAS 4 DAMN
I was so convinced it number 2 was the real parent, true plot twist in the end
bruh i paused the video just to comment............. I THINK ITS 2!!!!!!
4
When she slipped up and called him Zay I knew it was her. She said she had other children, parents mix their names up all the time. Slip of the tongue 😂😂
the mother said he wasn't attached to his toys and just sold it right after proves she is the mother, Ziggy hustled them pretty good pretending he wanted it 😂
Am I the only one who sees a disrespectful behavior to the possible parents? Especially with the one that leaves first. I don't know, I don't like that at all and I'm not interested in the rest of the video
I new it was herrrr, they have the same accent
I think it's the woman tho
Loved it ❤
4
Niko is going to be a FATHER!!!!!!
First question I knew it was 5 immediately
21:10 4 probably sounds like a proper dad
The dude
Bro number 3 was so sad I feel so abd for him
14:40 lol the way she believed it was octopus prime🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the dude
Mom
Is that a slipknot jacket on Aj
its the guy for sure
Didn't see that coming
Swear down, i knew the parent from the start
t
from the moment she started speaking i noticed they have the same speaking patterns and ways to pronounce words come on guyssss hahah
my names ezekiel, thats crazy
THE DAD! Its the dad. Number 4 is the father!  Edit: I was... unfortunately incorrect
it was so ovious
Didnt anyone realize that Ziggy was nodding his head like 'saying': "Jup, true story", when the mom talked about the chocolate cake incident?
I knewwww it was her😭 all her stories sounded too real especially about his name
I knew she was the mom the moment she answered the best friend question.
4 21:31
bro its 4
Hamza cameo
icl i thought it was 5 since like when she was telling the stories ziggy was nodding and smiling
idk why but I feel like Chunkz was so quiet and down this video
23:44 “hey you get back!” LOLLL
I was so sure it was OJ! Looks like he fooled me again.
I knew it! They missed when Ziggy nodded his head while mom was telling the story about the cake. I always look at the kid because it is clear they all have children, but the boy won't be as good at acting as the adults. Plus the toy thing lol. Kids have "favorite" toys for like 3 seconds so I was not surprised when she didn't recognize it as his favorite. Then of course he sold it lmao.
I think it's number 4
So obvious she is the mom.  Every good parent could tell
Niko got the same jacket as Jamie from top boy
love you guys
did they not clock how his speech was most similar to hers 😂
Kenny is having a child
I knew it bcs ziggy has curly hair
It Kenny
Like I think the woman said she didn’t care about the toy so he sold for a 10 quid so lads come on use ur braaaains
the one with a child is kenny
Didn’t she say Optimus Prime correctly
number 4
Momma fs
Yea it's probaly the guy with the black jacket
I think it's number 2!! Definitely she just knows him very well.  I will edit the cmnt when the video end!   Edit: I.was.SHOCKED!  But to be honest they do look like each other- ❤
My name is Eliot and I can confirm I don’t know ziggy irl
4
2
So obvious mum was number 5😭
I ACTUALLY KNEW IT
Two?
Honestly I always thought it was either 2 or 5
I knew it was 5
It’s defo 2
i knew it
The man!
Nikos comments are so funny when he catches people out
No one talking abt how pretty his mom is😭
6:30😭😭😭
23:55 awww
More of these videos beta squad plzzzzz
2
hamaza my brother
i think its that man close to number 5 i paused it so now let me go back and see who it actually is
i think 4 is the dad
Bro I knew it’s number five you guys stupid
its the guy….
i knew it was her the eye contact she made w him and also like she said the features
bro humza🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Number 4
The guy is the father of the boy 👦
the mom  #2
the white lady
I think the parent is Niko 🤩
No one saw ziggy node to his mum's story?
I actually thought it had to be 4
I don’t know and don’t give a shit
Hamza what the heck
i think its number 4
I literally knew she was the mom after the story behind his name ive had a feeling since the beginning tbh and also when she said he doesn't really care about the toy and he sold it after
10:53 That made me doubt her being the mom, since the lady before said August 2014 and the next dude said 28th, so I thought she saying Ziggy's birthday being 28th August 2014 was her improvising, using the info the previous participants laid out.   If you think about it, it's a massive coincidence.😅
5
4
3
1
2
2🎉
Its either 5 or 4 just by the eyes
i think that woman is the mom
This was their best one!! All contestant actors/actresses on point elite quality! 😮. Usually it’s so obvious, I got this wrong bad! 😮😮
aj hiding behind the table at the end 🤣
He literally said his name was Ezekiel before the show even started
“Ziggy my son I think you are full of zest but sometimes I think you are possessed”
I THINK NO 3
I knew it was her from the beginning 😂
I think it 21:03  the dad 4
ITS NUMBER 4 I SWEAR
Knew from the first round because of the accents
Let's Go Humxa
Hi Guys  awesome show I guess that white lady also the boy looked mixed I can see a white mother black father don't get me wrong I almost believed that Conga by he could have adopted him also
i knew it was her as soon as Ziggy said “it’s a blimming tiger!” same accent lol
THIS IS SO CUTE
As soon as she talked about the name, it was clear that she's the mother. The others were talking abt themself, but she was talking about him and his name.
4
number 2 deserve an oscar
We need constitutional monarchy that unites the world save ourselves
https://youtu.be/MJaEXsWM1u4
Number one was soooo funny 🤣🤣🤣 socials ?
tbh i don’t like the old girl in the white she’s annoying
4 hands down
4:10 😂
I think the women is the mum but yet again who doesn’t like sweets
she was the only one with a british accent
kizxh
ohin
2  is the mom
At some point they were clowning the mum & Ziggy reacted and I thought it might be her. It was a hard call though tbh.
4 has to be the dad, didn’t slip up once.
My name is actually hamza
You dont need to reveal who is having a child i already know its niko he is the one  who is pregnant
I think thta number 2 is the mummm
Did anyone see one person said august 31 there is no 31stvof august
Rip God bless
Hamza.
Who was the beta squad parent?
lmao
my boy ziggy is definitely adopted
4:07  HAMZA😭😭😭
How they got lucas moura on here 😂
I guessed it cause of how posh both the mother and child spoke
POV: you were shouting NUMBER 5 the hole time
4
i think it was 4
Icl it was kind of obvious they look so alike
I got something right for once 😂
Me and Tommy think its 5 Sam thinks 4
Mom
is somebody actually expecting a baby
4 from start as soon as he introduced himself
I think it's number 4
21:05 4
She said that she had other kids za could of possibly been an other one of her kids but they didn’t think about that until the end when she said she was clumsy
I think it's the girl
"How old are u?" "8" "oh perfect"
Hamza 💀 😂😂😂😂
number 5 had my pick ever since she told the god naming story i was so done when they voted her out
Das cap
Use me as WTF button
I DONT KNOW HOW ALL OF THE COMMENTS THINK IT WAS NUMBER 5 FROM THE BEGGINING. I WAS 99 PERCENT SURE THAT IT WOULD BE BETWEEN NUBMER 2 AND 3
it is for sure number 4
yes
10:38 this made me really suspiscious of the fourth contestant because he was looking at ziggy
I think it's the guy, since when he read the poem or whatever, Ziggy looked relaxed and a bit shy
I think 2 is the mummy
Number 4 is the dad
2
Thinkin it’s number 4
ITS the dude
Did u hear abt the baby
Dad
i think it is #2
I think it’s the girl I’m comign back later when I see the real,it was the girl with weavy hair
It’s has to be number two they have the same lips and skin tone plus she knows he has a sweet tooth or it’s the white lady because of how she acts
I knew it was the mum because when she was explaining one of the stories Ziggy nodded agreeing to what she was saying
It's the lady. Somebody give my child money n they say what are u goin to buy and they say sweets imma speak up too. It's a mom thing.
very cool boys
mom
#moskater
Hazma bro😭💀
I really wanted Albert to win
At the beginning I thought number 5
i knew number 5 was the mother even before the toy sell, because she was saying the truth
last 2: that women is def the mum the way she acts and talks is definitely mom like the dude he prob got a kid or sum cus he was quick with everything. update:imma end myself forgot about that women but i just thought she was a good liar thats insane.
I knew it was her.
I knew it was the last one just from the story about his birth. There’s no way she would know his real name’s (which isn’t extremely common) meaning and connect it as a miracle to such a story.
Mans said “shout out Calloux” 😂
19:19 - who cuttin onions
i was laughing so much when number 1 called him hamza 😭😭
The dad is Ziggy’s
I was thinking it was him not her let's see if I'm right....
i knew itt
I absolutely knew his mom was her from the beginning explanation of the name then her other answers kept confirming it lol
We are at 6M so I wana know who is gonna be a dad
Ziggy  and I share the same Birthday
a thought number 2 was a billion percent his mum
2
I knew it was 5 the whole time lol
It makes sense that shes the mom because the kid traded his "favourite toy" for money..Normally kids dont really go for that but then again now a days kids just want money LMAO but uhm she herself said hes not really attached or that type of kid to be attached to like a toy and the only one was his teddy bear...And her answers barley had any hesitation either, I honestly thought it was her the entire time or the guy at the end for the final.
I already knew from the start i could see it
it’s 4
Number 4
broooo hamza khan😂😂😂😂 bro us pakistanis know that hamza khan ins a pakistani actress🤣🤣🤣
4
Niko so fine
4
I thought fit white girl
i think its niko
It is two
Why do these guys sound like Brits yet emulate black Americans from the inner city? Are foreigners so pathetic that they emulate Americans just by watching TV?
Ok.
number 3
ZAY ZIGGY HUMZA😂😂😂
Who is having the baby?
Number 2??
Funny fact my name is acctually hamza
it was obvious it was 5 because the kid kept nodding at her stories and smiling
As a mixed lightskin kid with a White mom and a Black dad, I’m actually fucking pissed at myself for not guessing 5. I shoulda trusted the process.
I KNEW IT I AM SO PROUD OF MYSELF
5
The biggest plotwits would be ziggy being an orohan
The lady with the glasses  2 Ig
HAMZA
Wow did not think it’s was her
Number 4
4
2
I think it was Einstein man 👨‍🏫🤓🦳
thought it was her after she shared the name story but after he sold the toy for 10 pounds it was obvious 💀 plus she just seemed to care about him. Kinda wished it was Einstein tho lmaooo
Number 4 for sure 🎉
5
I KNEW IT WAS FIVE
that's why interrogation tacticts dont work
I think it is 4
13:47 How #5 reacted to Aj swearing while the kid was there gave it away from me lmao.
You can try nikos 123 kids
I think it is number 4 cause he looks exactly like Ezekiel
i knew it was herrrrrr by the toy and soccer story
YOU LOT HAVE FAILED, its the white woman
4:05 Where did Hamza come from 😂🤣
21:04 i think its oj
I KNEW IT
I knew it was her all along
Why did they vote out three he was the father
I honestly thought that 5 and 4 were both of his parents
I knew it since the beginning idk how they couldn't sense it and whenever she talked the kids reaction was obvious, it was just to obvious but when they voted her out they made me doubt myself. And the explanation about his name was something someone wouldn't lie abt.
❤god loves u he is coming soon! spread his word please. remember he died on the cross for you<33
4
Beta squad baby? It’s been 6 mill
We all had the same face when the real parents stepped forward 🧎🏽‍♂️
I KNEW IT!!!!!!
four
Hahah the moment mans renegotiated for only 1.5 pounds more, it made me think #5 was right, She just might be the mom. Hahaha my bet was on 4 or 5. 4 came in with a strong story from the start. #1 and 3 were pure jokes. Hamza! 🤣
Ziggys full of zest 😭
its the mom bumble bee i think it is
Lady!
BRO SAID HAMZA 😂😂😂😂
28th of august my bday bbyyyy 😛😛😛
umm...  where is the child.... You guys have 6.8million and ummm... No child has been brought up to our attention.....
I thought their were two parents there i thought it was 4 & 5
Mom, out
Every time they bring up Einstein and Hamza I die laughing 🤣 Chunkz is effortlessly funny
aj saying "i forgot people are human" had me reflecting a lot man.. we're too consumed by social media we forget people are indeed human
I definitely know for a fact that ziggy’s dad is def black
how is niko gonna just throw out the word "capitulated" and nobody questions him lmao
Her and Ziggy had the same facial features like what 😂
number 2 defo
I think it’s either the one with the durag or the man that’s in the last round
It was obvious it’s number 5 saying the whole thing about being resuscitated is a bit of a give away, You wouldn’t joke about that happening to someone else’s child.
I got annoyed at the guys cuz they keep interrupting I would get mad fr
Nahhh meet the child is he adopted😂AJ don’t say that😂I think the dad🥲
Bro im hamza
Number 5 is the father for sure 21:21 I meant number 4
Number 2
I THOUGHT IT WAS NUMBER 2 FROM THE START
The mom/the girl
Nah, I was so convinced it was number four.
I think it’s 4
i think kenny would be a parent
I think 2 is the dad
No cap my grandpas name is hamza
I WAS SO SURE THAT 5 WAS THE MOM
YOOO WTF IM HAMZA
Is no 1 gonna talk about when he called him perfect when he said he was 8 0:35
i just want to get  likes
The guy
SHARKY HAS A CHILD 🔥🔥🔥
i’m only 21 mins in but #2 feels like she could be the mom bc of the way she dresses and acts. white girl also coulda been the mom bc white moms like her love to adopt black children
I KNEW IT WAS FIVE BC SHE SAID IT WASNT THAT SPECIAL TO HIM AND THEN HE SOLD IT AWAY I KNEW IT IM SO SMARTTT
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHA
before seeing the end results number #2 is doing too much hence I think she’s not the parent, I think they voted the parent out already
the plot twist😀😀😀😀
Before the reveal, i think the woman is his mom.  Edit: i didn't see that coming
"I forget that people are human" while AJs hiding behind the table cracked me up 😂
I love the way Ziggy turned into Hamza-
2
My mum calls me by her sister’s name all the time 😂
plot twist...niko was the parent🤣🤣
I think the 2 in the white isn’t the mom but has kids of her own.
Yous voted the da out in the first round bro
Number 5 was so obvious, this kid is so well spoken like his mumma! Obvious from the second she opened her mouth!
Jamaican mom
sharky has a child
4
Its 100% #4
I think the mum is number 2
Spoiler alert     I knew it it was 5 but I changed at the last time
I knew it was #5. The way Ziggy smiled after the chocolate cake story.
Beta Squad>>>Sidemen 💯👍
no 1.
yall bettah be sayin the first parent rightt noww
11:11
i thought it was no4 oj 😭😭

The absolute silence when she stepped forward 😭
I think it was the white woman

We all know his real name is Hamza 🤣🤣🤣

Best episode 🤣🤣🤣
Dad

5
6:33 nah help
NO WAYYY
It's so scary how good people are at waffling especially number 2
I think it’s 4
Damn my mummy gut instinct was spot on. Before any of the "parents" spoke I had it pinned to #5 being the mother.
i knew it was her from the way the kid spoke
einstein killed nme
einstien half stepping forward at the end HAD me
Tbh, the first time I ever got it right from these types of videos by any YouTuber
I knew it from the start it is number 5 she was obviously the most comptables one with her answers.. 😊
I knew it was 5 when she told the story about the baseball thing and Ziggy seemed a lil bit uncomfortable and ashamed of his actions
number five is the mother
i knew she was the parent
The last man standing
brooo i knew it was her. how could u not
Make part 2
Lol 😂
hamza 1
4
As a father myself, I knew that number 5 is Ziggy's mother. The way she tells her stories about her son, i felt that. Glad i got it right at the end. Great video guys!
I genuinely thought it was nikos bredrin you knoww 😂
I actually guess correct for number 5!!!!! I am so happy!
his name is hamza ahhahqhqhqhhahahahaha
The facial features were too similar, and niko will be a great father the way he entertained him
The man talking about Injustice Dc sounded like he searched up the first thing that kids liked and saw injustice and tried to roll with it lol
5
its the mum
it would be cool to see one where both of the parents are in the line up
I think its number 4  Edit: i was wrong
Ziggy smalls
It was so obvious, c’mon guys. This video was still super wholesome tho 💕
I knew who the parent was and I was so surprised when ya voted her out
If it aint number four i swear imma die
i know sharky is having a baby but no one is talking about chunks 😂
Want more guess the parent 😅
LMFAOOO NOT HIM SAYING HAMZA
i’m still building my case that #3 is humzas dad🧐
When she said zay I instantly knew she was the mum.. Cause that could be a different way of shortening the name Ezekiel .. In my mind I was like y'all are so dumb😂
bro my name is hamza i could i be could ziggy
It was the posh way the kid said Nikolett?! at the beginning that matched best to number 5.  Great little family and great episode
4 now, after you voted out 5
These people can't maths. Ziggy says he's 8 but when it came to number 4,he says he's 37 but has Ziggy when he was 28.  Either way, the lady answered the best friend question and the toy question how I would about my my son so I knew it was her
I knew it
I think 4
Nah I actually gasped with yall like i thought it was her when she was talking but DAMN
WHATTTTTTTTTT
When she said "Zay", that could also be meaning that it's his special nickname given by her mom. And even the kid race is mixed, he and his mom have almost the same facial feature if you pay attention closely.
2 is the mom
4????
5:51 who's pregnant? I couldn't tell
i cracked it. KENNY IS GOING TO BE A FATHER frfr he lit said "i want a child" in the vid bro
I wanted the Hamza guy to stay just for the chaotic lolz
I KNEW IT WAS HER FROM THE START BEFORE ANY QUESTIONS IM CRACKED
gotta be 2 right
The mom accidentally mentioned his nickname i thought would make them realise, but it's something else under pressure and emotions
The way 1 went from ziggy to. Hamza💀
sure
Nah it’s the lady deffo
a slip of the tongue means she's lying? yikes...that was clearly his mum!
I thought it was either 4  or 5. But they voted 5 out
I think it’s the mom 21:05
I was screaming when they reveal the true parents cause I already know it's number 5, listen to the details lads, you lot are terrible at this game, haha
defo the woman in braids her persuasion and facts are really believable
I think its no.5...she was so detailed,they have the same accent and almost the same skin colour
#1 funny af
On god I thought it was 4
I was rooting for 4 at first, he had like the same style as the kid, and the age matched.   But the seeing the facial expressions when 5 was hearing the other stories, it was definitely her.
I think it is the mom
I knew it! I swear to god
imagine if they had to guess the teenager to the parent
Ain’t no way they voted her off. I was screaming she is the only one that seem to know him. Kids have toys they like now
4
I love how all of these videos have one person who is absolutely 100% an impostor
Let’s go
Chunks by himself (don’t take as me making fun)
number 1 is the real parent because all say 2014 that mean he is nine years old no 1 is say 2015 mean that is 8 years old
AJ be like: I fortet people are human
LMAO WHEN NUMBER ONE CALLED HIM HAMZA
I think it's the man
#1 was jokes.
The guy
I knew from the story behind his name. Beside no kid would give up their favorite  toy so easy,beside every mom with more than one kids  sometimes call their kid their siblings name.
I was voting number 5 since the first question
It was when Ezekiel said “blooming” for me I knew that was his mum she’s the only one who sounds like she says that regularly I knew literally from that moment on glad I got it right for once these guys always throw me off 🤦🏽‍♀️😂
Yooo, I guessed it was the brown-haired lady all along.  What can I say? I’m the best detective of all Beta Squad fans.
Number 2
i think its 4 its before i watched the result lets see how it turns out
I knew it she just felt like the mum
Mother😊
The swan biting the hand is actually believable, my sister was bit by an ostrich when we went to the zoo once because she got too close to it and her hand hurt but it wasn’t bitten off
It’s the boys think
I was right
When aj said fuck i paused on the participants faces and dam his actual mother reacted in a typical way like "ffs", still I've been thrown off tbh
I knew it
number 5
I love how nico was playing rock paper siccors and making him laugh.
I knew it was her the whole time 😭
It's number 4!  Number 5 is low key a jaw drop :O
Saying this before they anounce
4 is the one
I think #5
I think it’s the girl
Super cute ending 🤍
IM SO SMART I KNEW IT YK WHY CUZ OF THE ACCENT THEY BOTH HQVE THE SAME ACCENT THEY CHILD GOT IT FROM HIS MOM
4
9:48 why are u playing rock paper scissors and *LOSING*
I think it’s 2
Hamza🔥
I knew it was her after the 2nd round😭😭
2. Hundred percent or hamzah.
I think it’s the guy who is the father 😂
This actually was recorded 10 yrs ago and Ezekiel is 18 now and he is known as Ezekiel the 1st and is famous on tiktok
Idk
10:53 aye August 28th is my birthday
4 😊
i think its the woman
12:15 me too bro, me too 😭😭
Number two she’s the mom she said it in the begining  he’s a sweet tooth he got 10 pounds and said he would spend it on sweets
einstiein moving forward at the end got me tripping 🤣
Number 4 is the real parent .
JESUS LOVES YALL HE SAVES HE IS KING HE IS COMING BACK SOON REPENT RUN TO HIM HE LOVES YALL
when albert einstein tried stepping forward at the end like no not you 😂 hamza 🤣
the real child in this was Niko when he really wanted to buy the toy off Hamza 😂 bro was prolly laughing at him thinking that ain’t worth £10 😂
No 3 wasn’t even tryin 😭 Hamza 💀
I'm pretty sure its the dad in the black vest bald head and black beard.
i’m right from the start bro. 😅
the beard guy\
I loved 9:46 when Nico and ziggy were playing rock paper scissors 😂
Bro my name is hamza
I THINK ITS THE MAN THAT WAS BEFORE THE WHIT WOMEN
They where just bullying Number Three LMAO
4:00
I'm at 9:17 and he is nodding with the lady so ima guess its her bc he was suspicious of everyone else. Focus on how the kids acts towards the adults!
The mom I think
The mum was leng icl
1 wasnt believable from the start bc aint no way a black 16 yr old sticking around to take care of the kid
Prediction:Nah so i think its #5 who u voted out
honest to god I actually thought that it was number 4
Dead giveaway was the way ziggy spoke, soon as you hear the mum speak it's bait
seek Jesus before it is too late… turn to him before it is too late because we never know when our time is up. You can be any age at any moment and your breath can be taken away just like that. How do you know you will go to heaven when you pass?? You may end up in hell… you may end up in hell because you allowed yourself to live a life of adultery, fornication, sexual immoralit, and just a life of sin over all… not Turing over to God allowing him to cleanse you of your sins and giving you life .. There is one way to heaven and that’s through Jesus Christ our Lord and savior (John 14:6). One thing many people get mixed up is that Christianity is a “religion” when in reality it’s the complete opposite . It’s a relationship with God. And not in that type of way but in a fatherly way.. He loves you and knows your name (John 3:16) (exodus 33:17). He knows how many hairs are on your head to this second ( Luke 12:7) …  God made it easy to go into heaven but it’s up to you to accept him or not. All we have to do is firstly believe in what he done for you on the cross.. he took the punishment for sin and died on the cross for you willingly (galations 1:4)  God knew before hand the pain he would have to suffer on the cross for you. But he still chose to do it because He Loves You…  but not only did he die in the cross for you.. but he rose again on the third day! When believeing that truely we turn from our sins and pick up our cross ( not physically ofc) and follow him letting him lead us guide us through life.. Some people may even ask how do I know if he even real?? God said in his word seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you (Mathew 7:7-8).. call out to Jesus even if you have to ask him to reveal himself to you he will…. He love you💕  Gospel of salvation 💕 . 1 Corinthian 15:1-4   Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: ——
R we not gonna talk about him playing with the toy in the bath tub 💀
#4
Bro if you are listing to this on headphones or AirPods the black woman always says her s so loud and my ear are bleeding
My mom got me when she was 15
the guy is NOT the father.
I think its 5.... 😂
When she said that he "nyammed" the cake, i knew it was her. Her husband MUST be black
I hought he was the dad
14:41 she’s beautiful
Number 4 Is Dad
The way i knew it was parent #5
sharky is definitely our upcoming dad
I think someone called me
I KNEW IT WAS 5!! She was so good, maybe she got confused with her other child and that’s why she called him Zay, but it was so obvious! They even look the same, the eyes, lips, structure, everything lol
My heart dropped when Einstein moved fowrd
I think the father is parent #4
coal miner
"his name is hamza" LMAFOOO
i'm sorry it was obvious
Is someone actually having a baby if so you got 6 mil
i thought it was 4 all along
I think its the man
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.  Strategy  His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.  The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.  A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.  The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.  However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.  Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.  It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.  In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.  Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.  When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.  Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.  Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.  If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.  For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.  For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.  They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.  The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.  A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted  A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.  This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.  The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.  A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.  Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.  The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.  A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.  A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough
Who is the beta squad parent
I swore it was number 4 🤣
In the start, ziggy mentioned his names was Eziekeil and number 5 mention it.
#4
i think it’s number 2
Whose the father? He looks like a mini me beta dude
I knew she was his mum immediately because Ziggy looks exactly like her 😂
Number 5
i knew it was number 5
nahh when i heard his name apparently being ‘hamza’ i lost it
i think the white lady was the mom
I was so sure it was 4 or  2
The lady is his true mother!
Whole time I said it was her even with the zay I was like I mix my friends name up most of the time 😭😭😭
I knew it!!! Even before it started i had high hope on number 5, she was pretty confident! And about zay and ziggy! I felt like she has 4 childs so she could have called ziggy has her other child maybe who is called zay! (well my mom also sometimes calles my sister as my brothers nickname, cause they both has familiar nicknames) She answered all of 'em without any hesitation! Like a real mom would do.....
GRANDMA
This video's got a lot of views, but I bet it'd get 3X as many American views if it had a catchier title.  "Who's Your Daddy?" - Americans would understand [and click on] that right away.
I knew it was #5.  Her intro had the most background; plus, it seemed very sincere. Then, at the start of Round 3, she really looked tired of playing the game (which is what I'd expect from a real parent).  #2 was a pretty convincing actor, though.
Cool 😎
ezikiel from fuck youuuu clip???
4
It was so obvious it was her lol... when she give his name it give it away.
I can't deal with dude saying at 12:21 "Injustice league" bro!
Isn't it like weird for the actual parent listening in on multiple fake stories about there actual child xD
4
Number 4
It’s the mom ( this is before they announce who it is )
Also I hoppe Ziggy adopts the nick-name Hanza for life
i think it’s 4
the women
eeeeeeehhhhhhhh......Hamza🤣
Who came here after AJ's vid?
ITS FOUR
Wait so does that mean that number 2 is the best child predator out there?
i thinks its the girl with glasses
It’s the number 4 guy
Knew she was the mom as soon as she gave the meaning behind his name Ezekiel & the circumstances it was given to him; certain things you wouldn't joke about
Broooo, Hamza?😭
2
I feel bad for. The old mad.aka.Einstein. they were like straight up making fun 😢😂
number 1 should be a member of beta squad
4 :)
Before the answers I say it’s Einstein   Edit: I was indeed wrong 💀💀💀😭
Nah but Mumzys a baddie 😂👏
It's the dad
IT'S THE LADY
havent even watched the whole video and i know its the girl on the right, you could tell she 100% was telling you a story that was real
I was right
It’s the dad  …fuck
MAN SAID HAMZA LMFAOAOAOA
She said Zay because she went to say Ziggy and Favourite at the same time bros
it's so funny when you rewatch the episode knowing who the parent is LOL
When the parent was about to reveal"you get back, you get back" 😂😂😂ainstein was a troll till the end
ziggy's mum lowley looks like clhoe 'the detective' from lucifer
زقي
Ziggy is violating Niko in the first 15 seconds!
#4
i dont know it is yet but im gonna say 4 edit: bro i was wrong
I thought 4 snd 5 were the parents. The man said the dandee D.O.B
MY NAME IS HAMZA AND I WAS LITERALLY DYING OF LAUGHTER BECAUSE LIKE THE HUMOUR IS AMAZING IM A BIG FAN AND I WISH FOR YOU TO JUST NOTICE ME!!!!
From when she said yammed I know she had a black husband 🤣
its the black man with the swan story
4
Haven’t finished the vid, think it’s the second to last guy, and the lady next to him is prob telling stories about her real kids and just saying it was Ziggy
when my guy comes out with hamza lmao
Lol knew it was her because my mom is always mixing up our names when calling us, so it seemed normal to me.
Time stamp 4:08
BRO MY NAME IS ALZO HAMZA
I was almost certain that it was 4
Lol it was so obvious from the beginning it was number 5  10:08 -10:11 They literally have the same face  All her answers before the "slip up" were so much better than everyone else's   She says he was called Ezekiel because its a Bible name and then a couple answers later she says her husband is called David... another Bible name  And when talking about the chocolate cake she said he "yamed" it down. Nobody with that accent is using that vocab unless their partner is black 😂  Also 13:46 her face when aj swore  When they voted her out i shook my head in disbelief 😭
Umm I think she is the mum actually wait nvm I think that it is the dad. Wait nope never mind it's the mum. Wait arghhhhhh idfk. (I DONT F*CKING KNOW)
Bro Ziggy is the next generation of the new BetaSquad.
Definitely Defo the last guy
21:07 I think it’s the other girl you voted out
i think number 4
When AJ swore I noticed how the way she was looking down (like she really didn't want that to be said Infront of the kid but tried to tolerate it) which made me really think she's the one.
i thought it was 4 at first now i think it’s 2
I knew it. They have the same eyes.
no 2 is the parent
I’m a 9 years old and I watch sidemen and y’all so I don’t know who ziggy watches 😂
I was convinced that it was 2😭😭
They where lying it was Einstian
Number 4
before I see who the parent is I think it's  oj matthew I'm at 21:02
5 I guess
my guess is the white woman or the first woman in line with the glasses.
5, edit  called it, from the moment she said about his friends and his toys
Wow
13:34 omg I'm dying of laughter 😂
His name is Hamza lmao
boy
I think its two
Is it just me but I feel like this is scripted
is this fun to laugh over elder people? I thought you are okay. Turns out you bunch of lazy and crazy boys
It must feel rlly weird for adults to claim this random kid is theirs 😂
I was born on 8 of january
tbh i have no clue who the parent is
the white mum
From the early beginning I knew who was the parent. Read the comment further, but spoiler alert:       - first guy was totally clue less - 2 contestant was too cold. I havent felt the love - No 3 doesnt know his name - No 4 is not a father. A father of 3 like I am can tell you immediately - No 5 is a typical mixed race relation woman, she was acting a little, which made it hard to believe, but as someone who knows a little Arabic, I knew that the name literaly meant what she said. You cant come up with Hebrew skills from nowhere.  And, yeah, I know, its a little rascist to call out a girl for jeing mixed race potential, but its nothing negative. Its just as a foreigner I always had to check which girls do like us... and I have a sensor for it
Nice and funny very 🤣 funny
The reaction from the doctor😂😂😂
I KNEW IT!!!!
I think it's the lady that i Has black hair and white t-shirt
999999999 DAY TO FIFAA

The lady has to be the mom 😅
I knew she was the mother from the 1st story she gave...
How you guys get this aidia ❤❤❤😂

I know it was her yess
So 1…I live Ziggy sssoooo much (school counselor and mom of 5 boys)… and 2… I’m never coming to London without my husband, lol!
If it’s not this black man…. He could have conned me out of my whole coo. Like… please let it be 4
niko better be the father
Sorry but one said octopus prime and she said thanks hunny the picture though

Y’all at 6 mil🎉🎉🎉 ok so who’s having the kid
Ziggy's reaction to his mom talking about the teddy bear gave it away for me hahaha
I knew it was her from his body language when his mommy started speaking ❤
Kenny’s face at the reveal 🤣
I think it’s oj
Nice
I literally knew it. Her stories flowed the best and when she said it wasn’t rly his favorite toy he proved it by selling it to a stranger for 10 pounds 😭. But they voted her off for accidentally saying Zay
I think 4 ngl
i knew she was the mother cause her story were very real she really didnt have to think about it like the rest
from the beginning i was convinced it was gonna be number 4 omg
The hamza made me have no breath for 15 seconds straight
It was the way the mum and kid spoke/sounded similar that gave it away to me, when he said “it’s a blimming tiger” I was like yehhhh it’s her
I knew it lol
I think 4
Number 2
I think number 4
DUDE THAT WAS LITERALLY SO HARD TO GUESS

Honestly, I think its #4
I KNEW it was number 5 . she just seemed the most like his mom
i said it since the start
Exuse me what who is having a child wait what what is happening
How did no one notice that ziggy was nodding his head when his mum was talking
I honestly think its 4, the way he kept looking at ziggy while reading the note. but i think it was 5 as she said hes not attached to his toys then like 5 mins later he sold it lol
I think is the Dad
no matter how many times i watch this video i keep thinking the Mathew guy is the parent
I bet chunkz has a problem with number 1 💀
Bro i felt like number 3 hated being there and when he left he look pissed off💀
4
The way Niko played rock paper scissors with Ziggy on the side, That was so flippen cute🥺
Mom
The one in the Black jacket is the dad. He grinned in the beginning at ziggy too as number 1 tried to introduce Ziggy. Also at the heartbreaking story from the einstein guy.
kenny is having a child
Best collab ever. Beta squad ft. Albert Einstein himself
BRO THE HAMZA IS SENDINGG MEE 😭
I really thought he was number 4
When he said fuck … u can ez see who the parent was

i low key thought it was 2 until they asked the best friend question and she said Elliott? And his names Ezekiel? Ezekiel Elliott? NFL player? The Cowboys?
How dare you my name is Hamza I am Egyptian
Amen 🙏 God Please bless everyone reading this and/or praise you in Jesus name, amen.
I mean I felt like #3 was not his dad but I feel bad for him And I don't like how you guys are making fun of him Albert Einstein
NIKO IS HAVING A BABY!
14:33 *OCTIMUS PRIME>OCTOPUS PRIME>OPTIMUS PRIME*
The way my jaw dropped i really believed it was the guy at the end 😮😮
The way the mom says its not hes favorite toy currently hahahah the next second ziggy just sold the toy hahahah
SHARKY IS A FATHERRRR
It’s the man at the end
I thought it was obviously number five because the mother had a bit of a posh accent just like the little boy
It’s the man trust me ☝️   Never mind
Number 4
Dude in the blue at the start was massively annoying
I want to date number 1 cause he can’t lie
#4 is the dad! He wrote to the sun!
I was convinced it was 5
Id say 4 is the dad
The mommmmm
Who's having a kid in beta squad ?? 😂
I knew it since the first round!!!
9:44 WHEN BRO STARTED PLAYING ROCK PAPER SCISSORS WITH ZIGGY😭
Number 4 was so convincing 😭😭😭
6th Millionth subscriber!! 🥳
I think it’s the woman/girl
Does anyone know the insta from number five  Wanna follow her
Yay I got it right my opinion she has the same facial features
Shoutout my boi Hamza
Why he looks like niko
I knew it was between #4 and the actual mom cause the other 2 guys had horrible stories and the other woman said something about cockroaches and Ziggy seemed too put together to be dealing with cockroaches in his home
smash. next question
I think it’s oj 😋😋 (before I watched the whole vid)
the einstein guy's name was IQTEDAR KHAN , you guys made it up too bad bro !!!!!!
did anyone else know because they were wearing very similar jackets
number 4 was obviously the dad
I FREAKING KNEW SHE WAS THE MOTHER!!!!!!
beta squad on point recently
It was quite obvious the mum said that te kid does t like the toy that much and he switches it up sometimes. Then the kid sold the toy for 10
They both look like the parents of Ziggy or Ziggi😭😭
6:35 LMAOOOOO IM DEAD😭😭😭😭😭
I think it's number four
Literally too obvious after the amp cussed u can tell she was the only one dissatisfied. While the others not even caring
5
I’m confused when aj said to sharky you already have one (child)
The parent .i can guess this onr.
when aj said "HAMZA?" at 4:17 i died of laughter🤣💀
For the algorithm
They have the same accent, knew immediately lol
sharky tf u saying pefrect for when the kid said he was 8
HIS NAME IS HAMZA AHAHAHAHHAHAHA yoooooooooooooooo
You guys are the Beatles of youtubery. ;-)
I think it’s number 2???
i think its number 4 tho 😭
I knew it was her!
ngl ik i'm a bit late but i thought it was number 5 i was right :)
It’s Nikos son
It's defo number 4 they look so similar  HELL NAW IT WAS 5
I think the mum and dad is 4-5
It’s the leather jacket guy
I think its four
numer 4
At 22:46 they both take defensive pauses. One with hands in their pockets the other one with arms crossed protecting his genitalia😅. They're both not the parents.
"octopus prime" lol
The childs English gave it away, very well spoken. Pair it with the most well spoken guest, aka 5.
I think number 5 is the real parent
That older guy gets the best hair award
I think it’s number 4. Right from the beginning of the show. Number 5 had me reconsidering tho
it’s sharky or kenny having a kid
The mum was so obvious they had the exact same posh accent 😭
I think it's number 4.
i knew it was the white woman
This is my prediction it is only round 2 so if I'm wrong I'm wrong but I'm almost 100% sure BC everyone has slipped up
white girl
Bro I swear I knew it was her😭
Thought it was 5
I knew it was #5, same eyes… face basically same features.
Why was he acting so bad to the old man
i think is four
Was pretty obvious from the start, he's quite well spoken and she was the only one who was well spoken there (not being bigoted there, just people tend to emulate their parents speech to an extent)
I felt like she was the mom because every time someone talked about Ziggy, she kinda looked like "the heck they gonna say now"
I knew it was #5 from her accent. It was very similar to Ziggy's accent
He might grew up and become king of kingdom
Bro literally says I think number 4 is the father so they count it as if he said number 4 isn’t the father
ho2 do i fix my2 2keyboard the button 2 popped ou2t2 an2d took 222over 2my keyboard and no92 i cant play video game2 and i can hardly a2tch t2uff ho92 do i fix thi2 i al2o cant type a22nymore cuz of thi2 ho92 do i fix thi2 bull2hit
I’m surprised they didn’t get it 😭 that’s also why he sold the toy so quick. Kids get attached to teddy bears. Even if it’s getting beaten up. 🧸
I think it’s the woman that had 4 kids because the others stories was just to perfect
4
Thought it was the white woman but she overacted and the remaining guy was authentic. Felt the connection (commenting before I found out). 1st instinct was right and I was led astray. She was his mother.
MILF
I knew she was the mom when Ziggy reacted after she told the story of him being caught in the fridge was it😅
I paused it, i think its the girl
4
Like it was obvious she was the mom, didn't u see them copying everything she was saying
The black guy with a beard is gonna win
Number 4
Hi
I knew she was the mother when she explained the meaning of the name
I think number 5 is the mum. I'll update u
its 4
it was so obvious it was her the whole time cause her son speaks the exact same as her
these guys would annoy me so much if I had to talk to them
Its the guy and i still didnt finish the video but that women is doing the most plus her confidence is giving side role actress …hope am right though🫠
I think its the dad whos the real parent at the end.
why he keep on calling it the injustice leaugue💀
Oj i think is dad
its the dad.
4
KNEW IT WAS HER
The black woman
NGL she sounded so confident that I thought she was a very good actor
The parent is probably kenny or chunkz
hamza killed me
einstein
Did chunks get it right?? I agree it’s four
Love it ❤❤❤❤
I noticed that the 4th guy is not the parent he said he was 37 and had ziggy at 28 which makes him 9, but he's 8
I bet sharky will be a dad?.
i think its the dad/the dude on the right during the time of 2 ppl left
Number 4
Commenting before the reveal. I think it’s the mum
21:17 4
it’s def the older woman, they even look similar😂
Sharky "how old are you Ziggy" Ziggy "8" Sharky "8 ok, Perfect"
Last women is beautiful
Number 4
I was right!
I was dying after #1 accidently called the boy Hamza during his story , and with how much he floundered after lol
The mom kinda…
i think it is 2
#justicetofinland
he kept nodding with her lmaoo
17:50 lol
its obviously the black woman in the white sweatshirt
If it ain’t No 4...
4 is dad
it’s number 4 trust
Ziggy’s Mom is fine asf
I knew she was the mom the way she assumes stuff for him. My mom does the same thing 😂😂😂😂
white people watching be getting jealous                                 hahahahaha
Br9 it is the mom😮😮😮😮😂
I knew it!!!
Woman
I knew it from the start dawg😭 her story’s were so real💀
the woman that has glasses
23:48 THE SILENCE
I know who’s having a child
I’m ziggy best friend I’m heartbroken😂lmao
Black mom😂
I think it’s the man cuz he say the real name or ziggy and that’s why I think it’s him
I Think number 4 is his dad
I am commenting before thee final reveal I promise… Ok I think the man is his dad, and thee lady is his aunty or something… yea, the lady is a relative for sure. Either that or the other way round. But for sure doggy’s parent is btwn these last two
I'm here after just dying of laughter from "HEEEEEEEEY go join him right now, go join him right nooow" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 YASS!
2
Him selling the toy makes me feel like his mom was number 5 and they kicked her out🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️😂
Zay is probably a nickname for him so I immediately from the start knew she was his parent
I think 5 is the mum!
i knew it was number 5. the stories, name and what she said about the toy sold me it was obvious from the start
Kenny is probably the one having a child
the letter sounded like her
its defo the white women they voted off
SPOILER ALERT  I just knew she was the one when she was telling that coach story and Ziggy looks so guilty while listening... &&& it seems like he doesn’t care about the story of others. Number 4 was pretty convincing ngl, since the first round.
I was right number 5 is the mum 😂😂 I could tell straight away.
I think the mum is number 5.
I said it fuking hell man bro is 8 obviously the mom will be young that women looks 45 ffs she said the toy isn't important to him AND HE SOLD IT literally 5 seconds after and it didn't click in their brains PLUS sharky was dismantling his toy and he didn't even seem to care says alot init (She even looked so angry at the end because they voted her out plus zay could be another nickname or another childs name parents often mix up there children)
i don't get this series because if the mom wins they wouldn't get anything right but when someone else wins they get 1k so why the real one try thsi hard they should just get out in the first round and let the others win the game
they didn't gave the 4 his money he won the round
fun to watch
They’re so stupid they have the same accent, and she was so believable even I knew lol
FOUR IS MY GUESS 21:17
"his name is Humz"
He kinda looks like niko
I`t is nomber 4
I KNEW ITTTT
How do you all educate children?
Let's gooooo dragon ball 4 life 12:03
I knew it let’s goo
when number 1 accidentally called him hamza 😭
honestly I thought it could've been either one of the women. number 4 wasn't convincing bc he kept say dc dc . real suspicious
i think it’s 2
ziggy's got bants you know
I knew it
BRO I KNEW IT WAS NUMBER 5-
6:33 I’ve laugh so hard that my spirit goes out jsjsjsjajas
4
CHUNKS IS HAVING A BABY
4
I KNEW IT!!
I knew she was the mom
Bro the the last parent the woman
Bruv this was intense mannn😂😂😂😂😂😂
The man oj
you could just see his reactions when his mom told the story
I knew it was her 100%
Niko casually playing rock paper scissors with ziggy
4
The fact number one said he got him in 2016 and said ziggy birthday was in 2015 of January 😅
i knew it omgggg
Number 2
I honestly thought number four was the father, He said his real name first, but number 5 was very convincing too.
easy it’s 4
The woman
His name is Hamza😂😂😂😂😂😂
Definatley Einstein
After the rock paper scissors ✂️, it gave away the supposed winner ,… but I knew the lady was the mother after he sold his “ favorite toy” for £10 lol
i could tell it was her from the start from the accent
All the other parents were trying to show how much the toy meant to him by connecting it with what they chose as his favorite show while she just said it like it was it doesn’t mean that much to him then right after he sold it it’s all the proof you need
Ziggy sounds straight outa harrypotter
"OJ?!" 😂💀
i thought it was 4😭
The guy bro
Black jacket
The moment he sold his favorite toy for 10 pound; it was 100% obvious that it was number 5.
HAMZA AHHAHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAA IM DECEASED
I knew it was her
imo 4 is the father but could be very wrong
i knew it was hern the whole way through
4
Her mom is leng th god damn
4
Props to the kid for just chilling for the shoot and props to Niko trying to entertain him 😂 rock paper scissors n shit 😂😂
It’s the guy
I thought it was number 5 from the beginning because she was using black people lingo and ziggy is mixed raced meaning her husband is black and she picks up language from him
I KNEWWW SHE WAS THE MUM THE WHOLE TIME LMAOOO
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT AT ALL😳
He looks exactly like his mom I wasn't interested in what they are saying the moment I saw that
drop the moms @ ; )
Guys, imagine Niko being Ziggy's father
Beo i knew it was her broo
I just waited for the moment, that it turns aroud, that his real name is Hamza
This one is mad, right at the end I was feeling so indecisive about whether it was the woman or the guy, not even considering that the parent had already been sent out, I was so convinced and now my heads fucked😂. This one was hard.
"this isnt marvel  its a blimmin tiger " lol
parent 2
Parent 3 seems sad bro got madr fun of so hard and got voted first he looked so disappointed
Full of zest😂
The mum
I think number 4
i thinkits 4
I knew it was her from the start because the way she talks is so similar to Ziggy
Coldest "PLAY THE TRAILER" Ever... Big up Ziggy/Zay/ Humza
I have two sisters so my mom constantly says Hay-! Ah…!- Hayley… no JESSICA
The mom😊
enstien
I was certain it was 2 thoooo
It’s number 4 I’m sure
Hamza😂
"I think we're doing a great job lads" - right after they voted out the actual parent 💀
Kid knows about inflation. Smart boy
4
There were several tells that told me that it was number 5.  1)If you pay attention at 9:15 as number 5 was telling the story ziggy affirms with his body language. But they didnt see it.  2)I have decent facial recognition. So no matter haw i looked at it i could only see number 5 in ziggy out of all the contestants.  3) when she messed up his name, it felt real. Like she had done that before. I remembered she said she had 4 kids. And most people who have simbling or multiple kids can attest to having their name mixed up or mixing their kids names up. It happens all the time.   4) number 5 said it wasnt really ziggys favorite toy. Then soon after he sold the toy. That told me everything i need to know.
10:44 just said my birthday 😭
The mam
This thumbnail is really sus
I called it
Super wholesome video, thanks for the whole Beta Squad for videos like that :) I actually thought that it was the OJ who was his father and was in the complete shock when Ziggy’s mom revealed herself  Great video again
I think it is the woman who called him a guy
It wouldn’t be a beta squad video without a old person🙏🤷‍♀️
That girl is gonna be mummy
i’m at 6:08 it’s kenny he’s the dad
the lady in the white is doing too much with the "she has a sweet tooth" thought that immediately and niko said the same thing, fasho the geeza.
Hamza had me dying bro 🤣🤣🤣
Number 1 is dreamybull
The last lady, it has to be her.
It was too obvious 😅
I think it is #2
number 4
I feel like it was 5
i think chunks is a new parent
When the mom brought up the teddy he couldnt sleep with, he was fidgeting around thinking mom why'd you say thaaat
I knew it was number 5 cause she looks just like ziggy
the 4 is the parent
They should do one where they have to choose who is their mother but put all relatives up against each other to make it more difficult
The lady
It’s 100% the lady I can’t believe the man hasn’t been voted out yet 😮
i knew it
4
Eienstien a victim 💀
Its niko
It was so obvious
For Oj i knew he was lying staright away when he said his age then the age he had it, he said 28 when he had him but 37 minus 8 is 29
I think it was the white lady that messed up in the past with zay Edit: I knew it I freaking knew it 🥹😭
The guy
CONGRATS🎉 CHUNKS IS PREGNANT 🎉😊❤
As Sharky said, I stopped and my guess that dad is Sharky :) If you know what I mean
1
Bro injustice league
4 is the dad
Hamza tho😂
When i saw his mums face when she was voted off I could see the disappointment and that made me think she was his real mum.
Hamza
Paused at 21:08 I think it's the man because she is trying hard to persuade you when she didn't need to
4
4
Sharks said perfect when sight said 8 😂😂😂
It's not hictor dahl.... it's Iqtadar khan actully 😂😂
'AZNEE' 😂
it was def number 5, when she slipped and called him Zay, that should’ve been more of an indicator tbh bc moms have multiple nicknames for their kids
His name is Hamza 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
they all said some lies about the toy, she said he isn’t attached lol it’s too much of a risk tbh that’s how i know she’s the real parent
the parent of the beta squad is probably kenny he is more manly
i think it was the white shirt woman
All I want is a Chunkz freekick in Ted Lasso... can I get an Ameeeeeen
17:04 great vote
21:03 i think it's #2.   [SPOILER AHEAD]      Edit after seeing the video: NAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH, THAT'S MENTAL, THAT'S CRAZY, THAT'S JAW-DROPPING, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, THAT'S CAP, THAT'S BRAINIAC, THAT'S UNBELIVABLE.
Ziggy and his mum look so similar, that birth story aswell was too in debt, obvious from the start man😂
It's the man
As soon as she told football story and he hiding his face i knew she was the mother
I'm at the end , I think it's the lady that's the mother 🤷‍♀️  Edit: Last minute,  thinking it's 4 😅 I'm struggling Edit : I found out who it is, and my jaw dropped 😭 She messed up on the name and I just felt like she was good with making stuff up on the spot and she was very controversial with everything too ..
bruh it says on google chunkz is havng a kid lmao
It’s A FLipPing TiGEr
I was convinced it was number 4 till the end 💀
I think it's the white young lady. She seemed confident when she spoke
I think it’s the black guy
its number  3 MR KHAN and hamza
😂 spoiler alert 5 is the parent
0:10
Kenny prob the one with the kid
I skipped the whole thing when she said 'yammed the whole thing' - insstantly knew her man was black and that that was her kid.
23:42  The best reaction in this series till now
nothing tops the find the black guy video but this one pretty up there. Hamza part almost made me pee on my pants.😂🤣🤣🤣
All the lads are going to make such great dads, this was so sweet to watch. From Niko talking to Ziggy and playing rock, paper, scissors to the guys censoring their language around him. Such great guys 🥰🥹
DreamyBull?
Is no one gonna talk about the absolute resemblance with the parent. Look at the eyes and nose and tell me it's not identical
5
I don’t know why but I feel like it’s the man. I feel like his poem was more touching yk as if he’s speaking from experience but at the same time I’m doubting maybe he’s tryna sugar coat the truth but also the woman was telling a story which I kinda find off cause why would u lose ur kid every mother knows to not but maybe it actually is her I’m so confused. Future me?
I knew it from the start
I'm lowk thinking it's the guy ngl, number 4
defo niko's yute
the black lady
they already voted out the mom fr thats my prediction
ok but AJ just said "you're already have one" sharky "don't say that"
i read all the body language of all of them, totally knew that girl was the mom from the beginning. She's the only least suspicious by reading on her body language when she interrogation with them. However, The other fake parent has giving an obvious body language from the started and till the end.
Lmao they put Hictor Dahl its meant to be Iqtidar, I got the credentials to say that
4
Number 4
idk man number 4 sounds so promising
Ziggy don’t about nobody
i think its  the guy
4
father 4
No1 is the parent
One of the beta squad members was hitting that bunda man
I think it’s the lady in the white turtle neck
hes da dadda
the man
i think it was the guy
It’s Aj 🤰🫃
I honestly think it’s the dude with a white T-shirt and black jacket😊
Him selling his "favorite toy" after she's the only one that says it's not that important to him was a give away tbh
Someone's from somalia 🇸🇴
number 4
What’s the moms @ 😏
comment for algorithm
When your name is humza😮😮😮😮
Its defo Chunkz he looks a little pregnant
2
25:12 I ALWAYS HAVE THE HIGHEST TIME
I like how nico and ziggy did rock ,paper sis or shoot
OMDS THAT WAS SUCH A PLOT TWIST 😭
i still find it so funny that niko looked the most like ziggy
Yooo I thought she was lying too 😂
definitely sharky having a kid mark my words if im wrong il give 150 dollars to who ever replies to who ever lieks my comment
I knew it
ITS SHARKYYYYY! HES THE ONE HAVING THE BABY!
BRUV they just gave away whos having a CHILD!
It’s Kenny for sure
The fifth one was so damn obvious bro
bruh i thought black parents = black kids
||||
I wish no. 5 wasnt the parent because that would have been a fabulous performance.
Parent 2 is the parent I think
she leng as
It was very obvious when she said her husbands name was David after all the religious talk
24:16 I didn’t even know AJ was there until he spoke lol
Her story about how he was names was what did it for me. i was like woahhh either she one hell of a story teller or shes really his mom
I thought it was her the moment she explained his name.
i think its 2
half of the comments be like “omg I knew it, why are they so stupid” 💀😂
bro its einstein hamza g
I have the same story as #2😭…well my mom does I woke up on the side of the and wall and my couldn’t find me
1
BRO I KNEW IT
The suspense is killing me but I think it’s number 4
As soon as she said the meaning behind his name, I knew it was her.
I cant tell if the child thing is a joke or not😂  But if its not it 100% kenny
I think it 5
i think the black women is the mother
foc is pronounced as fuck. its fire in catalan
I thought it was both at the end like I didn’t know
They said no white people allowed 😂
4
Number 2
Niko is having the child
in the second round while the first guy was talking it was too halarious
Number 1
I KNEW IT WAS 5, cause she said that its not really his favorite toy and he gave it away for 10£ and that he has a sweet tooth and he said he was gonna buy sweets
I knew it and the moment he sold his favorite toy that she said wasn't his favorite solidified my answer.
lol!
Lets go hamza
The woman for sure
I knew that was his mom!!! Omg ❤❤
Was there a shoe around min4
That Hamza came out of nowhere 😂
sharky is having a kid aj spoiled it now you dont have to wait until 6 mil thanks me later
Ik it
Doggy was agreeing with the chocolate cake story gave it away
from the very start i thought it was 5 but then it changed to 2 when she got picked out
I KNEW IT
2
i believe is number 4
Guys is it for real when they say one of the beta squad members are becoming a parent or are they capping as usual 😭
Guys, imagine Niko being Ziggy's father
WHEN I HEARD NUMBER 5 SAY HER ANSWER I WAS LIKE "hmmmmmmmmm kinda wayyy into detail though-" when she stutter i was like maybe its not her...
I thought it was 2.
I TOLD YAAAAAAA
lady or previous people, the other guy is too devious
fkkkkk
Im actually very close with Ziggy’s family and have known them my whole life. We watched Fee and her husband get married in the church we attended and ended up having 4 beautiful and smart children, the third being Ziggy. They are honestly the most wonderful loving down to earth people which me and my parents practically consider as family ourselves☺️  With that in mind, it was absolutely hilarious watching this. Hamza!😂
Ziggy’s mom is a smokeshow
2
12:s3 AJ got me with the good numbers
Don’t make the Jamaican come out😂❤️🇯🇲
nah i was fully convinced that oj was the dad u know 😭😭
number 2 was doing too much during this whole video 😭
the dad
22:42 He said that he thinks number 4 IS the father, and you put a vote on him?
2
Hahaha me interesan mucho tus videos como me gustaría estar ahí tío 😂😂 venir a Nicaragua
I knew it
no 4
I freaking knew it was five,you know how fast and angry I'm typing this right know cause I knew it was her even though she was eliminated her story was just so so so so convincing
4
icl when beta squad hit 6mil the child will be already born
I still think it’s 3….
I think 2
4
its definitely the black lady
Knew it from the beginning and it is Chunk's fault u lost ngl
It is number 5 - easy u all dumb
I KNEW IT!! I SWEAR ON MY MUM I SAID NUMBER 5
Ziggy we have the same birthday!
its Niko
i think kenny or chunkz might be having a baby
19:49 (if aj wasnt lying) thx 4 the early suprise editors 💀
I was shook on this one
4 def
HAMZA 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Niko short from Nicoleta, hahha
The guy is probably the dad of the kid
2
2
my thought is the lady
aj saying he forgets people are human is hilarious
4
yeah they waffled this one hahahaa
I knew Chunkz was Preg
Bro is it the women
The man
“How old r u “ “8”  “Perfect” 🤔🤔🤔
We got 3 squads  1.Sidemen 2.Beta Squad 3.Amp
4
Bro i was so convinced on number 2 😭
I can’t be the only that thought Ziggy’s mom was gorgeous
Hamzaaaaaa 😂😂😂
we need 6 million subs to see the child guys
Chris has really really changed chandler is still chandler he is the og it’s just sad to see that they divorced wasn’t Chris a Christian?-
God loves y’all and giving your life to Jesus Christ is the best thing ever and so is being a Christian and so is talking to Him and seeking Him daily
My instincts were telling me it’s either two or five…
plot twist the cameraman is the parent
I was sure from the first moment he spoke that it was number 4, he just seemed so convincing in yeah yeah that's my son. He is a great actor
"I forgot people are human" So real
as soon as i saw that child selling his fav toy i knew the girl was his mom couse she said hés not that much into that toy . but nbr 4 was really good
My dirty mind is going places  8:58
19:48 Sharky 👀
Omg, how did they mess this up, it was obvious😂
*Hamza!* 😂😂😂😂
3 \
do more videos like that.
alright well apparently im ziggy’s best friend
Number 2 really convinced me with the 'sweet tooth' and Ziggy saying he'll spend the £10 on sweets right after
A child full of Zest
ziggy's mom actually so pretty ngl
No2
i knew it !!!
Number 4
I think neeko is the mother
I think five was actually his mom
i reckon its the mum
shoutout Callux 💀
KENNYS FACE AT THE END HAHAHAHHA
need more like these, these are the only ones I watch, the best ones where you gotta guess too
It’s the dad
I knew she was the mom from the beginning! The story about how Ezekiel was born sold me. I as a mom can never play the stress if having a baby. And she sold me plus I call my son different names lol it's Bubba, Boobie, Joe Joe or Emanuel
So racist
He look like his mom
Nah when number 4 started copying the same path as number 2 when describing why that’s his favorite toy I knew it wasn’t him. He just went with it
I knew she was the parent when she was surprised by what toy he chose.😅😊 funny show
I feel it’s the first just cause he did the calculations right zingy said he was 8 first guy said he was 24 had him at 16 his calculations were correct everyones else was off when they asked for his birth they all said 2014 and really the first guy said 2015 which if you do the math 2023 minus 2015 equals 8 also he got his name right at first so my guess is the first guy before I find the answer I GOT IT WRONG 😭
As a Mother..... we all call our kids the wrong name... even my own mother
You could tell just by the accents
It's number 4 because Einstein called him Humza and his name is
I knew it I even said it had to be her after she was out
I knew it was that lady
Defo true👍🏽
It’s definitely  Kenny cuz AJ set him up with a gall and he wants 13 kids so he has to start early
man
it's defo number 4 or 5 I first said 4
OMG, who is the beta squad parent???
Ziggy was at points giving it away cuz when his mum was telling a story he started smiling
i knew it was her because when she said that's he doesn't  have a favorite toy and its more of teddies THEN he traded it for the 10 THAT easily
2
hamza uno 😂😂😂😂 that finished me
Ziggy”8” sharky “perfect😈”
The white lady did a good job
I knew it was number 5 when she said ziggy wasn’t attached to the toy, and he proved her right since he sold it immediately after to Niko 😂😂😂
Ziggy is not mix race
The police should do this to find kidnappers or something
the mum in white hoodie
You could tell the way he was very well spoken - like his mum. That’ was the giveaway…
4
I thought it was her too, until she fumbled
ramadan kareem
Chunkz do be looking round in the belly, I think he is the pregnant one.
I FUCKING KNEW IT
0:10
Ziggys mum is leng
Every time I whacht bate squad they always make fun them
It the dad for sure  Edit F*ck
The fact that the first person kept trying to prove that Ziggy was his kid after call him Hamza, that's determination right there
LOL i dont know why but DID U SAY NIKOLETTA ,but thats a girls name got me 🤣🤣
I think #4 or #5 is the parent.
When she said ziggy wasn't massively attached to the toy and he sold it for a tenner I knew fosho it was her
Guys are very disrespectful to the parents.., 😞
ain't no way its not both of em
That was a nice vid
anyone know the song AJ sings at 6:45 i remember it was the beginning of a woman singing. it was old scool genre
Niko is a parent in the pic
I knew the mom was number 5 I called it the moment ziggy shook his head up and down when she was talking
PLEASE PEOPLE GET YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILIES, EVERYONE TO SUBSCRIBE. I WANT TO KNOW IF ONE OF THEM ARE TRULY ABOUT TO BE A DAD.❤❤❤
I had my suspicion it was the white woman when she defined his name. My name is also Ezekiel, so I know. Also they have that same shy smile. But when she slipped up and called him Zay, I knew it was her without a doubt. If it wasn't her, #4 was my second choice.
3! 🫢
It’s number 2
i was so confident it was guy #4 i’m in shock rn
Yall are bad at this
19:21 full of zest is crazy
Because of number 4 smiling when hearing the other stories he had me convinced 100%
How can ziggy say I’m 8 and sharky say cool perfect 💀💀💀
''its a blimming tiger'' HIS ACCENT IS SO CUTE OMDS
i think its number 2
My nan still
The five contestants Mum Dad Aunt Uncle Crazy Grandad
Old lady
I'm not a racist but there is only one white person in this whole video... Unless it is illegal to say that
still think its Albert
It was so funny when Ziggy said that Nikotella is girl's names. 😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
dad
I knew it
Tbh I thought Niko was the parent
NO WAY
Dude
Girl in white shirt
I think 4 is the real parent
Bro I knew the the white girl seemed too real
Pedafiyle vibes from trunks when he said how old you and ziggy said 8 and trunks said perfect ayo
I think it’s the white girl
I think it was Hamza- I mean Einstien
4
21:04 the lady
It’s fiddy baby’s 😂😂😂
Bad video idea, put a bunch of black people in a room and tell them there is one white person among them and they have to find out the imposter.
Thats the most obv one come on guys its gotta be XD
its the black girl
I knew it was her
4
I think it is #2
i knew she was the mum
broooooooo i guessed that it was either number 4 or number 5 at the beginning and when she messed up and said "za" i still thought it might've been her cuz like its a small accident
wtf is this
octopus prime killed me 😭
0:38 Perfect?? 😭
i think its 2
I knew it
when aj said you are not the farther to number five i was drinking cola and i laughed so violently it went up my throat
Sidemaen should do 5his too 😂
19:19 bro aint no way he said that about some random kid
1:04 *alright my names lawrence I'm 24 erm I had ziggy when I was 16*WOAH ok*it's possible*yeah ofc it is yeah my mum had me when she was sixteen hahaha*he's like that ain't my daddy haha*why's this guy lying man*I've done alot in the the past that you know that um*what you regret?* No he that's he's someone ive ..I've not regretted him*No erm he taught me to be a better man* ☺️☺️☺️🤗🤗🤗🤗😊😊😊😊 this is sweet but some of it I was a bit sussed out about
Dad
I knew it.
4
5 !!!!!
I think the chocolate cake story and the teddy bear favourite toy were so cliche which made me not think it was her
Im guessing that it’s number 2
wow, I really thought it was two.
I guessed right from start, but number 4 was throwing me off a lot!
They did her dirty bro 😂 Imagine being there watching some man make a poem for ur son 💀💀🙏
Ziggy selling his "favourite toy", should've proved the mother was right about him not being attached to it.
wait how did you get the child without knowing his parents kidnapper💀💀
simply life changing video
i swear to god  actually called it, idk why i just felt it
Imagine using this video as a way for a father you went to get the milk to meet his kid this way
I still say it's number 4
Man said Hamza 😂😂😂😂😂
I was so sure about 4
You guys take so long to upload
Ziggy stole the show bro
It’s 2 fr
i think 4
Actually remember a swan biting my finger when I was 4 years old. I’m just there and I gave it my finger lol
I well couldn’t decide between 4 and 5
Bro Einstein turned up at the wrong shoot and just started waffling
5
I think its 4😊
four
2
The man
You know beta squad should recreate their fist video together
I knew it was her the whole time, she spoking very knowingly, lovingly, and confidently
It’s Kenny
Hamza Yano 😂😂 icl that’s my name 😂
Think its the guy
I knew it was her. From her posture and and when she fumbled her words and said “za” her immediate reaction was like a weird sound which I sometimes make when I try to say words. I knew it from the start
Got to be number 4
This one was very obvious 😂 the other ‘parents’ answers were damn bad even until the final.
I only knew because the accent, and how easily he gave the toy up. What a sweet mother, your a lucky kid ziggy.
i know it from the moment she walked out
13:38 he goes fuck it’s so funny 😂
number 5
Please do find the gold figger with AJ
I fucking knew it from her first story
When is the next video coming out I want to find out who’s baby it js
the guy
Most definitely number 4
I CALLED THAT FROM ROUND 1! Hahahahaha. My kids are also biracial and I saw the bits of resemblance. And her answers were real stories, it was obvious.
Bro he litterly gave it away the black guy has a child when he said o want a child and aj said you already have one your welcome everyone
I think it’s the old woman not to be rude
Bruh I knew it from the beginning. She's the only one that looks like him and she talks posh like him. Edit: As soon as she said Zay that confirmed it for me thats some real mother nicknaming hahah
WHERE'S THE NEW VIDEO
Please guys please upload on time
THEY WAY YOU ALL STILL GOT IT WRONG LOLLLLL 🤣
Beta Squad are the goat 🐐
Congrats to however one of you is having the child 🎉🎉
NIKO

It has to be number 4
I think it is the girl
Number 4
“I forget people are human” Real
Well, the most clear signal was when they tell the stories, the child seems embarrased when the his mom started to talk about him in front of others.
I knew it was that lady when he sold his toy away
😂😂😂number 2 was propa

2

For a mother of 4 she kinda hot
MY BIRTHDAY IS AUGUST 28TH
am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you
Never mind play the trailer Upload the video

OH AND AJ I LOVE YOU 🤟 YOUR HEIGHT DOSENT MATTER
Ngl ;  Beta squad >>>>side men        Like my opinion . But I swear I’m true

I think it is the girl in the white sweatshirt. 21:06
I really think its 3!!
4
i think is 4
its number 5
so we are js ignoring the fact 1 of them is gonna be a father?congrats lol
5
You idiots are supposed to be uploading
Bro the ”YOU GET BACK” got my goofball dead💀
Aj i am after your mo
i wouldve guessed 5 as her stories felt true and when she said zay that couldve been a sibling of his
Beta Squad
number 2 is mum of ziggy aka hazma aka zay akz mini niko
2
I think it’s 4
The way I knew it was her, and then when they kicked her I was so mad 😭
AGAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
there late again with todays
I subscribed you because my friend showed me this episode and it was so funny " note that i knew who is the father "
I think it’s 4 and Hamza really Hamza out of all names.
4
https://youtube.com/shorts/3Q-Jl5u8KpU?feature=share
Im calling it just cause she's white they voted for her 😂😂😂😂😂
everyone unsubscribe so the child is postponed
No child favourite toy is Lego I knew it
I knew it. too bait
its the white lady. number 5 locked
i think its number 5 did u see ziggys reaction when she was talking about him storming off and crying about the football coach?
My mum used to call all her kids by another sibling's name all the time. That slip seemed genuine when mum called him Zay
21:02 I think it’s the guy, ngl the woman is trying too hard but between those two. HONESTLY THINK ITS THE GIRL U VOTED OUT. 23:51 NAH I KNEWW ITTTT I KNEW ITTTT
Bro my name is humza
Number 4
4 is definetely the dad
4
MegaTROOOOOON! 🤛
No side men were hurt during this video.
why was ther shoes at 3:58
Number 4 is the dad
Defo the man, he said ezikiel first
its number 4 lolol
Is it just me or did there accents sound the same 😂
As a Beta Squad fan I think Jidion, HP like the sauce and Filly would actually make the group more stronger to really topple the sidemen.
I think it’s number 4
none of them are the parents💀💀💀💀💀
I think number four is the parent  Edit: number 5 was my second guess she was real convincing
THE GUY AT THE END HIM STORY IS ALL REAL
😂😂
I knew it was her the moment I saw her eyes they look the same
Chunkz:what’s his name. Hictor Dahl khan:Ziggy khan. Chunkz:his names not ziggy is it. Hictor Dahl khan: his names hamza. 4:05 😂😂
The guy
4 21:14
I was thinking it the whole time I’m so good🎉
Niko playing with his younger self 9:45
"How old are you Ziggy?" "8" "Perfect"-Sharky💀
The whole premise of the video is  quite misleading. Any of the men could have contributed the male gametes that fertilized the egg and resulted in the child. It is extremely unlikely that the mother would be able to say which of the featured men, or any of the probably 15 others not shown, was the definitive contributor. And since the child is going to grow up without a steady male presence in the home anyway, and momma will pop out 7 or 8 siblings by 30 completely different men, it really is fundamentally futile to try and figure out who this child's "father" actually is.
the beta squad parent has to be sharky or kenny!
This shocked me
I knew it was the wyte lady the way she was talkin bout him reminded me of how my mom speaks bout my lil bro and I
4 ez
The first one looks like hes about to bus
i could tell by the voices, they both speak very well like they’re from the same household. same accent and everything
Hamza 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2
2
I think it's the woman in white
😩 pin me
I knew straight from the first 2 rounds that it was number 5 even though she fumbled on the round she got voted out. I dunno but I was never convinced that 2 or 4 were the parents
so sharky is having a kid
Hope y’all Have repented of your sins everyone ! Praise the lord Christ!
the reactions at the end are way more priceless than ten pounds
Great video idea never seen it done or milked for views 😊
the judges are kinda toxic
It’s 4
Bro the man said he was a single child and then started talking bout his younger brother how none on u realise that 😭
5
its that guy
Hamza I THINK HE IS THE ONLY ONE HOW CAN TAKE CARE OF A CHIELD
I think its 4
I new it was her
I knew it was number 5
I need mafia back asap
I think number 5 was the mom
Bring ziggy back guys bloody adorable
5
ONE OF THEM IS HAVING Q KID
It has to be 2
its the guy
In the beginning I thought no.5, then after Zay word, I thought number 4. Did same mistake as you guys.
Lady
Number 4
its einstein
I knew it was #5 from the start, her stories and answers were just so relatable. I could tell that the others were trying a little too hard to make up stories, though #2 was convincing. When you guys voted her out, I was like "There's going to be some karma." And sure enough...
Number 4 the lady
This is a sick idea lads great video
Spoiler Alert ‼️ close your eyes if you know how to read:  She says he doesn't really care about the toy... 5 seconds later he sells it for 10 pounds. All the proof you needed to know she was the mom.
i knew it
From one father to another Congratulations on your new born child or child to be 🎉❤
his mum is bare pretty icl
Beta squad they are so funny 🆒
Thank you for telling 👍
4
the man
#4….
Gotta be the guy in leather jacket
She was warred to name best friend in public .
Niko is ziggy dad plot twist 😂
Kenny messing up his final vote but constantly saying 5 instead of 4 and it was actually 5😂
OMG i was righttttt
I’m sticking with four, he is the father [edit] WHAT THE? SHE WAS THE LAST ONE I WAS THINKING OF
sharky: “eight, perfect” 😭crazy
its number 2
they all did very well but im gonna have to pick the one that look the mist legitimate too me Number 2
No one looks pregnant in beta squad
😊no actor
icl beta squad r the funniest ppl ever bc I feel like they don’t try
i think its nikos kid
I knew it was the white chick as soon as ziggy sold the toy to niko.
Its E=MC°
21:07 I think it’s number 5.
its Iqtadar Khan not Hictor Dahl Khan 😂
4
The mother looks exactly like Lauren German
Sharky and his child bride having a kid
i think its number four. and theres no doubt in that 21:03
number 4
FOUR
I think it's nr. 5 still 😂
That’s my name
i think its the lady
four is my guess, hes the dad
I think its the guy not the mum
Still think that 5 and 4 are both his parents. 5 defo his mum
Wow I can’t believe it was her?! 🤔🙊
dad
I think its Kenny
Did anyone realized that when they said *when we hit 6 million followers we will reveal who has a kid in the beta squad* *awhile later* AJ: I mean you have a child 😅
4
plot twist: its Niko's secret child
i thinnk it's number 4, number 2 kept strolling with her eyes
octopus prime...
The fact Beta Squad have a bigger bond with Ziggy than the actual parents. 😂
telling u now lad its the mum
STOP JUMPCUTTING IT'S SO ANNOYING, IT CUTS EVERY SECOND
Einstien
does beta squad merch
That was soo fantastic to watch honestly that made my dayy and I kneww she was the mom from the start but she played it off cool and low profile
Can we get mafia?
that was a tough gameee honetly thought number 4 had it
would we just ignore the fact that someone in beta squad is having a child ?? i just don't know who it could be.
5 is gorgeous
did anyone realise kenny barely spoke
i think number 2 is the mum :)
4😁
It is true that parents always mess up the names 😂 my mother sometimes calls me by her sisters name
No way i thought it was num2 though she was kinda doing too much but i didnt think it was 4 NOR 5 I THOUGHT 5 WAS JUST TELLING CLASSIC KIDS STORIES
Round 1 I could instantly tell it was number 4
2
I HAD A FEELING IT WAS HER
I'm one of 4 kids. My parents on a regular basis will call me by any name other than my own. That Zay mess up was classic parent slip up
Knew who it was since the beginning 😂
niko's so hot fr
I knew it was her from the start
I think its number 4
oh shit now the gonna break up fuck
When she said “yammed the whole thing” shoudlve been a sign she likes bruddas😂😂
As soon as he sold his "favourite" toy I knew it was number 5 lol
13:29 THATS KENNYS BROTHER ?
4 for sure 21:00
It number 2
number 1
I knew that this women wouldn’t say that they had to rehabilitate him at birth if it weren’t true.
This squad is the best
Was the story Einstein told about his kid passing a few years back, was that real? If not, that's a messed up thing to say mate.
I was so sure it was number 2 omg she seems so nice aswell
I knew it was her cus she’s like the most convincing
number 2 is obviously the mum.   Edit: I finished watching and I'm shockedd
HAHAHHA EINSTIEN 😂 Love this video❤
Why did you guys kick out hamza?😅😂
I thought the parent was 4 😅
4
I THOUGHT IT WAS NUMBER 4 SO BAD! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
defo the younger girl
2
5:45 are we just going to ignore that?
HUNZA 🤣 🤣🤣🤣
My name is ziggy my brothers is kingston
Parent #4 is THE FATHER
For the first time, I got the right option... She was smiling all the time and using the word Zay means she had other nicknames for Ezekiel
I think it is no.2
I THOUGHT NUMBER 5 🎉
Should have caught the mistake when Ziggy sold the toy after his mom said it was not sentimental
Number 2
He really looks like niko though
4 from the start
I think it’s the woman in the white sweater
Can you guys do a pt2
Bro you don’t understand how much I wanted Einstein to be the dad 😂 imagine how funny that would’ve been
4
HAMZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1
Go to belgium
anyone cock that 4 said he was his first son then he said he pushed his younger brother off the bed??
It had to be ainstein
the lady in the white shirt is the mother fs
4
Imagine you guys don’t hit 6 mil .is the the baby just not allowed out 😂😂
not sharky expecting a kid soon😭
Omg i Got it right yeesss
So obvious it’s Kenny having the child lol
AJ is so dumb😂😂😂😂
Why were there some random shoes on the table out of no where at 3:58
I know she was the mom and when she said the wrong name I was like yup that’s her kid she probably has more then one kid. The icing on the cake was when she talked about the toy and said that was not his favorite toy only a true parent would know that because he ended up selling the toy right after😂
kenny your are the father
I knew it was one of the women.. the black lady mentioned Jamaica and all the Ezekiel’s I know are Jamaican but both Ziggy and the white lady had quite posh accents so that was the giveaway for me tbh
It’s Chunkz that’s having a kid
i think its number 4
I can’t believe they allowed the beta squad within 10 meters of a minor
Ziggy sounds so Bri’ish it’s a joke
You guys should do your own tinder video it would acc blow
I think it's either five or two
Niko you very good
The fact that the mother said he wasnt too attached to his toys and then he sold his toy right after lol
i think its 5
His head peeping from under the table😂
its 2 i think
Umm I  think it the man ngl
I think IT’S the guy
bro mistakenly said hamza 😂😂😂
If there is ever a show of morons matching couple, children with parents and people with people. these morons will win an oscar!  It was so obvious! these morons just get into stupid trivial details that have no significance of whatsoever.
I knew it!!
"anyone got a ciggy mate"
i actually really thought it was number 4 he was really confident and convincing the whole time
I think it's the guy
4
tbh, the moment I saw she was the only Caucasian I knew it had to be her
Its the woan i think
its 5
It’s Optimus prime
I bet it is the mom
Next episode's gonna be 🔥🔥🍗
I was looking for them matching features ☠️☠️
imagine not subscribing
The silence when they found out was something I would never forget
Mum
icl i think it was einstien
Niko doesn’t know the DCAU
"𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝗺𝘇𝗮"😂
Sharky
3
Off the bat, i was feeling 4 or 5. The way she talked about his best friend and the toy really solidified it. Aint no way children have one single favourite toy, they change every 2 weeks
Sharky is the type of guy that Can look women in the eyes and make Them pregnant
I think number 4 is the parent personaly
Amazing, we need more Beta Squad videos, I have watched everything by now :( More more more more please <3
2
This was a damn rollercoaster 😳
It’s 4 from beginning
Bro my nayme is Hamza😅😅😅
my bros name is ezequiel 🤭
The lady is the mom😂😂 not the guy my guess
I KNEW ITTTT
i think its 4
21:54 when AJ says “goood numbers!” I cackled 🤣
From the first round I knew it was number 5 cos she knew the meaning of his name.
2
"He didn't say bye Hamza at least"😭😭😭
Kenny is definitely the father
I knewww it
19:44
I was 100 % sure it was 4😂
its not making no one in my class going to sleep
😂
it's number 4
Bruv i knew it was 5 bcs she said kt wasnt his fav toy and he sold it
commenting w no struggle its easily the dad
hamza 🤣 i''m going to dripple
the last two tbh
2
THERE ALL LIARS ITS NIKKO
4
I knew it was her wallah
4
I knew it. I knew it!!!
4
Who ever reading this God bless you saying to who believe
4
i'm thinking it's einstein right now ngl
I think it's the lady
Crap one of them is going to a father😭 I hope it's not Kenny or Chunkz
Name story, mindful of the best friends, cake story, her posture, her nose, her smile, how she was basically laughing at the other stories, and the kid obvious looks mixed not “light skin”
I KNEW IT
i dont understand how the last person wasnt voted out first if ziggy is black and she white and didnt say he was adopted no offence intended
guy wearing black
Who do we think is having a child?? I think Kenny
Sharky or Kenny having a kid btw rip if it's Niko
She said Zay cause she was saying ‘Ziggys favourite’ and mixed up the two words together
honestly i think it is number 4 the black dude thats 30 who said he got 2 kids and ziggy one of em iykyk
My name is hamza wow
This vid was too funny i enjoyed this one😂😂❤
Why are the members of the panel so rude and immature ☹️
"now that Einstein is gone"💀💀
#4 is the parent
4
At 6 million, the child will be born 💀
Are they acc having a child?
I think the mum is number 2, her little comment about the sweets was why I started thinking it was her
21:00 it was 5 brooo
I KNEW IT WAS HER
Before the reveal, I'm saying it's clearly number 2.
Niko needs to be a father soon I would love a video with him and a kid
it was the lady i thought at the start!! knew they shouldn't have gotten her out! woww~
the man on the right i think is the dad.. but the one on the left is exactly how a mother would be so.. hard to say..!  my vote is for the man i guess!  i just feel he's genuine and talks like a Dad would!
the boy with the jacket
She had the most pride when talking about him, it was very clearly her.
It’s the guy no way it’s not. The letter was supposed to be directed to Ziggy so the second I heard the lady read her letter that she wrote to you guys I knew for sure it was the guy who was Ziggy’S real parent.
5
i think it’s the white lady
i thought it was nikos kid
I can't be the only one checking for a scar on nikos neck
4
I think it’s 4
Wait a minute… my name is Hamza. the one most said word in this video was hamza 😂
I knew it she has 4 kids sometimes that's common and I know white moms 😅
The boy and his mom have the same eye shape..  I wasn't sure until they zoomed into his eyes and I recognized they were the same.
The girl
I thought it was 5 at the start then through out the middle I thought it was number two but with number 2 and 4 now im struggling
When I tell you I was shook I was shook. My mouth was wide open and all.
Hamza's dad is Einstein. Beta squad messed up.
OMG I literally knew it was her!
Moms a smoke gyatt
16:10 ahh she was soo good she made it so believable I'm still watching!!   EDIT!!  AHH no way ahh the 5th one ah oh my god ahh damn she was so good, damn both way she was so convincing but also not haha, damn ahh I love her smile at the end "yup that's my kid"!!
Ziggys mum a baddie
😂😂😂
its the dad !!!
Should've left number 3 for a few more rounds 😂
The first guy seem to be a cool member with beta😂😂😂😂😂he just has the same vibe
They also had similar accents
I think two is the mom.
I think it's the lady In the last round
i think it’s the guy with the leather jacket
17:29 killed me
Ziggy Zay hamza
21.06 ithink is the man
i think  sharkey is having the child
His real dad is actually Ronaldo 7
People not saying bye to the kid is rude as 😆
I’ll be real I have question about this new beta squad member are we sure this is not a prank and the sonogram was not off the internet 🤣😭 great vid tho!
New owners came in and splashed the cash on useless people not everyone
It’s #4
Women is his mom
Milf
plot twist none of them men are his parents
Knew it was her as soon as I saw her reaction to AJ swearing lol
Shouout Callux
5
i knew it was her, the zay was just a slip
the transformer lady tbh
How did number 4 know ziggy’s full name tho?
Part two
waa nagtii mootho subhannalah wallahi sharky mataganiid naag
Number 4
No one talking about how it’s said one if the en is having a child what
It was crazy they voted her for misspeaking my mom mixes all the siblings
its number 4 ez
“I forgot people are human”     Lol
Is it just me or does parent 4 look a bit like Thierry Henry 😊
White sweater looked away when she loved the kid
Awwww, one of you guys are having a babyyyyyy 🥰🥰🥰❤
so no ones gonna talk about one of the members of the beta squad being a parent???
oh i actually see nikos scar from the wwe video
bro said my birthday i got scared☠️☠️
The mum said that ziggy didn’t really care for the toy and then when he traded it for £10 i knew that she was his mum
She a gyat
Number 4
13:54 i thought it was his foot
It’s the number four even though I don’t like number four    Never saw this coming 24:28
😂😂😂
oj
i thought that was aj in the thumbnail 😂
Mom
The mum
It’s number 4️⃣
I think it’s number 2
i knew it when he sold the toy cus she said hes not really attached so i thought they would realize that when niko bought the toy but they never did
I actually thought it was number five because I was like this type of mum definitely raised that child!
no
21:04 the lady
i  really thought it was 5
I thought Ziggy Was Niko's kid.
So nice to see Neekos Fam 🥹
Fuck is French for seal but it’s spelled phoque
#2
i knew from the start, all i gotta say.
I knew it was the white lady , way before 😅
I think Kenny, Chunks or Sharky
2
4:07 😭😭😭
when she said zay she mixed ziggy with favorite lol
What if the kid is born before you reach 6mil? You gonna hide your baby like Drake? It's Probably Kenny or Niko, the rest aren't sinners lol.
It has to be 4 or 5
everyone in the comments knew that she was his mum meanwhile i literally was thinking it was number 4 and so convinced that aj was right 💀
I could tell it was her from the way they spoke
Kenny or Sharky are having a child
I KNEW IT SHE HAD SUCH GOOD STORIES
Can u guys please bring back more mafia
i think it is the jamaican woman
chunkz is the new beta squad parent 😃
I think sharky is the one having a kid cus when sharky said I want a son now aj said he got one that we don’t know about lol
do this kinda content lots moree
Bear wierd
I WAS CRACKING UP WHEN HE SAID HAMZA, THE FIRST DUDE
what a curv ball bruv
I knew it as soon as she spoke
nailed it❤‍🔥
Yeh
4444444444
Tall guy or the last woman
Still think its einstein
lol
11:31 What?! Nah y did I think he was 23…
10:04 taking the iPad away gives him more time to jump on the bed…
aj u triangle
I think number 2 is his parent update: WHATTT
octopus prime
0:24 He’s so adorable
After question 1 i thought 4 & 5 where his parents
DO ANOTHER
DO ANOTHER
They always have a random old person thrown in
it is number 4
bruh they were so mean to the old guy
i think it's 4
Petition for a guess the goalkeeper vid with Aaron Ramsdale He said he was down for it in the Fellas podcast ep113  Petition here 👇
Kenny is defo the father of the untold child
3
2
This one felt obvious to me
The mum kinda looks like Maggie from twd
Hamza watching like 👁👄👁
my guess goes with the women
From when she said “ he yammed the whole thing “ I just new😂😂😂
i knew it in the first round
That was too bait
When they release the real parent the “real parent “ first was laughing 😂
4
Set design is shit on this one. The vertical light and the rope light look like upside down crosses
I think it is  MR Einstein
def the guy that lady doing too much
Bro I was CERTAIN it was 2.
The woman out of the last two is parent (I think)
when the forth actually take a story with his birthday i know he is not ziggi’s dad bcs he run out of idea, birthday is a common thing
After ziggy sold the toy after his mum said he doesn’t really give a shit about it was a give away for me
Number 4
I THINK I KNOW WHO HAS A CHILD, I THINK ITS HP BC ON HIS STORY HE PUT UP A PIC OF SHOES AND THEY LOOKED LIKE A BABYS FOOT
great video
4:11 Einstein getting squared today
number 5 got flustered and said zay because she was shocked that they brought out a toy that he's not that close to and she knew that shell look sus when she says its not special.
Niko is having a kid on god fr
It’s the gent
LMAO AIN NO WAYY 😭😭
What a sweet kid.
Im guessing that chunkz is prengnant
Mum
didn't you guys realized that Ziggy said he was Eight years old and the number one parent said he was born in 2015. so 2015 to 2023 is Eight years. although he said Hamza.
get me in this show bro
einstein
I think it was Einstein
2
why this lookin 1:1 with Luh Tylor
when she said Zay it could’ve easily been a nickname or mispronunciation idk y they wrote it off after that
i knew it
Ziggy is such a cute kid
I think 4 is the dad
2
Deffinently Nikko is gonna be the new dad
Thought it was number 5. One person slightly stumbles and then they pile on and vote them out.
Btw aj is having a child
I loved that they all felt bad after finding out 😂
i knew instantly that it was her bc he had more similar facial features to her
Can we just appreciate how good Niko was with Ziggy?
Nah this ep was  mad
24:16 Aj had me cracking up the WHOLE video
Fuck chunks
I knew it was her cuz just look at the way she was speaking about him and changing his name
pre-reveal: two, the lady in white sweater post-reveal: oh- that makes a lot of sense
Hahaha i got the parent right!! she was very detailed and confident in all her answers,except the last one which she stuttered, but even for that, she gave a very convincing answer
I think it's number 4
Jesus saves ❤ amen 🙏
I’m 31st of august 2010😂😂🎉🎉
Man why cant people see through this fake rat chunkz yet, look how’s he acting with contestant 1, funnily enough he’s the first one to say “fame didn’t change me” 😂
omg i'm so so so so so sorry
i didn't even know i did that
i'm so so sorry beta squad
Knew it was the mom when she said the meaning of his name cuz most people don't know what Ezekiel means
nah what that video was a banger i was lost the whole tile
4 fs
I think the real parent is 5
ok but i was right and i was low key like mad when they voted 5 off cuz i literally slip up on my words too like i would've definitely called ziggy zaggy on accident.
i think niko is the parent
Looks to me like aj is the dad
I think hamza,s mum is 4
Anyone else notice the 4th guy said Ziggy was his first kid and then he said Ziggy was annoying his younger brother
I called it from the start
The way he said 'its a blimin tiger' I knew it was her. They sounded exactly the same.
5
i think its 2
Guess the boxer?
I could tell straight away who the parent was by the kid's posh accent
Congrats to the one who's going to have a  baby! (If it's true, that is.) Babies are a blessing! ❤
Niko is the one having the baby
I thought it was 4 the whole time bruhhhh
I said 4 8m still waiting t9 see answers
Last dude for sure
It’s 2
THIS IS DEAD
number 4
Kenny ain't fun at all
It’s definitely number 5!
I thought it was leather jacket from the start 21:00
Wallah I said it was number five I swear to God😂😂
i think its einstein
https://youtube.com/shorts/Ex8Q_7gxxFY?feature=share >> Fa Cup Winners Race Bar Chart
Nmbr 4 is the father
i was mind blown- i actually thought it was one of the last two parents lmao they're great actors.
❤
4
4th guy 100%
“How old are you?”  “Eight”  “perfect” 🤨🤨
KENNY IS DEFINITELY HAVING A BABY
I think the 37 y/o black man is the parent
if you wanna lie good say something that fimilarly happen to you but twist the story to you so your like the watching the situation in someone elses pov or what happened in your mind but twist it to that person
I know ziggy because of his brother Quincy
Yeah, I saw that a mile off. The first one I've ever gotten right.
the way number 2 walked in INSTANTLY knew that was the mother. ps HAVENT SEEN ENDING
Number 4 dude was so good, he sounded very convincing & I really thought he was the parent 😭
Its number four
The Second Lady was so sweet omg I was so sad when she got out she tried her best❤😮
ITS THE BALD GUY
4
Number 2
4
😂😂😂😂😂
we love chunk! :)) we need more chunk
Not the Einstein stepping out in the end 💀💀
So Sharky is having a baby? I thought it was gonna reveal on 6 MIL 🙄😭😭
I KNEW it was #5 straight off the name explanation. Way too detailed and personable to be fake.
i knew chunkz was pregnant
i think number 4
the guy
Ha ha such an amazing vid guy!!
its einstien fr
Btw chunkz sat by and watched KSI say the P word
I dont care which one of you's is having a kid, keep it out of the content
you should make a video where you have a child and 5 other adults. then you guess what relation the adults have to the child. Like parent, neighbour, stranger, grandpa.
I think its 2
1
It’s either king Kenny or sharky
What a surprise 😂😂😂 !!!!
I was so confident it was number 4 after seeing that he was smiling towards the beginning when the other dude was talking about losing his son. I thought he was smiling cause he was sure it was BS and he was the real father.
i knew 4 wasnt parent watch the starting ziggys 8 and he says he had him like 10 yrs back
Kenny’s having the child
My names Lawrence 😂
This was easy. There's a clear resemblance in the face of the son to the mother. Especially the placement/width the eyes from each other.
LMAOO this was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 but i knewwww number 5 was the parent
Hi guys.
Number 5 was the most obvious one for me and removing her just based on her messing up his name was a mistake. I can't count the times my parents messed up mine. Especially having siblings and hearing your parents start to call you by every one of your siblings names before saying your's
its the nr 1
FUMBLE! Y'all done goofed so hard on this one, fellas. Her story about his birth and the name was all I needed to know that she was the one. Big L, lads
4
That was the biggest plot twist of my life promiseeee
i knewwww it
Jesus loves you❤
4
The moms hot ngl
sharky sitting there disassembling the toy 😭
Number 2
I FUCKING KNEW IT
it has to be the number 2 she has the same accent as the kid
24:15 Finally AJ sat down…
I actually called it on the first try
I think it is the Dad! Not that lady... Great video! It made me laugh a lot and was entertaining.
What’s the mums name
4
iiiii love this content♥️
Number 1
i love how they talk like they are them 💀💀 funny asf
I actually enjoyed this more than I thought I would lol it was funny 😆
4
I think it’s the number 4
albert is my daddy atleast
cool
Mans said, OcToPuS PRIME, some ksi underwater crossover🤣
The beta squad can't name optimus🤣🤣
i hunk it’s 5
I knew who it was when they said the stories. When number five told the story, ziggy moved his head up and down I think two times? Correct me if I am wrong... Anyways, number two seemed like she is his mother, and the fact that she doesn't have any children surprised me because it seemed pretty realistic. Maybe the story with cockroach wasn't that good, but yeah, still nice. My third option was number four.
4
I think its 4

I CALLLED IT after watching a few of these. It's more common to see mixed race parents she was so genuine
Pls tell us who is having a kid and make a video about it i am sure its aj
It’s gotta be four
Chunks is havin the kid trust me
They were so mean to the Albert Einstein dude
Him
2
i knew it was the white lady
HAMZA was so good in this episode
Wait upon rewatching when they announce about the baby  thing they say the first will be announced not the father which implies that there is multiple fathers.🤔🤔
I think it’s number 2
4
When i saw them voting out number 5 i was literally screaming at them for how stupid they are... Like seriously she got voted out because of ZAY... It's normal for parents to have shorter nicknames since they in the same household and the fact that she said the toy isn't that special which differs from everyone else pretty much already told me enough... Even if she wasn't the parent... That num5 vote was baseless bs ball brain moment
I knew it was the Mom Since the first Sentence of the story
NDL
NDL
Kid looks hella bored
Number 4
Just so y’all know, I knew it, to talk about a scare at birth seemed lil personal and the passion was there!
“His name is hamza”😂😂😂😂😂
n.2 is my guess
I KNEW IT I KNEW IT WAS 5 I SWEAR TO GE والله العضيم
Hamza 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s Kenny having a child or Aj
Poor ziggy just has to stare at the wall while everyone is doing a challenge🤣🤣😂
i watched this on suma's jeans
I'm not sure if number 5 was lucky the 1st 2 rounds cuase there was more poeple so she had time to think up of a story or she's a really good acter
13:54 whose hand is that down there?
I knew it would be her they literally have the same eyes and headshape
Bradley ain’t there I’m not interested
Dad
Gotta love hamza
THE WHITE WOMAN OR THE BLACK MAN
4
The Second he said "it's a Blimming tiger" I knew it was the white lady
I swear it was obvious to me from the beginning it was her she played all her cards right but the boys were a bit too harsh on that slip up to vite her out straight away
i think its the old laidde
Follow if u enjoy beta square videos
Bro  y dose that kid on the thumbnaill loook so much like niko
They should have called the Mum back once he agreed to sell his 'favorite toy'
I believe Nr 4
9:43 niko playing rock paper scissors with the kid is so cute and funny
guess: the lady
2
Omgg one of you is having a child!! I'm guessing Sharky, I think he would be a good parent
Knew it was 5 cos she was going into detail and explaining stuff properly. Also when she said he didn't have a proper attachment to the toy and then he sold it for a tenner.
4
tell the kid a racist jokeif he laughs like a b1tch hes chunkz kid
2
WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH
1 has to be
I literally thought number 4 is the dad like so sure haha
The black lady
It was so obvious who the real parent was from round 1 !!!
Out of the last 2 parents i think its the man lol
The man
Should've been obvious the moment you gave all the parents the fake toy and everyone started to tell a lie and the real mother said that she hasn't seen this before and you vote her out and then tell the remaining parents that it was a fake lol
The way he was so comfortable with her still holding him like she did at the end is so cute
I feel like its the big black mother her accent kinda matches with the kids, his toy was a transformer (I didn't have a good look but it looked like one) and ngl they kinda look alike  Edit: Oh daaaamn
The man
it was be so funny if the beta squad played roblox the amount of beef there would be  would be so funny
No5
guys can i have a shout out please i watch your vids daily and i love you :) also i think chunks byeee.
Number 4
poor einstein
am i the only one thinking number 4 looks so much like thierry henry? Mad.
Ngl i think it wwas the black big bald man    Atleast i tried to explain what he looked like...
4
HAMZA HAHSHHSHHSA
Say wallah u guys r having kids😂😂😂😂
MY NAME IS NIKOLETA LOL
I’m guessing sharky or chunkz are having a kid but I guess I’m leaning into sharky
3 💯 the parent
it was between the white woman and the black guy in the final round for me
Can you please get me a free ps4 pls
surely someone heard sharky say 'perfect' after ziggy said he was 8?
i think its the mom LOL, but she do be persuding ahhh
I think it’s the guy who’s the father lol
bruv number 3 was CJ from san andreas
5:44 WHAT? Please don't tell me Kenny is having a child. I mean he'd be a great dad but my heart wouldn't be able to handle it lmao
definetly AJ's Idea
you guys are fools you could see it in her eyes
Player number 5, idk something about her
NUMBER 2
loving your vids!!!!
Hey Beta Squad, you guys have the wrong link for your Instagram account. It's for a fan page.
why do i think kenny going to be the parent
its defo number 4
10:20 my man just pulled a Cristiano ronaldo
The bloke
its the lady 4sure
Love your videos betta Squad I wish to become a huge YouTuber just like you ❤❤❤
Niko is so wholesome playing rock paper scissors with Ziggy
Niko would be such a good dad tho
Its kenny. Kenny is having a yute.
4
I WAS RIGHT OMG😂😂😂
THE WHITE LADY
Hamza 😂😂😂😂 that guy is caping
Number 4 trust
4
They r probably divcored parents
Congrats to niko for becoming a dad
I'd like to know who having a baby?? 😮
Need more Match The videos 😶
number 2
I knew it
It’s the guy
I dont like how ziggy said he was eight and Sharky said "Perfect"
4
I’m saying it’s Kenny
2 IS THE MOM AND 4WAS FUNNY IF THAT WAS ENSTIEN GUY HAMZA
I wish they kept number 3...I was dying when he said "hamza"
I was right. She seemed very confident throughout the whole thing. She kept positive, respectful towards everyone and with the look in her eyes as if she was laughing at their attempts. Her posture is what made me pick her.
I think 2 (damn it)
I think number 4 is the father
i think its the girl u already voted out
Its 4
bro these video ideas make me sooooooo 😏😏🥵🥵😝😝😝😝
you could tell it was number 5 by the way taht he talked same accent and the way they spoke was the same.
Number 4 really convinced me
The mom is actually pretty
he looks like her smh hahahahha
lets see the fact that sharky has 6 letters in his name and aj almost said that sharky had a child soooooooooo ig sharky is going to be a dad?????!
4
Man like Hamza
Match the parent to the child   2.5m people + me   Hmmm interesting 🤔
So we just ignore tht sparky has a child💔
honestly i think its the mum  number2
Niko offering 10 pounds off soggy for the toy was so cute
MILF
Wtf I wouldn’t guess that
You know when someone lies when they stumble or say “umm” a lot when theyre recalling a story. They’ve done this type of show so often you’d think theyd pick up on those clues lol
13:32 AJ says number 5 even though she’s number 4 ? 😂
im legit like that
4
vu
So who’s the person in beta squad having a child
I really loved this video guys 👍
Wait, is sharky having a kid?
24:26  watched it all it was so crazy but I knew it was that white person!!❤
I called it being #5, but you guys kept cutting her story off so that totally blinded your choice
That’s a MILF right there
It's the black dude
I still believe it’s Einstein.
I knew it was her from the start
Clearly 4 or 5
yo AJ should get purple hair cause the lights behind him made it look nice on him
Paused the video to say I think they took the parent out… I think it’s the younger lady who’s his mom   Edit: I was right lmao
Bro as soon as they all spoke it was obvious. Same accent. duh
Try doing “5 ___ and vs 2___”.
No cap, I was like ain’t no way Kenny’s the dad, no. 1. I thought it was 5 and then after he sold the toy that confirmed it for me!
Omg i always thought it was number 5! The simpler the better. // Sharky I love youuuuuu
2
Two
24:20 i thought there was a bowl on the table. Just AJ
I thinks it’s the girl In the glasses
She’s the only one that knew his real name it was so obvious how did they miss it omlll
I knew it was number 5 the moment she went into depth about his name
I think it’s her
I thought its number 4 all the rounds!
I think Niko & S are having a kid! They’ve been together for years now & it makes so much sense why he’s releasing the biggest menace now before reeling it in to be a dad! 🥰
8:44 Niko man😂 9:44 9:17 he's so proud he's nodding like 'yep I did that' 😂 17:54 buying a toy from a 8yo? Typical niko🤣
The one who's having a child is Sharky
watch it back im a detective in rl and everytime the real spoke, e kept moving his legs i knew it was her.
"His name is Hamza" I never laughed so hard 😂 🤣 😭 😆
Why is his real mom a baddie tho 😂
Not hamza 😂
Beta squad vids the past few months have gone through the roof amazing content boys! 👏
the white shirt lady
I literally don't know how they got it wrong! Haha he literally had the same posh accent as the mum. V cute though <333
Two and four were baitly acting (fairly well though) 😄🙂
I think it's number 4
My guy said my b day not year but
chunks don't even speaking English
SHARKEY HAVING A KID BTW
BETA SQUAD NEW VIDEO IDEA MATCH THE CHILD TO THE PARENT | WHERE THERES 6 KIDS AND 1 PARENT THAT WOULD BE JOKES
Such a good video 😂
I think it’s 4
2
The parent is number 5 because it looked like Ziggy got embarrassed during the coach story and during the cake story 9:17
u mama     n
Should do these against body language experts
are we just going to ignore the fact that one of the beta squad members is having a baby? that’s crazy
I felt like the mother of ziggy was the real parent all a long, she gave everything detail which was amazing and creative, especially how ziggy was born.
𝕀𝕟𝕥𝕖𝕣𝕖𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘
Is one or them actually going to have a kid? 😂
Yo why she kinda bad?
My name is hamza and I was shocked when my name was spoken by the beta squad 😂😂😂
Nobody gonna talk abou how one of the members are having a kid
Im Glad beta squad posting, cos where the f is sidemen.
I knew it was five before I saw the vid
number 4 easy
I got it right Ayee🤪
This is sick moment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr-O_7qopyk
The dad
Old man
2
Number 4
If ziggy started a band when he is older he should call it ziggy and the zig zags!!!😭😭
4 my guess after round 1
LMAOO they missed it ziggy is 8 and number 4 said he was 37 and had ziggy at 28, the math wasnt adding up
4
chunks is the most likely to be having a kid
I think it’s the guy
Why is no one talking abt how aj said that one of the members are having a kid
Number 4
ngl the way the child and parent speak is exactly the same. They got the same accent which gave it away for me
I haven’t finished this yet but it’s definitely number five in my mind. Her stories seemed so natural like she wasn’t even worried about coming up with something or convincing them because she knew she was telling the truth. I’ll come back to edit this when I find out the parent.
I think it’s 2
She said it wasn’t the real favorite toy which makes sense because he gave it away for 6.50
i think its 4
i’m calling OJ ‼️‼️
four
Aint no way one of u have a kiddd
einstein knew alot, just not his sons name
Gotta be 4
I realised it was her when she told the story of him eating the chocolate cake and he had the biggest smile and was nodding yes
GUYS IS KENNY HAVING A BABY WHAT IS GOING ON????
gotta be the guy contestant 4
This part killed me bro 4:08 😂😂
I hope IT'S AJ
Is anyone from Beta Squad having a baby? because Chunkz said it wasnt him
i thought it was 4 the whole ah game wtf
i knew she was mum from the start
kenny is 100% the dad
I think it was obvious when AJ swore in front of Ziggy, number 5 didn't look so happy 😅
I thought it was her because I believe Ziggy would nod along with what she said which kinda gave it away
Nice
I knew it was her from the jump 💀💀
i think its 4
2
I can't watch this whole thing, so who is the real parent?
9:41 Niko playing rock, paper, scissors with Ziggy is sooo cuteee
should of got behz on this
DAD
the guy100 %
Knew it was her. The way the kid was reacting to her stories 😂
Ik it omds😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think its 2
4
I think Niko is having a baby guys 😮❤
The last man 😮
it's def 4
The only one having a kid is kenny, dnt believe d muslim bruddahs r married n lets b honest nikos only pulling grannies with his personality at a darnce😂😂❤❤ congrats to the squad!!😊
I like their content i just find it sad when they make fun of people it’s not cool

I think its the mum
4
naw wait it has too be 4 the outfits are similar
Chunkz is having a baby
defo 2
That woman in the white top.. i don't like her vibes fam. trapezium looking brudda. She said she had real connection with the toy the boy sold for what 10p?
I recon 4 is the parent
Dad 21:06
Albert Einstein's name is not HICTOR DAHL KHAN it's IQTEDAR KHAN.
Ziggy is nikos son, he will make a great parent man, as silly as Niko is he will make a great dad I can tell.
their voice was similar so it was easy
I COULD JUST TELL IT WAS NO.5!!😂
I called it😂
i think 4 is the dad
She said he is not attached to toys and he then proceeds to prove it by selling his "favourite toy to you" are you kidding meeee!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣. It was painful watching this one guys🤣🤣🤣🤣
4
Number 5!!!!!!!!
Congratulations sharky becoming a dad!
I knew who it was once they slipped up with the nickname
Man said Hamza 🤣🤣🤣🤣
congrats to niko on his kid lmaooo I can see the resemblance also it seems like something niko would do to give a hint
i knew it was the white mom from the jump cuz im lightskin and lightskin kids normal have white moms and black dads
She also explains the meaning of his name in depth
Ziggy looks like the mom so much. This was the easiest as their facial features are so identical. I said it from the start
stolen from bankzitters
is it number 4 ?
Number 5. They voted the wrong one out man 😂
that white haired guy got me dying when he said that ziggy’s real name was humza😂😂
4
4
its the man at the end thats my guess
Now you guys have to do the pregnancy/period/birth simulator, I mean, you guys should do it
Nah the Humza bit killed me off 😭😭
I think it’s the last woman, I’ll c9me back to see if I was correct
So we are all just going to skip over the fact that they said Sharky had a son otw and him sayin they don’t know yet… pause cuz what? I hope it was an April fools joke
number 4
Ezikul sounds like a devil from black clover.
kenny is having a baby
Congrats kenny😉😉😉
It’s the Michael b Jordan guy
Lets pray chunks gott be a dad cause he will be the best at it❤❤❤❤wallahi
Sharky has a kid coming guys * Spoiler Alert*
4
Girl
I know it means nothing but as soon as they lined up I could just tell they were the parent.
Why do beta squad hate white people?
I KNEW IT
WHOSE HAVING A BABBY TELLL MNEEEE
SHARKY’S GOING TO BE A DAD?!?!!??!
sharky: how old are you? kid: 8 sharky: Perfect
If anyone were to have a child in the beta squad it would be Kenny
I still knew it   Great Video guys
Sharky has the baby
father
“His name is Hamza”
its gotta be 2
I swear to Jesus Christ i knew it was no5 cause the way she was talking about him😮😮 then thdy asked her the name of her husband instant reply (david) fair play👏👏👏
https://youtu.be/2V9B-Mp9Lsg  Everyone is waiting for the next Emergency Meeting.  I will not be making public streams for a while.  I can only be found inside of The Real World / HU.  Big things coming soon.
4, 5
lol all the mothers here knew the she was the mom ❤
I knew it was her
they should babysit one video
It was so obvious😂😂
Bro did that man (no1) just change from ziggy to hamsa😂😂😂, this is mentall😂😂.
I wonder what was said and edited out for them to be so apologetic at the end😅
No one can chat to me ever again after my reaction drops tomorrow💯😤I knew it was number 5 because when they were all telling a funny story about Ziggy... Number 5 specifically said he "YAMMED/NYAMMED" the cake... Please tell me what white women you know that has ever used that word to describe someone eating😂🤣She obviously has a black influence in the house hold and that's Ziggy's DAD‼ As soon as she said that at 9:17 I locked mah answer in😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
CONGRATULATIONS TO SHARKY FOR THE UPCOMING BABY
4
Am i the Only one tryna get number 2 and 4's like ig? number? SOMETHING??😭

21:04 I think it 5
Shoutout callux😭😭😭 that had me dead
4
19:47 aj you stupid you ruined the surprise

Ziggys moms a baddie
4
4
the guy
Man it has to be the man
9:17 was the moment Ziggy nodded make me know the truth
i think it’s 4
they're reactions are priceless to finding out she's the mom! lol pause it at any movement as they're finding out, it is histarical
OJ got the child’s age wrong of the rip I don’t know how they didn’t realise.
2 is the mom
Did you guys see Kenny, Aj, and sharky all move their heads right and left when they where taking about the tiger shirt
where hv I seen her
I called it from when she said ‘yammed’ about the cake I knew she was with a black man 😂
I THINK ITS NUMBER 4!!!!
why is no one talking ab kenny going to be a dad 🙄
4 all the way
NO WAY MAN SAID HIS NAMES HAMZA 😭😭😭
Who do u guys think had a kid
probebly number 4
Literally the easiest challenge yet and they got it so wrong off of 1 minor slip up that easily could've been what she likes to call her child
I thought why would she make up a story about this child, whether hers or not, needing to be resuscitated as a newborn… like that’s just a tragedy you wouldn’t even make up or put on anyone if it wasn’t true🥹
Kenny has to be the one having a baby
I KNEW IT WAS HER ONG🙏😭
2
4:10 I actually laughed out loud😂😂
I knew when AJ swore and the mum looked down in embarrassment while everyone else laughed. Game was done there.
I was lost too😂😂😂
I KNEW IT WAS HERR OMG
5 surely
Number 4
Bro I think its chunkz or Sharkey that's  gonna have a child
4
😶‍🌫️
BROOOOOOOO its got to be 5 she pronounces her t's craaaaaazy and talks posh and ziggy at the start was pronouncing his t's LOUD and talking like her
How are you guys having a child ??? I’m not pregnant ? 🧐
Daddy sharky
It’s the man
Omg no way this one really REALLY threw me I would of done the same so don’t feel too bad guys we were all fooled! 😂
AJ and Niko are the only ones who have girlfriends according to what i know. So it should be either of them. Both would make good dads✊
it has to be number 4 bro just look at him bruh gye feel
I knew it was her just before she went out! Stories were not overreacted like most other contestants
WHAT ONE OF THEM IS HAVING A CHILD
She was clearly the mum from the start. I guess it ain’t that serious, but annoying she didn’t even make it to the end.
So sharky wants a child? You could’ve just told me babe 👀
11:45
its a blooming tiger 🤣🤣
Can't believe they got this one wrong
It was so obvious that the white woman was the mother just from the start because no one else had a posh accent. Just by the accent alone it was super easy to guess.
5
4
As soon as she said yammed I knew it was her, idk why just did
😅
they should've known the real mother of ziggy when they said he looks like niko. because you can see they are both white-black mixed race
number 4 easy
Including kids in content is giving hollywood pizza party. This shit happens again im blocking the beta squad.
Chunks reallu showing his face
Number 5 got her cheeks clapped by niko to be ziggys mum
I think it’s 2
Number 4  ....... is the ........ FATHER
It was how they both talked it was the exact same.
The lady
these dudes are the new sidemen and at least they dont say racial slurs
I knew it since the start of the video
Ziggy is a trooper
It was when they started arguing at the end I knew it was neither of them
I think 3
4
number 2 said we made together this toy
the zay mum
kenny is gonna be a dad
2
Did no one else clock when number 4 said he was 37 and had Ziggy at 28 and he’s only 8 years old?
I think it’s bold man
is it only me or number there is always a troll and not the real person
Looooooooooooool Hamza!!!!
21:04 i think it is the woman
I have a brother named hamza the name hamza comes from Islam it's a beautiful name
BRO WHAT i thought it was number 4 from the start
I KNEW IT I GUESSED HER SHE SEEMS LIKE SHE KNEW MORE AB HIM
I think it’s 4 or 5 but 5 is gone rn so I think it’s 4
I knew it was her! The way Ziggy is so well spoken!
It’s the man
When number one was trying to explain his funniest story with ziggy that was too funny 😂he flopped it soo bad and then number 4 saying how he got bitten by a swan 😭stories were soo creative.
I’m soo shook that the real parent was number 5 I didn’t think it was her at all I thought it was number 5. But her answers made the most sense as soon as she went from zay to Ziggy to hamza I thought it wasn’t her just like niko but it just goes to show u should neva judge ppl because she said that was cos she’s naturally clumsy.
5:27 😂
1
23:49 icl I knew it from the start 😫
2
4
So are we all just going to ignore the fact that one of them is about to be a father😭😭
NIKO IS HILARIOUS 🤣
I think it’s 4
pls reply to me I am a big fan and if u reply I will like and subscribe with all notifications on
I think it's the women I thought that from the start I am second guessing myself now tho but ima go with my first choice.
knew it was 5 from  the jump
This is my favorite series... Please more videos as this
Number 4 MUST be a psychopath. There is no way a normal person can lie so good.
Wait wtf was AJ serious when he said one of them is gonna be a parent?
i fr thought it was 4
LMAO! i don't get how they didn't get it from the jump!
It’s the guy
I think it’s the white lady because of the facial resemblance
ITS 4
Vik can connect with 8 year olds 😏
4
2
I knew it 😂😂😂😂
Albert Einstein is the new Bradley
4
no. 4
love niko lol
4:11 is the best
I think it's five, but four out of the two left.
2mill in one day  Mad ting
4
4
You know what screw it😑his name is Hamza😂💔
women
4
I think it's the woman because they have a connecting story and when you look into ziggy (Hamza)'s eyes you can see that he feels touched
awh niko playing rock paper scissors with ziggy is so cute
GOD BLESS
it was so obvious tho ????
It’s number 5 wdym
Watching this because there’s no sidemen Sunday again
is George having a kid🤣
aj was like "i forgot people were human"
Aj's hair looks so cute!!!
Its the women lad😊
When number 5 used the word “yammed” I was convinced it was her
I think it's 2
mans said “sorry i forget people are human” 😭
beta squad 🤝 making elite content
I knew it
I think Chunkz is gonna be the dad
The fact someone said 'perfect' when he said he was eight lmao 😂
You guys always loose when the freaking truth is right in front of you. So oblivious to 😤don’t post this content again😭😭. Love y’all tho
Knew it
number 4 for sure, clear from the start, if im wrong then fair play
its da mother!!!
Whyd sharky say perfect when ziggy said hes 8 👀0:38
The uk just be watching anything and coming up with anything for a video
NUMBER FOUR
I think its the mum
Loved this video and for once I actually knew it! I felt like they looked similar and always have a similar experience with my little boy. People always question because he’s mixed 😂
Yo Ziggy 28th august bros yessir same birthday mine was before yours though
number 5
Bro this one was so good
I was right no way what a guess she knew to much to not be the mom
4
chunkz is having the child
Beta Squad foreshadowing about Sharky's baby.
Was pretty hard to believe I wouldn’t lie
Number 4
Finally chunks will have a child. But he has been pregnant some years. So the child will be different🎉🎉🎉
Before watching the rest I think it’s the man
I knew it was 5 because they look identical
number 4
Knew who the real parent was from the beginning. Was surprised when y’all fumbled it 😂
Tbh I think it's  number 2
i knew that was the parent cuz they had really similar eyes
That white woman is so good looking
The guy is the dad has to be
All I know is Niko is going to be a great father to our children 😊
idk how they struggled so much knew it was 4 since round 2  edit:mb mb i didnt know it was  5 lmao
5
4:08 😂😂😂
bro im confused why did he say shootout callux 3:55
I’m so happy I was right… I knew it was Fee Queen
Its got to be sharky having a baby
I can’t tell if it’s a joke, is one of the beta squad going to be a dad!!!
Wait a minuteeee, who's having a child?????
I’m thinking the girl before the end. Just looks like a mum
Donut that was a freebee
I already knew number 5 was the mom after her story with the football coach cuz ziggys reaction too the story biting he's hand was a give off
#4
I will never understand how the sidemen have more subs. You guys are more relatable, funnier and you each have your own unique character that makes you all loveable.  I checked their channel for the first time yesterday, and all of them are so dry, not funny and their videos are boring! You guys deserve their spot on YouTube!
I just noticed that younger Niko looks like younger Drake 💀
I reckoned in this video how good of a dad Neeko could actually be
21:00 its obvs 5. y did u vote her??
I knew it.
Chunks is having a child🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
I think its 5
I think the dad is number 4 21:00
octopus prime is hamza's fave character
YES, I knew it was 5 from round 2
Sharky: How old are you ziggy? Ziggy: 8 Sharky: Perfect  🤔🤔🤔🤔
Niko looks like rudy gobert
I knew it!
Oooh who is having a child I really want to know 5:45
Producer turned Iqtidar Khan to Hector Dahl Khan
I knew she was the mum immediately, so much that Niko started to annoy me when she was talking about his not favorite toy lol🤦‍♀️😂
Two
Sharky movin mad 8 is perfect??
I’m gay if it’s not Shark or Kenny with the kid, Can’t see the other ones being parents besides MAYBE chunkz.
I think it’s the mom hahaha 21:07
it’s the mum
4
I feel bad for Einstein if his son actually died 😢
Congrats on one of you become a dad
I feel like you could tell by Ziggy's reactions to her speaking also slightly gave it away, plus the pure amount of detail she had
I have a biggg question are they all fasting because in the trailer they are eating stuff so is this after they break their fast or are they just not fasting please answer my question thanks.
19:47 does get me thinking about this child
We've learned Niko is scared of swans
I knew it the hole time
Sharky has a baby guys 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Number 1 fucked up as soon as he said Hamza🤣🤣🤣
I knew it, thats his mom 9:18 When he shakes his head
white shirt
Think it’s 5
the mum saying ziggy isnt atached to the toy was so true cuz he ended up selling it 😭i felt for it too
Is no gonna tsk about one of the members having a child
4 and 2 are crazy liars 😂😂😂
I love this 🫶🏻
Wow what a plot twist
W vido
So sharky is going to be a father 😮
“I forget that people are human”  Funny and profound from our favourite triangle
Most prob my guess is that the one with the  baby is chunkz or sharky most prob sharky cause they both have six letters in them name.. 👌🏻
Yeah Kenny’s having a child we already know bun the subbing thing
It’s number two
I think its number 1
Haven’t seen the reveal yet but ima guess that it’s Parent 4. If not, it’s fs the other finalist.
My boy hictor Dahl khan did not want to be there 😭😭
sharky having a baby with me sorry to spoil 🙁
😂
I think it is number 3
As soon as the contestants came in I said the mom wearing white
I just knew by their eyes that they were mom n son😭
down to the last two and i reckon its both
YES I FUCKING KNEW IT
I think it is number 4
#2
I wonder which BetaSquad member will be having a child .. Hope it doesn’t change anything. Loving the bangers being brought every weekend 🥹🥰🔥
#4 said that was his only son at the start then in the next story he said he was playing with his young brother, dead give away.
Out of the last 2, it’s the women
The last two I think it’s the dad
Cutest moment when ziggy said PLAY THE TRAILER
I liked the video until this part 5:46
19:46 gg's well played and peace out
The editor needs to get those suggestions videos and the channel bar out the way so we can proper see the trailer
No. 5 From the jump i sense shes the mother
why is no one talking about the fact that one of them are having a baby
Calculations in his head:  His name is       Hamza
Will mckenzies mum looked gutted
the women
Niko would be the best dad based on how he treated Ziggy
number 2
I was shouting at my screen when they sent the real mothers off it was clearly her
4
Nikos reaction to Oj i died 💀💀
A mix race child and only one white woman, so obvious lol.
thats fraud she is white and he is black wtf
i think .. its 4
ngl brother number 1 is so fine
i think sharky is having a child
When he said 'blimming' and she said 'nyammed' I knew he had a white mum and she had a black husband loool
i think niko is having a child because he looks pregnant
I actually thought 4&5 were the parents but I think 4 more than anything
i knew it was her
someones having a CHILD??3850//.;['
I honestly thought it was number four from the start
2
wait why was aj apologizing
The boy
the white woman
y’all gonna ignore the fact that SHARKY might be A DAD
Btw the parent is number 5
"how old are you?" "Eight" "Perfect. Well we got him now" 🤨🤨📸📸📸📸📸
Kenny?
Is no one going to talk about one of the beta squads having a child?
Niko is so cute with kids 🤗
sharky sweatshirt is hard still
Not hamza 😂😂😂😂
YALL I THOUGHT THEY WERE JOKING ABOUT ONE OF THEM BEING A FATHER ITS FKN TRUE SHARKY OR CHUNKZ IS A FATHER TO A BLESSED CHILD. ITS SHARKY I CAN FEEL IT IF ITS NOT HIM I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY IM SO HAPPY YALL DONT UNDERSTAND
4
it was bait from how well spoke he was
19:47 AJ SAYS THAT ITS SHARKY THAT WILL BE A DAD?!?!?!
When I saw aj  under the table I thought it was a plant 🪴
Felt good getting it right!
His mom was so mad mad yall voted her off, thats when I knew for sure. After that I knew you voted the parent off.
4
100% number 4 (the guy), I thought it was super obvious
I think it’s number 4
has to be 4
Yeah mental
i think its 1
I think it's about time for a mafia episode.
The real parent is no. 5 (the girl that said he aint like his toys like that)
4
Are we just going to move past the fact that za or zay can be a short form of Hamza?
Whossss having a kiddddd
mumzy kinda a milf
#5 had me sold until that mistake, made me think it was #2
I knew it
Kenny and Chuckz are so boring in these games, they take this to serious and don’t have fun with it.
1 saying hamza finished me 😭
I knew the kid was from the white lady 😅
Meooow
Sharky finna be a dad
L video
I think the woman is the mother  🤞🏿
19:50
its the woman, aint nobody that good of a liar and she sounds wayyyy to convincing
I'm Guessing it's number 4. Clocked him since the beginning of the episode when he called him ezekial.
I always knew it would be 5🤣🤣
3
I knew who was mum as soon as she called him “zay” clearly a nickname the whole family probably call him 😂😍
I knew for sure the last guy left was the daddy 😂😂😂
Lol I was right
number 4 I think
They should’ve known it was her since he actually sold his so called favourite toy for 10£ which proved her claim that it actually isn’t his favourite toy and that he doesn’t get attached to toys but his teddy bear.
when it started i knew it was her she cant lie when she put god in the picture
I hope one of these becoming a dad is a lie just because the baby ain't even born yet and you're trying to use him for more followers
2
Gotta be 4
Amazing content
9:44 so cute bro wtf😭😭
Hamza did a great job
4th!!
Bro i wana know who is having a child
I’ve been thinking it was 4 the whole time. I think 2 just snuck right past me this whole time. Either she’s just good at lying enough to get through and now has to go above to actually win, or she is the mom and I was caught on 4 too much
It’s Kenny doing what his father did best
I thinks its #2 because #4 was doing too much trying to relate the toy to DC stuff, felt like he was tryna to support his previous response for persuasion. He also said "pushed the younger brother" instead of saying the kids name, weird.
number 4 😭😭😭😭
Man you lot are missing the point sharky has a child.
I thought it was 5 the whole time, and while the slip-up made me doubt myself, but I still stuck with my decision and was right.
It’s Kenny’s kid bet
Zay ziggy hamza!!
I think it’s Einstein
Plot twist, the person who gets voted that they're the parent gets to take home the child.
USE EDIOT! Man I knew it was NUMBER 5 from the stories Kmt how are use flopping that on my life use should’ve won
On my life I knew it
Not the shoutout to callux with the babies miracle 🤣🤣
NUMBER 2 FOR SURE
I thought it was number 4 from the start 😂
black guy

Here before reveal I think it’s number 4 cuz ngl 2 doing a lil too much
She didn’t even say goodbye
HOW IS SHE THE PARENT
23:47 Their faces 😭
It’s the lady , the guy exagrated the letter icl
I want to know who’s the father! For the new member of beta squad
I knew she was the mom when she gave the reasoning of his name❤
Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved  Lord Jesus I admit I am a sinner. I need and want your forgiveness. I accept your death as the penalty for my sins and recongize that your mercy and grace is a gift you offer to me because of your great love not based on anything I have done. Cleanse me and make me your child. By faith I receive you into my heart as the son of God and as a saviour and Lord of my life. From now on help me live for you with you in control. I want to ask for forgiveness for all sins that I have committed knowing or unknowingly. I ask for forgiveness and deliverance from these sins. Give me the power strength and guidance I need to not commit these sins anymore. Deliver me from temptation and from the hands of the enemy. Cleanse me with your blood cover me with your blood soften my hardened heart and make me new again. Blessed it with so that I will be obedient to your voice and guidance In your precious name  Amen
i think it’s the woman
4
Wait did I hear that right someone from beta squad is having a baby?!!! 5:48
I think it the 1 because he wasn’t trying at all… he tricked them… but I ain’t done yet with the video
19:48 i think sharky is going to be a dad, tell me I'm wrong
Kenny was so quiet in this vid.
from the begin i vote for number 4 DADDY
child?
Definitely 4
I thought it was number 2 ngl she seemed convincing enough throughout😅😅
why is no one talking about one of the beta squad members is gonna be a dad wth??!!😭😭😭😭
Why are the beta squad still sharing a tight table where someone hangs off on the side 😂
WAIT⚠️JESUS IS COMING BACK SOONER THAN YOU THINK💭🔜!!You may think  God is MAD AT YOU😡⁉️But the truth is, He’s madly in love with YOU❤️!!The door to repentance is closing FAST🚪💨!ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AND GET RIGHT WITH GOD BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!!✝️⏰🕊
I thought Ziggy's bone structure in his face looked like his mum the most and the mere fact he so willingly sold the toy confirmed that she was his mom. She knew he didn't like it that much.
i think its four
I was absolutely convinced it was 4
Ok but can we pls talk about how one of them is going to be a father ??!
When ziggy said ‘blimming’ I knew that he spoke posh like his mum
I knew she was the mum first hand😭
Team was a likkle rude today man lol
ITS SHARKY HAVING THE BABY DEF
W vid
What's your age?, Ziggy: "8", Sharky, "perfect".
:)
WHO IS HAVING A BABY TELL ME
The first guy was hilarious 😂 Edit: The end was shocking. 😶
rip sidemen sunday this week
Oml I voted number 5
omggg sharkys a dad 🎉🎉
W
So nobody’s talking about the potential 6th beta squad member? Nah? Cool.
2
niko better be the father.
I think it's 4
Bring back more videos like this 🧏🏾‍♀️
I KNEWWWW ITT
Guys you should have gotten this one. Just look at Ziggy 3:24 lol, his embarrassed body language told me that´s 100% his mom talking. It was s´cute.
Number two is not the mom
aj the hug was so unnecessary and cringe i swear to god
His  name's Hamza 🤣
Two.
Niko’s too funny man, buying the toy off the kid for a tenner 😭😭😭
Kenny is the beat squad member having a child
Nah the mum threw me off ibsr
😂
Hi
Swing my sword like trunks 😊
its 4 bro 100%
its gotta be the lady
It has to be 4
I genuinely think it’s number 5
It’s the women on the right
one of y’all’s having a child? prolly kenny man
I think niko is having a child
If his opps find this video he’s done
Number 1 straight up ludicrous 😂
I called it
4
I don’t ah is having a child so maybe niko idk
5
the ugly one
i think its 4  😄
I'll be honest this one was too obvious even by just observing they're reactions 😂
the thing is i called it as well, i knew fee was the mum from the off Ezekiel, Israel name, from the Bible, means 'God will stregthen'. the best friends, yeaaaah. w video as per usual.
that's einstein right
2
here before the guy starts belssing everyone
Momma wowza 🤩🤩
When ziggy sold the lego I knew she was the mum cause she said he wasn't sentimental to it and it wasn't that important to ziggy
I guessed number 5 from the start! epic video btw
Guys it was so obvious, Can you not tell by the eyes that number 5 and ziggy have similarities
i think 4 i havent saw the full vid yet
the parent is the bald dude
sharky Btwn the last two I think its the Guy......... yeah the squad were hasty in sending out the mum, I mix up my brothers names 🥲
4
Bro, I knew she was the mum! Especially because of the toy question. When she was confused and then said his actual favorite toy is a teddy bear, I knew the kid was prolly too embarrassed to give them the teddy bear so he gave them the car. AND SHE WAS RIGHT!!! He SOLD the car in the next round!
I think it's the dude
Good content
Chunks is a rat
Is it just me, or did the Beta Squad look extra good today
Its hamza
has to be 2
I’m ngl number 5s story about the toy really convinced me because the majority of them made it out to be something special and unique but in reality kids just make random things from legos that they’re not really attached to.  Edit: BINGO!
YALL SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN BUT WITH RELATIVES AND MAKE THEM GUESS THE PARENT THEN. BUT DONT TELL THE BETA SQUAD
I think it's number 5
4:08
I think it‘s the woman with the white pullover
When he said his name is hamza I immediately paused and went to like the video 🤣
that lady a baddie
I think it’s the guy
Definitely think niko may be having a kid and he would be soo sweet if so with a son or a daughter
I wonder if Kenny will be back for next week's video
Why does Carlene low-key look like darkestman 😂?
6:40 his face scared me
number 4
Fee (Number 5) said that Ziggy is not that attached to his favorite toy and then Ziggy just sells the toy to Niko for 10 pounds. Clearly she was right. For me that kinda gave it away and the biblical naming
4
Before the reveal: it was definitely 5
I think it's skarky because zigy said he was the oldisd out off all of you
The voted out 😊mom! Its her
I knew it
Im stuck too sharky
I THINK ITS 5
The mum on the left
Mum
I think its einstein
Num 2 she was so real and I can see the look on Ziggy it was her
4
by the way niko treated ziggy, he would be a good father <3 so cuuuute
I LOVED THE VID DO MORE
Got bit by a swan before, suprisingly hurts like hell
It's Kenny
I think it was no 5 you guys voted her out
I think the number 4 is the father
0:35  "How old are you man"  "8" "ayye perfect."
4
Alfred Einstein Hamza
Hamza ha ha ha ha
They kick everyone out that does one mistake 👏
Whos having a child in beta squad
@ 16:05 I just noticed...  after finding out that #5 was ziggy's mom (re-skimmed through the video to find how I didn't figure out it was #5 & if she gave out some clues)...   Ziggy glances at his mom (after she voted out the previous round, and was standing on set behind the cameras).  Im assuming she probably pointed upwards or whatever (to tell him to up the price a little bit) and asks Niko if he could make it $6.50
6:34 OH LMAO 6:45 HAHAHAHHAA 19:49 OMG 23:47 OMHHHHHHHHHHHHHTGGG
i bloody knew it
i think its einstein  HUMZA!!!!😂 😂 😂 😂
the man is da fardaaaa
5:46 WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
The woman
11:27 my names reuben lets fucking go most people spell reuben like with no e so Ruben but less go u spelt it right
I KNEW IT. I K N E W IT
I knew
Samuel eto
Now that the true parents were revealed, it would've been lovely to hear the mothers letter to young Ziggy <33
yuhhhh I called it lmao k
just for reference, in this vid the most times that the camera cut to ziggy's face was when his real parent was speaking, it kinda makes it obvious/gives it away based off that. especially in the beginning, that's actually the only times the camera would cut to his face was when they were speaking
AJ said “I forget people are human” 🤣🤣🤣
SHARKY??
Are we ignoring the fact that one of them is having a baby
Brooo i Saïd it’s the white woman😭
Woman
or niko
gotta be #4
is kenny the one who is gonna have a kid?
“Oh so he’s a grown man “ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If AJ is dumb pin my comment Beta!
5
We need to blow niko up🔥🔥😭my guy is super funny
OG said at 3:00 Ziggy was his first son, and at 9:48 said Ziggy had a younger brother. He shdve been out time ago
Its the dad 20:58
i think its the lady
Number 5 100% the mother
I think it’s 5 mainly because she said ziggy has 4 brothers and when she slipped up it sounded like my mom just slipping up with my brothers names
why does number 1 look like toby from sidemen
prob the man
kenny is the new father of beta squad and has his first child after the last dating video o AJ
Hamza 😂😂😂😂😂
yes hamza
Kenny‘s starting with his plan of 13 children. Congrats 🎉
4
i guessed it was the last woman as soon as ziggy said “blimming” haha the mother sounded posh when she spoke so i put 2+2 together
I bet niko is having the child and he will make a video saying ‘this is how i tricked the world into believing i had a baby ‘
My jaw dropped at the reveal lol.
I honestly think the mom jumbled her words together because she was trying to say "ziggy's favorite" and instead ran them together and said Zay haha
Its defo niko having a yute
Chunks has to be the one having the kid he gets all the puss
I think it's number 4 but my sister says 2😂😂
the man
No way AJ is pregnant
After the 10quid I knew she was the mother
it’s 4
You should do something about that ksi bloke he can’t be saying that if he can we should call every black person the n word and it’s okay
Do a part two
Chunks needs to humble
THE MOTHER WITH THE WHITE
ENDING HAD ME ROLLING😂😂
I would never have guessed it was the yt woman looool
i think its 2
I really thought number 4 was the father because he's the first one who mentioned Ziggy's full name. I was not even interested in number 5 because I was soo sure number 4 was the parent
man
It was clearly number 5 the whole time 😂
Why they got Thierry henry on here 😭
Number 2 is either a really good actor, or the actual mom.
12:05 A man of culture I see.
I’m pretty sure the man is the father as my guy was smiling every 2 seconds at the start as if everyone else there had made up random stuff and waffled throughout the whole thing.
But shes white
who is having a kid omg
i think its 4 lmao
white woman
When she said the meaning behind the name, i automically knew
4
How is no one talking about how one of them is having a child 5:48
Congrats to whoever it is (I feel its sharky)
It was so obvious if you pay attention to accents😂
the dad
I thought it was number 2, the ending was really shocking
Guess who is having a child amongst the squad
Is everyone gonna ignore the fact that sharky might have a son ???
4
thought is was the guy in the bomber jacket...
i knew it was number 5 bcs she said that ziggy had siblings and that sibling could be named zay and my mom always mixes me and my siblings name so thats why
the mother and son where really cute
Niko the US loves you my friend
MADDD that was the hardest, I thought it was the other woman the whole time I'm shockedddd
21:15 it’s 4 i bet
Gotta be 4  ???????
3:58 “shoutout Callux” 💀💀💀💀
i was sure it was 2!
Hamza
I think it’s ziggys dad
21:02 i think it was 5 😭
Holy shit I was right  damnnnnn
4
Beta squad are the perfect people to watch whilst eating
Octopus prime😂
I think its number 3! lmaoo the set was awful lmaaaaaaaaoooooooooooooooooooo!!
When she explained the meaning of his name I knew it hahahaha
the shared accent between mother and son should've given it away, but even i got sent!
Has to be either Niko or Kenny to have their 1st child
[spoilers]    When it was the birthday thing it went: 2: August 4: 28th 5. 28th of august  After that I was sure that 5 was not the parent, the odds of that happening are very low.
Number 2
i think its number 4 but its so hard cos number 2 believable 2
4
4
yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 9/04/2023
I KNEW IT, got it right
who having a baby
Hand on heart  This is dead fam
😂😂
The guy
I honestly think it’s the lady😊
fam none of us wanna watch u guys eat spiced up chicken,we wanna watch mafia
number 4
the guy
that mad
Mines My birthday is June 28th day 🎉
AJ apologizing was so kewt tho 😩😩♥️
i thought number 4 all way through
suscribe
Isnt ziggy that dog from jojos
Number 2
Is there any chance of getting hp, filly and darkest man into Beta Squad?
They need to do this with a teen cuz they are more distanced then little kids so it is harder
You guys gonna say anything about the sidemen and what happened or back up ur friends or anything aren’t you guys Asian ?
22:50 is so funny how niko made ziggy cover his ears
I think niko's having a child
24:20  - I forget that people are human  AJ
4 defo
Women
I knew it was her from the start
The ending shocked me
2
Another banger 😂❤
I swear, Niko's the best
WHO TF IS HAVING CHILD?!?!?!
i knew it , number 5 had too much ziggy lore
Hamza Einstein
N•3
I would've bet everything it was number 4.😮😮
Beta Squad Cum Chalice Challenge? Now way bro!
5
The second ziggy said ‘blimey’ I knew his mum was the lady! Very posh😂😂
Even though they were joking about everyone knowing each other. It would be interesting if they had one of these where everyone was actually related to the kid. So like a parent, uncle, auntie, godparent, and an older sibling. That would make things interesting.
Who is this hamza yout? 😂
Nah, it was definetely Einstein. By his moustache you can see, that he's fcking Polish or smth, so Hamza in Polish is Zay in English. Einstein tricked all of you
I knew they got it wrong when he sold niko the toy, reason being is because when they asked her about the toy she said she was confused because that toy isnt really that important to him and it was reflected when he sold it for 5 pounds
Pls make a "guess the cancer patient"
omg whooooo is having a child?????? oooooo i feel like its lowkey Kenny or Sharky but i cant imagine AJ, Niko, Chukz having one😅
I love this
Make number 1 one of the crew
The mum even gave the birth speech and y’all fumbled the bag 🤣🤣
I think its Chunkz whos having a child
Number 5
I knew from the start. It's a certain subtle but unmistakable motherly vibe that you catch.  Anyway, they all got it wrong. So is Niko going to knock everyone out, including himself?
I swear his mum and him look identical no idea how they fumbled this one And Ziggys reaction to her stories
4
Every p ⭐️’s child rn
i think its the dad
I knew it was her from the very start 😂
You could tell by his cadence he spoke exactly like his mum
I think its number 4
I'm sorry, who's having a baby?
Its number 4
Bro why she look like Lamar jackson😂
man his name is hazma lol i need my real dad was he probally thinkin
My name is hamza😭😭
It’s the mom
Thought it was 2
AHAHAHAHA I CANT WITH THEIR REACTION BRO WHEN THEY REALISED THAT THEY GOT ZIGGYS REAL MOM OUT 😭😭
His mom a baddie too ong
its 4
I knew it was 5, look at the nose man!
number 4 must be the dad
I knew it was her it’s the eyes and when they smile
first guy needs to be part of beta squad
Wasn’t ziggy or hamza the guy that roasted nella rose
4
bro said hamza my name
guessed 5 that kids wide hair curls( 2c) and hair colour gave it a way
The fourth  guys favourite word is deffo injustice 💀
3:59 was also thinking Ziggy is Niko jr
I knew she was the mom. One of her other kids must be named Zay. Moms always get their kids confused lol
i knew it from the start
4
"His name is Hamza" pause
Nice vid😂
Guess the black person PLEASE
Now that i went back I could actually see ziggy noding his head when his mom was telling the story about the cake
I knew it was she said say cause she has other kids and it makes sense if they all had z names and parent mistake their kids name all the time
its deff da mum
Number 4 looking like Thierry Henry
I feel like it’s 4
Sharky has a child?
I haven't watched the reveal and I think that's definitely number four
4
i knew from the jumppppp finally got one of these right 🤣
Come on!! who’s having a kid?
i think its 2
F
4's the dad
The brudda said he had ziggy at 28 and is 37 and ziggy is 8 what
Ziggy has a bright futute
So basically sharky is about to have a child
I don't think those were extra comments 😭😭that's generally what a mom would say if her son had an extreme sweet tooth, SHE HAS TO BE THE PARENT!!
the woman
I think chunks or kenny is haveing a child
number 4
They followed AJ's lead with taking out the mom. Don't trust a rat🤣
I knew it was 5
“Einstein we don’t want no theories just straight how you got him”😭😭😭 AJ is too jokes
"They're too old"😂😂
2
4
number 4
hi
I think the Jamaican woman is the mom
I KNEW IT SHE WAS THE MOTHER FFS 23:48
MOM
It was obviously number 5, she was so relaxed when the others were talking and I can’t believe they voted her out it quite obvious 😅
This was a GREAT video also can’t wait for yous to reveal who the parent is at 6 mill!!!!
i think it’s the black guy with the leather jacket is the parent
I KNEW IT WAS HER LMFAOOOO
I think it's number 4 tbh
5
I've never been so hyped for a trailer in my life HOT WINGS NEXT WEEK BABY
khan
😂 Hamza
So are we juss gonna skip over the fact that one of them is having a child … mmh maybe Niko ??😭 5:48 shii nvm it’s sharky maybe..?19:54
Number4
*none*
kenny is 100% having the child
4
I called it from the beginning and jumped out my seat at the end screaming I told you so
WHICH ONE IS FINNA HAVE A BETA BABY???
I’ve been saying 5 is the mom the whole video
Congratulations to Sharky and his kid 🎉🎉🎉
I knew it
Number 2 was good
Number 4
ziggys mom kinda badd
It’s number 2 the one that said he has a sweet tooth
MY opinion it the motherrrr I didnt finjsh the video yet soo
1
4
I knew it cus she spoke so posh and more gentle compared to everyone else and ziggy sounded the same way for a child
It's Chunkz who's having a child. Bet.
I guessed right
"Ayo its me"
Cant wait for miniminter to react to this 😂❤
The mum and son have the same accent so it was obvious
15:10 he’s definitely the parent
4 my arse
i guessed correctly bcz i felt like ive seen that part somewhere, not anytime recent tho
We wanna see another episode of FINDING THE GOLD DIGGER.... NIKO EDITION
I think the dad is number 4
Remember when she was saying Ziggy didn’t really care about the toy? That was proof, because he sold it to Niko.
I thought the title said “match the pervert to the child” 💀
I think ur wrong its the girl with curly hair
I felt 5 for real 🤣🤣
i think it’s number 4
Women with glasses
NUMBER 5 ❤❤
num 4
I think its the white woman who you kicked out
that was such an unexpected endinggg and also i have the same birthday as ziggy
It was so obvious that she was the mom....They overlooked her cause she was white but it was obvious...One of the few times I got it right though...🥰
I knew it was 5 lmao, especially when he sold his toy (backed up the mum's story)
i thought it was kanye west
Niko is the Lads Dad🤣
Truly I'm on 21 minutes of the video and I still think it's number 5 the white lady sharks.
Bro that one was soo obvious, Her facial features are the same as the kid. Beta Squad dumb lol. Also the story in regards to his birth.
I promise you she was my first choice after the hospital story!
i swore it was 4
The woman
damn i really thought it was 2
Niko literally bought "his favorite toy" for 10 pound after 5 said that he didn't have a favorite toy except his bear at home in bed 😂😂😂 how did they not get it 😂😂😂
Was I the only one thinking number four was the father ?..😅
Boring contestants ngl
It clearly wasn't number 4 because he said he had Ziggy at 28 and he said he's 37 Ziggy is 8 so it clearly wasn't number 4.
4
On god I have not seen the reveal (21:03) but i think its the guy 🤷‍♂
WHAT DO U MEAN ONE OF U LOT IS HAVIN A CHILD
imma say the parent is 4
4 niko vids in 1 week, really can’t complain 🐐 🐐 🐐
Number 4
24:18 I see a headhog
i kinda expected her to be the mom cos he looks mixed 😭
I think it’s number 2
It's Kenny! Kenny is going to be a dad is my guess 😊
the swan guy
but is one of the beta squad members really having a child?
the letter round is always cringe but good video concept non the less
Anyone of them having a kid, my guess is the one who’s dad is basically like an old Somali man 🤣    Kenny who has a million siblings
It's defo Kenny or Sharkey who are gonna be a parent ❤
Sharky’s having a baby so obvious
So sorry but why’s no one talking about one of the members being a dad??????💀
W
Commenting before the reveal i think its the guy with black leather jacket
4 black brudda
I think it's the first woman
4
I FOR REAL THOUGHT IT WASNT HER BUT WHEN HE SOLD THE TOY TO NIKO THATS WHEN I KNEW.
i think its 5
WTH is NO,2 man she is literally disgusting. Fat, always hands in her pockets, the way she speaks bruh so disgusting! But I love the beta squad! I love you guys so much and can't wait for the next vid!
Best  Video of beta squad So far this year 😂😂❤
is no one gonna talk about sharky completely destroying the kids favourite toy after niko bought it for 10 pounds
I was actually convinced it was number4😭
i knew it was number 5 because it is common for a mum to get the names wrong of her children plus she said that isnt his favourite toy and he just sold it to nicko 😂😂
How’s the mum white
Has to be four
alhamdulilah for beta squad youtube has been dry for the past week
the bloke
Sharky congratulations!!God Bless You and your family!!🙌
Bruh it’s so the lady
That was the BIGGEST plot twist of all time
Number 2
Sharkys having a baby
#onlyinserbia
I knew it was number 5 from the start.
where do they find these people 💀it’s like a cast for a wild programme every time
I think it’s number 4
i knew it was her as soon as he said blimming
20:25 - Chunkz 'I'm gonna stay quiet' LOL. The irony. Plodder
u can literally see her face when she was talking abt ezekiel.
Number two
Number 4
when that lady said Ziggy didn't have much attachment to his toys and then he went and sold it for 10 pounds the round after I knew they fucked up
I  think the perent is number 4
Could tell from round 2 it was her :)
What an L  It was obviously number 5
SOMEONE IN BETA SQUAD HAS A CHILD?????
I relate so hard when aj said „I forget people are human sometimes“ 😭
I think #5 is the mother
The way Aj immediately apologized and kept saying sorry was so cute god bless him
4 is the one
the woman duh
i just need to know if ziggy got his toy back
That was so unexpected
We need a more beta squad channel we can't wait all week for one video 🥺
Broooo the kid even sold of his toy, Justice for Mum😂
Daddy Kenny
I KNEW IT!
24:10 finally found a time where aj isn't edited taller
4
yk its funny I guessed that shii right just by the similar accents
Honestly, Nr. 5 had me either way when she said his name had a religious meaning, cuz you don't fck'n say that shit and then lie😂
Chunk, probs the one having a child
I knew she was the mum, I just get this aura coming from both of them, obv they've got the same complexion and idk the mum seemed fairly well dressed and I feel like she dressed him as well and the age dynamic just seemed right. She also had the best responses and overall looked family the most.
i knew it thats all im saying man
that kid bout to be the most famous kid in his whole school
I knew it was 5 She seemed more convincing
she literally said that its not his favorite toy  and the boy proceeds to selling it for 10 pounds ....
4
Hamza is mad
Very good video
It's probably the guy he's definitely the dad  The fact that it ended with them voting 4, he seemed convincing after they got 5 out. I originally thought 5 was his mum so yeah
4
Kids cannot lie, this child vibrates at the same frequency as the guy with the black jacket...you know the cool guy vybe, and black jacket seems pretty cool as a Dad !
Plot twist: The beta squad kidnapped an 8 year old boy for the sake of content😂😂😂
That's the mom
Shush number 2
It’s defo Niko
Where did Einstein come from 😂
l knew it was her cause she mentioned how he had no attachment to the toy. then he easily sold it to Niko.
wtf i didn't expect her
i think it’s the lady in the sweater
"His name is Hamza" wtf bro
Number 4
icl i got sent too...this one was good
I knew it was 5 because that’s the kid who plays for Crystal Palace
Number 4
OJ correcting himself from Ezekiel to Ziggy was a touch of genius!
number 5
"niko is old" :)
black man
Niko is going to be a father
Need more videos like these aint nothing better than this series
I knew it was her because she said ziggy didn’t care much about the toy and 5 minutes later he was ready to sell it for 5 pounds while the others said he was emotional about it
One of you is having a child? Omg they’ll have the best 4 uncles ever 🎉🎉🎉
Bro I just wish I can be in one of there videos 😢
Number 4
Sharky is having a child
Number 5 just kept yapping
It was obvious
i think it’s the white women
I think its number 2
0:39 "perfect" 💀
Number 4
Ziggy is so cuteee
It was so obvious it was her 😂😂
When number 1 called the yute  "Hamza" it was done 🤣🤣🤣
i think it is number 4
kennys having the child
4
When sharky cracked the joke about toby had me on the floor 😂
I paused the video when they said comment. I feel like It is 5 and they voted her out. She said zay but didn't  slipped up coz she said she has 4 kids. Her emotion when said that birth story, It was moving.
I KNEW ITTRRRRTTTT
The woman obviously
Before reveal ... I think it's 5
This must have been so weird for the kid having strangers make up stories about him :/
5 gonna be the parent. 2 and 4 are trying too hard
I love your vids , support both NDL and sharknation and I'm subscribed to everyone in the group ,just never stop posting ❤
19:47 is them basically saying sharky is the beta squad parent if anyone was wondering
you should of known because when he's mother was telling a quick story about him he was nodding like crazy
Oml I guessed right for once
i knew it
Who do you guys think is having a baby 😭
Idk who it might be 😮😮
I thought it was 4
I FEEL LIKE THE PARENT IS SHARKY IDK
Knew the mother as soon as she spoke. Common BSquad.
NAHHH I WANT THE CHJILD TO BE A PART OF THE BETYA SQUAD U MUST POST A BABY SHOWER / GENDER REVEALL PLLLSSSSS
5
Great video but could have had a guest of someone who’s a father like Harry pinero or Stevo the madman
Niko i might as well buy that toy of u to remind me of aj
i always thought it was 5
Number 5 is the definition of MILF
the man is the dad
They fr ruined the 6 mill reveal
First beta squad parent definitely Kenny
.
They never fail to entertain mate😂❤
it was so clearly 5 bruh
Ngl I knew she was the mum. Why did NO ONE pick up on a white woman saying the word "Yam?!"   At the point I KNEW she had black family/husband 😂
I knew it was her from the start, they have the same eyes and smile.
Kenny
I think it’s no. 5
I was actually thinking that number 5 is the mom cuz her face looks similar to Ziggy’s, and almost got it right
sharky  is  unkal
That was amazing! I was sold on parent 4 the whole episode, surprised I was wrong.
My mouth dropped...nah this was good.
amazing video as always, trash thumbnail this time tho lol
I think its 4
It's hard?, they all look the Same"
I think sharky is having the child
Wait. Is one of them seriously having a child? 5:43
Nah was between 4-5 the whole time then u chucked 5 was like cool 4 then
Niko is so fatherly 😭😭
It’s number 2 the mum
You just know Niko will make a great dad
Chunkz we’re waiting for an apology alluah baba
I think its Niko still
the mum is the parent
I thing it was the third girl who said zay and that you voted them out to early and that neither of these to are the parent but if not her then the man who had the son at 16.
I think number 1 is the dad. He's the only one who said 2015
I knew it was 5 it was clear
Beta Squad Baby! 👀👀 I think it's Kenny, I don't know why, I just got a feeling 👶
#'s 3 and 1 were out from the get-go.  At first I believed #2, then I was with #5 for a few reasons.  She threw me off a couple of times then I went back to #2.  I should have known it was really #5 when she avoided creating a conflict between her son's "two best" friends.  The way she said his birthday as well, was a giveaway.  #4 had me too but then I understood why.  He must be "the fun uncle."  I re-watched and realized how heartbroken Ziggy sounded when the guys talked to him immediately after they sent his mother away.  His spunk disappeared.  He also had his head in a position as if he was hiding.
By the way I'm ziggy
23:43 you step back😂
the mum was hot
its got to be number 2
I think it's no4
He’s def Humza
probably the hardest one yet i genuinely thought it would be the last woman standing
Number 4
Who is the parenting beta squde tell me please
Nah for some reason I won’t be surprise if the beta squad kid turns out to be a pet
Think it would be an amazing addition to the awkward comedy part of voting them off but think as they vote for someone to go out they should point at them and then hold it 😂
21:04 I think it's Number 4. Have to see if it's right or not. Edit: Did not see that coming. *ABSOLUTE BONKERS!!!*
The person they chose Said at the start that he was 37 and had ziggy when he was 28. Right at the start ziggy Said he was 8. If the person was ziggys dad wouldnt he be 9 then?
I think it's the women is a liar and the guy is saying the truth
are we not talking abt the fact that someone’s gonna be a father?? who do y’all think it’s gonna be !!
I knew it was that lady from the cake story, seemed to real😂
Comments before seeing the result think it’s the 2nd woman all day
That was so unexpected
Sussy niko
4
1:54 5:25 19:46
I thought it was niko
why sharky kinda checkin out the kid in the thumbail doe
Well Number 5 did say that the kid wasn't really attached to the toy. And he sold it for £10 so there you have it.
number 5
Awww
Mafia please
The final reveal... Now when I say my  jaw dropped, I literally mean  my jaw *D R O P P E D*
I think it's the man😭😭
"Can't connect with the 8 year olds Sidemen" They can't connect with anyone lmao
before I’ve seen the end it is definitely number 5
well, number 5 said ziggy wasnt all that attached to his toy, he did sell it for 10 quid to be fair😭
4
3
2 is the mom
Firstly I thought it was the white mum but that Zay bit threw me, although, all mums call their children the wrong names😂
Niko is the father
How tf did they find a Thierry Henry look a like
I think its the buzzcut guy
I KNEW IT.
Seriously guys, I think Kenny is having a child
Four
Parents mess up their kids’ names all the time 😂 and she said he’s one of a few siblings so it’s totally understandable. The best friends, the name and birth story, I knew from the jump. The others were good tho
I'm watching this at 5:53, What if 4 and 5 are the parents?
Number 2
I knew it from the beginning
8:57 BOMBASTIC WIDE EYE
at first i was thinking 5 but since she got eliminated imma say 4
i think its 4
INJUSTICE LEAGUE!!!
It was obvious it was her because she was the only one that said that the toy wasn't Ziggy's favourite and then later one he straight up sold it to Niko without even thinking about it😂
We all know its kenny thats having a child cus nico like nah AJ too short chunks defintly not getting a child and sharky always been single.
Number 5 is the mother
21:08 mom
I think it is dreadlocks
Hilarious!
U DONT EXIST
Ziggy saying sidemen is too old makes me feel old wtf 😂😭
big up ziggy
Number four
its number 2
i said it was the parent the second they came in. I KNEW IT
Sharky is having a kid lol gg AJ
The moment she said he’s not attached to any toy and that same round he sold the toy, I was more convinced she was his mum.
sharky has the baby
Ziggy is a proper legend, absolutely loved him
HIS NAME IS HAMZA. BRUH. 😂
It was obvious
0:38perfect? huh?
4
Studio tour? ...
Congratulations sharky on the kid🥳
'There was no two ways about it' 'Shoutout callux'   😂😂😂😂
#4
No one’s talking about the unskippable ads they’re making stupid money on😭
If you're reading this, you are already special - no matter what. This is just a reminder that you are valued and appreciated, and I hope you have a wonderful day!
It was so obviously number 5, I don't understand why they were so surprised!
5
2
lol
4
I knew it ahahah
Is chunkz the parent? I'm calling it.
HOW NUMBER 5!!!!!!
I can’t believe they voted her out! She looks like him .
I knew it was her as soon as he traded a toy that they both said was priceless but she said he was not massively attached too
Different video idea! Make a video where you have 5 parents and there child. One of the 5 participants isn’t the parent of that child. But the parents have to convince you that that child doesn’t belong to them.
its the guy no.4
Lol
number two
Number 2
The guy
Number 4
The middle aged woman, taking it so serious, she’s so CRINGE
Might just be me, but does oj kinda look like Thierry Henry.
0:11 EDP when he wants a cupcake
Is no one gonna talk about 5:50 ?
Can't lie. When I was watching this episode, I got a notification saying my friend "hamza" posted a new story on snapchat. Ain't that crazy🤔🤔
I THINK ITS #4
So number 4 let his under 8 year old child feed a fucking swan and they think he's the father?
Number 5 . I didn’t finish the video but I think it’s number 5
Sharky, we are happy that you are going to be a father!!
The fact that they are voting people out for getting the name wrong my parents be calling me 20 different names til they remember my actual name 😭
DARKEST JUST GOT MARRIED SO MU GUESS HE'S HAVING A YUT 🎉
2
#5
I knew she was the parent, he’s so well spoken for his age 😂
it is the guy with the black coat
I think Sharky is having a child. Watch 19:47, where AJ states that Sharky 'already [has]' a kid, to be met with a shifty look from the man in question and silencing talk from Chunkz.
KNEW ITTT
I’d laugh so hard if secret agent Bradley was in this video
Number 5
I miss-read the thumbnail to "who is pregnant"
It was clear that she was the parent because she said ziggy doesn't have a favorite toy and ziggy  sold that toy for 10£
Thought I’d was 5 I can’t lie  Edit: Oh it’s actually 5 rah
No offense this vidoe broke my insomnia today, fell asleep during this. Get darkest filly and harry on
yo guys I'm a big fan of yours, all the way from South Africa. watch all you stuff, just wanted to know when you are doing mafia again?
i guessed right bc the accent was most similar
I swear lady in the white is he’s mum , but also the lady who mentioned why she named him Ziggy
They should have brought Dective Bradley into this for even more banter.
💀😂😂man said hamza, the second guy killed me
😎I knew it!!! I knew they didn’t want someone obvious. 😅
I KNEW IT WAS HERR bro, the only other option is her being a really good actor cause everything made total sense 😭😭
I think the white Lady who left is the mother 🥲
they never miss a week wow
khan
Bruh , knew it as soon as she came in , he light skinned bro ,cmon lol
Number 4
Chunks that rasict joke ksi made was bare funny init the way u found it so funny was jokes 🙈
sharky: “your eight?   perfect “
I knew it was her all info was adding up n she messed up by saying 3 names that wat a mother does sometimes lol
So who’s having the baby
I knew it was number 5 😭
I think nikos thé dad
BLACK DAD!!!
Now this is one video I was WAYYYYYY OFFF
It's no.5 it's bate!  Edit: I knew it 🤣
I'm sure Real Parents can't even answer these questions. At least my dad can't 😂😂
I honestly thought that was obvious it was her
Someones having a child 🤔
That was honestly the most obvious one yet
I thinks it’s Einstein ez
2
Yeah Kenny definitely the one with the jit , ik he shoot the club up 60/40 😂😂😂😂 so predictable but we still gone help get to the 6 million brodie
4 broooo! 😊
Knowing Hebrew the moment she said "god will strengthen" it was game over for me, I've stayed through the end cuz it was 🔥🔥🔥
Number 1 got caught way too fast 😂😂
ziggy, every one of the contestants, the mom, aj and niko were all so funny 😂
KENNY IS HAVING A BABY🤌🤌🤌🔥
I can finally eat!!
women closest to the kid (guess)
i think it is the guy that is the dad, cus why would he sell the toy if it meant alot as the woman said?
I think sharky is the dad
Number 2 ya idiots
Omg Ziggy,  he’s in my school
Aj is 31? He looks very young he could pass as 17
Zigge means hamza😂
This is the most shocking episode 💀
Hamza took me out😭😭😂
ahaha wow. they did it again! great video regardless lmao
17:36 LMAO
At first I thought it was glasses lady now I think it’s soccer mom because she said the toy not that important and he just sold it for 10 measly dollars
Number 1 is such a bad liar man😂😂
four
STOPP DROPPPINGGGGG BANGERRSSS
AJ tricked me. I'm shame my self😊😊
The story behind his name sold it for me
i thought the boys would pick up how ziggy and his mother speak straight away, for an 8 year old he seemed very intelligent and had a similar speaking pattern to his mother
it war pretty obvious ngl
Five
Knew it was them right when you voted em off
when number 5 got the name wrong i knew it was an accident bc she has 3 other kids and my mom always gets our names wrong
5
I didn’t even guess that that was the parent!The other woman acted So well but suprisingly it was her
I knew it was her all along!!
A foreign translation is hilarious
I can't lie but I feel AJ is right to number 5 . And also then name hamz got number 1and 5 I can't wait to watch until end😅
Hamza real talk would be such a cool name though.
Number 4
i need 1st guy @ 😔😔😔
I knew it was her bro
idk😅
Bro I like how AJ said that you're not father was bad man 😅😅😅 lol
Best Beta Squad vid ever
'i forget that people are human' - AJ
I think it’s number 2
No.4 was lying straight through his teeth and he kept on stuttering you could tell he was tryna make bs up No.5 was convincing and seemed genuine throughout
Called it in the second round but more importantly..  Is Zigs looking for a step dad? lol
Great content as usual
As soon as she mentioned her little boys best friends. I knew it 🙏🏻
I knew it was her!!! Because they spoke with similar accents 😅
❤
I think it's number 5 because it sounded like she said Zay as a nickname, and it came out naturally. She also said that he didn't really care about his toys that much and then he sold it for 10 euros. Also, I think she just has so many similar features to Ziggy like her eyes, nose and lips. She just looks like Mum to me, I'll be surprised if it's not her.
its obviously 4
21:22 it has to be 4
😮
I knew it was the mom cause for the toys she said it was for the bath and I loved trying to float Lego's in bath. Plus the other two used the toys to prove Ziggy's favourite shows like DC and transformers she didn't which immediately gave it away for me.😊😊😊
bro i knew it was her lmfao also when she said zay that could easily be short for Xavier jus like ziggy
the kid said he’s 8 and number 4 said he’s 37 and had him at 28 which means the kid would be 11
I knew it was 5. My mum used to mix up my name with my brothers all the time growing up
When AJ said "I forget that people are human" hiding under the table. I felt that.
Bruh I really hope my man sharky isn’t having this child 😭.
I knew it was number 5!!! Was mad they voted her off because she said Zay
I think it’s the white lady on the end.
They didn’t see her facial expression when AJ said what he said?? I think it was a massive tell.
Niko hitting the goku with drip pose in the thumbnail is elite 😂
Ziggy understood  the assignment , my man was giving NO clue ! That was good Ziggy ❤
Number 4
the final reveal had me shocked
WAITTTTT!! someone in the beta squad is having a child
I knew it it was her cuz she was js smiling the whole time like she knew they ain gon pick her
This one threw me off fr real..damn
Knew it was 5! Right from the birth story
It's the girl 2
when she called him "Zay" thats when I KNEW thats his mom
istg i called it
I knew it the whole timeeee
Finally its back! And please stop the cooking series
i guessed it right 😎
13:44
Beta squad carrying
looool i swear if it’s not number 4 😭 on about this one’s the toughest they’ve had HOW
aj: alright les meet de child everyone: oh                     woah                    wat da hell                    dat sounds crazy 🤣😅😭🖖
How I knew it was number 5 from the start is crazy, the name slip just reminded me of my parent's personal name for me, i thought it was cute and its kind of similar to his actual name.
the dad
Sharky's the one having a kid??😭
Congrats Sharky.
Sharky has a child
Best type of beta squad videos
You should make Beta+, like side+ but betar
Number 4
the dad is no 4
im the father. love you ziggy
its te mum \
QUANTUM THEORY AJ BE SERIOUS RN LMAOOSJSKS
4 is dad
the child announcement??! 💀 LOOL they better start running up the subscriber count i’m being serious
the real mother even said "the toy was not his favourite" that's why Ziggy tradeded it off
the way they were NOT entertaining einstein today 😭💀 uno they were serious cuz they usually would’ve mocked it and dragged out the one bait character for the bants for much longer lmao
4
6:32 I am dying 😂😂😂😂
chunkz and sharky acc giggling when he said hamza yeah i was sentttt LMAO 😭
I THINK NIKO OR KENNY IS HAVING A CHILD
lmaoo
bro this video actually had me trippin 😭 best one so far 🙌
You guys need to be more respectful to your guests. Learn to read body language.
im sure kenny is the one having a child
knew it was her all along
Ay yo why did sharky say perfect when the kid said he was 8
Dude on the right
What did the guy with the cake do to deserve that 💀💀
i think it has to be 4
9:18 Ziggy’s face 🤣🤣 He was so proud of the chocolate cake incident
The white woman defo clocked the guy copied her said injustice and stuck with it and it defo through her off her story
When ziggy sold his toy then it just made sense for me, cuz the real mom said that ziggy don't have any favourite toy while the others were asserting that he loved the toy and everything
Bro don't why but I knew and felt no 5 is the parent I don't believe I nailed that😲
4
I thought he resembled his parent. So I wasn't surprised
#5
Beta squad never miss consistent bangers.
i think its parent 4 or einstein adopted him
hell yea beta squad made a episode for all the nonces to watch
This one was no challenge. I got it correct within the first 2 minutes. Look at 5's face here: 1:20. As soon as I saw this I was like, "There's the mom!" 😂
that’s literally nikos child 😭😭
Deffo 4 21:27
I thought it was four since the beginning so I picked him
WHY VOTE NUMBER 3 OUT????
See ya later Hamza😂😂😂😝
Beta squad member having a child?!? Thats CRAZY damn. My top 2 guesses would be Aj or Kenny!
😂😂😂
So is no one going to talk about what member is having a child? 👁️👄👁️
Na this one was hard I thought it was black guy also. 😂😭
Me at 16:25 “my daddy name zay” 😂😂🤣
21:06 im unsure im just going to guy with the dude
This was the toughest one yet!!   Ain’t no way anyone guessed her. 💯
You guys should make a video with Jude Bellingham
Once you’ve finished the video, go back and watch the parent’s reaction to AJ cursing… 13:40
Wow this was really good
Aj gave us a clue b4 6 million
i think its 5
I love me some Nico
The guy
I knew it was the woman!  Her stumbling over her words was just her stumbling like we all do sometimes. Shes human people do that. When you voted her out i couldn't believe it and i said out loud that you just voted out the mum.  Also she's on a show in front of a camera doesn't make it easier. She was probably nervous. Also i thought it was her because the other guy was black and it was abit too obvious. I felt like the show was trying to fool you.  The woman in the white sweater never even crossed my mind. She was doing too much.  I knew it was the last woman. She just had a genuine mess up.. Well im done bigging myself up. Hehe
I thought Niko was the parent
The other two were writing English essays Tryna link the toy and why he likes it
I knew it was her the whole time they have the same nose
After #5 said two best friend names I knew it was her
Icl I think it’s dat black bold man ibr 21:04
you guys should try to find ethans dad too
My man said he forgets that people are human 😂😂😂😂😂
i had a feeling it was her
I think it’s the black leather jacket giy
well shit
Niko's the Dad
it was so obviously #5 cause unlike the others she never really had to think about her stories. either shes an incredible actress or shes the mother
I think Ziggy's parent is number 2
5:48 now I’m confused if this is real or not 🧍🏻‍♀️because also 19:48 was a little something possibly too 👀
the guy my guess
2
I finally got one right!! 😂 knew it cos he has similar eyes to his mama!
Wow! Actually got it right this time.
Why do they sound like that
3
yo ya'll its has to be niko or kenny who is getting a baby honestly or my bet is nikooooo
4
Beta squad baby?????? For some weird reason, I feel like AJ is the one having the baby. Idk anything about the lads or if they're in relationships but that's my guess. AJ has always been so wholesome when they have kids in videos and I think he'd be a great dad
I died when they started calling him Hamza 💀
Why is no one talking about the fact that one of them is having a child wtf
21:00 number 4 easily
I knew it was the white woman as soon as ziggy said “blimming” 😂
as soon as he gave away his toy for £10 i knew #5 was the parent lmao
When she waffle about football made me realise
i knew she was ziggys mom from even before she started talking
I think its is the guy
WAIT ONE OF THE BETA SQUAD MEMBERS IS HVONG A KID
Ever since the chocolate cake story that Number 5 spoke about in Round 2, I knew she was the parent. And once I saw they had the same eyes, I was like this was so easy it to figure out it was her. So when the guys got her out cuz she was slipping on her words, I was like cuz Y’ALL AINT LET HER FINISH TALKING LMAOOOO 🤣🤣🤣 They took her out too quick lol
its 4
Ziggy parent is soo sexy..😍😋
"How old are you Ziggy?" "8" "Perfect" ...
It was so obviously 5 because of how well spoken they both was and when she said yammed, that was the dad rubbing off on her
Number 4
Is no one clicking the kid literally said his name in the beginning 😭
Zay = Ziggy + Toy
I thought it was O.J. at first but when I saw who it was, I was shocked!!
5:46 OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG, HYPE TO SEE WHO IS! Wait, no way... on 19:49 AJ laked it already???
Number Two
I think it is the girl at the end
Neighbour einstein😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀
Your videos are so cool never give up keep it up!❤
What’s fives @ tho?
Hamza
HAMZAA🤣🤣🤣
I bet the first guy to have a baby is chunkz cuz hes been carrying that sht for yrs
WHYS NOONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT SOMEONES GONNA BE A PARENT
beta squad videos just keeps on getting better
Who in Beta Squad is gonna be a dad?????!
Think it's no.5, she just called him a nickname or something
the last of us part 3 trailer I think the man is
The sad thing about this video is that iqtidar khan aka einstein said the name Hamza out of reflex as it is the name of his grandson that has passed away which is really sad 😢😢
it’s the girl - me and jas
Hear me out 👀 the mum though
22:50 best part for me 😂
2
wait is AJ actually 31?? i swear i thought that was just a joke every time niko talk ab it. if so, he don’t look anywhere near jt 😂😂😂
Holy we got finnesed 😂
WHATS YOUR NAME ? Ezekiel
i think the first baby will be chunks because hes the only one that looks pregnant
THE WAY MY MOUTH DROPPED WHEN I SAW THAT THE MOTHER WAS SO DEFERENT AND DIDN’T EVEN LOOK CLOSE TI THE CHILD WHATTTTTTTT MY MOUTH IS DROPPED MY JAW IS ON THE FLOOR
DANG, What a video
I’m pretty sure it’s number 5 cuz her story is just told in a way that she’s reliving the moment
4
The guy in the top two
I knew it! They look alike for jeez sake
4 is the dad i think 21:07
OJ!!!
am i the only one who feels like it was so obvious it was no. 5
Number 5 was the mom but they voted her out 21:20
Producers got Einsteins reboot card
Beta squad the new sidemen🤣
12:28 / 25:12
I think it’s 4. Sharky asked for it 😅
2
this shit is so much better now without the interviews constantly.
When niko went up to have his say on ziggy’s favourite toy, we all knew what was coming when he looked at aj instantly 😂😂
He’s the dad
number 4
I cant believe one of the beta squad have a child
I knew it was a bad call to judge who’s the parent by miss saying the name because that’s what parents do especially if they have other kids
I think it’s the dude(4)  because if the kid was into transformers then you would get him a transformer not Lego, and there is Lego dc toys so number 4s story sounds plausible so that’s my reasoning.  Edit: alright I was wrong
so obvious
Before the reveal I thought Ziggy was an orphan
it’s the dude
beat saying im sorry is so jokes
I was so sure it was 5
its 4
knew it
The mum is number 2
which beta squad member gonna be a dad.??????
How come no one talking bout AJ notifying us that at 6 mil they'll reveal the first BS parent
I saw the first explanations and knew contestant 5 was the mother, hence i skipped to the end and was shocked she was out. You don't speak that fondly of a child straight from your head like that and it not be yours.
2
I can't believe they actually took the kids favorite toy n broke it down like that
So one person makes a single mistake after being calm the whole time and they go crazy and vote her out? Sometimes beta squad are fucking stupid🤦🏽‍♂️
No I'm not struggling I know math it was number one if I'm wrong then fuq ziggy lied bout his age, update I was wrong af I don't get it
The most viable beta squad father is Kenny.
Still a great video
since th ebegginin i said 4 breh
luv youse, peace from straya
I always thought it was #5 but I knew for sure when Ziggy so willingly sold the toy cuz she did say he wasn’t attached to it
5
Whats the @ of the mum?
This one was very obvious because of how well spoken ziggy was. He spoke very well and clear like his mum.
KNEW ITTT
I think it has to be 4. Pre-findingout.
black no middle tooth mum i think
The lady
Me: 5 My sister: 4
“Bring all the parents back” ? They all his parent or smthn
Omg I would love to see them one day they seem so fun
I still think its the white shorty y'all voted out the birth story with the name is to personal to be made up and her body language while telling the story is showing its an actual memory
SOMEONE TELL ME WHICH BETA SQUAD MEMBER IS HAVING A KID
"I forget that people are human" 😂😂😂
I haven't watched the entire video but I know it's the woman cause they have the same nose 😂
Jesus loves you all
I KNEW IT WAS NUMBER 5
I KNEW IT WAS HER!
Ight so obviously the beta squad don't no math because at this point only one person has been giving answers that add up to ziggys age n its number one but they're trollin him, the first question they asked was to ziggy how old he is n they instantly forgot
What a dead vid man
hamza khan
Died at 6:35 bruh, dude seen lying through his teeth
24:20 why was this the funniest part of the video? 😂
Beta squad > Sidemen
Ay yoo no one talking about the first beta squad parent?? Is that legit??
Number one looks like dreamybull
I knew it was #5 because the birth of Ziggy was so personal
So good!
From the time he sold his supposed “favourite toy” I knew number 5 was the mum 😂😂
6:30 the way my jaw dropped😭
#4
niko should kidnap ziggy at this point
U guys met with my uncle in Saudi Arabia
einstein’s brain is simply too full to remember ziggy’s name 🤦🏽‍♂️
10:23 😂😂😂
I think it was #2
It was actually obvious this time😂😂😂😂
I knew it was number 5
the fact that he said hamza 💀
i clocked it when number 1 copied number 5’s answer of “tobi” being the kids bsf
Sharky is going to be a parent?! I don't believe it!
Why do I have a feeling his mum is the last women, person number 5. Even though 2 & 4 were really convincing.
i think its number 5   i knew ittttttt these lot are dumb
Sharky really said “shoutout Callux” after #5s story 💀🤣
This one seemed really obvious to me. Can even see they look a bit similar.
My vote is 4
I think its number four (commenting before reveal)
Kenny is the 1st parent
Chunkz the racist still ain't apologised for laughing when KSI said P***
the mum 100%
AHAHAH I KNEW SHE WAS THE MOM ❤
I think Ziggy really looks like his mum I knew it was her
4
The name mess up wasn't a big deal at all...she clearly said she's got a few kids - all of our parents have miscalled us for our siblings! It's the most parent thing to do!
Hamza 😂😂 I’m done 😂
Is it me or these vids dont hit the same anymore
Naa man said the yutes name is Hamza 🤣
I thinks it’s the dad
IShowSpeed Funniest JUMPSCARE Compilation EVER 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YHGo3IlL-8
😂😂
Such a good video yet again
Its definitely sharky or kenny having a child 😂
I think it's number 5, even though you just voted her out
My mom calls me my brother's name daily. The lady calling him "Zay" isn't an immediate red flag to me lol
is it 2???
Ziggy: I’m 8 Sharky: perfect 😂😂
Bhai love your prediction.  Watching you since last ipl and I am small league player and loved your rahane  prediction out of the box and correct help me in winning money. Keep doing brother
I knew it was 5 from the start
The person that’s having a child is Darkest
Are we going to disregard how they said one of them is a new parent??!!!
😂
5
As the viewers we knew when his mom was telling a story about him and the boy noded
yoo beta squad videos keep getting more and more funnier
There's no way anyone in BETA SQUAD is having a baby right now  cut the cap 😂😂‼️
I thought it was 4 from jump but after he sold his toy for £10 and didn't seem fazed what 5 was saying about it not being his favourite made me think it was 5
I think its number 4 lets see if I am right
I find myself looking forward to beta squad videos rather than sidemen
BLIMMING GAVE IT AWAY
after the kid said blooming tiger i just knew that was his mum
you know it’s a good day when beta squad uploads a new video
it is probobly the man
Obvisouly four
jamaica
I was 100% convinced that number 4 was the parent i wasnt even willing to consider the mum! Absolutely shocked tbh
wallahi, from the start i thought number 4. i got finessed. ggs
Before i see the reveal i think the parent is 5, i’ll edit it when i find out OMG I WAS RIGHT/
1
transformer
number 3
I knewwwww it was her! Especially, when she said he wasn't too attached to the toy and then he immediately sold it to Niko. 💀🤣
the lady
23:48 Aj LMAAO nah but I didn’t expect her to be the mom 😭😭
when number 5 said "yammed the chocolate cake" i knew it was her 100%
I think it’s the dude
AJ shouldve been one of the children😂😂
I knew it, I had no doubt!
AJ is too good of a commentator👍
I knew it . It was pretty obvious they were trying us off when you compare so I had that intuition
JESUS saves 🙌 JESUS heals JESUS forgives  JESUS loves you  JESUS restores brokenness JESUS is there for those who feel lonely or lost   ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Jesus is the reason your alive be thankful everyday be appreciative, humble, kind. Try to put a smile on someone's face spread love and positivity because someone may need it because this world have so much hate it does not need any more. 🥰
The mother was bad as hell
Must be 4
Aj is too funny man 💀
If they did what King Solomon did in the bible they would have got the answer in round 1 lol - 1 Kings 3v16-28.
LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE MAFIA VID, best series
could you do a guess the best friend
unrelated but like number 1 is so leng
the hamza part took me out😭
ziggy mom is hot af
Long live Hamza
THE WOMAN
think its the black man 21:05
As a mixed race guy raised by a white mom, after a few answers I knew for sure that was his parent! Big ups those who know 🙏🏾🖤
I think it's the man of the last two contestants!
the white gall
I thought it was #5 until you guys voted her out. She knew exactly what she was talking about😭
It was obvious to me that #5 was mom because of that birth story. That is real, especially with the reasoning behind the name. I think it the guy who said Ezekiel before she did threw them off bc it sounded copied. Plus every answer was very detailed. She could talk about her little pride & joy all day where the others would keep it brief.
Mom!! because of the way she wanted to pat him on the back after making 10p... dad's poem is too good. Don't trust someone that talented, lol😂
I fucking knew it
The  parent reveal was shocking
the last 3 had me stumped as well
Aj pointed out a big detail to #5 so I’m surprised they didn’t stick with her! She kept looking up to stop from laughing in the beginning she couldn’t even look at him
I KNEW IT WAS HER I KNEW SHE LEFT EARLY
We need q series with this
4
BRO IT WAS SO OBVIOUS WTF SHE GAVE RHE THE WHOLE MEANING OF HIS NAME 😭
Knew it wasn’t the fourth guy because he said “the younger brother” about Ziggy’s brother instead of what he would say if it was his other son “my younger son”
I mean 4 or 5 do look the most alike to him you can see it from both
White girl I think or the dude at the end is my guess
Her very detailed story about ziggy's funny moments was all the proof i need to know she was his real mum
#5 but at the end #2 rather than #3
#5 is the mom. I thought it could be #4 up until he said he didn’t know the name of his sons favorite set of movie characters lol then I was fully sold on #5.
I knew it
EW
Mans called him hamza 💀
number 4 defo  after watching video I KNEW IT WAS NUMBER 5 ALL ALONG UP UNTIL SHE SAID ZAY I KNEW ITTTT
i knew it was her when she said what his name meant.
Number 4
the guy
That mom is so hot Ngtl
When he said ‘it’s a blooming tiger’ I knew who it was. But tbh I ended up thinking it was one of the last two
Not going to lie, I was sold on number 2💀
it was obvious
Fantastic job guys really good at working who the parent is can’t wait for more 🥰🥰🥰🥰
number 4
whos having a childdddd!!
Hamza lol
Ziggys kinda..
Number 4
Why is AJ hiding super noodles in his hair
I can’t wait for next weeks video 😂
21:05 number #2 number 4 said he got 2 sons, but the poem made it sound like he had only one🤔🤔think about that
hehe
I think Kenny is having the kid
AJ's logic is mental 😂
I guess kenny is the member to be having a child 🤷👀 Anyway guys can't wait to know
Soo clear of the sidemen
I think Chunkz would be a great father 😂
First one was so funny 🤣 Two and four were really convincing what a liars especially the man and his relaxed face  His real mother was emotional at some points🥰but the skin colour made me think she is not🤷
they had such similar accents i don't know how they didn't clock that and realise it was SPOILER number five straight away 😂
Niko is definitely the father
I think it is the man over the woman at the end. I’ve paused to comment..so let’s see. Woman was doing the most with the sweets and it’s so generic.. she then jumped on it…tbc
defo number 5
King kenny got a kid
What kind of Swan bites your hand off lmfao 🤣  They don’t have teeth. It’s the feet you need to worry about and the wings. That beak chomping on you might be therapy lol
Bro I said it was 5 only because everything was on point , hardly ever any hesitation to answer , the favorite toy thing she clearly was talking truth there cause he ended up selling it for 10notes like pshh . She seems like such a Good mom tho
I GOT PLAYED I THOUGHT IT WAS 4
4
yo the description is out of order ☠  "Beta Squad have to match the parent to the child out of a group of 5 adults. Welcome to guess the ex boyfriend."
Niko playing Rock Paper Scissors with ziggy 😭😭
It better not be Sharkyyyyy lol
mommy
Either no 5 or no one is his parents
I don’t know how they couldn’t tell by the accent
Who else got it right?
the dude
The child doesn't look real
Hamza 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4
niko is the dad
The first guy kinda looks like kenny💀
yes i’ve always known that the beta squad hates people with speech problems
their reactions when they found out that it wasn't either two or four💀
His mom is bad tho
I love how Niko bought the toy from ziggy and sharky unintentionally dismantled it in front of Ziggy🤣
Is it just me but I'm starting to only watch them and not the sidemen? Also please do more of those videos matching parents matching bf or exs is so fun to watch 😅
This one was bait man😂😂
nah the ending shocked me I was so convinced that it was two or four😭
JAW DROPPED i never thought that 5 is the actual mom😭
Think its 4
its the man
I genuinely thought it was 5 & 4 😭😭
The mum is the parent
Niko playing rock paper scissors with him is so cute
Niko is brilliant with kids
The black guy is the dad Edition: welp wat a mistake
So clear that is what that woman, the whole story with the birth and the name meaning yk
I’m loving all the challenges ! AJ how could you 😮 😅
i think its the lady stillllllllllll
NAWWW THE FIRST GUY CALLING HIM HAMZA HAHAHAHA
Before seeing the reveal, I legit think it's number 5 even thought you voted her out.. She could call him Zay too, if his name is Ezekiel.. Idk I think either number 4 or 5 but I'm going with 5 :D
From the BEGINNING I thought it was number 4, that guy deserves an Oscar
Kenny or Sharky is definitely has to be the new dad for vibes I'll go with Kenny
HAHHAHAH HIS NAME IS HAMZA IM LAUGHING
Four 😂
100% KENNY GETTING A CHILD FAM THE GUY LOOK MAD SERIOUS ALL DAY
Ww
24:17 24:18 aj 😭😭😭😭
I knew it,cos he said “blimming tiger ” and I was like black ppl don’t say that🤣
I’m pausing to say, I think it’s #4 from the last two standing
the giveaway was 13:48, when they swears in front of the child only the real mother is feeling the pain
fuuny asf
I think it’s the guy but idk
That biracial woman had a good game but I don't think Ziggy could've been her child unless she was with someone who was biracial too.  What I mean is that Ziggy and that woman both look like they have one black parent and one white parent.
4
4
I think it's the woman.
I think it’s the guy who said he likes DC
They voted off the actual parent because they weren't acting. AJ had a great realization at the end.
more wholesome vids!
Kenny has to be the one having a kid His parents had  10 kids innit He tryna keep it going at a yound age  💀
Ziggy looks more like Niko than anyone else there
If the baby is sharky's, can you name it Ali so if it joins the military, it'll be shown as Mohamud, Ali
Lol great vid
LADY WITH glasses
Triangle head is hella cringe
I was struggling so much to find out who it was but I put my money on number 4... I'm writing this before the reveal. And also great vid beta squad you always make my day 10x better
the black gal
I think is number 4
4:10 is my name
I knew it from the start
Is no one talking about how one of the beta squad members are having a kid???!!!
NO WAY EINSTEIN WAS THE FATHER. AINT NO WAYYY
I think its the black dude that was with the mom at the last part
19:47 I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE ✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽
i think its the mom
I knew it was 5 😂😂
Omg who’s having a baby !!! Tell us now !!! Lol
Holy shit that was intense
Yea this was extremely obvious
I thought it was 5. Zay made me think it a nickname her mother uses for him.
I KNEW IT!!!!
As soon as the little boy said “blemming heck” I knew the white women was his mom
4
No one talking abt how aj said sharky had a child and at the start of the video it said one of the members has a child
HAMZAAAAA!
I think its the guy. He's the only contestant that actually LOOKED at ziggy throughout the game. everybody else looked at betasquad or up in the air.
r we gonna ignore sharks saying perfect after he said 8
Injustice league💀
NIKO IS GONNA BE A DADDY
Another race mixer. Brown is not diverse. 🙄
4
Disappointed Bradley wasn't one of the parents 😭
someone tell chunks to cover his awhrah
blqck girl
this kid said "blimmin" and they couldn't tell who the parent was 😭
Ziggy has to be one of the cutest kids  i ever seen 😭
Niko would be such a good parent
HAMZA I AM YOUR FATHER!
In my opinion could obviously tell it was number 5, no way she was free-styling that information
Was obviously number 5 😂 nice try lads
So everyone is just going to ignore that a beta squad member is having a baby?? 😭😭❤️
There faces looked shocked asf wen she stepped forward 😂😂
R we gonna just forget that I think sharkys having a child!?
Kenny
I didn’t all deny the real parent was the real parent. My vote the whole way through was 5 but 4 was very convincing as well
❤
i knew it was #5 even when she messed up his name... my immediate reaction was she probably has other kids and got their names mixed up bc that happens with my mum allllll the time. what made it even better was when she said the toy wasnt his fave and he sold it to niko right after lmaooo
4
bro ziggy was nodding when his mum was getting questioned, i already knew it.
I thought it was defo one of the final 2, mad!
Bro turned ziggy to hamza😂😂😆
Is it no.4
i think it's 4 ngl
Number 2 letter sounds like it was written by chatGPT 😂😂😂
I swear I knew it was 5 when they voted her out
I love when beta squad posts
Plot twist Beta squad hit 6 million subs and this is Nikos child announcement video!
it was so obvious that the girl was the mom, how the hell do you get this one wrong hahhaha
The 4th man
5
idk
number 5
Nah it was blatantly her 😂 she said “Zay” cos after Ziggy she was gonna say “favourite” so she got muddled up
ziggy dahl kham had me laughing differently 🤣
4
number two was doing way tooo much. She also does not look like shes in her 30s. The only thing that may have convinced me was her figure, but then we find out shes never had any kids at all. i'm mind blown.
Callin it half way through the vid yeh nd the parent is Einstein lool, nah is the white gyal I reckon she jus wit a black fella
whys the description guess the ex boyfriend lool
#4s mafs ain't addin up
I wanna see for once that the classic old man be the correct answer, it would be a nice twist
The guy
I think it is No 5
Gotta be Kenny having a kid
I think 4
Nah the second they voted out 5 I knew they were wrong
I knew it was 5 when she first spoke of him
Number 1 was a gigachad
What a wholesome moment to see Aj finally reunite with his long lost brother
Hamza🤣
Well first guy said he's 24 had him when he was 16 and the kids 8 so off the rip I'm thinking #1 because of mafs n all
My vote was five all along I just thought when she called him ‘Zay’ it was another cute little nickname for him like Ziggy or calling him Zee 🥹
dad
5:50 its sharky 100%
4
The fact that they forgot that Number 5 knew what Ezekiel meant off by heart and came up with a flawless story about his birth just shows how stupid these people are
People never thought that the beta squad would ever return a child in there life.
W video, the kid made it much funnier too!
I think it was the 5th contestant 😂
I thought this one was too obvious tbh, 5 made so much sense from the moment she first spoke
kenny knew all along. during the last voting round he kept saying 5...HE KNEW
i think it’s the black guy
I knew it from the beginning with that resuscitation story also every time she spoke Ziggy turned his head away smiling.
Only people Who didnt Come from tiktok are worthy liking this
Bruh 9:21 yeh tht lady finishes tht story n the kid nods his head borderline agreein wit her lool, if any1 clocked tht the games finished ahaha
Congrats to everyone Who is early and Who found this comment
I pray Who ever reads this becomes succesful in Life
It's probably chunkz
Kid selling the toy right after she said it wasn’t his favorite toy and he just used it in the bath proved her point and they didn’t even catch it😂
I mean, the moment she said the whole meaning of Ezekiel, I knew it was her
Niko playing rock paper scissors when she said he likes games 🤣🤣🤣
4
Was it me or it was so obvious it was 5
I think the parent might be 5
sharky????????????????????????????????????
Bro niko looks like ziggy so much and chunks looks like the stepdad
He sold that toy instantly and no one thought oh yeah she just said he didn't really care about it and the other two made it out to be really sentimental - that made it super obvious
Number 2
It’s 4
Next vid looks 🔥
2
I KNEW ITT....am I the only who always get these right...
Omg who is the first parent in beta squad 😂😂😂
Stfu WHOS HAVING A KID
THE BLACK GUY!!!!!
number 4
Icl beta squad copying sidemen is getting out of hand, first SOME of their videos, now having a baby 💀
It’s got to be Chunkz he been looking more pregnant lately!! Congrats bro
i knew when it was her when she said ezekiel the strenght of god
Beard doesn’t actually makes you old someone guys get beard at the age of 17 because of genetics…
knew it was her from the voice
Mate i did not expect that ending
Theres always one joker in the contestants 🤣🤣
I think it is the guyyyy
Na number 1 was sick😅😂 i died i would crumble the same way less the rallis
ziggys mum is a milf bruh
That was a twist, whoever didnt watch the end its einstein's kid
i’m saying kenny having a kid
So sharky is the beta squad member that's expecting a child🔥🐐 w dad ...i guess😂😂
number 2 and 4 did good tho🤣
I think oj
We all know it’s gotta be chuckz having a child as the rest couldn’t handle one
I think its kenny to be having a child. If not then nikos gonna be a funny but annoying parent🤣
Is it just me or would niko be a great uncle
When she said the controversy thing i 100% knew that it was her because she wasn’t waffling and she was being real.
I'm not gonna lie, I knew it had to be number 5😭 her story in the beginning was so convincing
4
You need to do more of these they crack me up
That’s nikos kid wtf
I think it is 44444
4
The man
The way they dragged the video after 17:15 😭
Women who got voted out
Einstein coming out with “Hamza” was crazyyyy 😂 then when the other guy called him Hamza too!! Lmao! Also number 2 was too nervous, her voice was trembling everytime she spoke, too obvious it wasn’t her.
I think Sharky’s the one having the child😂
Congratulations on the child aj shibell
hamza
W
I think kenny is the first Beta parent
Niko was so good with Ziggy! He’s gonna be an awesome dad one day
Top G >>>>>>>> Ksi
I knew it was her!!!!! 😂
i thought it was #4 the whole time
That description is brazyyy🤣🤣, guess the ex boyfriend??
Deadass thought it was four😊
I think out of the girl and guy left at the end the guy is the real parent (gooseman)
I had 5. I think just the best friend question and her thinking instantly it might be controversial at the spot was good enough.
number 4
whys there always a random old person ☠️
Bro said it’s his bath toy 😂
Sharkys gonna be a father
No 4 is the father
the fourth guy said that he had ziggy at 28 but he's 37 now which makes ziggy 9 even though ziggy is 8 years old.
"First Beta Squad parent will be announced at 6 million"... You are on some joke ting *~Filly voice~*
4 is the dad is what i think
I'm surprised chunkz didn't call mr khan a p**i... He laughed when ksi said it.
didnt expect to hear my name💀4:09
I clocked it was number 5 when on the toy round she said ziggy doesnt have  adeep connection with the toy and 2 mins later ziggy sold his toy for 10 pound lmaoooo
that's crazy how a beta squad meber is having a baby
#2
I was convinced it was 4 from round 1 so shocked
I fw 5
#3
W Vids keep grinding
4:05
cackling at the end where they're pouring their hearts out in their letters, and the kid is just starring at the 10 quid he acquired
I was right
the facial expression of the last women at 0:56 gave it away for me, i immediately thought she was the mother. was just something about her facial expressions thruout the video
is one of them actually having a child orrr….
Beta squad so clear. Sidemen fell off
Humza killed me
it was obvious that that was the parent, her story was just making sense to me.
I reckon that the production team used E=mc2 to get Einstein out of his grave.       I'm gonna kill myself for this joke
I KNEW IT
I guarantee it’s Kenny having a kid 😂😂
Guys I really love you, but are you copying ideas from another channel called jubille?
Hamza 😭😭😭
3rd
this is so cute
1st comment
I THINK number 2 is the parent
GIVE HIM BACK HIS TOY
Einstein was clearly the dad 🤣
I think its number 4
I’m gonna guess that it’s #4 before I even see the reveal
i knew ittt
BRING MAFIA BACK BOYS 😭
Wait someone help anyone else hear that one of them having a kid? Was it a joke or…
Wonder what the real mum's poem was like
you guys are so fine i cant brooerifuneriv
Yo let's go!
I did not expect the ending
5
Imagine we get them to 6 Mil before the baby gets born😂
Its the guy with the black jacket
NAHHH I KNEW IT WAS HER THEY GOT ME SCREAMING AT MY SCREEN LMAOOO
I trinken its the man not the woman  in the final
Wait why is no one talking abt how a beta squad member is gonna be a father 😭
i knew it was her because ziggy sold the toy he wouldnt do that if its his favourite
You can tell by the accents from the start
21:06 It’s number 4
Number 444
Damn jidion. Niko has shown that he’s the biggest menace. I mean to tell a mom they aren’t the parent of their child is insane.
2
Dad
number two has to be it
2
She said Zay because she wanted to say Ziggy's Favorite and stuttered you schmucks
This broke my brain 😂😂
I swear it’s the 4th guy
This is just epic like I have no words I never watched this I would be mad if a white person is the parent
Beta squad are the perfect people to watch whilst eating
Number 4 is the father
should have asked what are the cute pet names you gave ziggy.... short snappy funny answers guarateed to weed out the liars
i think it is oj
Ziggy is a future BetaSquad member!
Just sayin i would've fit perfectly for this bc my dad is older than some of my friends grandparents
if number 5 was fr the mother after aj said your not the mother ...................................................... bro WAIT WTF NUMBER 5 IS THE MOTHER?
Yo ill gladly come on the show, if you can find my father that is.
Remember when Chunkz laughed at a racist joke?
i knew she was the mom, the moment he said ok to sell the toy for 10 dollars 🤣
The fact that she knew the meaning of ezekiel was a dead giveaway.
Do a match the parent to the child
The best beta squad vids are the 1 with filly
I was guessing 5 at first, because it was a very mom thing to do to be hesitant about saying who her son’s best friend is because they could watch and get mad at her kid, but then she messed up Ziggy’s name and I didn’t think it was her anymore lol
Definitely knew he was a mix baby 😂😅
from the start i was sure that number two was the mum
Humza is crazyyyyy 😩😩😩
I think its the women with the glasses
When four said he was 38 but had ziggy at 28 that means ziggy is 10 when hes 8
I guessed #5, based on the simple fact that his speech was most similar to hers
I knew the mom from the start. I’m scared of chunkz getting old and not being funny anymore he’s been acting less lately and that scares me so much. I miss the days of “I’ll k!ll ur parents, i know where they live”😂😂🤣🤣 i love chunkz men
I think its the Man
Number 2
HAMZA got me dead 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
Bro anyone got fee insta or facebook
After the 1st round, I just want to say before I watch the vid, i think it's the 4th dude
I’m naming my child hamza now
Bro I fucking called it it was fee but I didn’t comment I wish o did
Okay but I just know the mum felt like a million dollars at the end , I can’t believe she got voted out I was voting for her and number four the whole game, another great video Ziggy was a great character and got along so well with niko throughout the video “ can’t wait to see more 🔥
it's 4
Iqtidaar khan
Niko needs someone to slap some knowledge into him. Swans are not vicious creatures. Geese are. Freaking arrogant prick.
20:58 i’m not sure yk😭😭 i thinkk number 5 or 4 can’t pick between
so cuuuuute
Number 4 kept saying "obviously" which is a big sign of lying lol suprised the lads didnt pick that up sooner
LMAOOO
Nah I didn’t see that coming. Fully thought it was number 2
swearing in front of Ziggy 😂
2nd guy says his birthday is in august 4th guy says its 28 june 5th girl says his birthday is 28 august, mixing together the previous two dates she's a liar edit: WHAT????
Bro said his son full of zest
Bro why chunks legs so skinny
love your vids
My parent messes up my name with my brother Even tho we dont look that much alike😂 beta squad really thought the parent was gonna be flawless and confident as stone and get all the spelling correctly like a robot lol😂
BETA SQUAD PARENT NR ONE IS WHO??? I need to know so please everyone subscribe
Congrats niko on becoming a dad 😊
Wait they're having a kid
Siwlowheenmfckc 👍🏼
Great video!!!❤
I fully thought it was #4. Wow.
number 4
She was too nice n point not to be
I thought it was 5 but was like no way because of the previous round she said 28 of august while the 2 before her said 31 of august and 28 of June - as if she combined them, along with the mess up the round after 😆😆 Crazy
I think it was 5
I knew it was number 5!
most wholesome beta squad video
U guys should do it with both parents but not tell them there both there
Tbh I acc think it’s 4 yk
Worth my time; I laughed the whole time; Ziggy is really smart and cute; it nice clip.
4
Number 4
I think we know who the parent is before the first round is over
I knew it was her
I KNEW IT Bro i was so sad when u voted Her out
Did bro really just say octopus prime 💀💀
Niko bout to have a kid
I knew it
i think it's 3
trust me kenny or sharky is having a baby
what who’s having a child ??
Na this I thing number two three was the father the way he walked away😂
Niko just playing 🪨📄✂️ with Ziggy
I voted out ziggy first round he isn’t a parent
i think itsz the dad
Its definitely niko having the kid you can tell from his interaction with ziggy
5 for sure
I knew his mum had to be the white lady. Ziggy got a "white" British accent and he sounded very much like his mum.
hamza
I feel the black dude is ziggys dad
ledt
Number 4
Yo r they gonna do mafia again i miss those videos (this one was good aswell tho)
first dude was funny asf 😭
W?
Why niko so weird in the vid like he isn’t acting the same as he normally does
is no one talking about how one of the beta squad members will have a kid
You gotta get Yung Filly in more videos
24:21 when an said this I was dying 😂😂
Bro fee so fine
New trailer looks sick AND I THOUGHT #5 WASN'T HER AFTER SHE SAID ZAY I'M SO SORRY 😭😭😭
6:49  IM DYINGG HAMZAAAA
the woman
ik 5 was the mum as soon as ziggy said blimming
I think it's the man
This video is funny af
WAIT ONE OF THE BETA SQUAD MEMBERS ARE HAVING A BABY OMG
Sharky is most def the first dad
Einstein name was ''Iqtadar Khan'' not hector dahl khan.. Editor messed up there
congrats to sharky on becoming a dad
4
i had locked in 5, but the finale two had me second guessing
One of them is having a child?
he’s name is hamza 4:13  IM DYINGGG
nah that ending made me jump wtf 😂😂
I knew it was her when she said yammed, clearly lives with a jamacian husband
did they just say that sharky has a kid- 💀💀💀
Why in description it says guess the ex boyfriend xd
9:45 WHY IS NIKO PLAYING ROCK PAPER SCISSORS WITH ZIGGY 😭😭
I'm guessing 2 on the final round Edit - I did think it was 5 before she got voted out tbf she was pretty convincing with her stories there was a lot of detail
i think it’s number 4 and have since start
probably the 5th
Home girl with the plaits (Prediction)
Harry Pineros his dad
You are not the father
the sidemen aint uploading 😔 but the beta squad never disappoints
number 5
AJ i feel u im short
I LOVE BETA SSSSQQQUUUUAD
I'm gay
Why they slapping hella ads on one vid
i thinking number 2
Number 5😊
19:48 Sharky has a son?!?!
Spoiler Alert! I noticed the mother sounded a little posh and then Ziggy said blimming tiger and I was thinking she’s the parent lol 12:43
Albert enstin
2
Think its the mum
Ziggy looks like Nikos child no cap😭😭😭 even tho he doesn't have one
WHO IS GOING TO HAVE A CHILD IN THE SQUAD
I KNEW ITTTT YOU SHMUCKS
I thought Zay was Ziggy’s brother and that’s why she called him that. My mom mixes my name and sister’s name a lot
This video was so top-tier, genuinely
before i see the results, i think the man is the parent
4
How tf did they brought Thierry Henry???
SO wait where's the actual Hamza?
hold up🧐🧐🧐
When #5 said “yammed” that was confirmation for me that she was the mum. She’s obviously been cultured by a black donny, cos what white gyal have you ever heard use that word😂
During the whole video, I thought it was number 4 and was going to comment that they must choose contestant wisely to make it difficult but the ending man 🤯
In the description why does it say guess the ex boyfriend???
7 ads
2
I think it is number 2 (before reveal). Out of the final two
@ 6:34 lol lmfao
man
Boys change the order of answering so ones at the end don’t always have so much thinking time
Beta squad 🔛🔝
I actually didnt expect the ending
I think it number 4
NAHH WHAG ONE OF THEM R BECOMING PARETNS
icl i think its the mum but ima reply my reaction
I need Niko to run for mayor
Wow, the beta squad production squad is getting more and more advanced, they’ve managed to get Einstein on the show 😂😂🥸
aj hiding under the table after cussing in front of the child had me wheezing
Ngk when I saw the thumbnail I thought it 2as neeko's child💀💀
kenny is having a child
first time i got it right
Bruv I think it is 4
A saturday upload 😱😱😱😱😱😱
3rd one
beta squad being consistent. LOVE IT
Must've been so weird for the actual parent just listening to the other guys waffling
Number one made me cry😂😂😂
"He's name is hamza" lmfao
i think its 2
You could kinda tell she was the mum based off the accents
was hoping Bradley would show up
From the minute she said she was religious and explained the name Ezekiel, I knew it was her. Aj had it out for her from that moment for some reason.
Can’t wait for the kid dude! I’m still in shock 😨😂 #iThinkItsSharky
Did not realise how recent this video was
#5 seemed way too much like an actor. Fair play
awhh lady 2 was soo sweet
i go wi 4 hommie
my name is hamza 😂
Are we just gonna ignore the child announcement?
Congrats for the baby, Kenny! 🎉
niko and ziggy playing rock paper scissors was the cutest
I think its the Carlene
Wait who's the beta squad dad?
nahh ziggy is a g famm need him in more vidss
YEYSYSYYEYSYSYEYEYS
“His name is HAMZA” 😂🥸
For the first time in this series I guessed right. So this is what winning feels like
Bro #2 was doing the most lol like really octopus prime ? 🤣🤣😭
4
How is she the mother?????!!!
I constantly keep saying that they are the Real Entertainers
istg niko is so cute with kids
Was genuinely convinced it's 2 ngl
4 is the parent
I thought number 5
1 such a vibe❤
Man said *Hamza* 4:16
I think it’s 2
Congratulations to whomever is having a child 🎉❤ 🫡
its deffo the white mum, she was just so cool with wtv she said
niko grinding
I think it's 4
I wouldve never  guessed 5 i srs thought it was 4
Who is number 4?
« I forget that people are human »😂😂😂😂
Guys, it's time to subscribe if you haven't already... Seriously... 5:46
Niko: OJ lol
I instantly knew that was his mom. Besides complexion, he honestly resembles her
I think number 5 because I have a friend with a white mother but he doesn’t look white at all looks like ziggy a bit
Beta squad are killing it man 👏💪
Wait are one of them really having a child? 😦
its four from th second 5 messed up it was between them  My Bad🤣🤣 hardest one yet tho
I knew it was #5 when she messed up on his name i thought she was calling him one of his siblings name common parent mistake
Beta squad is the best YouTube group in 2023!! 🎉
Goddam can someone tell sharky I've always liked him😢😅❤....love you shark

“How old are you Ziggy?”   “Eight.”  “Eight okay, perfect.”   😂😂😂
next should be finding nikos dad after he went and got the milk
The silence after the mum stepped forward
Number 4
Very easy number 4
I KNEW IT
I think that one person is the parent
actlly got it correct i knew it was 5
4
I think its that Einstein guy. Could be wrong though
4
Hamza seems like a pretty relaxed kid
My brother is called ezekiel
2
was anyone else shocked that Mr Khan wasn't white
I think it's the lady
Icl I thought it was number 5 until they voted her out, u could tell she said zay by accident
My guess is the woman
😂
How did they not realise that number 4 is 37 and he said he had ziggy at 28 even tho ziggy said he was 8😂
number 5 messing up her kids name is understandable my mum does it all the time😭
the mom done said that toy doesn't mean that much to him. That's why the kid easily exchanged it for 10 bucks 😂
W vid
I think it's the dad
I think its number 2
I think its the man
Crying.. I was convinced number 4 was the dad…. when she stepped up I WAS SHOCKED
when lawrence said hamza at 6:34 i cried🤣
Ur taking long to upload
I think its the last man cuz look at the styleee… the kid wearing fresh clothes, it just matches w the last man
How the f*ck is Zay😂
Think it’s four
Nr 5
I think is the man. That's number 4
S
I knew it 5
such an unexpected ending!!!
We know you command c and p cause of the description ...
The one in the white jumper I think is the mother
why does the description say 'welcome to guess the ex boyfriend' LOL
AJs gonna get these man sued🤣🤣🤣
the plot twist at the end, that was good
we're waiting for video "beta squat"
I bet all of them got a chance lol
You could tell by the way the parent comes across and talks, the same as the child does
Mum said the kid wasn’t attached to the toy and then he sold it to Niko for £10 two minutes later and people are shocked about the reveal ?
0:35 Sharky, what do you mean by that?
#2
Hamza Lmao.
I knew it was 5 from when AJ swore, you can see so much regret and disappointment in her face highkey
I knew it was #5 as soon as he sold the toy to niko, and the mum said the toy didn't really mean that much to him
I’m low-key surprised that Bradley didn’t show up saying he’s ziggy’s Jamaican dad
it has to be number 2
i think its einstien
i thinkk its that transformer woman
i knew it all along
Octopus Prime😂😂
This is my fourth time watching it now
the real parents answers were so natural i just knew it was them
Sharky is a dad?!
Is Sharky the dad 🤔
It's beyond me how nobody voted 2 out after she said OCTOPUS PRIME
is one of them actually having a child?
I'm so curious about who from the Beta Squad is having a kid or maybe they're joking idk
Y is no one talking about one of them become a parent???😂🎉
Definitely amazing idea for the next one. You should do the opposite one parent to  the children.
“his name is humzah”🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
it is thw woman number 5 you voted out
niko playing rock paper scissors with the first kid lol
Please make more of this type of content, I absolutely love it :D
2 just looks like she would be Ziggy's mum, i dont know how none of them clocked it
i knew it
not Number 4 calling him zesty
2
4
I think is number 2 icl
how is nobody talking about one of them having a child. icl I think its Kenny but idkk. LETS GET TO 6M💯
Another Beta Squad banger, they're smashing it this year, clear of Midmen
Einstein
I love beta squad but chunkz is my fav bc of how funny he is
2 was doing wayyy too much 😂
I knew it lmaoo it should’ve clicked in their heads after she said the toy doesn’t have sentimental value and then soggy sold it for 10 pounds💀💀
bet Kenny expecting his 5th child by now
the mom did say that ziggy wasn't that attached to the toy and then ziggy ended up wanting to sell it for 5 pounds so at that point I knew it was her
Hamza, Ziggy, Zay... wow they named him💀
Greatest, Most Amazing Interaction of all Human Existence
Not niko playing rock paper scissors w him❤
I swear I knew it was 5 😂😂😂😂
Nah, you could just tell it’s number 5. She said the kid’s not fixated on the toy and 5 minutes later he was willing to sell it for some sweets. That just confirmed what she said!
Idk it’s like the same just go with one 50/50
First one
3:57 ; I thought i was trippin but hahaha what are does shoes doing on the table ?
Niko’s reaction after parent 4 said that his name was OJ killed me💀😅🤣🤣
Hows sharkys muslim mum having him at 16?! Confusing
W beta squad uploaded
How is no one talking abt Sharky or someone in the beta squad having a kid??🤔🤔    It might be a joke but I'm not sure
I think it’s 4
21:03  Absolutely no idea,  but I think at this point, the real parent is voted out, and it's the woman who said the toy isn't really his favorite toy.
is no one going to talk about how sharky has a child
Description is mental🤣 "Beta Squad have to match the parent to the child out of a group of 5 adults. Welcome to guess the ex boyfriend."
Man I said 5 as soon as they walked out. They look so much alike boys, you have to see that! Funny vid though as always
5 had us all completely until she said Zay then I started questioning it
NUMEROUS DOS
It's obvious its Kenny or Sharky who's getting a baby
i wonder whos gona be a dad 👀👀
i think it 4 idk why but i just feel it im sticking with it
The dad
Mumzy bad af
14:44 Incorrect   That is a decepticon not a transformer
It was pretty obvious it was #5, when they brought out the fake toy she was the only one that was hesistant and didnt really try to make up something fake, yeah she slipped up but compared to the stories and explanations from the other contestants it was pretty clear who the parent was
was just watching the old vids like guess the black person
I honestly thought it was Einstein 😂  no but i genuinely thought it was number 5
Only reason I’m watching is because the sidemen ain’t posting 😂😂
No one would have thought it's her
We need another episode of ''guess the parent'' for real 😄😄🖐🏾
I CALLED IT LMAO edit: she literally just went to say favorite and ziggy at the same time and it came out as zay
I think it's 4
Not a beta squad vid w/o an old person😂❤
she was definitely the most genuine by how she spoke, the older lady sounded too forced and number 4 didnt sound passionate enough but yeah the mistake caught me too....
Aj killed me the whole time
Is it just me or does the the kid and Niko look alike in the thumb nail
i think the mom is nr 2
I knew it had to one of the two ladies! Ans I kept thinking it's 5 because her responses flowed so naturally. Plus the kid is mixed, so I felt like the dad was black if it was her.
Ofcourse it was 5
loooll
who in beta squaad is having a child it better not be sharky
Number 2 looks like darkest lmao
Can you make another channel called beta xtra or something like MoreSidemen. We want to see regular content 2-3 times a week would be great. This once a week stuff is too much suspense
I think its the black guy!!
GET THESE MEN TO 6M RN
fam it is humza
We all know chunkz pull out game is D-
13:55 bro who’s toes peaking out the table 😭
4 is the dad
I think the 5 is the parent
I had a feeling it was the white lady. but they had me change my opinion at the end and i thought it was the guy😅
Probably number 4
Brah she said i made a cake for his dad and the next day he ate his birthday cake
my opinion i think its 4
yall are genius
You can see him nodding and agreeing to the chocolate cake story 😂
I was completely wrong, thought it was 4
Sharky having the baby congratulations 🎊
I knew It was 5 after that ezekiel story😮😮
4
I thought it was 2
its defo 4
ziggy is adorable aww
I think it’s Einstein frl 🥶
5:48 DO U NOT REALIZE NO ONE CARES IF U ARE OR NOT 💀💀
Yo i actually thought it was No.5 from the start, lol, imagine....
i think itss 2
funniest channel on youtube
5:48 NO ONE CARES!!
the description 💀
Sharky is having a kid? Wtf
When his real mum said it’s not his favourite toy anymore while the rest said it was I knew she’s the mum but beta squad were Focused on her saying Za
4
4
Hamza 😂😂😂😂
Why did sharky say perfect 🤨
Seems like a lovely mum tbf - quite a wholesome video
It's obvious it was number 5 no one would give a sincere birth story about a kid that wasn't theirs.
Chunkz is having the child i knew he was looking a little bloated lately
it was so obvious who the real parent was lmaoo😭
I knew it was her when the kid didn't hesitate to sell his "favourite" toy. She did say it really wasn't his favourite. If it was , he wouldn't have sold it so easily.
23:51 WHATTTTTT
the dad
❤
i think it's number 5
when that guy said Hamza i SCREAMED
4:10 this scene is 100x funnier when your name is hamza 😂
I knew it was number 5! I thought she might have used her other child's name with the zay because moms always do that! But she looks a lot like him too.
My personal guess is probably kenny or sharky being the first beta squad parent. GET THEM TO 6 MILLION NOWW!!!
4:11 ayo thats my name
Did anyone notice that number 4 said the kid’s birthday right and then the mom said after
are we forgetting abt that they said one of them is having a kid ???? SUBSCRIBE NOW we want to know whos the first dad in the beta squad
last guy
It's for sure 4.
the first guy is elite, this guy continued his story even though he literally got baited out 😂😂
Amazing vid and l thought it was ...4
Nah hold on Sharky goes 8 🤣🤣 “perfect” 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣 messed up man
I knew it from the start
I love these style videos sidemen just try do to much let’s go beta squad
Who is watching this before or after IFTAAR 😮😮👇👇
why is no one saying anything about one of them having a kid wtf, gotta be Kenny right
its OJ
Love you beta squad keep it up
Shark having kid
I think its the white woman who left the round before Sharky asked to comment idk why but I believe her lies lol     I was right
Number 1
Great video
21:03 i still think the mum (number 2)  she looks a lot like him, her poem didnt contiounsly rhyme, always had a story and seems very plausible.
I think its 4
W
I remember when the dark times when they weren’t consistent. Great to see this consistency it’s life changing!!! 🥹
It's bro 😎
ok WHO GOT SOMEONE PREGGO??
its no 4 for sure because he was the one who said the name
23:48 LMAOO I KNEW IT BRUH her story behind his name was just too convincing bc it had sm depth and its not something anyone could think of in a few seconds yk😭
20:16 she is the mom for sure
4 DEFO
Ziggy Hamza Dahl Khan
I cant niko playing rock paper scissors wit ziggy was wholesome for me
I hopet Einstein was the dad
The sheer silence at the reveal LOL never heard the Beta Squad act like that before, they knew they fucked up completely.
you guys are improving day by day lots of love from the US
4
woman
I th
Stolen from the bankzitters
19:17 very good
I hope Sharky isn’t the one having the child 😂
I knew it was number 5 cause she literally got 4 kids, I would have immediately thought she accidentally said one of her other kids names lmao. My parents sometimes mix me and my brothers name up lol.  Also definitely knew it was not number two, she felt more like a nanny than a mum and also when she said she was focusing on work first before having a child, I knew that she had no children most (not all) women that say that got no kids, no offence.
Who yall think has a baby/baby on the way?????
The f words it's I do in romanian ,,fac,,
Sharky got done dirty one the tumbnail 😂
It was 5 I just know it
17:15 Chunkz - "I think we're doing a great job lads". *They just kicked out the real mom*
This is so funny 😅👌👌  Respect to the beta squad 💯💯
aj's hair looks really good here
LMAO
I love you beta squad ❤❤❤❤❤ british will rule
Beta Squad rockstar
Why did Sharky say perfect after Ziggy said he was 8 yrs old?
BANGER
These get better each time loll!!!
I think 5
when he accidentally called him hamza mid story I lost itttt. 😭😭
Not einstein creeping forward 😂
What a twist
21:00 its hamza
I thought the parent was 4 or 5 then because they brought up his actual name instead of the nickname… then I thought it’d 4/5 kid together lol, but when she said zay I’m like she’s not the mom lol and she’s the mom lol     I feel like it’s Sharky that’s having a baby
favorite channel
16:36 thats the father fr
no 4
When she said the football story about her kid, I knew it was her, most simple but believable story
Hamza😂😂😂 But whatttt 1st parent from beta squad 🥺.  I think it is Niko.
4
i really thought it was was between 4 and 5, but when she stumbled, i got soooo thrown off man
Day 1127 of aj getting called a rat in every single beta squad video
Not Ziggy coming after everyone's age...
It's no 5!  Parents mix up their kids names all the time😂
24:20 why is aj not standing on the chair tho
It’s the dad
No wayyyy no wayyyyy
As soon as he sold the toy i knew who the real parent was
YOH😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I still think it's number 5
Jesus Christ Loves You All So So Much! <3
1 round in and it’s number 5
We need “Match the cousin or aunt/uncle
I think Ziggy’s parents is number 1!!!
Its number 4
I feel like the first person was a sibling of ziggy
Get your under an hour bage here
niko and ziggy playing rock paper scissors was so adorable
14:00 he kept the joke rolling lolllll
19:49
I think niko is going to be the father when they hit 6mil subs
Man like humza
I knew it was her since he sold his "favourite" toy
Always an old person to make me laugh 😂. Hamza. Lmfaoooo 😹😹
As soon as the real mom said the kid didn’t really care for the toy and then he instantly traded the toy for $10 I knew it was wraps
You know it’s a good video if you’ve liked it before it even started cause beta squad would never give us a bad content ❤❤❤ I love you my Giant bby Niko ♾️
my guess is four is the father
I knew from the start right when the video started she looked like him
9:44 that was cold of hamza
I KNEW IT WAS HER WHEN SHE SAID THE RELIGIOUS THINGS AND HAD THE DEFINITION
Sharky I think it’s number 5 if I was going to guess from where you asked. I thought the slip up could of been another kid names zack or summing idk cuz I think she said she had 4.
I love the videos❤❤❤
I think it’s the guy
When she told the story about ziggy eating the chocolate cake and having his head yammed inside his reaction was all I needed he was proud of that moment lol
I’m at the final two and I believe it’s the guy on the right.
Ziggy telling them that it’s short for Ezekiel unintentionally sabotaged everyone
12:07 LOLLL
It's 2
betasquad > sidemen
I thought it was the girl it’s my prediction
That's crazy using 1 of your kids to hit 6 million
His name is ‘Hamza’😂😂😂.
chunks a dad fr
i knew it was 5 the whole time
It’s gotta be 4 I swear it was the laughing in the beginning
At this point Beta Squad are just copying Sidemens 😂😂😂
Everyone subscribe so we can see which beta squad member is having a kid😮
Beta s quad always have me creasing fr
Not niko playing Rock Paper Scissors with the boy😂😂
21:32 "cuz she lightskin yeah?" that shite had me rolling🤣🤣🤣
I have never thought that people are humans
10:57 CHAD HAMZA
When number 1 said Hamza naa lolllll😭😭😭😭💀🌚😭😭
hamza one killed me but number 5 was a standout!! the facial features were obvious. plus when aj messed up she was distraught compared to the others
WAIT A BETA SQUAD MEMBER IS BECOMING A PARENT? SUBSCIRBBEEEEEEEEE I NEEEEED TO KNOW
number 2
Oh my god. I would never expect this result. From beginning to end i was between 2 and 4
SHARKY HAS A CHILD?????
6:32 my man fumbled differently 😭😭
i think its 4
I'll say 1
Beta squad is on top
number 4
im so early wow
I love u beta squad
number 4
I think it's 4
number 4
NAHHHH THE PLOT TWIST IS REALLL I LOVE UR GUYS REACTIONS
These guys are actually just terrible at these guessing games🤣🤣It was quite obvious with the way the mother spoke with a lot of love but these guys heard a stutter and said nope 💀💀
Ziggy Hamza😊
"Iqtidar" Khan not Hictor Dahl Khan 😂😂😂😂😭😭
5 is a story teller she uses a lot of adjectives i think its number 2
Bro I acc thought it was 4 😂😂
WHOS HAVING A CHILD???!!!
Why are Aj's instincts always wrong? 😭
first dude is the best
Salam boys, I am Hamza!😂
It’s the Mandem
I think it’s 4
einstein wasnt  smart in his answers here
#2 honestly brav
when he gave the toy away it confirmed the moms story abt it not being his fav toy and i knew it was her
i think its number 2
FIRST TIME I KNEW IT FROM THE STARTT
6:35 HELP MEEE
4
I thought this was Aaiden Diggs
Its great how.. If youre reading this you have to sub😁😁
nahhhh I was convinced it was #4
I get so excited when you guys post, my favorite youtubers
Bruh the mom literally had like speeches for the answers how did they vote her out for a stumble 😂
voting for the last man standing i think that's his father. Alright let's see
I wonder who's going to have the child
(im south asian btw) but i knew it was her early on cos this kid and her mum both speak kind of posh like when ziggy said 'blimming' i though yh this kid defo mixedddd or got a white mum
I LOVE BETA SQUAD
4
White woman
i had #5 easily until she missed up her own kids name. and when they called her out on it she didn't even defend it or explain herself otherwise i would've still gone with her. #2 was doing way too much. 4# didn't seem like his father because he was a bit cold. and clearly #1 and 3# are there for the vibes lol
It is the guyyy
Plot twist: the “beta squad member” with the child is actually just HP who’s having his 54th baby with his 54th wife in his 54 years of life with his 54-inch forehead
Shout out to Hamza.
I think it’s number 5
This was maaaaad, I was 1000% sure it was between 2 and 4. Great video as usual pricks
goddamn number 5 is peng
I knew it was white girl cuz she said he wasn’t attached to the toy and then he sold it to Niko 1 minute after 😭
4
5:46 did anyone else think that they were capping for a second... Also CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW DAD!!!!
I knew it was 5 when the kid said blimming, never heard a black person say that in my life 😂
I thought the kid could maybe be mixed race
"I look after him on Tuesdays, but I call him Hamza..."😂
It Niko is have a kid
Nothing better than opening YouTube after a long day to seeing a new Beta Squad vid 🔥
she messed up saying Zay because she was trying to say "say" at the same time
Wtf
4:12 HAMZA ZAGGY ZIGGY   makes sense
The fact that the first person kept trying to prove that Ziggy was his kid after call him Hamza, that's determination right there
Hiii
The two one
Beta Squad needs to stop traumatizing children
2 dad
Bro it's been 3 the whole time bro
Kenny is probably the parent 😂
I wish u guys post everyday your fun to watch
alright lets be onest we all kinda felt like there was a connectin between Numer 4 and Ziggy...i tought Numer 5 was just a amazing actor but she was fr the mum like...but neverless ideo was amazing as always
Chunkz real name is hamza
Hamza 🤣
i knew it that it was number 5
mistake in description Welcome to guess the ex boyfriend
❤
are we gonna forget that one of the members are having a child??
Who is going to be the first BETA parent lets get them to 6 million Inshallah it going to be sharky
not
hem
The fact that they sent the mother out so soon 😂
2:03 :(((
Niko wearing that Top Boy jacket!
yayyyyyyyy new vid made me cheer out loud in my room!!!
That was madness did not know white lady ziggy mom 😮😮
it’s not a beta squad video if they’re not a old person in it 😭
2
She was my choice until she said “Zay.” 😮
4:10 WHAT 😂😂😂😂😂 how do you get hamza from ziggy?
Early
These guys are so dumb
WHAT. WHO TF IS HAVING A KID
i didnt expect the beta squad to return a child
sharky is the parrent
5
First
Is it just me that goes through the comments first before watching the video😂
theses videos make my day sm
Number 4!😂
Early
I guessed the right person 😆😆
I think it's definitely the guy (between the last two) WHAT IN THE PLOT TWIST-
That lady in white said he was born on 31st of Aughust, does that date exist?
yeoo
its definitely parent #5
WALLAHI I knew it !! They looked so alike omg
4
Racismo, no?
4
23:43 Sharky telling Einstein to step back😅
W BETA SQUAD❤
On a Saturday? Lets goo!!!
Omds no way someone from beta squad is having a baby
Ziggy gave a clue when his mom talked about one his naughtiness moment
It’s snarky whose having a child❤😊
i think its number four. If its not him, its five.
niko cracks me up every time, buying off the favourite toy of an 8 year old
its number 2
Defo no 4
Niko just casually buying the kid’s favourite toy
her
They should do 100vs 1000 hotel or smth
Wow the rhymes were fire
*"Hamza 4 Ever"* - Albert Einstein
Def #4
I hope none of these are his parent can't even remember the name they gave him fuck me ones letting his child go against big ass swan
the moment Ziggy sold the "favourite toy", I instantly realised that the mother who said he had no actual attachment to the toy was the parent
carley ek hoopi jy kyk die nie eks kwaad vijou
Kinda racist
I'm mark I do wing Chang
Looks like reng syeed needs to make an appearance again
nahh this was acc so easy 😂😂
I genuinely think this is Nikos kid XD 😂
The facts she said he isn't that attached to the toy then the next round he sold it for the 10, yh it was wraps from there
Aj shush you triangle
The man is the dad?
I wonder how much it cost to get Einstein on the show
I think it’s lady in white jumper
its the girl
early for once
Salaam to Chunkz, Ramadan mubarak may Allah bless you ❤ my brother🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
Is Sharky wearing 2 apple watches??😆
The man
i think its the mother no shot im wrong
Loved that video idea
I think it's 4
The mum said he wasnt attached to the toy and then he sold it for some sweets so thats when I knew they fucked it
The real mother did seem very convincing, and zay/ziggy is an easy thing to mix. So it's harsh to vote her out for that only when she was very convincing. But loved the vid as always :)
I low-key wanted the dad to be Einstein
it 2
I knew it was 5 when he sold the toy immediately after she said it wasn't really his favourite
theses guys never disappoint😂
deffos 4
23:10  How’s Kenny reacting like that when he literally picked number 4 himself? 😂
85k person
I was fully convinced its number 4
hi
3rd is the dad
9:44 NAH THATS SO CUTE THAT NIKO WAS PLAYING ROCK PAPER SCISSORS WITH HIM
My jaw dropped to the ground on the final reveal I would of never expected it thats what makes these bets squad videos so good.
I never would've guessed that it was her
i knew it
Niko bouta spawn a gremlin
I knew it was 5
Hamza is a cute kid.
Sharky would be a good dad
congrats kenny
Oj said ziggy is the first son but at 10mins he said ziggy has a younger brother :D
I WAS CORRECT NUMBER FIVE OMG
Well done Ziggy
Anyone else think Beta Squad needs to stop voting out people that misspeak LOL
3
early for once
The fact that they forgot that Number 5 knew what Ezekiel meant off by heart and came up with a flawless story about his birth just shows how stupid these people are 😂
W upload
Always a good day when they post
Here in the first 30 mins
theyve come so far im shocked
I would say the girl
thought it was 5
you could see at the start who the parent was by the looks
ajˋs apologizing under the table after saying flip...made me crack up
commenting until kenny notices me 🧍🏻‍♀️(2)
I think it's #5
02:58 man started off with Ziggy's govt   if it's not him, I'm fkn done  edit: 23:45 😦
4:12 even Ziggy was like "my name is Hamza?!"
9:40 niko playing rock paper scissors 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the gaslighting after calling him the wrong name 😭😭😭
4
Number 4
i genuinley think that the parent is number 4
i knew number 5 was the parent, no idea how tho
I think it's Number 4
I think the parent is number 5 but time to see the reveal now
Niko playing rock paper scissors with him was funny💀
its obviasly kenny whos having a baby🙄
Where tf did the name hamza come from?💀💀💀💀💀💀
Who would've thought lmao
The toy bit gave it away
Ziggy is looking more like niko than his own mum
Surely it's the white chick.. she's maternal af
4
I love the Beta squad❤
Commenting before the reveal, I think it's number 4, I'll edit my comment later after the reveal  Edit: ...
commenting my prediction before video ends: i think its the second lady, could be number four tho but im saying the second woman is the mum
4
bruh the description says "Welcome to guess the ex boyfriend" 💀
Just Finished iftar was watching the old videos, Good timing
Hey Beta Squad, the description says "Welcome to guess the ex boyfriend."  Also I thought it was Niko from start but now at the last two I was kinda feeling the guy at the end #4.     Edit: I am not surprised it was 5, I was between 4 and 5 because of how they both knew it was Ezekiel, but I went 4 because of 5's stumble. I was actually convinced 4 and 5 are the parents
sharky, if you want a kid lmk babe!! I WILL COME RUNNNG WALLAHII!!
Cmon it was obvious it was the white lady
The man
ziggyˋs cold tho like he looks so cute but got like a fire ykwim he got the whole squad especially with the age 😭
I knew it was between number 4 and 5 from the get go🤣. Shutout to Ziggy for being a good actor 🔥
i think its niko the first member of Beta Squad ti have a child
I think the third last is the mom
Vik would’ve been great at this. And then invite them into his gaming basement.
I thought it was number 5.
I thought 4 was the dad the entire time 💀
Seeing is believing. Once you've seen one, really close up, it doesn't matter what anyone says, you can never un-see it.
I knew it
it's kenny
before the reveal: the guy in the black jacket
Niko be looking like Jamie from top boy🤣
ziggy ziggy ziggy cant you see sometimes ur eyes just hypnotised me
This is the new sidemen video this week ig
Elite Video
I knew it from the accent, they have the same accent
9:45 rock paper scissors
i knew it was her from 2 round
WHOS BECOMING A DAD???
it is the women
not niko making a trade w a 8 year old
I KNEW IT WAS HERRRR OMG
oj mathew is uk's floyd mayweather 😂😂
I think niko gonna be the parent.
Hi beta squad and love your videos and you gotta pin me or else I can give a example “FBI OPEN UP AND YOU ON THE FLOOR WHOLE SQUAD WIPPED OUT GG EZ I SHOT YEETED”
IT’s number 4
That no. 2 lady really made me believe that she is the mother
How was it number 5 tho
It was obvious that it was number 5
😂
I KNEW IT IT WAS THAT GIRL
Niko telling Ziggy to cover his ears before threatening Chunkz was so cute 😭😭😭
My Uber eats just arrived and you guys just posted a W video
ONE OF THEM IS HAVING A CHILD ?????
10:53 - this actually freaks me out
🤣🤣🤣
It's gotta be 5
You could tell he was Fee’s yute from the start- the way her stories just came way more naturally😅
No. 2
Lets go more Beta Squad!
Number 4
I called it from minute one only a modern mother (especially white) would bring her kid onto a show.
I think it’s number 4
LMAO I KNEW IT
number 4
Clearly number 4, aint no way there is anyone else
The parent was the right one bruh
I bet Kenny is the one having a child
Earlyyy
Wow
The actors were going crazy
I said it from the beginning it has to be number 5
oh and its number 4😂
4 it's easy
6:31 I’m doneeee 😭💀
Getting the notificication of this videoliterally saved my day...
ratio
i ve been dreaming of this!!
1:11 is EVERYTHINGG
It was 5 nahh
NIKO IS HAVING A CHILDDDD?
I thought the parent was number 4
2
gotta be 2
I thought it’s 4 when there was 2 people left
Who is the dad
The series is dead now ngl repetitive af
Good to see so much content from Niko on Beta Squad, Jidion and on his channel.
It’s the guyyy he’s the daddd
NO WAY BRUH PLOT TWIST
Number 2{Before i've seen the results}
man this is rigged that's nikos kid
im ngl this is tough but I think the lady is the mom  edit: wait ngl Sharky kinda convinced em maybe its the dude WAIT NO WAY THATS WHO I THOGHT IT WAS TIL THEY VOTED HER OUT LMAOOO
Niko is so cute with Ziggy. He'd make a great dad 💖
Hamza Khan
The shock when they found out who the parent was 💀
Nothing better than opening YouTube after a long day to seeing a new beta squad video
W
Octopus prime im dying 😂😂😂
2
The funniest 😂🙌🏾🔥
My day just got a lot better
i knew she was his mom
Lady in the whit shirt
Nikolas omilana me and u have beef meet me behind asda the one in barking tommorow at 3:40😊
It's definitely 4😂
wait- has sharky actually got a child or am i buggin
Love these lot they are jokes man
I could rewatch their vids and never get tired of it🤭
theyre even copying the sidemen by having kids 💀💀
Why isn’t no one talking about one of them having a baby..
HELLOOO
The father is the man with the nice poem or letter
Aj finally found somebody thats smaller then him
I think its the man! 21:03 something about his poem felt more like he knew ziggy on a personal level, i can read people.
His name is Hamza 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Chunkz and Sharky at 15:43 tho 😅
I’m guessing it’s the 5th person because he looks a lot like his mother.
the mother
beta squad makes my week fr🙌🏼
Sharky has a son!!??🥺
Are we not going to talk about which one of them is having a baby!?!? Better not be my future BD AJ!
I think Kenny is going to be the first beta squad parent
3
hamza🤑
I think its number 4
Haven't watched your videos in a while very funny lads
Shit was hoping for racist countdown 😢
4
im so happy they have subtitles 😭🫶🏽
Beta squad is the best to watched white eating ❤❤❤
i feel like chunkz is having a child
i think it’s 4👍
So no one talking about how one of them is gonna have a child?
beta squad on top 🔥
Hamza gang
what the hell sharky is a dad?
early
SOMEONE IS HAVING A CHILD?!?!?!
The woman in the white looks like darkest man when she smiles
What a masterclass from chunkz and and aj
It’s 100% sharky having a kid he looking stressed lately
I think it four
big up hamza
Kenny is gon be the father, he’s starting the 13 kids army
lbr Kenny is most likely to be having a baby
6:34 instant regret 💀
21:15 I think number 4
It's Kenny Kenny Kenny...brother looks like a baby making robot man ..with all due respect tho😂Kenny is the one who's gonna have a kid
Clicked soo fast I was in bed before the room was dark
Imagine Einstein was the actual father
0:38 sharkyyy
Literally every single video, I always die of laughter at some point of the videos
13:54 what on earth was that
Feeling proud cuz i came early
Sui
beta squad child?!
ramadan kareem brothers and sisters 🙌
When beta squad posts you stop everything to watch
Beta Squad is incomplete without an  person who is there just to make us laugh
This is too funny 😂
Hello 🎉
niko like this comment if you're the main character. cuz i think u is
Ziggy is a cool name you know.
SQUAD SQUAD
Niko don't collab with JiDion anymore, he's a moron who tried arguing with Kavos about the KSI drama
throughout the whole vid I went along with all of the women in white's stories
The toy interrogation was the best😂
These comments r so fresh
Feels great to watch there vids after a bad day
4 is def the real parent
9:45 the little game of rock paper scissors was elite 😂
omg icl this video was dead funny i was crying
Beta squad is releasing bangers lately respect💯💯
yesssir new vid
Did they say a child?!
What a w video a again
Niko-GOAT
a other banger
shoutout Callux 🤣🤣 3:58
beta squad can you guys do more fake employee vids?? :)
Niko prob the hardest worker bro is doing so many videos. From jidion to beta squad to his own channel.
When #1 said hamza i started crying LMAOO
W vid and I’m early
He has my birthday.
Lets all agree that AJ is stupid but not stupid enough because we love his stupidity 😂😂😂
LOL IM 16
NAH BOSSMAN SAID HAMZA💀
This is just jokes man 😅😂
hi
#4 looks like a ripoff Kanye
He said Hamza😂I can’t man
Kenny’s the parent
These guys don't miss!
Kenny has to be the one having the kid
14min gang
The kid is way too cringe
.
If anyone is having a child I say it's chunkz congrats my man🎉🎉
Im so glad kenny is feeling better ❤
They get better and better every vid
THE WAY NIKO INSTANTLY SAID “OJ?!” HAS ME CRYING
Yesss finally I been waiting since ur last post
Isnt Niko  a bit to young to have a child
loved this video
niko is the best beta member and no one can tell me otherwise.
They bought dreamybull in the videos
(-B
"How old are you ziggy?"  8 "Perfect" 💀
It’s a great day when I see a new Beta Squad vid in my YouTube feed
Props to Niko he can still manege to do the "Who's the biggest menace" and Beta Squad
I GOT SO EXITED WHEN I GOT A NOTIFICATION THAT U UPLOADED A NEW VIDEO😭
I think niko is getting a baby
Love these kind of videos x
Hamza mine name lol
Yo the swan thing has happened to me. I think I was like 4 I'm 16 now. We were at like a huge hospital and it had swans outside, alot of them and I went close to the baby swans and from the back came forth the mother swan and then bit me on the lower back. It didnt really hurt all that much and I was okay but never went close to those swans again. Fast forward a couple months ago I went to that hospital and had forgotten about it and saw those swans and remembered what happened lol
6:57 defo darkest man’s long lost cousin with that waffling 😂
I feel like number 1 needed a second chance 😂
Who has a child????
Nooooo 😂😂😂😂😂 because I died at 2:27
I think hamzah is Einsteins first son 😂
never knew Albert Einstein would appear in a beta squad video
Ur vids are the best I watch all of then😇😇😇
AUYY
I'm glad you lot give us content unlike the Sidemen the bunch of let downs. Imagine giving in to a bunch of Karen's
getting a beta squad notification>>
Ahh I like #1 he should be in more videosss
Coming Home to a new Beta Squad Video is a Blessing For real❤❤
7:06 “oh you want me to continue”😂
The fact that the first person kept trying to prove that Ziggy was his kid after call him Hamza, that's determination right there
love the vids and how u post often
Beta Squad > Sidemen
13:08
PLS LIKE MY COMMENT😎🇳🇬👑
Puts a smile to my face seeing this upload.
Only beta squad has bangers now at days
Beta squad are the perfect people to watch whilst eating

No way one of y’all is having a child that’s so exciting 😭
Why did Sharky say "Perfect" after the kid said he was 8?
Do they reply?
theres nothing better than opening youtube and seeing a new beta squad notification 🔥
you've just got to love the beta squad
Who here has asian mates that are quick to say the N word. Un cancell the Sidemen.
Chunks having a kid I’m calling it RN!!
Beta Squash > Side Puss-

Waiting for this video to come out
Best youtubers out there fr fr who agrees?
Who dy'a think is having a kid?  I can imagine AJ as a parent 😂  My money is on Sharky
My g Hamza was sat there listening to random people pretending to be his parent 😂😂
Finally some beta squad content ❤❤
way better than sidemen love your vid
AJ IS HAVING A CHILD I THINK
Nothing more satisfying than a new beta sqaud videos
Hamza😂
Can’t cope with Hamza 😭😭😭
KSI would've been a great guest appearance for this
we need to know the name of the child :))
Wwwww
The first parent of beta squad has to be Chunkz, sharky or kenny
i just love seeing the notification that beta squad posted!!
Since the sidemen aren't uploading  Beta squad is clear🐐❤️‍🔥
A CHILD?
Bro who is having a kid omggg 🎉🎉🎉✨✨😃✨✨✨✨🎉
