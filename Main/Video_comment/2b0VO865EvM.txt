*What do you guys think?!*
it's impossible to have RR supermodel supersaleswomen?   my sis has a dog called mabnny
Nothing reclines like a Maybach seat, as far as sedans go
My favorite Rolls Royce
God bless you too.
2 chances of 10 000 man hours spent on that dash - zero and none. Just another sales pitch with no facts, just talk. This is still a freaking boat. Rather but a Cullinan. Getting in and out is easier. Driving position is higher. It is not a freaking boat!! 😤 🤧 🤨
the only thing that looks nice in the paint and face RR fell off on this one
Ik word een beetje misselijk van dat mannetje hoeveel geld hij heeft niet normaal
I will buy it when it depreciates 95% in value oh fuck I still won’t be able to afford it even then
Please help me sir please help me 😭🙏😭
That car salesman-just that edgy and greasy feel
You made that sales person the top sales agent in states
It's too animated not respected like the older version
No thanks nice but not for me.....
It's too modern.....
every on of these videos is ruined with the inane background synthetic tapping noise "its not music" is irritating for gods sake
I live 30 seconds from a Rolls Royce factory
The best salesman I have ever seen
feels like I’m watching gta5 gameplay
Hope I will go car shopping like thissssd
Much improved style and beautiful interior. So sweet that the love of your life will choose the spec. 👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Real beautiful car are my dream car i like so sooooo much
I'm obsessed with this TECHNOLOGY!!!!!!!!!!!!! How much is it, I want one. Screw a sports car! This is something else!! You should totally get that in replace of what ever rolls Royce you may have.
It's so obvious how they kiss your ass and it makes me laugh every time
10,000 man-hours on the lacquered front fascia across the dash......you sure about that?
The bitter scent inspiringly confuse because great-grandfather culturally provide amid a gullible gusty kettledrum. wide-eyed, godly lung
The dapper commission externally cure because rowboat coronally pine minus a public eyebrow. unadvised, special hydrogen
How does RR not have full autonomous auto pilot.   For a car that your supposed to be driven in you would think for the $$ they would be up to date on technology
Love the video
Hello,, I'm from California 34 yrs old single gay,, you?????,,
Of course Rolls listens to their customers when they got so few! Imagine honda listening to their customers...
The rural face statistically exercise because wrecker revealingly calculate excluding a daily creator. used, scattered witness
Was the Tach maxed out at start up a warm up indicator or was it faulty?
This want to make me to buy a Rolls too.
You are fabulous
Hi sir i am from india, banglore , karnataka  We had 600 acers of land for sale i hope u can look after that
"Perfect to stash your little cigar or something" with a Bag in his hand, Noice. 9:24
That rear end is horrible lol
There are much better color options
Rolls Royce manager explaining him about the new features  Manny: get out
The open digestion curiously divide because starter advisably talk except a careful foundation. mysterious, selfish jumper
The wicked lip perioperaively crawl because eyeliner numerically damage near a massive banker. scary, murky condor
Greets from Hamburg Germany
I don't like this gen
06:18 Lol I live in Hamburg too.😂
You are a huge inspiration to me. I quit sales at the dealership and am working on getting my real estate license.
I’ll pick one up in ten years for $10K.
I can't wait to see you Drive this Beautiful car. I am happy for you. God bless.
Thx for allowing me to imagine what it’s like to be you  Thx
Handshake Sales Guy: "You got the mask" ....Corona doesn´t care ! :D
if you have money, everyone is your sheep
Let me drive for u manny 😂 I got great license
9:00 that shit was loud
isnt this the same one savage garage tested?
How to be a salesman: don’t be this rolls Royce sales man.
The sales guy is AMAZING. Watch and learn.
I wish I was rich
Salesman so nervous probably wishing his day is made with the commition he will be receiving with selling this ghost off the lot....
You’re a smart man Manny.  “I need to bring my wife.”
"10,000 manhours on that fascia alone" so that one guy 50 weeks a year for 5 years, 5 guys for 50 weeks a year for a year. Or 50 guys for 40 hours a wheel for 5 weeks?  really?????????? I think they make this shit up to just tell rich people.
That color & spec is flat out sexy! They really did a good job redesigning the 👻 & it came out super cool.
Why it is in black color
The way this salesman talk is so calm
This guy could sell me pampers which I do Not Need xD
Imagine getting the best car
The color is really special
Manny: Any place to put the key? RR Salesman: yea right there, perfect to keep your cigar or something  me: or something ey ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Ya we don't wanna die from Carbon Monoxide" Manny is funny without even trying
That guy could trade some Hanes socks for a pair of Gucci's
3:40 when? :(
What's a bigger flex, Manny having Pagani on speed-dial, or RR having Manny on THEIR speed-dial…
I just hope your wife let us buy it lol
you know you've made it when you get a phone call from Rolls Royce
THIS GUY HAS A LOT OF MONEY > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiI09qkaWAo
Brother get me one. Not a big thing for you
Nice rental bro...OK let's see all the cars in 1 line, at the same time
HOLY MOLY when I saw the interior my jaw dropped
What a good guy he is gonna get acceptance from his wife
Hi I want to  order one for my collection 🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅
What a fucking waste of money.
Now it looks just right. Gorgeous.
I got surprised how loud the engine is for a RR. Like so much that interior TUXEDO style.
Love this video and your position to say that you are definitely going to get it... you are the man! Anyway, I think it is the best looking Rolls Royce ever - luxury, stylish and yet sporty! Though it does have a little resemblance of the 7-series, but since it has always been built on the German brother's platform anyway! Liked and Subscribed!
Drops down I thought it drops up
I like manny funny guy
Face mask cost more than my malibu
Asboustelely fabulous  its parking  itself   like Mercedes s classic
Manny listen's to him like he doesn't know anything
great video
my guy went t rolls royce showroom in a t-shirt
how do you get this money?
Manny - “ill be talking to my wife about this car” Me “ ill be talking to my wife about which cheese to get home from coles”
Further more if it's truly the finest vehicle in the world. Why are the resale numbers depreciating $25,000 to $50,000 per year for years 1 through 4? Sales person body language is nervously uncomfortable, hoping Manny will fall for the B.S.  Look people if you need to make $400,000 or $600,000 make a product that is actually worth it🙈🙊👌🤦😂😎👃👋🤟 sounds simply enough, obviously it's not
2. Rolls Royce has priced a Rolls but it was actually a BMW. now that people stop buying. They say wait, wait wait. It's a Rolls Royce again. Get out of here 😁
This is an embarrassment I will explain...
Whos the queer in the back. 8:49. Go back to high school.
they are wearing masks and then they shake hands what a wonderfull way to start
I would do so much drugs in the back seat. Thats just me though.
That's a car room in the back
Rolls are for men I had 59 biscayne that was a long car drove it with no problem power steering went out I cut the power steering hose
lol Goodwood salesman sticks around after the question tryna secure a half deal... lookin all evil n shit
When you're so lazy you can't even bother to pull or push your own car door to get in or out of the car. Rich people really think they're just the ish dont they.
i think it's the most luxurious car in the world.. i love it. but also LOVE your Royal Oak offshore :0))))
This guy has so Manny money...
What does he do to earn money to afford cars like these... I wanna know.... I want inspiration
that rolls dealer is slick
I like rolls-royce ghost
And hey man!! Is there a way I can work with your company I recently got my real estate license in the best state(Delaware) and you would not believe the 100s of millions of real estate just sitting here cheap right now no one is buying it and I know the state very well and where the prime real estate for the future will be...there is so much room to make profit I’m not sure if you have ever done research for the state of Delaware but it is a tax haven state for business.... so my man there is a lot of room to make money please give me a response and we can maybe speak more I watch all of your videos and would love to have you as a mentor. I know a lot of these real estate moguls are fake and lie when they say they love to mentor people but I watch every video you post and having you as my mentor would change my life. I’m not a beggar I just want to work hard and earn any money I make
Great car.
"i'm pretty sure i'm going to order one, but i'ma need my wife to do that", come on brah -_-
Add me to ur slave list sir
Unbelievable results!! This has been an incredible experience from day one with mr Dennis @Dennis_forex09 at Instagram. This wasn't my first time trading but honestly I didn’t know what to expect when I first joined. After much loss. God walked me through the entire process from start to finish, which was a HUGE plus! They made the entire process  so easy and hassle-free! I’m very impressed! Go to him @Dennis_forex09 I will definitely be referring him to you all,
Manny is so down to earth hey
I wanna be this rich, Im gonna be this rich 🌟🌟🌟
hello .yest just start seeing your video .👏👏👏👏👏👏👻🌺🌺🌺
I’m more whiling to get a ghost now because the previous one was just to big
👎👎
$datmug
They sent a German to represent Rolls Royce. Just in case anyone was under any doubt, there's not much British about this brand anymore
This is my favourite Ghost by RoLeY. Mad Motor. Love It. 👍🏻
How much$ new car?
You inspire me Manny. Money command respect.
Im sure he be the first ok lol he wants that commission
This is the "I am gonna watch all this guy's videos so I can close the sale" type of dealer
9.31 not a worry with modern cars
Круто 💥
I want to drive it past soup kitchens throwing truffles at the homeless people. "Now floor it Jeeves choppy choppy!"
Beautiful
You'd think for such a massive cost they'd have atleast have decent fitment. Wheels are so far inset
Manny can you please spec out Maybach so we can live the experience with you😁 love your vids
It’s nice when the salesman is actually knowledgeable about the car. Go to a Ford dealer, and they don’t know shit
Absolutely beautiful, love the exterior the changes they did, especially with the interior and the 2 tone color combo
I like how Manny consults his wife before doing anything. I love this man. Great Success.
"They listened to people like you"  Lol hahaha, of course they gon listen, you are thier customer
No to masks
That's a beautiful car man.i hope u get it.
Manny, you have an obvious love for the RR brand.  'm commenting on this because we have 3  Silver Cloud III's in our family.  That we have loved since the day we've had them.   My family is the original owner.  I was actually born in one on way to hospital. LOL You should invest in a SC3, and have the mechanics completely refurbished to today's standards and technology.  It would be an absolute amazing motorcar.   ALL RR's are work's of art, but for my NOTHING compares to the outward appearance of the SC3. (In my opinion.) Thank you for sharing your love and appreciation of the RR brand! Best wishes to your newest addition.  Enjoy! Cheers, Keith
if it da ghost why aint it white
umm excuse me can i uhhhhhh have Pwese
RRs have something about them that even though they costs a lot, especially after personalising, it deserves and fully justifies its price. You can't say that for any other cars.
manny you should do a give away for your one million subscriber ?
سلام اقای خوشبین من حسین هستم از ایران شهر اسلامشهر من ارزو دارم یه ماشین داشته باشم ولی در توانم نیست اینجا دلار شده 27 هزار تومن پراید 23 ملیونی شده 117 ملیون اگه میشه کمکم کنید بتونم یه ماشین بخرم به مادرم میگم دعات کنه خودتو خانوادت سلامت باشید این شمارمه 09357197128 امیدوارم این پیاممو بخونید هر چند میدونم وقت نداریدو مخاطب زیاد دارید.
you should buy this car for sure
Can anyone tell me what does he do for a living
My first time seeing the new ghost 👻 love all the updates finally
Is it me or is the sales guy “Shooter Mc Gavin” ? 👈🏻
Fn Manny you the man bruh
Is this video about the car or about the guy !! And the salesman is not up to task
Adding Ferrari sf90 stradale in your garage would be cool
Wow it's gorgeous 😍😍😍
when will you be doing a giveaway???
Instead wasting money on cars you can either waste your money on homeless people
So beautiful 🤩👻😍
ALOT of umms from the salesman. Need to do your homework before Manny shows up
Buy its its worth every penny....
Manny when is the private jet going to join the family???
He asked what's horses power  he should have answered SUFFICIENT
That looks like China made version of roll's Royce
الحمدلله رب العالمين 😁 الفلوس مو كل شيء، انا اعرف ناس بكامري و اسعد ناس في عالم 😇
in Huefelandstrasse (Munich) they had RR in the basement. So now all i see is not a RR but a freaking BMW from Huefelandstrasse .
"feet-pound of torque". Well people I'm still waiting the day people will go to school and realise foot-pound is never something else than a torque. So the expression "feet-pound of torque" is like saying the "white wall is white and the blue sky is blue" or saying "the car goes 123 mph of speed" "rides the quarter mile in 12 second of time" or slow down from 60 to zero in 50 meters of distance".
now i feel like i came back from the RR dealership/dealerbullshit. I mean the dealer is nice but eh a little bit too much BS.
Rolls Royce dealer: well everything has been changed from the previous generation  BMW engineers / project managers: well not really  Suppliers engineers / project managers: well not really  ahahahahahahaah
Rolls royce looks a little different than a chrysler ngl i dont see the beauty in them
Mercedes Benz W140. https://youtu.be/rT-otmKxm_s
You know that youre rich, when Rolls Royce is calling you and even closes the Dealership.
*puts on mask*  *shakes hand*
Manny ain’t the boss. The wife is
excellently finished car
On the illuminated starlight dash - the word GHOST can be replaced with whatever words you want, or eliminated .
Did you guys have a microphone shoved up the exhaust pipe?!?! That shit was loud!
I'd love one, but Rolls Royce's really aren't that aesthetically pleasing
That purple color in the background looks good...Damn that interior really looks Clean...Perfect mix to keep the ink from rubbing off into the seats
i love how manny looks like a little kid while listens to the seller   :D
Love from somalia
manny sir u need sleep
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد كما صليت على إبراهيم و آل إبراهيم في العالمين إنك حميد مجيد اللهم بارك على محمد وآل محمد كما باركت على إبراهيم و آل إبراهيم في العالمين إنك حميد مجيد
4:45 thats BMW touch
does he still have his Porsch 935?
I wonder what his wife drives??
If I were to buy a Rolls Royce to drive more than to be driven in, I'd pick the Cullinan, but what do I know I'm nowhere near being able to be in the market for one of these lol
Do you guys handshake these days? I can't even think about it, but Manny is always taking risks :D
The rolls Royce dealership employee had a mask but still shakes hands with him
Haha sales guy seems unknowlagable
If you think you've failed in binary options trading, its a lie my friends because I was lost until i saw a post about Mr Young.I'm glad to introduce you to the most amazing manager ever,In fact all hope was lost until I met this amazing manager who changed my life for good.If you're interested in regaining all your loss you can get in touch with him via Instagram @you_ngli or send a email linyoun56g@ gmail. com
You know you’re high up in the car world when Rolls Royce calls you
Well Manny s still at 900k and arjyou hit 2M by doing 2videos😂😂
Lol I love how manny says plenty of leg room even though he’s like 5’6”... like any car basically has enough leg room for him
This sales guy is really good
Hi manny, great content, I hope you buy one of these super cars... can't wait for the review... keep up the good work..👍
Come on Mr.Manny When LaFerrari
Wow
What do I think? I think that you should keep your mask on and avoid shaking hands with people.
Manny buy Chiron super sport.
That's a beautiful updated Rolls Royce.  I like the extra room in back.
Like the Phantom Drophead you have is not even more boat like
I honestly think that the Phantom 8 is perfect. However this new ghost looks pretty too
nobody, i mean NOBODY  Manny: Holy Moly!!!
Manny....I don't know if you are seeing this but if you do can you tell me why you still don't have a ferrari in your collection pls..
Get the Phantom the Ghost looks like a Toyota
We the salesman said how much horsepower and torque, I liked the video 😂
Hey man you can gift me that older one or the oldest man actually you can gift me your oldest or worst Car no matter brand
Wtf? Why YouTube notified me about this video? I watched this last week.
Amazing car!
The funny thing about Rolls Royce is you don’t know if the driver is worth $1,000,0000 , $10,000,0000 , $100,000,000 or $1,000,000,000
....hello .many i am from indian ...rolls royce car my dream car...and ride safe....okay.....by....
You wouldn’t of been there if hadn’t already talked to your wife, pull the trigger it’s clear she supports your car addiction being that you’ve managed to practically fill up an airplane hangar with them
Go for the rr suv and get it by Mansoory
Get this wise man to 1Million subscribers!!
Manny manny manny. Next time please,  don't ask about how dim the lights will end up on. 😂😂 I mean even the expert from overseas in Germany was so surprised that when he heard your question he wished for the earth to split and swallow him there and then. 😂😂 so please man stick to the  buttons on the car like what does this one do or how great are the brakes
Why are there so many Verified People commenting on this video???
You didn’t end up seeing how the spirit of ecstasy went down into the hood. Update?
Salesman;  "Commission,Commission, Commission"
BRUH MY DAD WAS AT THAT DEALERSHIP 2 WEEKS AGOOO
I think you would like the devil 16
I’m watching this in my work closet sitting on a box. I don’t deserve to be seeing this
I would take that phantom overthere not the ghost
Why are you not posting a vudeo
Me:- I can afford a royce rolls  My mind-: 2:20
10,000 man hours is a false statement i guess
I think feed poor and end hunger makes you more rich than buying cars
Should have gone for the flying spur
This guy manny in the future and we in the past
it looks a lot like a bugatti
when the salesman is more nervous than the buyer. manny is not intimaded by the luxury and keep asking the new features lol
I'm literally confused, who's Jeff Bezos?
What is its price🙄🙂
i can finally say to a car manafactuer, too much. there ae so many features, like holy hell man.
Get it Manny
Mask 😷 ok ... but shaking hand 🤝 no good in 2020 ... 😉😂😂😂
3 defects in the front bumper design, not hiding the screen like the previous one, and the back seat table is not as small as before. Honestly, I wanted to buy Rolls, but these defects made me hesitant and the lack of wood in the dashboard and doors
you should konsider buying a McLaren 765LT Supercar they are only making 765 of them and its the most beautiful car i ever have seen
Manny i'm a 16 year old trying to be a millionaire but i can't afford paying 800$/year for a mentorship that will not guarantee anything 😔
I love seeing manny happy, he’s such a good guy
Wonderful car, I also like the killer beat at the beginning of the video I wonder who made it
One man, needs too Many cars ? And anothers mans die for hunger...  You can sleeep man ? Really ?
Manny you should buy a Mclaren 756lt
As per my opinion, I might say that many people nowdays express themselves so wrongly , by saying this or thst person spends money because he doesn't know how rich he is.  Here's the deal, guys. First of all is the privilege and the respect, you get from dealerships from such supreme companies. And honestly I'd say you feel grateful that someone respects you and have such a big gratitude abd consideration for you, as a person.   @manny khoshbin , thank you for sharing your personal day to day videos with us. I personally love your videos and the fact how humble and honest you are. Keep up the great work, as you always do. 🤝🤝
did they just shake hands while wearing a mask
It just doesn't have the presence of the previous version. There's nothing that makes you really go "wow" when you see it. I'm sure it looks better in person though.
Great Choice Manny👌 I'd buy that too.
Please do it’s a beautiful car and if live to see it in your collection!
I wanna be Manny Khoshbin just to flex around showrooms.
You should definitely buy it
How are u giving up a convertible in Cali??? Plus cigars???
I wish I could afford one manny you wanna buy me one hahaha jk
Looks horrible like every other RR
Salesmen being salesmen.
Manny can I send you the numbers for my 2010 Lexus LS460 it will be 300k cheaper for a daily 🤣
Buy it 🤞🏾💪🏾❤💯
Everything is so tasteless, just... empty sadness
Yeah this he is from England! His is German and also works on the 7 series!
Manny I’m pretty sure if you asked them they would do unmentionable things to your willy just to get a sale 🤣😂🤣😇
What about your porches 935
The AMG one comes out it will look nice in the collection
Mr.Manny, try also Bentley.
Manny "the motivator" Koshbin
Sir we need a full podcast kinda thing in which you tell how you started, how you made your first investment in your business and everything, ur ups, ur downs, ur hardest point and your life changing decisions, moments and experiences.🙏🙏
Hello Mr Manny, what do You think about new Maserati MC20?
At around 9:50 there is leth’s intro song playing in the background
Hi Manny, I have a question and would love you to make a video on this. What’s your advice for someone chasing the kind of success that you’ve achieved who’s starting in real estate with just 20k saved? Thank you!
Wow
Huawei vs Xiaomi https://youtu.be/wbJvweNdbdQ
overrated
he should take a look at the mercedes avtr
Sir , I don't know you, but I want to know     what is your job
Damn.. That interior design is the best!
Kaya gile babu
Manny.... Get the Bentley Flying Spur...
Kilian freut sich so hart😂

Manny is the kind of guy who see's cool picture of cars online and goes and gets the car XD
One day you we’ll be famous
I like that underneath its a 70 grand 7 series
You to rich to be click baiting bro
it looks a bit too much like a bmw for me....
I want a RR mask 😷..
Love that he needs to discuss it with his wife. Goals 👏
u should get a Maserati MC20. It looks really cool
wears a mask, but shakes hands !?!?
When does the speedtail come in?
I’ll take your old Roles Royce
wearing facemasks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,shaking hands....................................never heard of covid19?
the watch and sunglasses can buy the car.
Perfect to hide your cigar or .....spliff 🥶
its a nice Car/Boat but the thing is that its like manny's old Rolls Royce (on fornt seat) and extra luxy on rear seat  (i mean if M.K want this car than he mey have to buy driver :) to feel that Luxurious rear of RR)
😍😍😍
Why do you need your wife to order the car?
your just boring mate buy a vauxhall get real, goodbye
, sell up and give to the poor 🤗
Looking more like a ugly new BMW
Manny i dont need RR, i only need 8k for new outboard motor. Give me a loan :D
half a milion and no key holder??   9:05 what a scam rolls royce! ive had enough of this bullshit.
Even Manny have to discuss about what to buy things  with wife Wife is the ultimate boss No matter what the place is it or how rich you are 😄
I want to be rich like you, soon When I get 18 years old I will try your mentor
Manny is nerve going to sit in the back seats 🤣
Manny! You need this slr!    https://collectingcars.com/for-sale/2007-mercedes-benz-slr-mclaren-edition
Anyone else think he should get a Lamborghini veneno?
Making show off of money
👌
I actually like more the old version, this looks like the Chrysler, But interior is just jaw dropping
EU QUERIA VER O CARRO, E VOCES DOIS APARECERAM MAIS DO QUE O RR
Manny - “ill be talking to my wife about this car” Me “ ill be talking to my wife about which cheese to get home from coles”
The guy that’s from England he looks like the guy from futurama
Look at me....I’m manny
Hey manny you shoud sticker the cars and get all the cars out and in to a drive throuh maybe "short-sticker the car woth your name
Why was that idiot wearing a mask if he’s taking it down to talk? As nutty as the people who believe it’s real “covid19” that is!
You need to get the Tesla roadster if it comes out!!
love your vids manny!
But I like the old one
Justo ayer vi uno jjajja
What's the Price of this....
Camera man .. focus on the car .. not the people talking
Brother are you from chitral pakistan please tell me
Hello Manny. Would ever buy a Tesla Model S / X or 3?
Wsste if fucking $$ While the earth implodes people do the stupidest things
Is this gta 6?
Love the guy style  ...neat and rich
Super Car
Dr. Fauci does NOT recommend to shake hands!!
this guy is the worst salesman ever..
As sad as it I may sound but I would marry that car.
Manny I have an idea for a car you should add, the Apollo IE 🔥🔥
He forgot to show how the spirit of ecstasy goes down
10,000 hours times $10-15/hour equals $100,000 -150,000 cost to build a dash light. This car in 10 years will only be worth $100,000
@manny khoshbin. Sir , could you pls give me some tips to become a great man like you🙏
Are you getting a chiron pur sport?
royce or maybach manny ? and do you like the cullinan ?
“We don’t wanna die from carbon monoxide.”  Constantly buys and owns dozens of high performance petroleum cars
Super Manny !!! Amazing
Hermes Ghost?
I like it, pretty clean, I really like the green
Buying a Ghost and saving 100.000 usd instead of buying the more expensive phantom - is the recession reaching MK as well?
Got annoyed by the fact that the headlights are not parallel to the grill
Mr Manny congrats for your future RR. Great success
So aparently any dark foreigner with money can buy a rolls royce. Shame with the lack of class of the brand to allow any cheap looking person with money get this cars. Brand should know better. Salesperson just want the comission
Wow they closed down the dealership for Manny.
He said his last car was to big? Ummm... this is a rolls royce whats bigger than this car in his price range ?
Buy it man , it's amazing , waiting to see your driving that to your garage ♥️
One day I wish to be as successfull as him one day...
Some how looks outdated compared to the previous gen. Ghost. Too curvy maybe?
Im really lovin the interior. OMG
Imagine the automatic doors break down
Wearing a mask and shaking hands. Tf is that
i think he should get a wraith or cullinan
"My collection" how snobby can you get.....enjoy it because you ain't taking your "cars" to the grave....
Can we get up to 1k likes in this fantastic video
Don't forget to drive safe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifzMlaaOZ0w

But a 992 Turbo S and beat the car up. It will last and I think it will be a fun edition to the channel.
0:45 americans....

If the law of attraction was a person Manny is the number one candidate
If u get it then get the short wheel base
That kid needs to wear his face mask
2:20  Manny : get out  Salesman : yeah
You did It!!!!!!!
Boring!
Man i wish one day i go to the rolls Royce and buy one

Yo my Persian dude. Wanna fund my music?
Its funny how RR has to hire a guy with that stereotypical look of a rich white guy..........just to be a salesman
why does this channel need advertisments
Don't mean to dis but rolls are wasted on me, why buy a car that really you shouldn't drive but your driver should. Cars should make you feel alive not goto sleep. Anyway end of rant.
We know now that Manny likes a big rear end 😆
Keep doin it!
Putting on a mask than shaking hands AHAHAH why u even put on that mask than???
I’m the same guy behind just doesn’t know where to go 2:59
Can u loan me 1million manny?
Next collection Victor Aston Martin???
Wow I always thought that the ghost was just the crap version of the phantom but apparently not
Hi Manny i saw a car maybe you're interested a MacLaren Speedtail cheack it out
Dude beautiful man! I grant you everything that comes your way and more! I am thinking to emigrate to America or other country even to implant your guidance because I think it doesn't work here. I admire the humbleness and the free advice and fun videos just the way you treat people is amazing because I believe in karma who does good gets good.
pay your video guy more money!
Very good ghost
There is so much 7 series elements in this car. Even RR is using BMW's tech for the autonomous driving. Paying so much more for a 7 series.
What a machine. Apex predator of luxury
Why not the 4 x 4 one? With a body kit?
Giving my fans a brand new Bugatti Imagine
10 000 hrs to make this part, it's lie, only this part would cost 150.000 dollar for work + materials.
Why do you need to ask your wife Manny? Is it a joint account?
Buy a dawn
I think you're a true gentleman for seeking your wife's approval first :)
Why would he hide a cigar? 😂
To manny your Next supercar must be a Lexus LFA.I know you like rare cars.
Sad the sailsman dident talk about that you can custom the Area where it says ghost. Manny could put his Logo there in yellow.
Manny probs wont see this but hey there is going to be a very special SLR Mclaren hitting an auction soon i know you have 5 but this isnt just any SLR its serial number 001 of the limited run SLR MSO edition has so many upgrades its ridiculous you should check it out
The sales agent doesnt know that much about the car and its features and one of it is that now its doors open automatically or it assists you while opening it
It's absolute Manny🤑
Why don’t you add a w motors car to your collection     Those cars are rarely found
This dude on point tho. Closed the dealership for you 🔥🔥🔥 I cant even shut down a McDonald’s
Manny it’s crazy awesome 😎 the luxury unbelievable 🤙🤙✌️
Imagine just casually going to shop for a rolls Royce
I wish they would have popped the hood so we could see how they worked the Spirit of Ecstasy into it.
9:25 or somthing lol
They probably made this car especially for him. Impressive.
When will you get a LaFerrari ?
Just buy a new drophead lol
can you help me buy a pc☹️
Looks classy without being a Ostentatious.
Super car blondie should come check Manny's garage out ! 😂
Killion has his mask on the whole time while standing alone, then when he walks up to manny and the other guy, he pulls his mask down to talk to them within the 6 foot range. His mask became useless at that point lol
Men will be Men. I am gonna let my wife to know about this.
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k things to come
I love those salesmen :-)
Man did he just say maybe im gonna pick this ghost up 😭🤣
You need this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVT9zs5glpg
Be honest Manny made the review intresting
It's still 2020 now 🙄
RR: So this is our new GHO... Manny: i'll take you entire stock.
Its a nice smooth car
https://open.spotify.com/album/0IAeHeC7SQWmaNjeHIYhZz?si=ldtDUjUuTnexFJv-TESiuA
the configuration is crazy I love it, it makes you want to be rich
Real GTA in life💓
This guy buys cars like I buy water bottles...and there absolutely nothing wrong with that.If he were broke and homeless people would never help him and walk right by him.Make all the money dude and keep buying all the cars,the same person who would say it's accessive is the same person who wouldn't help you if you had nothing.
Necks gonna snap when that airbag goes off bc he's sitting so close to the wheel lol
puts on the mask.. AND.. shake his hand!😂
Sir you should buy  a hermes rolls royce......
Manny i wish you'd make it like your chocolate Bugatti.
https://youtu.be/jVT9zs5glpg
Hermes Royce rolls will fit your bill 💯💰👌
To us regular folks it’s the same as a phantom. Manny, Jim’s father from American pie and the kid from good wood be like Nooooooooooo it’s not !
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful.
Manny sees any orange: WOW Hermes orange
F THE MASKS!
That Cullinan in the back is more cooler
Show the goddamn car!!
Omni driver
Let’s ask himburg all the way from Germany  Himburg: umm I don’t know....
Many peoples dream to buy a car like this byt Manny buys this as a daily driver. Just rich things
Nice one sir. The car looked like a million bucks. Will you be driving it or will you hire a driver?
Money Khoshbin
Beautiful car Manny. Love the orange stripe in it also.
Manny: Thanks for the mask Rolls Royce!  Manny: Proceeds to SHAKE HANDS WITH SALESMAN  🤦🏼
Remove mask when u get close to people 🤣!
manny cashbin
Hello. Do you have a wonderful car driver for that? If not, I will.  😉😎
I find it hard to understand cars painted green, just doesn't work
Best car 🚗❤️
Bro wtf. The dealer could be easily his brother 😁
Manny I need $2500 to register my business. Care to help? You'll get it back double
Can u buy me a c63 amg please?
اللهم صل وسلم على محمد وآل محمد كما صليت على إبراهيم و آل إبراهيم في العالمين إنك حميد مجيد
Can I have your old rolls royce
That’s gr8 colour choice. I really liked the overall design as well as the displayed colour too!  It’s just gr8!
get the gray one!
WERE RICH IN ❤ NOT THINGS. WERE DAUGHTERS 4 LIFE! 👩👱‍♀️👩‍🦰
I don't have bike
Wear a mask and shakes hand. Outstanding.
Thank you for showing me how poor I'm actually am
Am I the only one who thinks this is ugly and about to click to the Ford GT video? Usually love your car choices Manny! Just not this one!
Manny I think you should also checkout the new S-class, you'll absolutely love it. It simply takes technology to another level 💯❤️
This guy has more cars than the number of underwears I own
i wanna hit you so hard cuz you're so fckin rich..... but i also love you cuz you're so humble too..
Why are you not buying a lamborghini centenario hypercar or a laferrari hypercar Manny i hope you see this I am a big fan to you, stay save
Imagine being so amazing the dealership closes its doors just for you
What’s crazy is that this car sales man looks just like my ear doctor. I bet he makes just as much as him without the long long years of school. But than again , to work your way up to selling rolls royces takes time as well without paying for the degree.
Respect to you though mate...but America needs to get a handle on this thing soon.
*puts on mask and walks in to proceed shaking hand* thanks for the mask😆🤣🤣🤣
You wear the mask then shake hands....not too smart Manny.
Only youtuber that never travel to visit orther country
2020 not 2021
Rolls Royce!  It always stands at the top..
Imagine making his royce one of his hermes edition collection
These guys at the dealership are going broke so they want to sell something to anyone to recover their loss.😖
Manny is awesome
Bruh...you buyin cars like we buy candy ....
The RR salesman looks much more like a RR owner than Manny...
More rubbish
U showed me that working hard and having dedication will make ur dreams come true in the future.
Wears a mask but shakes hand. Oh god!
Literally 99% of you won’t see this but God loves you so much. Hope you guys have an fantastic day! (Please Read My Name 💝💗)
killian is pretty cute
I hope manny is my long lost father so i can escape the hard life of living in a third world country
New cars are nice but i will stay driving my 1984 Cadillac fleedwood brougham d elegance....its what i consider luxury and comfort all around ....if i was rich af i would get the Cadillac cien...no questions ...
Which song is the trap song??
Just buy it
the salesman reminds me of the head pixie from fairly odd parents
Mbn to own a Rolls.
That Purple Cullilan though!
why does this guy need to brag about buying dis garbage
I'm loving the new production on your videos 👍
Manny, you didn't mentioned any price for that car, is it secret? Otherwise how much?
buy it. what do you wanna do with all your money? do it! you deserve car # 37...
Money grow on trees
That arm rest that opens up in the back is kinda awkward
But a regular version and i think you’ll be happy.
I think in terms of exterior design this is the ugliest rolls by far but this extended wheelbase one looks good than the normal variant.
A normal car for manny is a rolls Royce
You need that exact same spec... wow 😍
Is sporty really what you’re looking for in a Rolls? Elegance is what Rolls stands for.
Love you bro ❤️❤️
Manny has reached the level of success where he walks into a dealership and it closes down for him. I am at the same status in Gta :D
manny: everything's good but what's the horsepower? lmao true car guy
ПОЗДРОВЛЯЮ И ДАРЮ ВАМ ПОЗИТИВ и ЛюбОВь )
That sales man sound like he has no idea what he’s talking about he’s not natural
RR Manager: We're not making any sales, what should we do? RR Salesguy: What if we invite Manny?
I love the car but 10,000 man hours in the fascia alone!?...how is that possible? Smoke break for 9,900 hours and actually working for 100...ahh that makes more sense.
Nice Video Editing 👍👍👍 #peepalpeace  CONGRATULATIONS MANNY🎉🎉🎉🎉
Omg this reminds me of having to work with rich people and put up with their bullshit 🙄. Not saying he is mean, he actually seems pretty nice. But it reminds me of all the mean, condescending ones I had to deal with.
I’m going to get one tomorrow
Que buen video el de hoy
this guy is a RR salesman to a T
By it
Weak!  He should’ve gotten a manager involved for that T.O... lol
Nice design only 1 thing i would change is the position of the back door handle on the inside and make it closer to the passenger..
Spirit of ecstasy 🤷🏽‍♂️
O plz show us more of your things!..smh... make a video helping out poor people or something pal
This looks like a Chrysler 300 to me. I always think that’s what they are into I see the wings on the hood
guys I can't even tell you how excited and how full of love my heart feels when I look this guy smiling. I'm half Persian, so when I see this happy, wealthy and handsome Persian man smiling, it reminds me of myself and my family. God bless u all <3!!!
NEXT VIDEO MANNY PLEASE COMPARE YOUR HERMES PAGANI HUAYRA VS YOUR HERMES BUGATTI CHIRON. THANK YOU
Love that salesman he's legit I've delivered Rolls-Royce to that dealer in Irvine straight from the port in Jersey City (Reliable Carriers)
I love that car so much. I’ve been here since 35 thousand subs
Shoutout to the cameraman & editor for the flicks📸👌🏽
Salesman: I’ve done 2 videos for this man, he best be ordering that new Rolls! Manny: *feeling pressured* I’ll have to chat with the wife. 😂
Man those cars are absolutely beautiful.
as a owner of 10 rolls royce cars, i approve of this purchase manny you have much to learn about rolls royce
The ghost is one of my favorite cars
buy it :)
since when does manny consult with his wife for a car
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! I hope you Stay healthy through these tough times,  ... My dream is to have 2k. I been struggling to get there🙏
Those seats would be heaven with my mashed up spine!
Think the salesman needs to find out more about his product that he’s selling
all that money.. no moonroof or covertable.....next
gosh, how did that man become a manager there? i could speak much better than him and have Manny buy 3
I like how Manny plays dum all the time! He knows very well every single feature in the car but definitely will get a great discount 🤣
I really like the car but how are you going to get out of the car park when the car door is long?
11:20 why would you shake hands at this stage?
Front looks too much like the SUV
Hey Manny,  Liked the video.  Question for you.  Are you going to talk about the Gordon Murray T50 and would you buy one?
I don't like a yes man. The guys just trying to get you to take the car ...
Fuel prices are going to quadruple if Biden wins.
Would you get extended wheel base or standard wheel base? I would have thought the standard wheelbase would be the size you are after since you find the Phantom too big. Also i would have asked the salesman if the standard wheelbase has the same elec closing door feature as the LWB.
Buy it new daily 👍🏻👍🏻
Disembody Narrative of Self🎈Non-Duality
This is what success gives you, started from the bottom now at the top. When you have so much money and you dont know what do with it. Keep it up Manny.
this is not a car to drive. It is to be chauffeured in.  Not a car your wife should drive
Hey, no handshakes
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18 .
why do people watch this ?
you’re a god
Im definitely ordering mine in Dec. My present to myself 🤴🏾👏🏿💣
Why r u wearing those stupid masks there's nothing wrong with you both why are you being so effing  compliant and PC  for a controlling lie?
Manny you deserve it  You have worked hard for your cars , so  Go for it
5:25 Ehh, I doubt that.. For designing, slight probability, but for actual production? Doubt.
U already have the phantom, so why not just get a wraith?
Trust in Jesus he died for your sins, believe the gospel. Repent!!! If you do sin confess your sins, ask him to help you overcome your sins he will. Obey Jesus, live by his teachings, be led by the Holy Spirit. The Lord is coming soon you must live by his teachings. The love of God is beyond our understanding  God bless,,...,..
Can you buy a doge DEMON 2018 BROOO
10,000 man hours just for the fascia loooooool
Maybe I'm missing something, why would you "collect" expensive depreciating assets?
when ur so rich the dealership calls you
You need one
This car costs more then my house
Great detailed review. Im leaning to the Cullinan on the Rolls Royce side along with the 2021 Bentley Flying Spur
I don't like the front the grill does not look right?
I was exited when you were buying phantom but this new ghost just look like an ordinary car😔😔😔😔😔
I mean the car looks sick but what i would do personally is black it all out and put window tints
Not a very good salesman. He tries too hard with everything he says. Too much suspense pausing. Maybe he is nervous but he needs some help
I swear every time manny starts up a car he says “we don’t want to die from carbon monoxide!” After 30 seconds😂
this dealership guy sounds and acts like Timmy Sykes
Manny there is shooting stars too did you see any?   🌌🌠
*Please drive a chevrolet suburban 2021 Its my dream car and i want to see your reaction to it* 🤔
he inspires me a lot and hes humble
phantom is way, way better
Using mask and touching man hand✋😅
U said adding ..... U didn't say looking ....
Phantom is so much better, a true Rolls. This is like a VW deluxe.
Buy abt Audi RSQ8-R
Materialism!
Yeah uh its perfect to stash a cigar or something.... ;)
I just purchased one 2 days ago, great  vehicle!!!
Can you add a 2013 Honda Civic with eco to my life ?  Please and thank you lol
Shared on www.signtheartist.com submit your music
I love you bro and you car ❤
I love how manny keeps it cool and simple with dealing and thats his great success!! I’ll see you there one day !! 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Manny - Just like Most Kind Guys that respond to your Sincere requests - "I really hope you see my response(s)"   I posted a Detailed Reply....to your previous post URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOaGDz6zDR4&t=54s where the same Gentleman RR Orange County brought the White Demo Phantom that sits on their lot, to you.  Check out my response - same Username - I recommended a few options for you.  Yes, this Ghost EWB is the Perfect Replacement to your 2004-2001 Black EWB Phantom - its 18 inches shorter, weighs a 1000 pounds less, and drives Amazing (Planar Suspension)  My Configuration Suggestion for you  1. Exterior -- Twilight Purple and English White  2. Interior - Leather colors are Tailored Purple and Grace White, with Forge Yellow piping and stitching (that's the closest the configurator would let me get to gold, sadly, and comes close to matching your favorite "Hermes Orange") - Get the Gold Spirit of Ecstasy Hood Emblem option, contrasts beautifully with the English White on the hood  3. URL to RR Ghost EWB Configuration: https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en_US/bespoke/configure-your-rolls-royce.html  This is the Bespoke Config as there are lots of "Commissioned Options" to pick from  Hope it helps, and I really believe the EWB Ghost is the Perfect Car to Transport your Beloved Family, and the Perfect Choice to take over from your long overdue for Replacement Phantom EWB Black Car!  Good Luck and God Bless!
LOL I like how Manny concludes the video "I'm gonna need my wife's decision." BS! LOL I'm sure he makes all his own car decisions and he was rich before he got married
put on the masks but did the handshake. tsk tsk
Congratulations Manny !!! 👍
I like the ghost better than the other RR you looked at earlier. Best wishes and keep up the great work!
This car is awesome
okay,  we get it,,, you're really rich
WGAF...REALLY
Becoming urticaria-free really feels NICE. With numerous OTC products and Big Pharma pressing their medications everyday in the news, it's kinda stressful to get a grasp on what works and what doesn't. Others, such as the one that keeps being mentioned: Shane Zormander's homepage, takes a different approach and sets out the facts.
I went to go buy 2 Rolls-Royce cars today but the dealership was closed to a guy only buying one.
I want to become so rich one day, that a Rolls Royce dealership will close down for customers, just to let me TRY one of their cars!
didn't watch a second just came to inform there's no such thing as 2021 Rolls Royce yet
This new way of opening the door is one of those weird gimmiks...once you get used to it you never lose it again and do it on any other car aswell lmao
That front part eats you . . . $[||||||||||||||]$ Nice
Think Manny is one of the few people who shakes someones hand while wearing a mask
Add some help to the world
Am I tripping or like not so long ago the goat him self was like at 500k subs now almost a million 😭
Masks and a handshake?? Pick a lane bro
'arju aishtirak😦
The colours combination is amazing
Fantastic car to add to the collection.  I think the Rolls Royce Phantom looks quite awesome personally.  I think I will add it to my collection in a few years possibly.  The only issue, though, is finding women who want to ride around in it.  In my area, the women prefer the latest models in cars, so if I bought it used, many wouldn't ride with me.  It's a dilemma for sure.
Beautiful vehicle ✊Enjoy it
Buy a bentley or some other luxurious brand.....you have rolls ! Buy something different which offers same or higher luxury I hope everyone will be hapoy
Nice
They copied Putin's Aurus/Kortezh 😝
Cars: exist   Manny: I’ll take your entire stock
Everytime Manny gets a new car, I myself feel happy LOL, such a likable guy, god bless him and wish him more success and more CARS
But this is just as big as the phantom 😑
trending damn
I bet those RR face masks cost like $500
Idk why I'm watching this I don't think I will ever have the opportunity to drive such expensive car
for those who thinks RR close their dealership for manny private tour. you are literally a moron. theres no customers during corona anyway so theres no difference
What's the point of buying this but driving it yourself?
How many cars does this guy buy ? xD
Mask + handshaking?    Wtf????
ATTENTION:  If you are a new ager, muslim, atheist, catholic, satanist, or anything other than Christian, I just want to warn you. You are in deception. You’ve been lied to by the devil that all religion leads to Heaven. Jesus is the only way to Heaven. He lived a perfectly sinless life we can’t live  ourselves because we’re infected with sin, thanks to Adam and Eve, and he died on the cross, shedding his pure blood that washes away our sins, and then he rose again on Easter. When you believe on Him alone to save you from hell, you will be saved and have eternal life. Don’t wait. This is your eternity we’re talking about. You can die any second and can’t go back to this life. Please! God doesn’t want anyone to go to hell. He wants all to turn away from sinful living and to surrender to him. God is with you. He’s listening. He’s waiting for you to talk to him. He is gracious and full of mercy.
I saw u on fastest car in Netflix
It's a car, nothing special , manufactured for short people
LOVE the front, phew
is your wife preferring the Ghost before a Cullinan? just asking, (btw awesome car)
nice
Manny you should make a project car like for example buying a car then tuning it out
#TRENDING
Exposed carbon fiber Rolls-Royce Ghost! 👌🏻
When you don’t want to find room for a massage chair so you buy a car that has then built in.
RR Dealer: This car has been redone except than the umbrella and spirit of ecstasy Manny: Get Out  RR Dealer: Actually gets out until Manny calls him back in the Showroom
When you’re so rich that Rolls Royce shuts down the dealership for you
Many. Turns on the car. "Yah we don't wanna die from carbon dioxide "😂 i love Manny so much. 😄
if i bought this i would have to live in it
The person reading this will be successful in life
I feel like this guy shits on people so hard with cars that people don't wanna give him a sub lol
This man  never heard of economical crises
Делайте с русским переводом!
Salesman is awful, sell the damn car earn your money !
That spec is absolutely magnificent! 💚💙
Мажор
The new ghost looks awesome!
BEST PART : I WILL HAVE TO BRING MY WIFE. COUPLE GOALS I TELL YOU.
Every car sales agent must have an instant boner whenever they see Manny Khoshbin walking into their dealership... Manny should start a freaking reality show on this... like "Who wants to win a car sale commission?... How far will you go?"
Manny: adding a RR ghost to his collection  Me: adding a T-shirt to my collection of 2  T-shirts
The worst salesman ever..
Wears a mask but still shakes hands tho :D
Nicest Chrysler 300 I ever seen
Mate you have got to buy one. In my humble opinion the best looking car RR have ever made. In white it is stunning. The open pore wood dash is sublime.
Review your rolls ghost
i wish i was rich like him😞😞
His shoes are probably worth as much as my car and the watch more than any house i’ll ever afford 🤣
When is the Bugatti kid car arriving
Am getting something like this 5years from now.😐
I need Rose rocy
Stradman needs that purple rolls Royce culinan in the back.
Hey help me lol
Missed the rolls Royce hand sanitizer
Just sent mine back,the dash was the wrong colour.
Manny: "The standard phantom VIII was too long" Also Manny: *owns the longest phantom VII in the world*
Cant get more exclusive than this
These are the only videos I don't skip a few seconds forward ... @Manny Khoshbin legend!
Does it feel good to just keep buying cars.  Manny time to sell ONE and help those less fortunate.   You seem like a cool dude, how do you sleep knowing kids and families are starving and living in their cars.  I appreciate your style my pops was a gear head and we had many classic cars.  I’m just saying that you could Really change some lives right now w your generosity.  (You could get the tax break). I’m sharing what food I have and giving rides to those who can’t even afford Uber.  We all have to do our part since our govt is failing us.  Thanks for listening   And know your soul will be enriched by sharing
They already have it in showrooms days after the reveal Typical of Rolls Royce
Love the video...it's funny that no matter how much money you have what wifey says Goes!! 😂💰
get yourself a wraith Manny
You all realize that this virus is b.s.?  They know it, y'all should know it.  Not trying to turn this into politics but why are people so stupid and trust their governments so much?
why don't you buy a Bentley Continental as a daily driver? that would be much sportier and cooler
how to flex your money
I don’t like the sales guy lol
What's difference between ghost and phantom? Both are luxury sedan for the rear passengers
Woe woe woe unto the inhabitants of the earth. A angel showed up not looking like a man. Please click on the picture in the icon and watch the video Bible prophecy is revealed from The Book of Revelations real Fallen Angel World War 3 come and see
Is krazy how many cars manny has and the background music is the perfect combination with the cámara work
Manny : fire it up  Manny : You don’t wana die from carbon monoxide
Is Manny so small, or this car is immense?
Rolls Royce sales people are like "How do we get him to buy this!?"
Me head palming after Many shakes hands wearing a mask.
Go for British Royal Green....
manny make a hermès edition ghost
*what the dis ma dream car*
Manny buying a rolls royce like its a toy Me : i should save up some money to buy that shoes..
Rolls royce were getting ugly on the front end. I feel with the new generations they are making the front end better again
Best automotive channel... 👍👍👍keep the good work up. 😎
The new RR Ghost is beautiful for your wife, but i think the RR Phantom or RR Cullinan will fit your personality more sir especially when you do your custom personalizing thing to it 🔥❤️
Are Rolls Royce not planning on making a Coupe and a Drophead for the Phantom 8?
I think it's 450 man hours to do just the leather interior I heard the other day.
Its good to have money people won't care about covid precautions
NEW S class is more Sleeker than this !
Manny looks like mark consuelos from riverdale
They still going on about the star light headliner...its as old as the hills now ..just a load of led in the roof..for the money they cost least u expect
Prefer the 2021 s class myself Rolls Royce is just a fancy bmw when you look closely
Extended wheel base but I thought he did not want a boat.
Front looks like Audi A7
Claim your “ here before a million views” ticket here
the rr people are soo nice
Are you a millionaire or a billionaire
Good choise the better bang for the buck compared to the phantom 🙌
I love your channel man!
You should check out the McLaren speedtail
This is like buying a Champion hoodie at a trendy store instead of buying it for half the price at Wal-Mart. Only thing you paid for was the emblems. Got you a fancy Chrysler there buddy.
Rolls royce:wanna see our 2021 rolls royce Me:but it's 2020 year
motivators evert
Why does this car looks like a Chinese knockoff version of a Rolls Royce?
That front end looks menacingly elegant, love the lines on the side
Very nice manny
We lost everything. Even our car. Thus Civid has messed our lives up  I wish I could have a car of even 10% the price of your collection
Manny why don’t you have any bentleys ?!
That’s a really nice 300.
You should get the new maybach like Mercedes
Manny needs to get on the joe Rogan podcast
Props to the cameraman/cutter. Nice car porn with nice music.
black beauti
Close up the Dealership!!!! 😂😂😂  Its not like Wal-Mart were people come in and go out every second. This is for the 1% and they like the Dealership to be closed when they come .
Can you buy me my first car please? It won’t even be 1/5 of the price of that one lol.
I totally love this new ghost 😍 I’ve been gushing over all its reviews !! I’d buy it in a heartbeat
Manny khoshbin : get out Dealership guy : yeah !  2:21
I though you were going with the Phantom
You should get an Aston Martin.
😅😅😅😅face mask but than shake hands 🤣😂
Phantom
That car ugly ion care what no one says it’s basic asf lookin
fogholade bod fogholade , mamnon misham agar hatman ba leila khanom baraye bazdid omadid dobare video recorde konid
1:30 when they first walked up to it, it's size blew me away!
It's way better than the old version
Headlights kinda look like a Lincoln Continental
One day my hard work will bring me there.
When RR introduced the 2021 Ghost Many was the first person came to mind, since he just tried the Phantom VIII, I was like this fits him way better.  Also I think RR did a very neat and spot on job with this news ghost.
You really should buy the cameraman a car
what about the next drophead?
Keep the mask on The coronavirus is very bad if you keep on taking that  mask off.....
*I think the Ghost is suitable for the  daily drive. The Phantom should only be used as a passenger... that's where you get to enjoy the luxury aspect of the vehicle.... anything else you'll look like the driver and people want to see who's in the back😁
Manny is such a cool person
Manny - casually buys a rolls Royce  Me - struggling to buy a sandwich
9:27 "Perfect to stash your...uh cigar, or something. :)"
try a mini little legs 555 😝🤪✨☘️☘️☘️
One of our finest exports 👍🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
A mask . And you give each other a hand🤣
How about the phantom is a little expensive
Rolls Royce guy: only the umbrella has not changed  Manny :  Get out !!   😂😂
you should prank your wife manny by saying you will go with her to check on a new car and then show her an old beat up nissan to see how she reacts 😂
I think I’m gonna be obsessed with this car for a week then never think about it again
4:25 at this time the dealer looks exactly like Stanley Tucci correct me if I'm wrong
RR is really trying to chase after Bentley with this, which makes me a bit sad, RR are supposed to be the ULTIMATE in class and luxury, leave the power, speed and ultimate opulence aspect to Bentley. you get a Bentley to flex, but you get a Rolls to savor and enjoy
Well Manny, i added recently a new pair of shoes, the rock 3 ones so.... great success 😂
oh no, did the RR salesman just used the word 'sporty'?, he should be fired. Quote James May on this one: anyone who works for Rolls Royce that has been caught using the word 'sporty' or 'handling', they would have been fired. 😂😂😂😂
Full Send on the Ghost. It is stunning!
When the title doesn’t have anything to do with the video.
*wears mask* *shakes hands* Corona: am I a joke to you?
He is so rich that he should honestly get a rolls Royce with the private suite.
It looks just like the last couple... haha
Really love your content keep up the great work!
youtube recomend me ur channel, and now i subs and keep watching ur video "great success" :)) note: i wish i could success and low like you <3
Phantom got too big over the years. It's a nice car to be so chauffeured around. But the Ghost... That's an amazing car both for the driver and the passenger. Get this Manny!
Nice car. Who needs a Phantom then?
My mom wants to start real estate any suggestions manny? Please respond
Buy it
Great success!
This salesman reminds me of like Jeff Goldblooms brother or something lolol
To listen to people u
Hermès Rolls Royce soon?
Whats the point in having like 5 rolls royces lol, why not get 5 different cars
Those sales people were horrible. No clue about the car.
He should try a bentley too..
I'm sorry, but it looks like a 2020 Lincoln Continental
I don't know why but I still don't like the interior of modern Rolls Royces
I jus noticed manny is close to 1mill
Beautiful green
This video called me broke in 8 languages
As Ive starting to watch it, I wonder how spoiled his kids are
Ugly car
🚗🥰😎😀
All the safety of the mask and then you shake hands with the  guy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
and i just sit here broke with my 1998 vw lupo watching this 😢
Make it marble
Future??  2021 look at media and interior wow so old  S class 2021 is the one to buy
I think give it a rest pretending you care about masks. Watching youtubers etc do the mask charade  is cringe and makes me click out.
6:04 kind of an oopsie, if you're selling such an expensive car, you should know all about it.
I swear every car he has is a daily car🤣
The best damn salesman in the world
I Like the white one from the last episode.
Manny, it's the best looking of the entire Rolls Royce family. Good choice!
A cullinan would be really coooool  Also that ghost is a good or beautiful choice  I agree to buy one   Tho it's not a convertible 😂but still good A cullinan tho would be sick   Also I heard vehicle vergins made a color changing starlight headliner :)
Very nice, looks like a solid purchase.
My collection: old Mercedes whit no brakes.
Don't know if you are aware but your videos showcasing your ability to drop +$300K for cars on daily basis are a bit much! How about a video tomorrow taking a walk through a poverty ripe neighborhood knocking on doors offering instant financial relief (legal anonymous gift amount allowed) I know I'm going to get blasted by your fans because you regularly donate to charities but this is different I never see ANY WEALTHY PEOPLE doing anything like that! Balls in your side of court bud...
CONGRATS MANNY!!!
This car is insane
Sales guys is trying to sell you so badly
Cool hyper-base.do.am
you really have no idea about cars, you don't really deserve them to be honest! you should go collect painting, leave the cars for the real passionate people
U literally buy a car everyday lol
We cant wait to help you spec your own!
The bmw group makes the best luxury Limos that rolls look so 🔥
No offence but if you are this rich why adding ads in your video? ☺️
Buy a car made out of pure gold
3:50 Mee too cant wait to see it just saw it on Instagram oh....wait nvm 😌
You know you’ve made it when a rolls Royce employee says “nice to see you *again*”
That spec is incredible, Manny. That subtle green with the black/white interior and the orange accent is so elegant.
The RR called him Twice and Closed the dealership just for him to take a look at the car🔥 I want to be that successful 💯🔥
0:35  The mask: aM i A jOkE tO yOu!
You should see Cullinan I think
10,000 man hours to produce the fascia? 10,000 man hours at my local garage would cost about 1.2 million
Love how both the RR guys dodged Manny's question about dimming the console rights 😂
What about a Dawn? Maybe with Aero Cowling?
6:19 GERMANY 🇩🇪🇩🇪 sehr gut
bro ik you have a lot of money but we don t like to watch you and flex like that... do something different please.
you know you’re rich when RR invites you to look at a new car and you don’t ask the price
i like the greenish tint the black color is giving from diffrent angles :/ looks cool
Not sure if he elaborated more behind the cameras, but the salesperson did not highlight the changes that much lol.
Those masks look very uncomfortable
Beautiful car no sunroof it’s the extended version I think as a daily driver don’t know if I’d want to go with the longer version for convenience one thing that bothers me about Rolls-Royce you spend all that money for the luxury and attention to detail which is totally worth it however it’s an English car there’s always a German trying to sell it I noticed even in their new ad for this car makes me feel like I’m buying a Mercedes or a BMW just my thought  attention to detail but I believe that’s what the car is all about and when they missed in their advertising campaigns The English accent is the elegance of the car
*manny Bro You Buy White Colour Rolls Royce Ghost*
Hey Sir Manny, why you have so many commercials in a short video like this? I enjoy every video of you, but this i way to much commercials. Stay Healthy, Take Care and keep going forward. Greetings from Germany
It’s like a baby phantom
Epic
What is the point of the Phantom now really when they extended the Ghost, even with a longer wheelbase?
Beautiful jewelry...
Greattttttt💎💎
The new Ghost is amazing!
I PREFER THE ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM SERIES 8.It has more road presence and displays dominance.  https://youtu.be/PCHrn4Yxv5Y
Manny you are close to a mil 🎉
Why don't you show us your car collection in the house
Get the new S class 😎👌🏻
Solid car manny great success
Looks like a Rolls Royce but Manny's version
Wears a mouthpiece when coming in but still shakes hands.. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Get a Dawn for daily
Thank god Rolls Royce exists. Perfection

Howwwww
They always beat their creation by building massive masterpiece of their own company cars
He is a very hard working man, he deserve it all... what a motivational man.... I wish one day I become successful like you did.... thank you so much for your great videos, dostet daram <3
dude buys more supercars in a year than I buy socks

" I need to call my wife " :D
The coupe version would be great
Who else feels like at the new iphone presentation? ...everything was changed, it just looks exactly the same...
And I have second thoughts on buying Robux
Either Manny a small dude or they built that thing for people like Shaq
So how much horsepower. lmao
0:38they shake hands
0:38
THE GUY FROM GOODWOOD, ENGLAND SOUNDED GERMANIC.. good job BMW
Man doesn’t want the other cod it feels to much like a boat. Not being funny but those things are land yachts
Sounds like a typical yes man Manny all they want is your money dude don't do it 😑
Why don't buy another convertible rolls?
Lets do roll Royce ghost Hermes edition ! Daily driven 1 of 1
My school works for rolls Royce
Many look at some lamborghinis lamborghini Centenario??

Holy God!!!   I Freaking love this Car😢😢😢😢  I love your videos 😂😍

6:10 , classic, another seller who have no idea what he's selling.
nice bmw
“Thanks for the facemask” *shakes hand*
Сделай на русском пожалуйста
I love the very classy color combo on the outside, that dark green and the black, but not sure if that works together with the bright interior.
I love that green but id have the hermes orange and black combo interior just stunning 👌🏻
Buy bently flying spour or rr culinan
Buy bently flying spour or rr culinan
I have a good Idea hire a driver for u just to make it more luxurious
The salesperson seemed so desperate to make the sale
the rolls royce manager: this is private tour HOW ABOUT THE CAMERAMAN AND THE GUY WALKING IN THE BACK
Very nice, now that’s luxury
Inside loks like a Mercedes e class
Manny... Gorgeous however you strike me as a dawn man. Hold out... it will be worth the wait.  Wishing everyone success who reads this comment too.
Buddy manny koshbin  can u gift me any 1 of ur buggati...u got so many..
That's very nice choice  And order the new 14 mill dollar Rolls-Royce
9:30 LEGENDDDD WAIT FOR IT ... ARYYY
Why does no one at rolls sells him a dawn
How is this guy a salesman at RR dealership.. he is literal shit LMAO... Nice car by the way
7:40 nooooooooooooo :( I expected: "ENOUGH"
Legit tot it was a phantom at first before reading the title
Enjoy the videos very much.  Manny is very kind to everyone, respectful, does not speak over others.  A role model for sure.
Manny I appreciate ur work God continue to bless u more and more...pls help my family, no money to further my education... Dis is my mail....Michaelknowleys@gmail.com
If the car is a ghost why can I see it ??
The PHANTOM is not a car you drive, it's a car to be driven in while you relax in the back.
I dont get it when they call a Rolls royce a new version!! This cars look the same like since 2004! Maybe when i own one i will be able to tell the difference!!
Guy on carwow says the new rolls is so quiet it makes you sick???
Wearing some cool custom masks   Just 3 seconds later goes for a casual handshake0:34
I knew it
Omg pop the Hood please
That Rolls Royce Sales guy speaks like David Blaine
Manny you must check out the new Aston Martin it's insane
when Manny truly can spend his riches in helping humanity all this is all bullshit.....utterly bullshit.....
I prefer the ghost to phantoms!!!
Omg I'm his 200 dislike :/
I guess the Rolls Royce seller is in financial trouble at this time of the Coronavirus, so they are targeting Manny to buy his car
The new s class killed this Ghost
Man u too rich what do u work as pls reply
when you are so rich that Rolls Royce is the least expensive car in your collection....lol..🤣😂🤣😂
The car literally looks like a RR from 10 years ago. The guy is a good salesman tho, a bit too pretentious for my taste.
Buy one!
Thats a great car  U should buy it manny!!
Manny: "wow" Salesperson: raised eyebrow, points, pause for effect, "correct"
Oh hi Manny
i can barely afford a 2016 bmw 5 series
that thing is dropdead gorgeous, thats why i love rolls royce
The man's dieing for a commission
Lol my dads mitsubishi outlander has adaptive cruise control
"needing my wife", classic, same here all the time, i dont make decissions without my wife, escpecially if its car related. You are the best Manny!
The door system should be licensed to mercedes...i fins a lot of owners flighting with the benz doors (retired folks)
Kheli ziba. Afarin!
Yes Manny get a 21 Ghost SO BALLER & SICK🤑😎👌🏻.
Finally a YouTube video where folks are wearing face masks for covid protection. It took Rolls Royce guys to do it. Come on Manny, use your mentorship influence to show folks what to do and wear a mask.
Now that’s a car 😍
Can Rolls-Royce have Hermès version🙈
Nothing about the illuminating grill? I thought that was a great feature congrats Manny
4:00 pm
The Color is eww
They did a great jon, making it special
Manny! If you’d ever like to own a piece of Australian history, I have a HSV MALOO for sale! Would certainly stand out from the crowd! 👌
Guys, it's so nice to be fucken rich!
When you just can't just save your money no matter how hard you  try
That thing looks like its gonna "ghost" ur lambo
that’s my second dream car
Seller : every single thing is redone on this vehicle. Manny: get out %
Manny's cameraman is living the best life
Road to 1M Manny.
Manny, You look tired.
They never showed u the lights in the grill
Manny if u go for then go mustered color interior or one black one beige . Not combination looks suzuki 🤔
I normally like your videos.. but as soon as the Ghost came onto the screen my finger spammed the like
Black seat looks horrible?
Looks funny why the interior is similar to my 740 Li and 530 d 🤔
Unfortunately the front end borrows too much from the Audi S8. It's a stunning design aesthetic but simply incompatible when applied to a superior luxury vehicle.
Roll Royce sell for BMW now all the car of Roll Royce BMW build it !
You can be the richest, most successful version of yourself ..... but the wife is ALWAYS the BOSS .... Agreed :)
But the Bentley continental GT . For a change 🤪
its good man but you should have got that phantom 8 that suits you a lot
Should have got the new Mercedes S-Class!!!!
Imagine suicide bomb attack in rr xD
Buy it
White looks much better... brings out   all the curves
“Perfect to stash little cigar or something... 🙄” Dealer definitely want to give manny a new RR
Previous headlights were awesome
A Phantom too big?! You disappoint me, Mannyboy.
It looks like it has a giant moustache in the bumper :D
If you think money can’t buy happiness, give them to me.
Editor / cameraman needs a raise
And it's 4 wheel drive and real wheel stear. If I has the money I would buy one
i always get motivated and inspired watching your vlogs.
Many you should get a Aston Martin Victor Damn Victor is new hyper car from Aston man Victor is fire
No waaay... Damn, hard flex
Beautiful car Manny sure you will come up with a colour combo!!
Why a ghost LWB? I would rather get a phantom
Wears a mask and shakes his hand 😂😂
Who cares 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Imagine a hermez rolls royce😂
Love the car, think you should get it in white.
can i borrow a dollar pls
do they always dress like that in the dealership
Sales executive: JUST 7" longer 🔥
This car is the perfect beauty of a Rolls....🙌🧡
i say buy the cullinian
oo i like it
This Dillian Kid pissed in his pants lmao
very nice
Why don’t you buy a Hypercar?
They *REALLY* want manny to buy a car😂😂
Camera person refused to show us the car
Who else remembers when manny wasn’t a proper You tuber, and was just a millionaire making car videos
He like I want it butttt my wife said no 😂😂
That purple Cullinan tho!
That rr salesman is so prepared for like every question...
Damm... The color is sweet
How much money do u have man
On road to 1M Great success ♥️♥️
I you dont have a driver please tell me let me be your chaufer
Why
9:28 we don’t want to die from carbon dioxide” haha 😂
Congratulations Manny good choice I love the Ghost it's such a special vehicle.
you should buy it
It’s not even out yet
Congratulations Manny on your new Ghost
No dedicated place to put the key fob?? Did the engineers miss something?
This sales person is disgusting I would not buy anything especially a car. Says blsht all the time
So cool going back to wifey for her nod of approval even though he doesn't need to.
Manny, why don't you buy the brand new mercedes s class? It is a spaceship
👍 showing off... there is ppl with no food
Please stop using this cringy trap music when you show cars. It makes me click off so many times.
Pre production car, which they clearly forgot to install the privacy glass. Who would want to be in the back of that and have everyone looking into them?  For the people who have got it all, price is no option. For the rest of us, we'll watch it on YouTube. 😅
I love your voice just as much as your face
Whay doesn’t manny buys a cullinan its smaller than the phantom and he can use it for getting driven in.
When he said get out...I would have been gone
I'll be happy  to see you donate to hungry people some of your money. Instead of showing off by buying all the fancy car in the world. May God bless you.
Hello Manny can you give me 1000$ I want to buy a bike for college
Manny is probably gonna want his Ghost in White!
The new Ghost is nice but honestly the new Bentley Flying Spur is just the king right now, spectacular car 👍👏
Мордашка этого ролса похожа на аурус
What about fake exhaust tips 🤦🏻‍♂️
Everyone has a boss.
Whoooo
“Get out” “Yeah”
I wish there was a mcLaren SUV who agrees
Me sitting here looking at cheap cars 😐
Yes the car is beautiful
This guy bought the jesko his son a Bugatti a Ford gt and now a rolls
I really miss the passion of this car salesman for this amazing car!
No Handshakes 😎
It still long like the other one.
They wear the mask but shake hands 😂😂
Can u buy me a  2009 Mazda
9:11 Manny redlining the Engine the whole time🤣
Again no sun-roof ;-)
I just love it take it it is very nice car
That green is amazing!
I would keep Dropheat....
Great success
manny and salesman: gets mask to stay safe from COVID also manny and the salesperson: shake hands, stay within 6 ft of each other, the guy from Goodwood pulls down mask to talk.
0:32 Takes mask on and then just shakes hands, nice xd
I love this thing, it is my dream to own something like this 🙏  And to whoever reading this, I believe you will get to be like Manny  Everybody Stay safe! ❤️🙏
If you are watching this video right now, it means you will never be able to afford one of these. So let's just get back to enjoying our middle class lifestyle 😅
Best salesman
i understood "definitely i will... run my wife over" xD
What are those gorgeous shoes that Manny is wearing?
Oh wow
Great success 👍
At this rate Manny will Have a dealership at his house
You should have  bought the cullinan btw  the car is lit
CÓ AI VN🇻🇳🇻🇳 K
Other YouTubers:   Review of 2021 RR Ghost Manny Khoshbin:   Adding 2021 RR Ghost to my collection
Cool
Rolls Royce's should make a custom hardtop convertible Wraith Hermes edition just for manny!! ohh man that would be sexy.
Gets a rolls Royce mask then proceeds to shake hands with the dealer...
kinda sad the salesman didn't say "thank you for having me"
Do a rolls royce ghost, hermés edition
Please adopt me
Those salesmen are so annoying!
You have to use a different sound effect for your “message” in the beginning or Apple will retaliate
“Takes costumers advice” *still has same 50 cent plastic windshield wiper stalk found in every Mini Cooper since 2003”
What if I told you Jay Z is God in the last Bible book (Revelation/Apocalypse) and that I was His Christ. Would you believe me? I have “Jesus” on my thigh and Revelation 19:16 says on His robe and thigh is a name written: KING OF KINGS LORD O’ LORDZz
I think a Bentley or an Aston Martin would look cool in your collection like a continental or a vantage
You should also take a look at the new Mercedes s-class
He still asks his wife ... Just saying
I knew you were gonna get it, I seen your comment on Rolls Royce's instagram when they showed It a few days ago
Sorry Manny but... i don't believe in ghosts
Why there is a teenager who works for RR?
All the RR in the world will not bring happiness.
Headlights and grill lool right out of a western star 5700 semi truck!!
Beautiful! But I don't like the back lights ,I think it's worth the price tho
I was still waiting for the Spirit of Ecstasy to be dropped down @3.40 and still ended up selling the car. Manny love your optimism
Only 563 horse power for such a big car they should bump it up to at least 700 horse power
What car where you reviewing? I couldn't see any
I think I would have loved to have seen more of the car and less of the people looking at it.
HAHAHHAHA MANNY IS SO RICH HE HAD THEM BRING OVER A GERMAN TO EXPLAIN SOME SHIT ON THE DASH! WOW ABSOLUTELY BANANAS.
I’m just chilling here thinking about if I should buy a Big Mac and manny just buys a car almost every video 😅
I can’t even afford to see that car in person
Many : Can you change the color of the dash?  RR dealer : i have no idea if you can change the color of the 10.000 man hour light in the dash , let’s ask our expert from Germany who knows all about this. German RR Guy : i have no idea
The Salesman is super
I prefer the Cullinan
Very nice !
Congrats Manny
Wow its a great love it ROLL ROYCE
Wow, love the rethinking of the spirit of ecstacy position. Respect for acknowledging the value of the wife's opinion.. Blessings on Blessings Bro
Did he say so my glasses won't F UP now? How professional.
I think you should order one convertible on white to keep going whit the daily car specs
Such a nice and humble guy. Met Manny in person and he was so gracious and cool. We need more guys like him in the world! 👍👍
Hey Sir Manny! If you have the time may you send me some Money for College! We students are having a hard time this pandemic! Love From PH🇵🇭
LoVe from India 🇮🇳
Wondering if you really need to add ads. Id rather watch your video without having to watch them.
looks like a chinese knock off
I think phantom is much better but this is ok too
I don’t know much of rolls Royce.
This RR salesman is soooo 80's
Living your dream!!!
woww
I think they should have made the lights strait but everything else is brilliant
white is the best color!!!!
Everyone doing the impressions on the Video. Manny : Gets the real thing!
Don't buy a long car it will be bad
You’re so close to 1 million subscribers
They know this is a RR advertisement 😭😭😭 rolls Royce milling
11:05 i think someone broke in
it looks much better in a darker color. they shouldn’t have used white as the launch color for the car
Get it in white
This man could sell snow to an eskimo. I like that in a car dealer
So practically hes driving a Chrysler 300
The only eror in that car is to not have a dedicated space for the key. That should be a must. I would insist on it. Otherwise perfect.
Great option Manny keep it up! Great success!
Nice Chrysler 300.. sorry that’s what it looks like in the thumbnail
EL CORONA* DONT SHAKE HANDS, WEAR MASK WHEN U R OUT SIDE MANNY: IMMA JUST IGNORE THE RULES AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Can You Give Me A Ride   I am A Die Hard RR  Fan With no RR with Me 🤭
I really wanted to see you open the hood
You should buy it
Manny: I’ll ask my wife for this Rolls.  My customers: I’ll ask my wife for this 10$ shirt.
We don't wanna die from carbon monoxide!
that is stunning !!!!!!
Should have get the new s class
You know u made it when they close the dealership just for u
When they start delivering 2021 Ghost  to costumer?
This Ghost makes a lot of sense for a daily driver for your wife and also yourself than a PHANTOM.. but still cool to have a big brother PHANTOM or get a Culinan since you only have one large family car Tesla
https://youtu.be/u7Nr0afHahw
0:34 stop it man you cant do that 😒
i love background music can you tell me from where do you get this much         intresting music
what an amazing video and car wowwwwwwwwwww Manny you killed it
Ayee the first time seeing someone with the same name as me
NEXT BUY A BIG BALLON IN FORM OF A GIANT 2021 ROLL ROYCE GHOST WOULD GRAB MORE ATTENTION!!AND COST MUCH CHEAPER!! AND FLY TO PARIS AND AFRICA AND ALL COUNTRIES AND BE VERY FAMOUS!!
I knew Manny had to ask the horsepower😂😂hypercar problems
He reminds me of the famous fashion designer on project runway. Timm gun
How do you get rich?
The BMW Brake Calipers lol
It is a gorgeous car manny
Take it
A big inspiration!
Congratulations 💗💗🤗🤗😋😋🎃🎃
This is probably the most positive YouTube channel in 2020. Thank you for sharing with us Manny!
5:20 😔
Ever roll Royce is big too me personally Bentley is a better daily driver
When the dealer was explaining everything has been changed on this car. Mr. Manny: GET OUT.
My Honda has a a back up camera
People who thought the car was not lunched  l l l
the salesman is pointing out all the things that will break in a few years and cost a fortune.
The salesman 👎 really like you are selling a rolls and you don't even have proper information about the car ... It sucks man.
The light up ghost plaque in the dash dims by turning the dimmer dial that is with the exterior light controls.
"We don't want to die from carbon monoxide!" >>> Buy electric car!
I love how this man is so wealthy and full of success he just causally buys a rolls Royce ghost like it’s nothing
This was in my recommendation can someone let me know who this guys is?
0:34.  S O C I A L   D I S T A N C I N G
I would be more interested in being driven in this than drive it. That back seat is super plush.
I was like 🤯🤯(ﾉ*0*)ﾉw(°ｏ°)w
is is absolutely gourgeous, but sadly i cant affors it.....and it makes ma sad
Rolls Royce Hermès edition when?
It’s so Persian of you lol
As long as it doesn't ghost you!
When talking about the car please let the camera man point at the car not at the people talking because we cannot see anything apart from Manny’s tshirt
Calling in reinforcements about the dash haha love it
You need to buy a yacht.
Well I guess it's safe to say that this dealer is getting a raise lol
I am sure this guy can sell me THE PEN !
Both are nice
That salesman was born to be a salesman.  Really superb at licking Manny's boots.  Reminds me of the salesman from Man in the High Castle.
Manny: “the new phantom feels like a boat” Also Manny: *drives a drophead boat*
When you thaank someone for a mask with a handshake
One thing that manny taught us. First you learn, then you earn🔥
ROLLS ROYCE that looks like Chineese replicas of Rolls Royce in China!)
Such a liar. You said the white one
That’s the one Manny. Never seen a more beautiful car
i would rather have a toyota!! piece of junk to me!
Chrysler copied Rolls Royce with Chrysler 300 model. Later rolls royces copied Chrysler 300.
Manny get rid of your extended wheel base and buy this one
Manny is so inspiring, think in business, think BIG!
Sir Manny can I work for you?
Manny,.time is up, the tribulation is at the doors, all these cars will.do nothing for your.soul, repent and believe the Gospel, turn to Jesus
The salesperson really did find out about him... The cigars and Hermes HAHAHA
Damn 12 miles. They really be letting the workers in that dealership test drive that thang huh
Rolls Royce need to go electric. No noise.
Imagine having dealerships such as rolls calling YOU when THEY get the new car in... what a life you live manny, hard work does pay off
I literally commented on a rr post
Manny should do a collaboration with Michael Blakey
Wht does this guy does for the living ..😆😆.......someone pls tell me ... ha ha ha lol
The masks are really pathetic.
The salesperson is great. He does an excellent, high value presentation.
This salesman is so good he's making me want to buy one even though Im broke.
Manny buying another car  Me thinking should I buy a different phone case to make it look cooler
Manny: Can you dim the stars? Salesman: well yes, but no
I predicted it guys! Look at RR official launch video for proof. I posted a comment the day the video got out
Let's have a mask on, then take the mask off.  Stop faking the "virus".  Just rock on like before. It's all political BS. Statistically proven.
I love when you speaking I only came for your sound
*I don't think the phantom and ghost will go very well in your garage. Your other cars will be scared.*
I bet the mask is worth more than my life
Clickbait, when you are the Persian Archie Hamilton. Legroom? Seems like he is 5’6” 🤣🤣🤣
The sales guy sounds like that Dr. Arthur Neuman from The Mask😂😂. Nice Car by the way
You know you are special when Rolls Royce closes the whole dealership just for you :)))
Dealer : the new ghost also comes with new shooting star feature  Manny : get out !  Dealer : leaves country 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nice choice Manny, though i think white would look cooler
Wow many really knows his rolls royces
Is it just me or the back of the car looks like the back of a mercedes?
Let me ride it
Hi I’m on fortnite you are just like you are you so much I love your friends I wanna was a great time and I’m so happy I wanna is my time for my dad and my brother in my school I love to see my friends I love to play and I’m so sorry to my dad I just got to my dad so I’m going home to my psn was your name so you wanna was a really rare day and you were so nice and
This mans simping for that Commisiion
This car is just nuts!!!
Manny: buys car Salesman: GREAT SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!
This car is actually insane, I know what to dream when I go to sleep tonight
Coming from car sales, I can say that this Jim seems very classy.  Perfect for the Rolls Royce Brand.  No sucking up to the client or camera, simple, to the point talk with the Rolls Royce Speak Talk.  I'd buy a car from him!
Sir I think a RR wraith Black badge is more suitable according to your taste in cars.
Wheres the umbrella, ela ela ela ey ey ey?
I like that manny not a clickbait
Es moda las musicas tan parecidas q ponen en muchos videos de coches?
Manny: Buys RR The salesman: Great success!    Your friends at Rev Media
You know your important when a roll Royce shop closed just for you
A 'Hermès' edition would be awesome
Get a Dawn or Wraith! Much cooler!!
محشره 🙏 ❤️
Manny is the only person I know who gets calls from rolls Royce offering him exclusive one off cars
And am here watching the video at 360p ;c
Oh snap! I think I just saw a ghost!
This salesman is noob
You should get a Hennessy Venom F5
Camera man needs to start showing the car and and what they are talking about and not who is talking
i gotta say i love the look of that new front end !!
That car is so noisy
❤️👏
This guy buys car like groceries! #legend
They better listen to the customer if they are spending 500k USD
Hi manny can i have some money pls?
Be so rich like Manny, Rolls Royce dealerships call you personally whenever there's a new model incoming...👌🏽💯
Who found Manny khoshbin randomly and started watching regularly 😇😁
Why don’t u buy a cullinan ?? U don’t have a 4*4 in ur garage ! 🥳🥳
I'd think manni wants a convertible..
Manny is so rich that they closed the dealership for him 💀
the purple cullian tho
Manny everything has changed expt umbrella and ecstacy ..GET OUT 😂😂
Can you buy my ps plus its only $10 🥴👉👈
That guy dont know how To sell a car
Thru already got his Hermes color key.  Lol.
Can we acknowledge Manny’s camera guy.... goddamn!
Manny take your Chiron to carmax to see what they offer
#Dawn
In the Rolls Royce engine bay, you can fit 2 2JZ’s in it😂🤦🏽‍♂️
My favorite thing about manny is that even though he is a super successful millionaire, he still takes the time to interact with his fans and followers. +Respect
I still think Cullinan would be the best daily drive for Manny.
My car also has a key holder, it’s called the glove box.
The interior looks excellent.  I'm not a 4 door car type of guy  but if I was, this would be one on my list
When he has a special rolls Royce mask and I had to make my own out of a t shirt and some rubber bands. The best part is that my mask ended up costing more.
Right on brother. Your channel was one of the few that actually kickstarted me to take action and start my own channel
I dnt think Manny is interested bcuz if he was he would b in his office looking at it ...
Very nicceee
I love the fact that Manny always work on little details and tries to wear matching accessories to the car ❤ Great Success 🔥
Puts a mask on but shakes a persons hand🤦🏻‍♂️
Looks like a super comfortable car 👍
*Manny Khosbin is legit the coolest and most amazing person on YouTube. Keep up the good work Sir!* 💗👍
If you come to successful peoples channels and ask for money you will never be successful lol, find a passion of yours and try to make it successful
You know you're rich when a Rolls is your daily driver 😎
A very nice facelift I say. They didn’t need to either for the new year
Always enjoy your video one of my favorite YouTube👍🏾👍🏾
Great Manny
AAAAAAND the salesman forgot to demonstrate how the Spirit of Ecstasy works. I was really hoping he'd pop the hood to show the inner workings of that new setup.
I may not be first but I am here
Hi
Imagine working at Rolls Royce and being so dumb that he removed the mask when he started talking. Dude mask helps to stop droplets and of course corona. I wish they had some common sense.
BORAT SAYS Very niceeeeeeee
Rolls-Royce paying Manny for this one!
YES!!! Life is too short and moeny won’t matter when you die so why not buy what you want and live the American dream!
Add a supra it’s a good car in my opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mIFaih6k3s
Manny makes expensive cars look like normal cars and makes it look like its easy to afford these lol
Are you trying to rub your wealth in peoples faces?
It's true that Manny gives hearts? Manny is the Man!
buy it
https://youtu.be/Y7KGVDc_oQ4
Bet that Rolls-Royce mask probably cost more than my vehicle. Lol
I think the manny should buy th ghost
Why not upload video in 2160p as before
Are you gonna get a Bugatti yatch 66 are gonna be made
Imagine watching this i can’t even afford a fries if i’m hungry😔
Social distancing gang
Rolls Royce ghost is my favourite car
"closed the dealership for you" ... * Bunch of people in the background *
the color combination of the interior is a killer
Is it just me or does that salesman and car make Manny look short 🤔
This is perfect
The sales guy “uhhhh ya it’s uhhhh very good ummmmm very thoughtful uhhh everything is great uhhhhhhh”  Man I could have presented this car better
i saw the white one looks nice, the emerald green make it even better
Green over tan leather... I would choose that combo Manny :)
"wow" "no way...." "whaaaat" "very cool!" "mhmmm" "yep sure very nice"
If you found the RR too big why not get a Bentley Mulsanne, Flying Spur or Continental? Is it that you find their values to depreciate more?
Hi! Manny💪💪💪
Does the self opening door have a sensor on it so it can stop if it’s about to hit a wall/other car? I could see that being a huge problem
i think manny should do a drift build
It fits you perfectly manny
looking forward to the 1 million subscribers celebration, i'm sure whatever you decide to do will be a great success!
U know he’s a real rich guy, not some fake youtube guru who’s faking their wealth to scam people
Buy the rolls royce SUV😅😅😅
Midget 😂
Manny says let’s not die from carbon monoxide more than let’s buy a new car
Yo why does his interior look like the inside of a boat when he said it’s like driving a boat
I like how they dont mention that old Ghost was based on 7 series BMW. New one is based totally on new RR platform, and it will not be shared with BMW. Thats the main point about new Ghost, its not 7 serie dressed as  RR. Its a proper RR now.
You should buy a dawn
7:20 bruh got the bong setup already damn
When are you getting the Bugatti Divo??
two click bait videos suggesting he's going to buy a rolls, neither video does he buy a rolls, it's clearly advertising.
9:22 perfect place to hide your Cigars😂this man knows Manny Khoshbin really well🙂
Emerald Green with red and black interior and starlight headliner
Manny: Hopefully you'll hook me up... Salesperson: We'll take care of you so you can hook me up with my comish! Cha-ching!! lol
hey what happened to your porsche 935?
Must obtain that vehicle
YOU HAVE TO GET THIS MANNY OMG🤩 it’s beautiful
So can one still get charged with an open container when enjoying the champagne in the back seat?
nice car
Yes that exact spec
👍💗💕💞💌
That green is absolutely gorgeous, I'd like 4 😅
my man imported a goodwood person just for manny, someone really wants to sell a car
It is truly hard to believe how much money you have, congratulations on everything
Hey manny i know your busy but please upload more لطفا
They just tryna make their sale haha they dont seem least bit into this lil showcasing
Im going to get a phantom but with one condition if i see plastic ur dead
They got a place for the alcohol but not for the weed
Everyone: *Ya know you've made it*
Get the Cullinan
Easiest best car collection in YouTube.
Get the cullinan manny
🙌🏽🙌🏽
Get the Phantom.
What a great salesperson. First class...
If you spent as much as you have on getting you're son a Bugatti you could have a cool wall of just model cars taking up all of the wall
Wait so its not an Hermes edition?
I think  u should add it
Perfect choice
Is it just me or the dealer ain’t that passionate by showing and selling that car 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
Binod
I can't wait for my next life to see if I go millionaire
Manny: That's a beautiful Ghost Ghost: Yes
Rose are red  Violets are blue I got clickbaited And so did you
Get it Manny 😂
Its almost morning here in east Africa, any time is always a great time to watch a Manny vlog
Your little like me You NEED  a driver
bmw needs to update the dash/screen/gauges already.
Those RR masks are siik  How about that this car has the illuminated grill and the fact that you can customize the dash!🔥🔥
that guy really wants his comission huh
GUYS I WAS 15 SECONDS IN THE VIDEO AND MANNY MESSAGED ME!!!😱😱😱😱
Exicted for the wraith and dawn the facelifted one
VERRY NICEEE!!!  BUT, id take off that orange pin stripe ,go see VIK @rdbla And do a blackout package! With a nice set of 24"/26"  Factory lookalike wheels or vossin lexani maybe , in satin black oh myyy !!!!
I think RR car dealer don't know that Manny had its own dream car showroom inside his house.
why when he asked the horspower of the car the seller didnt say "the enough". I am disappointed
Honestly .... I loved it more than the cullinan  Very impressed  Rolls Royce did a good job
Wassup
Why not wait for the Wraith Black Badge
I love the way he says “get out” straight to his face lmao
I like that emerald!
wow just think if they were looking or talking about something of importance instead of some ugly slow car.. tell me 'manny' why you pay so much for a company that "bankrupt"... for someone that claims to have money, i would hope they would make better decisions, i mean this guy doesn't even have 'class'
Amazing car. Well deserved sir. Love your channel! Great inspiration to my life!
MANNYYYY killin me ,hoping to hear back from you sir
What about the maybach
Manny is the first man in America to take on depreciation from the 2021 RR Ghost
Can I have a 1000 dollars please
Manny Khoshbin I love the interior, but I don’t like the front of the car. I can’t stand how they slanted the headlights back. I like the front end flat. They made it aerodynamic and sporty looking, but I don’t think it looks good. Also, the box around the headlights isn’t there, it only goes around the headlight halfway. I think it should go all of the way around.
Do dealerships just order a few safe specs to have on inventory? I imagine most people buying a Rolls new are ordering it personalized. I'd like to see some videos about how this stuff works, and the high end car buying experience. My Nissan dealership gave me a donut and a bottle of water when I was buying my truck, which is pretty much equal to Rolls Royce calling Manny in for a private showing.
Please do Hermes Rolls Royce
Thats a good salesperson
Me: Can’t afford a used Honda.  Manny: Wanna see my new Rolls Royce?
*Gta 6 leaked footage*
“Great Success”
We wanna see your wife’s reaction ! :))))
You do not drive a Rolls, you're driven in a Rolls Royce whereas a Bentley is a car you drive.
Almost at 1 mill
Watching this on my shattered galaxy s10e
I just added a 1998 civic hatch back to my collection so now I own a 2012 Norco Pedal bike & 98 civic as my ways of transportation 😃 my first car ever I was just as happy and proud as you are when you purchase these wonderful exotics
how about getting a rolls Royce cullinan?
Is this Leyla’s new ghost daily driver?
Manny, your RR Dealer is flexin' on The Stradman with the Purple Rolls in the left back corner!
Me:Cant have a loan in a toyota  Youtube:would you like to see manny's new rolls royce
It’s honestly how I wished the 2021 Mercedes looked, they went backwards
🙌🏼🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱
What sort of payment plan are you going to go with?
That car sells itself, but the salesman thinks he's selling the car.
Lowkey clickbaiting us
Manny it’s time to upgrade !!!
Manny is being wine and dined to death by RR
Can't smoke your cigars in there 😔
I’ve been noticing a lack of “very nice” and “great success” in manny’s videos lately
Everytime I watch Manny Videos, he always remind me that im....broke..
This guy is buying car after car !
Can't help but notice your drop-top is dangerously low on fuel there Manny..
2:30 the rear looks very VERY mercedes  I am not really a fan of RR, but this looks like a nice car
Hi
How about hooking me up with car b ! Working 2 jobs ... change my life
Hi
Went to sleep after a long day and my notification woke me up. Its fine I'll wake up its many with a new video.  Cool addition to you're collection By the way where is your porsche.
"eNtRy LevEL" my ass, this is the best rolls in my opinion
The rolls Royce ghost is nice but honestly the Infiniti q70l is almost as comfortable and drives just as good for 10% the price
Buy it same color that is you all the way Manny... Mrs Manny please let him buy it for you...
Sexy
I don’t like dealerships. But... if they were all like ultra-luxury dealers maybe I’d like them.
You should not touch and that’s what he gets a germ from one to the other and then if you touch your face you have the disease so do not shake you bump elbows that’s the new thing bumping elbows
can you show us how you clean cars?
Your dumb
The only thing I don’t like is that it is missing its sharp edges, its too smooth
Congratulations
People  Who disliked the video have jealous  But its okay
You literally can’t hate this guy
I will take it as it is with that spec. Black and dark green combination with orange stripe, white and black interior -- gorgeous.
You have to post more videos please you my fav youtuber at the moment your really inspiring and It would be the best day of my life to spend a day with you and have a joy ride in your mclaren p1 it’s my dream car but I am trying to save my money to invest I love your channel much love ❤️
This dude is a great seller. I see how nervous he is about this gorgeous car. Congrats Manny
Headrest like soccer balls 😂😂
Hey Manny, are you considering purchasing the 2021 Bentley Bentayga? And how do you pay when purchasing, cars pay full upfront or do you recommend financing is a better option?
if you gave me 1 million $ would  you even notice  it 😶
Manny you need the 2021 Mercedes Benz s600
hey random person reading the comments i hope you have an awesome day god bless you your millions are waiting for you keep up the hard work random person
this is the same car they used for the pictures on the website
Wow great salesman. Feel like he should be noted. 🙏
Beautiful vehicle. Congratulations. A well deserved treat.
that guy has exceptional hair
That's the first rolls royce I've ever seen that's aggressive
Not quite the Phantom... but the Ghost is the smarter choice lol
Thank you for thinking of people living in the east coast manny lol.
0:50 my glasses won’t fuck up now 😂😂😂
That is pretty
Manny I love the front of the car, it looks like angry.
Its a dramatically altered Ghost, with every panel redesigned entirely & a new interior, this is the Ghost it always should've been. It's a spellbinding conveyance.
Great success🧸
Manny absolutely loves it...buys a Chevvy Spark  🤣  🤣  🤣  🤣
Manny, what does it feel to drive a Rolls Royce?
Manny...I don't know if this was mentioned already, but I saw another video where I believe they said the dash can be customized just like in the Phantom. So you don't have to have "Ghost" on display; you can change it to your company logo or whatever else you desire. I also saw that there are "shooting stars" in the headliner. If you decide to get it, I'm sure will enjoy it IMMENSELY!
Great car to add to the collection😍
That's the one manny
9:37 “we don’t wanna die of carbon monoxide” 😂
sorry but that purple rolls is so much cleaner 😍
I feel poor lol
A private event? Are you kidding??? As if so many people will storm the RR dealership.........
is that the exact spec you will be getting or will you and your wife configure a new spec? it's very nice either way.
Why nobody has ever invited me to view the new Rolls Royce?
Love the ghost
I don’t need ask or show my wife the car to sell you the car.
Ah! You did it!  I thought you were going bag that white yacht
The seller is so boring doesnt seem to know much of the car .. Yawns I had better customer service at bestbuy .. All he says is uhh uhhh I dunno.. Smfh
For get the car, I want to employ this sales man....
The front is looking a bit like an Audi for some reason, but it's a nice car. Different color though Manny, it's beautiful 👌
You should buy a 2020 c8 corvette
lol love how dude enters room @ 6:20 with a mask on and then lowers it to speak less than 666 feet apart ^_^ derp.
My Idol
BEAUTIFUL CAR
Spend all that money on a rr and get a basic mask nit even n95 they should give u a full corona proof suit and mask .smfh
0:12 lol im using android
No one talked about the lighted grill.
hug to hug going to 1million subcribers goodluck and godbless sir manny ♥️♥️♥️
Manny walking into any car dealerships in LA Salesperson: We are closed to public just for you!
“Mommy car”😂🤣
Buy it, buy it, buy it
Still a huge car
Just because it’s private doesn’t mean you don’t have to wear your mask, you don’t know where that guy has been
The design is starting to grow on me with this color at first I thought it was kinda weird looking
That salesman definitely knows his audience. Great spec already as well
Looks similar to any other new sporty sedan... Older rolls royce had presence this feels too modern "soulless". Of course it's beautiful and luxurious, but i think bentley is doing better with their new models in terms of exterior design.
LETS GET MANNY TO 1MILLION
Manny, can you give me $500 I need to pay my rent.
I call BS on 10000 man hours on the facia.
Previous series is way better looking
*omg*
I think it looks ugly. If you look at the front directly it feels like a Chinese knock-off RR. The rear looks like a knock-off Bentley. And the car overall shape just looks...off. The interior, while I have no doubt about the material quality being top notch, the design is lackluster. Bentley's interior looks much more elegance and characterful imo.
Color 👎🏼
If you ever need more space to store your cars my garage is always available 😁
Very cool, not a fan of the Cullinan?
Manny is in the future
when the 2021 ghost has fucking idrive 6 for infotainment
You know they had their best guy flown out for this free promo 😂
Carbon Monoxide I believe can kill you , but the other bullshit doesn’t.
5:22  Eerrm 10,000 man hours is 1.14 years
Manny is a very nice man❤️
Lovely land yacht. Really like the orange accents, including that pin stripe. I like the Cullinan a little more, but I'm guessing it's quite a bit pricier?
I like it but a rolls wraith will be the dream
Just get the dawn
FERRIS BUELLERS DAY OFF SCHOOL TEACHER....BUELLER?BUELLER?? LMAO..ANYONE of 30 knows what i mean..
Seems like your just buying the brand and not the car
Puts mask on, shakes hands then touches his mask 🤦‍♂️
alex choi influenced the colored key fob
Manny buy a wraith
That is funny, let's put a mask on and then shake each other's hand, classic, Manny you are awesome oh, that's exactly what I do
I can’t wait to say the day that I added a car to my collection. I only have one for now, but I believe what manny said a few weeks back. “It’s all about how much effort you put in and how you finish.”
Sup manny congrats on the new car I was thinking maybe add a couple muscle cars too your collection like classical or maybe if you want modern muscle it’s your choice but I would love to see some muscle cars added to the car collection
Why do you drive your own rolls and not have a driver?
Because it is Manny, the salesman know this is really because the Phantom was too big, not a money thing 🤣
Brag much.?
Never showed us the spirit of ecstasy
Allow it
As a Christian,  I want to warn everyone who wants things for prideful reasons. Its called covetousness. God hates it. Like idolatry you place that thing on a precious place in your heart, a place where you should have God  reign.God wants to reign in us for we are His Temple. But we all have sinned   we all are lawless. We all need a Savior. JESUS CHRIST IS LORD GOD ALMIGHTY and died for you in the cross but was raised from the dead and is now seated at the right hand of the FATHER  In heaven. All AUTHOURITY has always been unto Him. Now we all need to search our hearts and repent, turn from our sin and confess our need of Him. Do you believe JESUS CHRIST is LORD GOD and confess he was raised from the dead? If you do, if you believe Jesus CHRIST IS YOUR SAVIOR now, you are saved by His grace through your faith in him from eternal separation in hell. Give Jesus Christ your life, surrender to him and live not forbthis world, but seek first JESUS CHRIST and his righteousness and he promises he will give you abundantly more than you can imagine or think.  HIS  Life is far greater than what having a rolls royce can give you.
I’m a car salesman and based on manny expression and previous video I notice right away he would rather prefer a convertible and not the extended wheel base.
Manny please buy new car
You should try to to get a aston martin vulcan on vanquish
You know you're a baller when you wearing a custom Rolls Royce mask.
Does anyone understand how phenomenal of an salesman he is???  A++
This man buying cars from Legendary motorsport lmao
Don't let your wife decide... Just go ahead and buy it for her...
do a 1million dollar giveaway to a homeless
Do not get it in that colour, the car is beautiful the interior is unbeaten but the colour just ain’t it chief
The fact that manny started off with nothing and what he is know. Anything is possible
Surely the Old drip head can get upgraded to a Dawn first
I'm a fan of Manny Khoshbin ❤️ from the Philippines  very simple and down to earth. God Bless to your Family
You have to give it to Manny. He notices every single detail of the car. That's very very rare about customers and even so called car fanatics. I was amazed to see how he was able to catch and observe the bonnet, head rest and the trunk lines going down. This guy does truly deserve such cars. Much more success to him.
Get out🤣🤣he said
Buy one Manny or what a out the Bentley?
You know you’ve made it when a Rolls-Royce dealership closes down for you to come look at a car!🙄. Manny you are my inspiration and plan on doing your mentorship program soon!
Manny: wears mask  Also Manny: straight up handshakes Salesman and contradicts the purpose of wearing a mask lol
I knew you wouldn’t like that giant tank you drove last week.
Beautiful car, I wonder sometimes, knowing they don't sell hundreds of vehicles a year, those sales people at Rolls Royce must do well..
Manny I know you love this......but I honestly think you would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't try out the new Bentley Flying Spur. Have you seen the interior on it? Next level.
this is my dream car its very rare i see them in real life but when i see one i always just tear up man its just not fair
idk man, flying spur is cooler i think but with options it scales up really quick
bro you are living a dream!
Salesman just talks out his *** Doesn't know anything about RR listening to him 🤦‍♂️
RR Dealer: This car has been redone except than the umbrella and spirit of ecstasy Manny: Get Out  RR Dealer: *Actually gets out until Manny calls him back in the Showroom*
That’s funny because the day before yesterday I just order it
Why not get a cullinan as it would add an suv to your garage and you will experience something different and is beautiful. New ghost is also stunning so you can’t go wrong tbh.
That car is beautiful. I want 3. Good for you Manny.
Hope to buy one, one day 😏🔥
Yeah 👍 the color is up to you
GREAT SUCCESS!!
I wish I can live like you
Good that you showed the rear for only a quick second, its ugly.
Salesman is a simp to Manny
Rolls-Royce should get a educated salesman. I would've aced that sales pitch at age 16! Who hired him?! PiCK ME!
When you’re so rich that Rolls Royce shuts down the dealership for you
9:45 leths intro
theres no way manny would like this comment and say "very nice"
Yo Dillion needs new hair lol
0:33 , Why were a mask if ur gonna shake his hands?
My man casually bought a rolls lmao
2021 😳 dam, i just love watching you because you drive my dream car. LOve you.💖
Get the Black Badge 😍
Are they going to do the black badge series again for the ghosts/ wraiths? If so I’d wait for one of them if you can’t order one already!
UGLY!!
0:48 he did not just say that
Road to 1 million subs
It's just too big for you :(
Why did you shake hands but wear the mask?
Petition for manny to buy a million dollar car for the million dollar special
I am a big fan of you content♥️ and you should buy this rolls Royce its lit♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍
This car is awesome, I think you have to add in your Collection.
WOW! Your subscriber's list has gone through the roof! Good job! I definitely think the Ghost is a good possibility for you but I would order it in silver with white interior! 👍😷👍
I really like to invite you to iran .after this rejime .their end is near we will take back our country .just imagine manny khoshbin in milad tower that will be epic 😍😍
0:46 so take these off.       By the way I got corona
that's what I said last video. This is a much better option for a daily driver.
🗣You should get a rolls Royce dawn that's total trash
Manny would u ever think of getting a hellcat ???
I love how you are acknowledging everyone . Handshaking the young gentleman.You Are humble and powerfull. My idol.
Smart, the hypercars for Manny, bring the wife in for the luxury. Happy wife happy life.
Very niiiiice ;)
when *Rolls Royce* calls *you* that's when you know you have made it
<--- I see Bugatti Boat in your future Manny... The Aston Martin boat is amazing also.... Cheers, Blessings!!
When you don’t want to find room for a massage chair so you buy a car that has then built in.
Imagine how much that mask is lol
More depreciating trinkets.
That model doesn't need a salesman; the car should speak for itself.
“I didn’t like how big the last car was, so RR called me back to check out the new Ghost!” Gets to dealership *shows him an even bigger car*. Like wtf RR lmfao
Him gets a new rolls  Me get a new bike
YOU Are Sick bro😍😍😍
good luck bro. you deserve it.
Manny: wear your masks!   Also manny: BIG MANLY HANDSHAKE
10:28. “Holy moly, it’s like a soccer ball ⚽️” 😂
From some angles it looks like an Audi A8. Not bad, but not great either.
How much for the p1 manny
Bet. I can't even afford that rolls Royce mask 😂
TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸
Manny could buy it then and there but had to go back and bring his wife. Very nicee
The car is so freaking cool
can you pay for my community college bill
5:25 - the car starts at $332k. The dash lights has 10,000 mans hours in it. 10k x (for the sake of argument $15 a hour but rolls Royce wouldn’t hire such cheap labor right?) = $150k. No way it’s 10,000 man hours.
You maybe buy a Cullian that gonna be good 👌
I realy like the new ghost👍👍
Nice nice manny
Maybe maybach?😉
What is that song called when you were showing the inside of the car? I really want to know lol
Insanity!!!!!!
Im a sucker for emerald green, imagine that colour on an amg black series
Where is your 935
Please Get One they are so cool . It would be so nice to have in your collection!!🥳🥳
Its a yes from me
The purple cullinan in the background 😮
Love the growth of the channel 🔥🔥
love your vids manny
I dm you on Instagram and its important can you please read it asap my username is @shemmy202
The wraith is like a tug boat but the ghost is like a water limo
Hmm, not bad, but I think the front lights look dated.
We will need a follow up video.
The car is awesome I'm glad you got it
I cant even afford this guys' gas...
Congrats man great success!
Needs wider wheels, wheels sit way too far in the wheel well currently
Great success 👍🏻
a little more modern, a little more sporty.... a little more bentley
Always positive always inspirational!!
Keep up the good work you are Such an inspiration im stil broke and drive a opel corsa 2002 but u make me feel proud for the hard work🙏❤️
Get it already dude, this thing is so fine!!!
To him adding a luxury car someone can’t even buy for a day looks normal to him... lol jk
i though the wife was only the boss on normal families, guess i was wrong
Now rolls Royce make sound! so cool...
Buy it but only 1 of 1 Rolls Royce Ghost
good choice for you!  fits you well...it's their #1 selling model in RR history.
Let’s get manny to 1 million before 2020 is over
MANNNY GET ITT
....it's always up to the wife. Happy wife, happy life. :-)
I’m looking to get a Super size at McDonalds... me and Manny are NOT THE SAME 😞😞🔥🔥
😮😮😮😮congrats😁
I love how he's rich asf but still so down to earth 👁️👁️👁️👄👁️👁️👁️
get out 😅👌🏻🤣
Beautiful
Wow Manny, It's surprising that you are wearing a mask.
llol the rolls dealer has no one buying at these times, manny is like a savior
Got the masks but shakes the hands hahahaha u gotta love it
we want to see a Hermès Rolls Royce 😳
0:40. “This is going to be a private event for yourself”    *Has a professional cameraman recording everything for YouTube”
I imagine that mask would sell on ebay for about $150
Why does he need his wife to give him the go on buying a car?
2:21
manny have you considered getting a wraith or not because you cant be driven around? thanks
The ghost looks and sounds cool
Moin Moin!
Nice congratulations Manny 👏
hey Manny if you ever feel like you have too much money, i'd gladly take some off your hands  the ghost is amazing btw, congrats!
Wow, Rolls Royce is definitely designed for perfection!
Ive never read any comment about the camera work... its just smooth and engaging!
What a great salesman too! The type of guy you WANT to buy a car from! knows every single detail about what he is selling!
Good content Manny!
If this doesn't inspire you what else. ❤
3:41 but when is "later" :(
Love you Manny❤, my daily dose of inspiration!
You know you've made it when RR sends you face masks and closes the entire dealership just to give you a private tour... You're the man Manny!
Needs some chicken wire 90's 🐔
HOLY MOLY!
Absolutely love this. Keep doing you Manny. We will support you no matter what
I saw the RR on your story and i knew this guy had a new daily driver
A couple of months holy
I can buy 20 expensive Rolls Royce luxury scars if I want to but I don’t have the money Jajajajajajaja
Can i have the old rolls
Wears custom rolls Royce masks, walks in and gives the employee a handshake smh
This man really wants to sell a car
Rolls royce also added a shooting star feature while the starlight is on and i think its super nice to have that on the new ghost
I really thought u were not even going to consider buying the car 😂
Ill take the purple cullinan
Manny can you please give us update on your hair transplant I'm thinking about getting one and I would like to see how yours comes out
Finally 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
great video man , amazing content,keep it up don't stop      btw trying to get to 100 subs thank you all
10 thousand man hours? On a dash. Cmon man
CONGRATULATIONS! Great SUCCESS!
Beautiful!
Where do the Pistachios go?
You know your a baller when you are wearing a rolls Royce face mask.
👀👀👀
As soon as i saw the 250k price tag on the new ghost i knew manny would want it 😂

BEATFUIEL

Early manny like my comment  Great success
I'm convinced this young man is a billionaire. Can you adopt me please my dad sucks
Amazing Manny your a great person!
I felt so poor watching this
MANNY!!!
OO I Wish The Phantom Was Not Soo Big Cuz Everything Is Perfect But it too long and i rlly like the ghost and manny just a suggestion can u make more irl vlogs/family videos with ur kids and like u surprise them with ur new purchases and there reaction. Love to see it on the channel
He buys cars like toilet paper😂💰
That transition @1:00 was too clean, congrats manny !
How many people get a private showing WoW
Its not white though?
Hi
i didnt thought he would actually buy it
If my family was rich and I could get an expensive car, as soon as I'm old enough to get my driver's license, I would not get a Lambo or a Ferrari like all the other normies but I would get instead a Rolls or a Bentley.
One day im gonna be like you manny😛
Dream car
rolls roys camry
got a notification in class that you have upload halfway through the video my teacher caught me watching haha
WAIT FOR THE BLACK BADGE EDITION

Nice colour car
Remove the hat. Let us see the progress of the hair transplant. Head full of hair coming soon. 👍💯✌🤲
hi man you are soo good eheheheh
You need a Wraith....doesn't look like you're a driver
What’s the damage with one of these?
I’m the only one that likes the older ghost model? I mean the front
Seems its very hard for someone with an thick american accent to sound sophisticated enough for being an Rolls Royce representative.
Jeez I can’t even find a truck to drive. #PoorLife
Manny's wearing a mask.  Majority of Americans -> "THAT DOESN'T HELP"
Manny: "wow" Salesperson: raised eyebrow, points, pause for effect, "correct"
And the point in wearing the mask for 3 seconds is?
Thanks for sharing
What about a Gallardo I love the look of them because it just brings back simple vibes not so fancy and just looks soooo gooodddd!!!  TLDR: You should get a Gallardo
amazing rolls
If I was Manny for a day I would rent out a track and just go crazy with his cars. Video Idea Manny !?!
love the spec👌🏽
Ohh Lord won’t you buy be a Rolls Royce Ghost 🙏

Puts on the mask...Then shakes his hand...No fear of Covid-19 here no...What's the point of even wearing one if you slide it down to talk?
