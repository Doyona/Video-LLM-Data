🙏 A huge thanks for all the kind words guys! As much as I love Sendai, unfortunately it's one of the most seismically active regions in Japan. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't on edge still a day later, given it was such a shocking and intense earthquake. Most earthquakes start as a faint rumble and then get worse and worse. This one felt like a bomb had gone off a few floors below and catapulted the entire floor upwards in a very sudden and unpleasant manner. Since then we've had quite a few aftershocks, such as the one recorded at the end of the video. But I think above all it's important to be grateful that despite the huge earthquake casualties were pretty low and damage fairly minimal, with power and water outages fixed incredibly fast. It's a testament to Japan's astonishing engineering and emergency services.  As for me, it's time to get back to work scrubbing up the studio! ⭐ For more updates I recommend following Abroad in Japan on Twitter.  (Youtube isn't great for posting minute-by-minute updates). ⭐ https://twitter.com/AbroadInJapan
That 1995 earthquake was the one I lived through as a Canadian in Japan at the time.
My dad was in his house in Tokyo and then it was shaking like crazy everywhere and everything fell down
I’m glad you were safe
if you have a ramen shop, why do you have a studio of a ramen shop?
This reminds me of that scene in Shogun where Mariko says "This is why we make our homes so they can go up just as fast as they come down."
When I saw that cat my heart broke..I thought you really filmed in a little Ramen shop, not in a studio set
Most of us knows it's not an aftershock, it's the mane earthquake.
Hey Chris. As long as you guys are ok, that’s all that matters. Items can be fixed/replaced, as much of a fuckin’ expense and annoyance it may be. Take care! 👍
Not even 2 years later another M7.5 earthquake strikes Japan...
You can hear the emotion building up in your voice. God bless you, poor lad. It could of been much worse mate. x
Glad to know you are safe! Gluck with the clean up! Could have been worse but appreciate your genuine thoughts on your experience
Well, Ishikawa had a big earthquake on January 1st. 😢
this didnt age well :(
So sorry!  Glad you are all ok. ❤❤
Japan's recent earthquake brought me here. Praying for everyone in Japan.
"Worst Earthquake in 10 years" 2024 felt like it had to one-up it's little brother from the get go I guess :(
Just re-watched this video cuz YouTube recommended it to me again.  And I gotta say I’m happy to live in a country that doesn’t get earthquakes at all, (or otherwise I would be fucked because 90% of my stuff is stored on wall shelves lol)
???? I'm quite confused. In the aftermath of an earthquake....you all are in a building, WALKING AROUND IN YOUR SOCKS.....were there is water and GLASS ALL OVER THE FLOORS????
It’s because of all the tectonic plates near Japan. You need to move to a country that doesn’t have any. I’m sure if they realized it thousands of years ago it would still be uninhabited today.  I refuse to live anywhere that there is any type of natural disaster can possibly occur under any circumstances 🤣 But seriously. Hope it wasn’t all that bad. Love you guys
Pretty sure the 2nd clip is Joeys house
Wow, you have the WORST luck ever. Two earthquakes in (probably) one day. Well hopefully that next one won't be as strong.
The [cc] writes "Oh god, oh god!" each time you say "Oh fuqk, oh fuqk!" ... what a stupid filter ... 😂😂😂
That cat looks sad... 😿
For those who come to Japan, let me explain how to respond to earthquakes, which Japanese people have been taught since elementary school.  When an earthquake strikes in Japan, there are almost no cases of buildings collapsing. Conversely, if you go outside, wires and other debris will fall from above, so it's safer not to go outside.  First of all, if you are using fire, put it out quickly, and then protect your head by hiding your head under the table in case the furniture falls over in the house. Fire and head injuries reduce post-earthquake survival. Once the tremors have stopped completely, please check on TV or the Internet whether there is a possibility of a secondary disaster such as a tsunami or a landslide. If an evacuation order has been issued for your current location, immediately evacuate to the designated evacuation site.  Panic is dangerous. Do not make loud noises and act calmly, as it may make not only you but also the people around you uneasy and cause a mass panic.  However, secondary disasters such as tsunamis and landslides require more attention than earthquakes
YOU COULD NOT PAY ME ENOUGH TO LIVE IN JAPAN. WHAT A TOTAL SHITHOLE.
Comment 😮😮😮😮😮😮
でもこれで家が崩れないてやっぱ日本の建物すごいな
We're just glad you all are okay! Things will eventually get replaced, people won't ever be. : )
日本はこれで地震は終わりって訳じゃないから怖いんだよね。 大きな地震では、まだ南海トラフ地震と首都直下型地震が起こる。
I’m glad that ur okay and I’m glad that it didn’t hit my home city Toyama takaoka city
最近日本各地で5以上えぐいて
I have been binge watching your videos, i am crying so hard now, i dont watch Travel and living guides and videos on youtube except (begin japanology) but your style of presenting is what made me stick around and  to learn about Japan, i know this video is old but my heart goes to you and everyone ❤ I love you so much Mr A. Broad  I wish you speed recovery
What about the 9.0?
Heard from a Californian that museum putty helps keep knick knacks in place during earthquakes.
Chris I’m so sorry
Finds Trash Taste picture, puts it on the shelf: "Everything is better now." Fucking hell, I laughed out loud xd
Thank God 🙏 you and your family and friends are safe, lucky the whole building didn't collapse, but thank God 🙏 you didn't have to much damage's in the studio other than the water 💦 liking all over.
Studio still looks really good even after it's wrecked.
Well, your set now has more character. Looking on the bright side, that is.
just seeing this - hope all are safe and okay from that time.  where I live we survive hurricanes and losing personal and family possessions is always upsetting, but staying safe is always the real goal.  best wishes and appreciate family and friends more after an event like this my friends
bruh watched that trash podcast and they were all like 'oh this cartoon figure is way too fragile and valuable, I don't know what I would do for it in an earthquake' and they are all zoomers.   water damage is reasonably unforeseen, delicate stuff on shelves in japan? nope.
As someone who was there at the 2011 one, it is both terrifying and amazing to experience the absurd earthquakes. I only say amazing because Japan tanks those fuckers like crazy
This video brings tears to my eyes, may this never happens again. 😢 Prayers from Australia.
I never felt really strong earthquakes growing up just weak ones down on Puerto Rico. By the time the big one happened there, a 6.5M one, I was already living in the states.
You should mend the neko using the japanese "gold repair" method. That would be awesome!
0:10 What is that flash of light? EDIT: Ok, found some information about it. Apparently just called "earthquake lights". Happen before, after or during an earthquake. It's believed by a NASA sientist that they are electrical discharges from minerals in the ground shooting up into the sky. They are reported in like that 0.5% of all earthquakes. I guess only the higher magnitude ones.
Coming in late, but I'm personally surprised the mirror was unfazed... Hope all is well and keep making great content.
I know this is 5 months away but I hope you kept the cat pieces and did kitsunigi on it where you repair it with gold. I hope you're doing much better now and I'm glad you're safe.
I get that Japan is cool, fascinating, beautiful etc., but this country is in my top 3 places where I never want to live. High cost of living, small or even tiny apartments that are pretty expensive, lots of weird bureaucracy, rules and hurdles especially for gaijins and above all natural disasters like typhoons and earthquakes that are sure thing once a few years. I've read somewhere that it's a matter of time when Japan will be hit by a disastreus earthquake similar to the one that happened aprox. 100 yeas ago when hundreds of thousands died and many more lost everything. I'm fascinated by this country and its culture but I don't understand people who want to move there. It's a great place to visit when you're on vacation but nothing more.
地震が怖いいですか?
Where is his studio in Japan???  Closer to the epicenter?? I live in Tokyo and I barely remember this earthquake and not a single thing fell over in my apartment and all the convenient stores were stocked just fine.
The most important thing is you're alright, and the building is stay intact. I know all those things is made in Japan, but still.
the worst part is it happened late at night
Wow! Scary! Glad you're all safe!
That’s crazy. Wonder what my time will be like in Japan for four months
Thank god that you guys are safe and there wasn’t another tsunami
Not too bad actually but that cant be good to see all your personal things broken and on the floor.
I was here for the 2011 one, and it was life changing…and I was in Chiba at the time.
Scary
3:10 Anime idea: *Jishin Neko* (Earthquake cat)  The story of how a cat acquired its injuries (and 'powers') through an earthquake or two.  And the escapades it gets up to as a result over the forthcoming years.
Any update video
0:01   -   0:09 Bro i could make a song with that sound
There is a reason why I don't live in that area of Japan and would never want to...The closest I lived was in Nagano pref. (on Niigata border) and I've already had enough getting the small earthquakes all the time, which was such a shock after moving there from Okinawa where I got like 2 earthquakes (but Okinawa gets typhoons every other week so lol). After that I relocated to Kyoto and basically forgot, that earthquakes exist.
Wow glad you guys are okay, and thankful for the retrofitting of 1995 🙏
When you're British & the earthquake destroys every tea cup.
That's bloody scary 😳!!!
feel like you are exagerating. Most of your stuff seems still ok, except porcelain stuff
What the hell was that white flash in the distance.
When we were in Tokyo many years ago, there was an earthquake while we were in the hotel lobby. Us and the Japanese were the only people who didn't panic – being from Wellington in NZ we get used to them. It wasn't  much of a shake really, but to those not used to it......
🥺. So sad
そう言うけど2011年の地震の方がこれより100倍ぐらい強かった。その時の方がもっと怖かった、僕泣いた。
And thank god your ok did you know that in January 17 in 1995 a biggest earthquake in Kobe 5500 were killed at the time of the earthquake the place got completely destroyed and damaged including Osaka was a little bit damaged but for the last time I am so  Glad that your safe also late in between Fukushima and shrasi sao stations a bullet train derailment after the manicure 7.4 earthquake
The heaviest I felt was in Portugal a few years ago, a 6.4 one 😜 I wasn’t that much scared, I was amazed at the force… and… the motorcycle underneath us 🧐😳🙀
💔💔
sad
I'm my country you would have found a pile of rubble instead of the building.
I don’t mean it in a rude way but now seeing how big your full studio is I don’t understand why you pay for apartment lol I would just live in the studio.
Man… I’ve never experienced an earthquake in my life ( it’s almost impossible for earthquakes to occur in my region ) and I hope I never will, because this definitely doesn’t seem like a something I’d ever like to experience
I think you learned a lesson. there is a reason why Japanese Home Centres sell a bunch of earthquake stuff. Notice how chilled Natsuke seemed to be? I came to Japan in 2001. My first experience of a noticable quake was a 3.5 after about 3 months that woke me from my sleep and scared the shit out of me, then I kinda thought I got used to it. then 3/11 hit. (I went up as a volunteer 3 times just after and it was like a Hollwood disaster movie) I have faced many dangerous and scary things in my life but I have never been more scared when that hit! Nothing compares with the feeling of helplessness during a natural disaster. There is nothing you can do! and the aftershocks just ramp up your fear. god vid mate,
0:09 what the heck is that light ?
This is why I'm afraid to hang anything up in Japan
I think in my whole life I've so far probably experienced like 3 Eyebrow raising Earthquakes? 🤨 Anything of that magnitude would leave me in an agonizing pain of destruction as pretty much everything I cheer would be prone to not surviving it like my wall mounted 77" TV, the 4 screens of my Work PC situated on a glass table, my Collection of now rare and thus hard to replace Tamiya 1/16 scale RC Tanks in a free-standing glass Vitrine... Yeaa... I'd probably have to run for those to rescue them while sacrificing he rest to the Insurance Gods 🤔
I totally understand mate having been through three big ones myself
I'm sorry this happened, glad it wasn't worse. Looking at the broken items makes me sad, it would have been cool if you saved some items, and then you put them back together with gold :) Maybe take it to a shop that does that and share it as a video. Kintsugi ("golden joinery"), also known as Kintsukuroi ("golden repair"), is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum, a method similar to the maki-e technique
I'm glad you and your friends made it through ok.
Oh man sorry, That sucks...I hope you can get it all back together. The set was super cool!!!
Oh man that’s so sad.. much love to you and the crew brother, I‘m glad you’re all alright.
This made my eyes water up, Can't imagine how chris must feel :(
イギリスYouTubeや国民には、日本のJR が有名だと思います。福島県や宮城県などは、地震がよく発生します。JRの新入社員は、福島県の白河で若い新入社員は、鉄道や新幹線の技術を習得します。なので福島は原発というイメージを払拭してください。イギリスと日本の鉄道は友好です。福島で勉学した方々がイギリスの鉄道に役立つことを理解してください。
holy shit im so sorry about your studio
I hope you're ok broad
THANK YOU BROAD
Hopefully you can fix some things easily with super glue. Seeing you truly upset is hard. You're a very stoic person.
kinsugi that cat!
I don't wanna say it but water flooding the streets is a nice little touch to his set
I think it's kinda classless to be walking around vlogging in the aftermath of an earthquake tbh
TOO MUCH EARTHQUAKE!
That little scene at 0:05, kinda broke my heart then i saw the floor of the ramen shop. :(
This year!?  OMG I live in Japan (Kanagawa prefecture) but this earthquake didn't became big news at all.  We just thought "another one again."  I guess we, Japaense people, are geting used to shaking earth little too much. (LOL) Anyway nice to see you doing OK. 😉👍🌟
is no1 gonna talk about how the one bottle of myers rum was still standing on the desk :> Seeing this 3 month after release hope you got it all fixed <3
It’s that giant monster from Godzilla
I'm amazed that mirror was still standing!
Scary
I can actually feel the sadness in this video and it kinda makes me want to cry. I’m just glad you are all okay but that sounded like a very scary earthquake and I’m sorry this happened sending lots of hugs
I didn't realize that the day the earthquake in question happened was the day I got my job offer to move out there. I'm excited, but also very aware of the destruction that earthquakes can cause on an island nation like Japan. I appreciate you taking the time to document the really great things about the country, while still highlighting the things that may turn people away from the idea of living there.
So sorry this happened chris. Is there not insurance to help with things like this in japan?
I live in California so I know what it is like to go through a 7.0 earthquake.   We were lucky the Lander's Earthquake 1992 was far enough away in the desert.  Though, in hind sight, getting out of bed to wrap my arms around the color TV I found in the trash wasn't the safest thing to do when your house is violently shaking.
Thanks!
sad
1:40 1:45 Demonetized

I think that most important thing is that You are safe, of course it's sad what happened to Studio. But still, health is important.
In CA it’s just earthquakes, but they can get pretty bad.
That is one thing outside of tsunami that am not too fond of about Japan lol
Just came back to visit the channel and I'm surprised I didn't see this on the news at all.
What was that lighting  at 10seconds in the video in the background in the horizon at 10 o'clock looked like a laser beam from the sky that Earthquake looked like something out of a movie.
Why is the video called. 'My apartment?'
Natsuki is such an amazing friend I hope his shop is ok
wow thats bad, also water is definaltly bad for electronics
Hi Chris, thanks for the update on the Earthquake.  Glad you and your friends are safe. Cheers...
I could not live in Japan. For real.
Living in Anchorage Alaska for nigh on five decades I've watched a large extremely heavy metal military safe break thru two walls, I was riding this one out in a heavy steel chair because I couldn't show fear in front of the troops and I really don't believe I could have if I tried.  Been there on multiple occasions.
Not fair I slept through that one....
Looked like a nuclear bomb striking in the background 🤔 No one going to mention this except me?
Playback speed 2x- holy shit!!!!
At least the mirror didn't break.
Hope u doing better
Oh no… Sorry about that Chris… Will the Ramen Shop be back? {More Importantly, Are you ok?}
😟😟😢😢😢
I would think the aftershocks have sort of a post trauma effect.  The anxiety of "is the aftershock going to be worse?"
Okay so Chris....it's been approx 20yrs since Esther's bday in Singapore. Don't u think this earthquake creates an ideal time to move to Canada? #The rain check
Best of wishes for Japan and you as well stay safe.
i really liked watching your videos cuz i thought u were some poor english guy who just was a teacher and then i see your studio and it doesn't look like your poor at all . glad ur not dead but u can afford it looks like and btw i know my grammer isnt right hah
dam.you.rly.did.become.a.degenerate.with.trath.taste...
CHRIS.JUST.COMPARED.HIMSELF.TO.CINDARELLA....SUUUUUUUCH.A.TENDER.PICE.OF.SHIT.XDDDDDD.
Kintsugi for the cat!!
Anywhere we can donate for the restoration of the studio?
holy shit, you have the nicest work studio ever
*Things Japanese Youtubers mentions about the pros and cons of living in Japan*  Pros: Exciting High Tech Japanese Culture Etc. etc.  Cons: [nary a mention of earthquakes]  Japan does have stronger buildings to withstand earthquakes, even before the big one at Kobe. Only thing is, at Kobe there a lot of traditional Japanese houses, light material with super heavy roofs. Those all became death traps for the residents.  Glad to see the building your studio is in, was built according to modern day Japanese standards.
You could repair the cat with the kitsugi technique - the art of repairing broken pottery with gold. It would be verry beautiful and still be a piece of history.
how terrifying omg. i’m glad you’re all right 😭
I’ve had my fair share of earthquakes in Central America where whole houses are swallow by the earth in an instant. Truly terrifying. I feel for you and I’m glad you’re ok
2:48 hes looks like a detective
Thank god Natsuki is okay
Dam that rely sucks but can always be worse. You and the crew are safe to make more content so thats good.
So glad you're okay! Wow what a mess. 🤯
I would if a company makes a electric portable water vacuum that you can charge with an outlet or usb
Sorry for your trouble. It must be so unsettling. Sorry your studio got messed up, it's authentic Japan now! Seriously though, I love that set, it's perfect. Glad you weren't hurt. I remember my first, so in settling. The most powerful I think I ever felt was a 5.4, and that was only a few seconds.... I had a whole apartment block above me, and was worried I might become entombed...ganbaremasu!  PS. Could you fix the cat using kintsugi? You know, the Japanese art of repairing ceramics with gold?
Glad you and all the people in the videos and production made it through safely
argh Chris man, this sucks ): hope it's not too much hassle sorting it all out (:
Stay safe out there, man..
I was there for the March 11th earthquake back in 2011. One bottle of wine shattered, but nothing else, so I'm glad to see you making it through another earthquake of considerable size.
“Oh I’m gunna die now” bruh lmfao
FUCK thats a scary experience
What happens at 0:09 ? Is that some kind of camera phenomenon?
Maneki Neko... meet Kintsugi.  :-)
I wonder if the videos that seem like people silently standing there with a cellphone camera filming are actually webcams and security cameras, or are legit people just being like "welp, if I'm screwed I'm screwed.  Might as well go out showing the world my last moments."
What a beautiful apartment
Hugss
I was in Chiba during the '95 quake. My mom called all frantic to make sure I was OK. Given the distance, I hadn't even felt it. Saw it on the news like she did. LOL
I was in the 1989 San Francisco earthquake on the 36th floor of a building on landfill. Earthquakes are terrifying and destructive. On the plus side, you're not injured. On the negative side, it's gut wrenching when treasured possessions are destroyed. I wish you the best of luck in recovering from the earthquake.
Sad! I was given my grandma and grandpa stuff that they did not want as they sold one of their small houses. And I'm now 48, but something that almost always was done to stuff that got broken (porcelain, and other stuff) was to actually just glue it right back again... So if you really like the thing but don't want it broken maybe you can find the pieces (yes I know it was a real mess and 10000 piece puzzle I guess) but you know what... Try to find the pieces and glue them back in again... sometimes you get lucky and only you know that it was glued....
It puta a bit of character In the studio I guess
Crazy. I wish there were earthquake safe buildings. Good faith
I miss these types of videos. Non- scripted genuine Chris, wish he would go back to these. Nevertheless, i’m happy for his success and glad he’s genuinely safe.
Get someone to do some kintsugi to the cat figurine. It would be a great momento.  Make a trip to Don Quixote to get replacements for your broken stuff and make a video about the trip.
Kind of weird because even for us here in India we had a very slight earthquake which is really rare for us since we're not that prone to earthquake. And now there heavy rain here
金継ぎで招き猫を直すかな？ 🤔
I'm just glad you and your team are ok Chris that's all that matters. things can be replaced but not family or in your case your team. please stay safe
I'm considering moving to Japan. This and the tsunami waves that can form because of earth quakes scare me.
4:22 Chris you pervert - this will get you demontized XD
Hi @Abroad in Japan . Can you give me any insight into what that flash was? whatever it was, was big and probably not working very well right now. cheers, stay safe
Better not to have too many decoration or picture frame.😱😭
Luckily y all are fine god bless
So sorry for your loss Chris, so much hard work gone with nobody to blame, truly heartbreaking for all of us too
Been living in Japan myself for years and tbh, so long as people are safe and alive. Earthquakes are scary af especially the ones rocking us the last year or so, but I really don't care what stuff of mine is broken so long as me and my friends are alive after it.
Japan invaded other countries and killed countless of people in the worst ways possible(Human bioweapon trial, called Unit 731), rapped countless women for pleasure. So God has been punishing that country for what it did in the past by giving that country constant earthquakes and tsunamis.
Plot twist - there was never any earthquake. This is just the mess Chris normally lives in.
The most important stuff in that studio is you guys, and you are unharmed. The rest can be rebuilt, so keep up your spirit!
Good luck abroad in japan. Hope you guys come back stronger .
How can those buildings survive that ? Its insane what modern architecture can do ...
As an acehnese, Your weakness disguise me. 🤪
I hope everything works out for you guys ! Best wishes
As long as everyone is safe. That's most important. Hope the water thing gets fixed soon
your office destroyed still looks better than my house on a good day
Me, an Indonesian: "ah i see, just another Sunday morning eh?"
Less is more in the future human have to learn to live with less stuff...
Take care Chris and the team.
Omg that looks so scary
This is why I'll never go to Japan. Also I'm poor as sh1t.
Oh man... I thought that was secured for earthquakes if it cost so much.. feel your pain
Honestly guys, I think you got off cheap.  Sure it would be nice of nothing got broken but at least the building is up and intact.
What date did this earthquake take place ?
damn best wishs from denmark, which never have earthquaks at all, cant imagine living with the fear of the possebilty
Imagine you were pretending to be james bond and you orded a martini at that exact moment.
I one experienced a 8.1 magnitude earthquake and it's horrifiying,  a 7 magnitude earthquake doesn´t feel as bad but it stll feels bad
When I asked my brother why there wasn’t a new AOT ep I wasn’t expecting him to say “becos there was an earthquake” I hope everyone is alright and you all have returned back to normal by now ❤️
If you have never experienced an earthquake, you simple can't imagine it. If you have experienced an earthquake, you don't want to experience any more.
In case of an earthquake hide under the desk.  Meanwhile, the desk:  0:00
I'd attempt to glue all of the broken pottery back together. Kind of a physical reminder.
Allot of people don’t understand just how scary a big earthquake actually is. I live in Alaska and was in my house during the 2018 magnitude 7.1 earthquake here. While I had experienced earthquakes before, nothing compared to that one. One way to describe it would be like the world is trying to shake you off of it. Truly a terrifying experience and I hope everyone in japan is ok.
I was actually watching the Geoscience Australia earthquake map and I saw this earthquake pop up.
I really hope all is ok over there. Praying for everyone💖
LOLLLLLLL GOOD LUCK REMODELING AFTER THIS
Uhhh Velcro stickys on everything when you get it all fixed and restored for next time?? Hope things go well for you next time man :/
Amazing Chris, how could you possibly ever guard against that in the future and di you find the leak?
I was in Sendai 2 weeks after the tohoku tsunami.  Was on a balcony smoking a cig when I believe a 7.9 came through. That woke me up lol
Sorry to hear about the damages to the shop!
Glad to see Sharla and Natsuki are okay! Right then *cough* best be off…
Get a kintsugi kit and fix the cat. A little gold on the cracks will make it look better than before.
I like to think the Manekineko broke because he did his job well. It was lucky nobody was in the studio and nobody got hurt, and his job is to attract luck to him. He gave his life so some things could be salvaged and made sure it wasn’t worse. I’m sentimental like that, though 🤷🏻‍♀️
The gatchamon machine lid can be plastic welded, using a soldering iron or wood burning kit and some filler plastic.
Good that you're safe
Your beautiful Ramen shop! :( I'm sorry that happened. Such a cool spot! Glad you'll rebuild it!!!! In future, maybe you could have some of the sticky material that museums put under ceramics to hold them in place for preservation purposes (it's like a reusable glue and available through Amazon). I think the substance is called Puddy or it could be tack. It's been a while, but it's like a stronger version of the sticky stuff that can tack up posters on walls (but it is specifically meant for holding breakable things in place on flat surfaces). It's usually clear/colorless, but it may save you money in future. Love your show and I hope you continue to feel the support your viewers feel for you where you are.
I am glad you guys are alright. Sad to see the studio is in shambles tough chris.
Very glad you are safe, Chris and team! Best wishes from the USA!
Glad your safe! I would have shit myself 3 times over
Glad you are all ok.
For your broken kitty at least, and your more favorite other pieces, you could see about maybe something like Kintsugi? You could keep it AND have another deeper meaning too!
Gland you are safe, does the gov't of japan offers any financial assistance?
Sorry about that, the damage looks horrifying and everything was so beautiful before. So glad you all are well though.
Honestly Chris mate that's proper shit we know you worked hard for that studio and spent alot its such a shame to see the place like this
Dude, I would keep the Maneki-neko kitty. It is not entirely smashed. And it symbolizes you and your business surviving the worst. I would totally take it and keep it as a good token. What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger. And a bit b=more bruised, but who cares! Stay safe! Cheers
Gotta keep that busted kitty! He's got a cracked ear but still mostly intact!
Sooo, those two are an item, right?
If you really love the maneki neko and you still have the pieces, you could do a kintsugi-like repair on it.
I'm happy that you're okay. Just a week or so after that my town had a tornado rip through it. We were fine, but some shops and neighbors near us weren't terribly lucky.
Chris, you should repair your cat with Kintsugi, the Japanese art of putting broken pottery back together with gold. It's an idea of embracing flaws and imperfections and I always thought that was really cool.  You could even repair it with glue and color the repair with gold-colored paint if real gold is out of the question.
I thought this video would at least be in 2021, it was 2 weeks ago...
That 1st office was doing the Harlem Shake…like DAMN!
watch out for mold and good luck bro.
Glad your okay.
How many EQ´s is needed to kill Chris?  but joking aside,  seriously glad to see that you are ok<3
Hey Chris, just saw this video and its long after the fact but hope you get your studio in order and everything works out. Love the content and will forever love any of the content you put out. Good luck my man
water and electricity no bueno
Hope things fix up ok and all the people that matter are safe and well
As you mentioned, I experienced a big earthquake in 1995 at Osaka when I was a child. It is said bigger earthquake will hit Japan which is parf of  from Kanto to Kyusyu near future. So scary...
When did you get a studio!?! i love that bar set!
kintsugi
If the pieces aren't really small, you can just glue most of that stuff
Well, I'm two weeks late but maybe a bit of Kintsugi for the little Neko is in order, even if alo the pieces aren't quite there lol. I'm glad that you all are okay 💜
I still remember that night years ago, I had the flu pretty bad and was sitting up in bed feeling miserable and my phone started to buzz. Looked at the screen and recognized my brother's number - calling from Nagoya, Japan. When I answered the phone he sounded a bit shaken, said he was taking a taxi home from work early because they had just had a pretty big shaker and to let mom and the rest of the family know he was okay. He couldn't stay on the phone long, so I thanked him for the heads-up and told him I hoped his fish tank was okay and that there wasn't too much damage. He said he wasn't sure about the tank but so far where he was looked okay, and from how bad it was he was pretty sure it had been fairly local. After he hung up, I told my mom who kinda shrugged it off - I guess he had told her a few hours ago they had a small earthquake and she thought that he was referring to that again (it was pretty late so that seemed to sort make sense.) then I texted my other brother and his wife the update and went to bed.  The next morning it was a text from my sister in law that woke me up, basically saying something along the lines of "OMG I'm so glad you messaged us, I just turned on the morning news and was freaking out!"  So of course I woke up mom and dad and we turned on the tv. My brother had been very wrong about where the earthquake had been centered, it had not come from anywhere near Nagoya, but instead was from much further north and had been so much worse than he had known then. And yes, it was the Tohoku Earthquake.   Later he told me that even in being Japan they didn't know how bad the damage was, or hear about the tsunami until a day or two later - there was enough damage spread wide enough along the coast that, in all of the confusion the news just didn't get out super fast, and what did get out was jumbled and confused. I will never forget the feeling of that morning.
Damn man, that sucks! It’s hard when memories get destroyed like that. Hope everything works out in your favor!
Glad you're OK Chris!
Dear, God !!!!!!!
Best of luck in cleaning everything!! I’m glad you’re all ok. I’ve kinda grown accustomed to big earthquakes here in Chile. ( I’ve felt at least 4 more than 7 in my life 😅) so I hope you get accustomed too
What’s up Broski 🦋,
Losing possession to natural disasters has to be one of the most devastating things to happen to someone. At least the studio is not completely destroyed, but the clean up work still seems to be ample.
Was in alaska during our crazy earthquake. You become adjusted to the aftershocks but you feel it will be another big one all the time.
I'm glad you and your friends are safe.  I hope you are able to rebuild your studio soon!
Repent of your sins and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, believe in your heart that He has died for sins and rose from the tomb on the third day and let the Holy Spirit within you, and you shall be saved.
At least you are ok and most of the material stuff lost can be replaced, hopefully.
Good you guys are doing ok big fan of the channel and you work keep on the awesome work! cheers from Panama
nooo, the manikineko!
Were you not in Sendai for the two 7+ magnitude that hit us in March and May last year? Those were damn scary too, but this time the shaking was much more horizontal. RIP my television. Compared to your apartment I think I got off relatively easy though...
Rough, wish there was more i could do than commenting, liking and subscribing. Sorry to see this man.
My first thought after hearing about earthquake was I hope you were ok because you were dead center of earthquake.
Glad you’re ok
Wow..in some cases it doesnt look too bad but than other things dont look so good..Poor Nikko kitty
Praying for the safety of you and the people of Japan. That experience sounds really scary. 😢
ah man I feel bad for you man.
Am I the only one that saw the thing fall from the sky and show flash of light in the horizon at 0:09 in to the video
Awesome video
You could practice the art of Kintsugi on that ceramic cat. Rather than gold solder just get some gold fingernail polish. :) I did that to a favorite planter and it gets a lot of compliments. I am enjoying your videos. Oss.
Doesn't Japan have a culture of mending broken things with natural glue laced with gold dust? I think that's what you could do with the manekineko which adds even more sentimental value.
Im really feeling this. Dont worry, it will look even better afterwards.
Poor Maneki Neko! Perhaps you could venture on an epic journey to learn the art of Kintsugi and get the cat back together!
*Mate, I feel for you. That seems scary! I remember when we get some after shocks here in Thailand and that's nothing.  Hope you are doing well.  Love yours videos ,Cheers mate*  💪💪
I am Japanese high school student,17 years old,going to be grade 3 from April. I experienced earthquakes.I am not afraid of it.  I always offer for earthquakes.
as a person who has experienced earthquakes I'm glad your ok I have never experienced one as strong as the one you went through in this video so I am also glad you weren't in the studio and that your just cleaning it up
hope you are ok after the replica at the end of the video.
The cat is a good opportunity for kintsugi
I have found that the depth of the quake as much as the size determines the experience. Deep is good, slower and more mellow. I saw some guys here on scaffolding during a 7.1 and it was hilarious. The direction makes a difference as well. Ours are 100km or so deep usually, the 14km deep one felt so much different. More things falling as well.
bruh this got more views than his hyped up documentary
As someone who's lived through several hurricanes and salvaged a household or two, I'm glad you're all right. And...it's only stuff.
Holy...that is terrifying! Glad you're OK!
Nice to see you are ok ! Can you do a special video on Advanced Humanoid Robots !
I am glad he and all his crew came through unscathed even if the studio took a bit of a beating. Because I am an American that sometimes has a hard time understanding a Brit I turn the closed caption on.  I mention this because I am struck by how every time someone says 'fuck' in the close caption it's 'god'. . These captions aren't auto-generated suggesting that someone has to go through and type in all the captions.  For some reason I just want to know - who chose to replace 'fuck' with 'god' and more importantly I want to know why? LOL
Glad you're okay mate.
Man, earthquakes can be so freaking scary! I'm from Chile and we had a crazy big one in 2010. You know you're in danger when your country have two separate words for "small earthquake" and "THE earthquake". Take Care, Chris! Hope everything is alright. Hope you the best luck with the aftershocks :c
Is Japan full of spiders. I aranchophobic  so really scared to visit the country.
Apparently Japan is a giant dishwasher
Did they ever figure out what cause the water spill?
I'm so sorry to hear about this man. Wishing you and everyone affected in Japan a quick turnaround for the best. Hugs from Brazil.
I’m so sad about this! Your studio!!! But honestly at the same time I’m happy that all of you are ok… everything else could be replaced but not you! Warm regards from USA
I moved to Japan in September. This is the second earthquake I have ever experienced (first one being in 2018 when I traveled here as a college student). It was pretty terrifying, not gonna lie, especially when you lived in the Midwest for your entire life and these are as foreign as it comes. Only saving grace I had was that I don't have a lot of stuff in general that could fall down and break in my tiny apartment lol.
2:25 That anime moment with main hero reminiscing about the past
Perhaps a PSA about Japan's earthquake preparedness would be in order? Many foreigners underestimate the power of these tremors. Ikebukuro Bosaikan has some good training and sell items which should be in every household. There's also pamphlets and websites in non-Japanese languages. Something to consider.
That was a 7.4? Must have been very superficial to cause that damage
Omg Chris sorry for the loss of your studio I hope you get everything together soon
Might be time to move the studio to a modern building
Lots of broken stuff, hopefully nothing super expensive was broken.  But for the rest of the stuff, like all the porcelain and stuff,  you would probably have teared or changed anyway,  within a 5-10 year period.  The most important thing is that you made it with your health intact!
5:33 wtf was that?
What was the explosion?
Keep safe 🙏🙏
What is that light at 0:10, it is looks like something is hitting the ground!
To anyone who has some knowledge about earthquakes etc.. What  does exactly happen at 0:09 ? talking about the light.
I'm sorry for you but is a seismic country it will happen again. Just learn what to do and do no put anything you don't want it to get broken in high so there will less chance to brake. Tall buildings move a lot because they are more flexible than in others non seismic countries, this helps to disipate the energy without being crashed. Live in seismic countries teach you one important thing. It ok lives crumble down, but you have to get up start again and keep going, even knowing that is probable that it will fall down again.
I actually cried a little when I saw your studio, I remember how proud you were when you showed off the new ramen shop studio and it’s sad to see the state of it now! I am glad everyone’s okay though! Hopefully you can get everything back up and running without to much trouble Chris! ❤️
If this happened in Nepal 50% of houses would be rubble
Hey Chris, too lazy to type all the things I wanna say! So Im just gunna say this! Been watching your videos and love them. You make great content. Thats it for now! Sending love and support from Toronto! 🥷🏻🤗
Got the studio just in time then...
Lol
I feel sorry for you for your Studio if the Lord you’re OK not hurt.
man, crazy world, pandemic, earthquake, the 3rd anlgo-american war on europe....
Well, you could say it was a decent studio whilst It lasted
Guys do be careful if u enter a room with electronic or any sort of electricity and water on the floor, in my country a whole family died of electrocution just cuz they touched the water and each other.
So sorry guy,the shit happens statement is appropriate now.
I've been hear for years mate. Perseverance is thy name.
good thing u have patreon, so we could recover your severe of the studio
about 10 years ago i was in a 7.3 earthquake. i had grown up experiencing small to moderate size quakes all throughout childhood, but when that one hit i realized how truly scary they could actually be. you could hear the sounds of the cars on the streets bouncing and swaying, the sound of all the metal moving makes you feel like you're in an actual disaster movie.
Don’t know if you can get it where your at but look up Clear Museum gel. It might come in handy for future earthquakes.
How many earthquakes have you been through there?
Watching him put that frame back on the shelf and say "There, everything's better now." My my tear up a bit. When a natural disaster hits and you come back to find the one place that should be safe wrecked it shatters something inside you. Just finding one item untouched or minimal broken means so much. Just one item where you left it.  I can remember doing the same type of thing I found an item and put it back on the shelf and said aloud for no reason "There, all better." I have no idea why I said that because everything was far from better I just felt I had to find sanity in that moment.
Wiggle, Wiggle, WIggle.
you should get a thing that stop object from falling down from a earthquake. idk what is called but it was featured on joey from anime man girlfriend channel
The apartment alleyway lasted a total of 8 videos before its death. That hurts.
glad your ok the studio can be cleaned up and things replaced, but people never can.
As you had said in you documentary on Fukushima, you will rebuild.
It's just even more authentic now 👍
So sad to see what happened to your studio, but I'm glad no one on your team got hurt.
Wow, that looks really bad. Sorry for your studio that was about smashed, you spent so much money and time on it only for one thing to screw you over. Stay positive Chris and get scrubbing my boy
As a german, even the aftershocks would scare me shitless lol.
do some Kintsugi on your lucky cat if you can find all the pieces!!
So sad for your studio. Take care Chris.
Sorry you guys had to deal that, glad everyone is ok! Love your slippers man. ^_^
Just glad everyone is okay.
Translation needs work. Or is it the author?
Probably too late now, but you can get the cat fixed with gold.  There was a YouTube video there a person had their bowl fixed with gold. (Maybe an antique bowl) It's was quite pretty 😍  Hoping everyone is ok 💝
Stay strong.
We felt this all the way in Misawa and it was a long one. I can’t even imagine what it felt like down in Sendai 🥴
Glad you’re ok
Damn :( glad everything is somewhat ok :)
Can you order museum putty from the USA for literally all the items that reside on shelves? That's what everyone living on the East Coast of America uses to keep stuff on the shelves during earthquakes
still looks better as in Ukrain's apartments
stay safe, stay strong brother.
Ever heard of Kintsugi? The Japanese art of repairing ceramic with lines of gold along the cracks. It's beautiful in many ways.
That little machine gacha'd its last pon. I'm glad you're okay though. That's the most important thing. I'm sorry about the studio.
Pain. Glad to see your OK but this makes me sad. Looks like we all gotta throw hands with nature smh
My father also had a lovely moving ceramic maneki-neko for years. He was really sad when it broke in the 2010 Christchurch earthquake. I've been looking for one ever since.
The Tohoku earthquake released 350 times as much energy.
My only experience with Earthquakes is when I was in elementary school and there was a pretty weak earthquake when it comes to earthquakes in Northern Virginia of all places, but yeah, there hasn't been an earthquake here since then. I think it was around a little more than a decade ago.
What kind of worst earthquake doesn't kill people?
That was all stuff,as long as you are all alright that is the main thing.
Bro been getting chubby
Im amazed how the walls came down as well , an electrical fire could have happened to easily.
Oh boy it's so sad... It was just the other day when you showed us the first video in the ramen shop set  T_T I would look for a kintsukuroi artisan to repair the maneki neko tho
Jesus loves you all
Chris your dry sense of humor makes my day, from America
I'm so glad that you're all safe! I can't express how heartbroken I was after witnessing the damage inside your studio. You spent months building that beautiful area for your work and friends- Such a scary event to be in! Sending you all the love from Brazil!💙
Not a big deal, but the new earthquake laws didn’t start in 1995, it started in 1981, so buildings that were began to be built after that are safe. It was in 1995 in Kobe when these buildings built under the new law didn’t collapse like the others proved that it works.
im 3 minutes into the video.  did anyone die from the earthquake? i hope nobody died but im curious to know if anyone did.
This is why I hate Jvloggers.
Too much earthquake.
Sorry bro that sucks. Carpets or rugs might help. Plus I thought in Japan they make sure everything is secure for when earthquakes happen?
so glad your ok!
Yeah all i know chinese start it, hopefully we invade them in future.
Maybe you can save some of the ceramics using kintsugi and make it a memorabilia. Keep safe.
Been a long time fan of yours and I think most of us are in agreement that we are so glad you are okay. The studio can be rebuilt. Most important thing is that you and your friends and loved ones are okay.
Dutchsinse - YT - follows the energy of the earthquakes.  He knows when it hits and where.
You must certainly be a well off fellow with a spot that big in Japan.  Very sorry for the inconvenience of a 7.4 Earthquake, but very happy your alright, and able to carry on.  Be safe, take care, thank you for sharing.
Stay safe, Thank God no one was hurt on your team!
Glad you are all safe!  Things can be replaced, you can't replace people.
nooooooooo!
I think I would've cried in that situation
Dang, at first it didn't look so bad then you showed all the water on the floor and the broken bowls, I was like, "damnnnnnnnn that sucks so damn much" I hope your studio has earthquake insurance and I hope your able to build back stronger than ever!
Man, that really sucks, you kinda recently just finished the whole ramen shop and store, just for it to be hit by an earthquake! I really like that cat and I really liked the gachapon machine!
Oh man, and your just built that. D;
Cmon its authenticly japanese now.
Sorry to here about your stuff, brother. Godspeed.
Heartbreaking.
even Nepal is facing the same situation. Stay safe everyone
holy shit...
went on leave from my job in japan cause my mom was sick and had to fly back to Britain, I live near Sendai, I left two days before the earthquake. My mom wants me to go back but I'd rather stay with her and spend as much time as I can, just knowing how damaging that was to some people.   Shit's fucked man.
Welcome to California! I went through the Northridge 'quake. Pretty damn terrifying.
I watched tons of footage.  This was bad.
that was painfull to watch. Whose custom was it again that cracked cups were pieced together with pure gold?
It's heartbreaking to see this happen to such an amazing studio and and to Mr. Affable of all people. Hope you can get it up and running soon!!
Do they not sell mops and buckets in japan.... JS
Right after you got the studio too, I'm happy that you're all okay and that the studio is mostly intact, but that was still a lot to lose. I'm sorry for that Chris.
Jesus, I am glad you are ok man.  I was in Japan when the Kumamoto Earthquake hit and that was a 7.0?  Hope you get back to normal soon, I apologize that I didn't spot this sooner.
Great respect to people living in Japan and their spirit of life.  Lesson learned from Japan "May whatever happen DONT GIVE UP just get up and move forward."
Chris-sorry to see the damage of the physical manifestation of your beautiful but sarcastic mind. I’m glad you’re safe and Sharla and Natsuki were kind enough to be with you through the process of checking the studio and cleaning up.
OMG
My God, it was scary.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. - Matthew 24:7 KJV
Japan has a lot of earthquakes I was surprised that earthquakes rarely occur in foreign countries
Manfrotto research team need to speak to the makers of that cheap flimsy mirror.... either that, or you need to mount your expensive lighting gear on the mirror.
I actually do love you that’s all I’m saying I’m here you’re there but I do love you be safe
"Earthquakes in diverse places, the sea and the waves roaring ...... all these things are the beginning of sorrows, but the end is not yet" (Matthew 24).
We all hope everything's good for you Chris nothing but love
minimal damage. here in germany, mag3 would shut down the whole country for at least 2 weeks. 3month for full recovery.
is that earth quake or the second sun?
Ahhh- this is so sad to see your beautiful studio- I hope it can be repaired well and back to good health soon. I am so glad to see you are okay, what a scary event. Your videos of Japan are beautiful, as is your sense of humour. Take care from Canada 🇨🇦
Sorry bro
Glad you're ok, Natsuki.  And Chris, too.  Has anyone checked in on Ryotoro?
Oh, Chris, I’m so sorry for the damage to your studio.  I was so sad to see the destruction of such a beautiful work of art.  😞  But, at least you and your loved ones are ok.  I hope your studio will be better than ever!  The wabisabi fingerprints of the earthquake will perhaps serve to bring it even more character.  Ganbatte, my friend.  💚🙏🏻💚
Lots to be grateful for.
As I'm sure many other people have said, we're glad *you're* safe, Chris.  The studio is unfortunate, but that can be fixed relatively easily compared to you or Natsuki or anyone else being physically injured.  Hoping things get better for you, man, love your content
I live in Sendai too, it was no joke! Material things can be recovered, but our lives are most important, so glad you were safe!
Hmmm he's rounder than I remember...
Glad you guys are all doing well and uninjured.
Glad you all are ok. I was in that earthquake as well, it was huge. I’ve been in many earthquakes before, and that one just felt like it would not stop.  I’m from Alaska, and there’s been some large ones up there. But nothing like I’ve experienced here in Japan. I’m glad you’re ok, though.
You can rebuild it.  You can make it bigger, stronger, more Ramen-y!  I am so glad you guys are okay.
The most important thing is , that everybody is alright!!
4:19 anyone know what that 2nd little comic in the top left is
I know that feel bro. I'm from Chile and i experienced an 8.9 one. Glad you're safe 🙏🏻
As long as you're okay, that's the important part. Material can be replaced. People can't be.
Man this is so heartbreaking. Just moments ago I was watching the first video you put out of this awesome studio. Then I got this video recommended and I could not believe it... I hope you will restore that studio to its former glory. Stay safe
But most of the things that broke look like clean breaks so you should be able to easily fix them! You can even take a lot of the broken dishes and piece them back together using the same method used to make kintsugi.   I am glad that you and everyone is alright and hope that you all stay safe! You really need to earthquake proof the studio though because its better to be prepared than not!
as someone who was in christchurch during our quakes i can agreee to all you have said
I’m happy to see you are ok wish you luck with the repairs on your studio.
Glad you are okay
Glad that YOU were spared from a potentially greater tragedy. Stay safe out there!
Agh. Gutted to see this happen to you all! I hope you're all recovering and doing well. Be safe!
Some kintsugi maybe would be good solutions for the maneki neko or the other glass pieces! I'm glad that you all are safe
all fun and game till the furniture says: <----- and ----->
If you have all the pieces of the cat, you could get it lacquered together in the kintsugi style! Glad you are alright.
I am so sorry Chris, I love your Ramen shop and I hope you are able to rebuild it, but I know there are some really cool things in there that are probably not replaceable. I am also glad you have your friends to lean on, and I am so glad you all are ok. So many of us love Abroad in Japan. My heart goes out to you and you are in my prayers
I would of been panicking and thinking the world was ending
Videos like this one make me really appreciate living ina place that doesn't have to deal with earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or volcanoes. Floods and wild fires are bad but this is just terrifying
There's that creepy flash of light during a earthquake....what is that?? I just watched a documentary about a town that got flooded and people saw a light during a earthquake before the disaster....
Oh my, so sorry Chris for the damage that was caused at your apartment,  but I am happy to see you are alright!
Glad that you all are safe (/･ω･(-ω-)
You can always use kintsugi techniques to fix the broken ceramics.
Will you consider repairing the pottery you really cherish via Kintsugi?  I think it would be a good story to tell when people see the cat you really care about restored with gold.
At least your back alley didn't get smacked up.   Glad you guys are alright.
I'm so sorry that this happened but I'm glad you're alright, emotions withstanding. Silver lining: the water kind of adds to the grungy aesthetic!
It's just stuff, you can replace it.  I'm glad you and your friends are all OK!
Use Kintsugi to repair the cat and give it the chance to tell a story!
A lot of opportunities to do kintsugi there, don't throw out the cat it's just sad.  Glad you're safe!  ♥
If the insurance comes out favorably, I'd recommend spending a little more to get a new, and improved, ACTUAL kitchen in the ramen shop. Maybe you'd only use it when you had a competent cook over, but it would be soo immersion.
Glad you are ok! 3:10 Take that cat, glue him together and put him in the same spot. If it happens again, glue him back a second time. Resilience is one thing that defines Japan and even the entire human race. We rebuild, we start again. Things might never be the same, but in the end we emerge stronger and more close knitted.
man, the broken maneiki neko with the missing paw is such an odly apt symbol for such bad luck - so sorry it all got ruined, I hope you can rebuild
Make that 4 near death experiences….  Glad you are ok Chris be strong my man 💪
If you live in a Country that have frequent Earthquakes why would you suspend fragile objects on shelves ? I just don't get it hat's senseless behavior.
I feel so bad about the new studio man, but I'm glad that you're safe.
all the best from here. im glad ur safe. better days ahead stay postive <:D
Hope you manage to get everything back even better.
You should keep the broken cat Chris, as a reminder to your studio's history! Since watching your videos I've learned much about Japan and how efficient they're able to act on these unfortunate natural situations. I'm so terribly sorry to witness your new studio in shambles, but remember it was amazing, and know it will be amazing again <3
I think the earthquake showed how much random crap you have lying around
3:20 keep it broken like that. Reminder of the earthquake
I felt this quake, too. but I am in Yokohama, so it wasn't so bad. It was soooo long, though! Here in Yokohama it felt like it just kept stepping up and up. I have been inspired to update my bugout bag...
jesus, glad you're all okay!
Japan was like wiggle wiggle wiggle
It is a Japanese thing to fix things in a way that emphasises the fix. Like pottery where cracks are fixed with gold. Perhaps the cat should be taken down that path.
Glad you and the regular crew are all safe
The best opportunity to learn kintsugi!
Haven't experienced one as bad as that,  but I live in New Zealand in an area that cops a few earthquakes in the course of a year. It makes you hyper-aware of sounds and movements around you. Glad to see that your apartment didn't appear to have sustained too much damage. Hopefully you might be able to get the poor little cat repaired or replaced. Stay safe Chris. We are all sending our best wishes and hugs
Dude that looked terrifying. Glad you're okay, so sorry about the Ramen Shop. Wishing you the best from the other side of the Ring of Fire.
Glad you are ok. I kept a few ceramics from the 1989 Loma Prieta Quake (6.9 Richter). The aftershocks are the worst.  And nothing really prepares you for the Big Ones. You just batten down what you can and hope for the best. The fact that your shelves stayed upright is good. So you did everything as well as one can.  Take care over there.
Well the good news is that water damage goes well with the tech distopian aesthetic of the ramen shop.
Things can be replaced, lives can't. The important thing is that you're safe.
Japan is the land of earthquakes, the most in the world I believe. It is important you are safe. many were injured and a few have died. Broken things can usually be replaced,
I didn't see any of this on the news, just stuff about the Ukraine and the virus. Amazing how important things like this can be easily under reported. I'm glad all of you are okay.
I’m sure it must have been really scary up there, given what we felt in Tokyo. But if you’re genuinely impressed by a few smashed glasses and a pint of water spilled it’s time to change something in your life. Usually, living through life-threatening events has the effect of helping us reevaluate the loss of insignificant material possessions. This mess must have taken less than 15 minutes to cleanup with three people. I call #fake drama.
Damn dude. That SUCKS you just had that out together, you were so proud of it. Fuck man. I'm sorry
Do you have insurance?
I was amazed when a typhoon took out the power in my area that the convenience stores continued running in the morning without power. They just switched to using handheld battery-powered registers.
Yeahhh... we were in the 94 Northridge Quake, "just" a 6.5. You know when you are shaking out a cloth and you snap it and then end flies up? Yeah, we felt like that, nearly airborne! And to this day, when there's a quake, all I can think is "don't get bigger don't get bigger". I'm hundreds of miles from Ridgecrest, and that one shook HARD here, moving stuff in the garage, breaking roof tiles, and scaring me!
Survived the Great Tohoku Quake.  My place was trashed.  The bed moved to the other side of the room.  Not a great day.
stay safe Chris ❤️🙏
It's a mess but it could have been a lot worse. This stuff looks to be all replaceable. Lives are not.
Ever figure out where the water was coming from?
Glad you are okay Chris. Things can be replaced or repaired people can't
1:32 Wow, you're lucky that the mirror didn't drop and shatter. That would have been a major pain to take care of.
If you found the maneki neko pieces you could do the kinstugi!
So sorry that happened and glad you’re safe!   As a Californian who has been through many earthquakes and bi-annual earthquake safety in school, I want to remind everyone DO NOT touch water after an earthquake when there is obvious wire or electrical damage till after you have a professional inspect the wiring. Getting electrocuted by water is a huge risk after these disasters
I had a recent car accident and it felt devastating to see something I'd worked hard to own smashed to pieces I imagine you might have felt similar. I'm sorry this happened.
Dude i feel emotional for you. Ive been following you for a while and this honestly breaks my heart. Im soooooo sorry for your lost. You saved up for so long to make a new studio and you didnt deserve this to happen to you.
I'm so sorry Chris 😭❤️
All that matters is that you guys are safe, prayed for everyone in Japan
Could put the maneki neko to a kitsugi repair. I am sure it will be a lot more valuable after that.
Glad you are safe Chris
If you like the cat that much, why not try the kintsugi treatment on it? It might look cool that way, and you'd still keep the cat on display.
#staysafe
Imagine 7,4 earthquake happened in china.  No building last standing 🤣
Glad your safe amigo.
Glad to see that you are all alright and healthy :D
You would have made so much more money with this video if you didn't say the F word about 27 times !
Remember, he slept through three sirens when Korean missile flew overhead. That's how bad this quake was.
all that matters is that everyones okay
Ready to come back home? Seriously, I am glad you are OK.
That’s no earthquake, it was Godzilla
Should have got a mop
So glad you and your friends are safe, Chris. Gutted for your studio. Sending love to everyone in Japan right now , must have been so scary for you all . X
glad you are okay!
Hey Chris. I just wanted to say I really look up to you and that to see you having to undergo this really makes me upset. It also puts a new perspective to things, in a way I hadn’t thought of before.  My thoughts to everyone affected.
Don't get discouraged. I know it's a new studio you worked hard on but you did such a great job and just glad you're all safe and can now rebuild
well, equipments may be damaged but you got to make this video to get millions of views surely the monetization can help cover up some of the loss
So glad you are ok. I love this channel and your content. Things can always be replaced (even the beloved maneki-neko) but you cannot!
If you really need to say some profanities on video at least you could make people aware of them at the beginning of it, mate, so that parents can protect their children from hearing them.
Dear Chris, I saw a documentary on hikikomori today and it made me really sad. I am thinking how to reach out to lonely people in my country. Could you do something for lonely people over there?
Just glad to hear you are okay from such a massive earthquake. But I know with time the studio can be reforged anew, and hopefully stronger than before to ensure more control should another earthquake happen.
I'm so sorry this happened and you guys are having to go through this.  I am glad you are all okay!
Dear Mr Broad, hopefully you got all set up right now and you are able to calm down again. Your words at the beginning of this video, would make an interesting video to. The new and actual rules, the government made in Japan, for more safety during and after earthquakes. At least, each tourist may have this experience during his or her holidays. And i do suppose, that we are all waiting for your new videos! Yours sincerely A.T.
It’s like stewart lee regenerated like doctor who and moved to japan and started a youtube channel and still had the exact same voice as the previous stewart lee
That’s some seriously scary stuff! I was just thinking of earthquakes in Japan the other day actually, with March 11th being the 11th anniversary since that huge one that caused the tsunami and the crisis/disaster at Fukushima, and then just days after that day, this happens...   Glad the damage was minimal considering how strong the earthquake was this time!   As much as I’d want to visit Japan sometime, the prospect of earthquakes does scare me more than just a little bit as I live in an area that has few or none of them, and the ones we do get are usually so weak you don’t even notice them. I may have heard one here in my town many years ago but still don’t know if it was one or not, I woke up one night and just heard the windows rattle but there was no wind outside and no heavy machinery driving by that could explain the sound.  There was one in the Malmö area in Sweden some 12-13 years ago or so and I lived in Malmö at the time, it was strong enough to make some visible cracks in some walls in Copenhagen, but I totally missed it and didn’t know a thing until people at work in Copenhagen asked me if I had felt the earthquake that morning. I think I was either on the bus to the train station or already on the train when it struck so that may explain why I didn’t feel it, I’ve heard you notice it less or not at all if you’re in a moving vehicle, and I was relatively close (10-15 miles or so) from the epicenter. If I had still been in bed when it hit, I would have noticed for sure as I had a lofted bed at the time with a desk underneath it and because the bed was so high, movements would travel up pretty well from the floor or even just when turning around in bed. That quake was only I think a 5.4 or so though, and as far as I can remember nothing had even toppled over at home when I got back from work that day
I’m sorry for what happened to your studio Chris. But more importantly I hope you are all safe and well. It’s not much but I send my best wishes. Kind regards Chris
Am in Morioka. We are ok desu
Get it gold fixed!
I really hope u had insurance for the studio Chris. This you will also surpass
Damn yall were hella juiced about sendai, hope yall arent too shook.
So sad for your studio but thankfully you're ok. Hope it won't cost you too much to re-do. Wish you the best 🤞🍀
I know some just pack everything down as a precaution when they do not need it and bolt everything else down just in case, but Earthquakes tends to be felt stronger in such large buildings rather than smaller wood homes.
Do you have insurance like we do in north america or is it something totally different?
Come on, ya know it will happen again, it just mother nature.  Not much you can do, at end of the day everyone is safe.
damn, not the ramen shop. you should make an episode looking around for some new decorations for the studio
Glad to see that you are safe  Take care of yourself Hope the studio gets fixed up soon Hope your favourite maneki neko could be fixed
That's got to be hard to see, but on the upside all the preparations made for this kind of thing based on past experience means that people you know over there are likely to be ok and that's what really matters.
Glad all of you are okay. I know it’s a massive PITA, but looks like the damage is relatively minor. Could have been much worse.
As someone who has done quite a bit of plumbing, I am yell "turn the water main off!" because a drip can become a rupture real quick!
Taiwan also just had their earthquake of the decade and I felt the same way, really thought the building was coming down. Incredible that buildings are capable of surviving it.
That's really upsetting to see your studio like that, but more importantly you're ok. You can replace a broken ramen shop, but there is only one Chris!!
Repair the car with gold lacquer. Kintsugi
I'm glad that you're safe. I'm from another highly seismic country and I'm surprised by the lightweight construction in Japan; over here everything must be solid and built following strict criteria to be able to endure earthquake vibrations without falling.
Who wants some milkshakes?
Save the parts from the cat. Isn't there a tradition in Japan to repair your favorite bowl with gold, maybe you can do that with the cat? Good to see that all of you are well. Much love from Sweden <3
"Hey, Rick, why do you keep all your stuff in chests and have nothing on the walls?"
I’m living close to Tokyo and I was scared at. Can’t even imagine how scared you guys must’ve been!  I made sure to move into an apartment with the highest earthquake safety measures. Things I would’ve never considered back in Europe 😅
In fact that I live very far from Fukushima, I felt the Earthquake but it wasn't that strong. I was just scrolling through my phone and suddenly I felt my body moving. I looked towards to the water bottle on my left and also saw it moving. I hope that the people in Fukushima are all safe
As long as you’re safe.
Earthquakes are the reason I would not want to live in Japan for a long period of time. Esp how shaky is the political situation in the world atm, imagine Earthquake and war all at once. If one can flee a war zone where can you flee fast when a natural disaster hits the whole land. I am happy you all are ok tho <3
Dang.
Looks like the yakuza did some work on you. How much do you owe them?
I live in Saitama and it was scary even over here. I cant imagine how shitty it was where you live. Earthquakes freak me the hell out honestly. glad youre okay!
I can feel the pain through the screen
Dude I hope everything gets better over there!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sorry about the outcome in your region… How about bringing your manekineko to a kintsugi class with you 😉 🐱? ~ pottery teacher in Chiba (none of my pottery broke this time)
Hopefully folks can get into normal state again. Like hell the way buildings were shaking like jello
Heart broken to see your studio like this, feels like it was only yesterday that you introduced it to us.   Glad you are safe, and it's nice to see Sharla and Natsuki with you.  I had to go through a flood before, no where near as scary as what you went through, but I had to do the clean up by myself and it was the lonliest feeling in the world.
Take care, Chris and co! I'm in Osaka, this video reminded me not to take things for granted (and to maybe secure some of my shelves). Love your channel, hope the studio was not too damaged.
at least yall are safe be alert since earthquakes are getting stronger and occurs frequently every year and its scary as fuck.
That was crazy. Hopefully the studio can be rebuilt quickly.
I'm so glad you and everyone else is alright. Seeing the footage of the buildings and airplanes outside fkin SHAKING is absolutely horrifying. The stuido in that state almost made me cry. That Maneki Neko used up it's protective power to keep you save uwu Now it will be honoured in its smashed, but still magnificent appearance <3
Yikes, I never even heard about it, wow! Glad you’re ok tho xxx
its okay to cry chris i would
The Japanese can't catch a break can they but I think there were no casualties so that's a good thing.
glad everyone is save & the structures are intact! shame about the kitty tho =/
日本は地震あるから怖いよねー。チャイナの人は喜んでたみたいだけど。
That is absolutely terrifying!! I glad to hear you are safe!
So glad you're okay man!
Glad you're okay ✌
You're going to be okay!  And I'm so glad you're okay and that there was no big tsunami.
For the maneki neko I would use kintsugi to try to bring it to life again!
F
Where did the water come from in the end?
Biggest earthquake I've ever experienced was 7.8 in India nepal border man that was scary
U can replace a building but can't replace u, glad your safe man
I felt this earthquake all the way up in Hokkaido. There we just had some mild shaking, but considering Hokkaido doesn’t tend to get many earthquakes, I knew the epicenter must have been pretty intense. It’s great that you’re okay and that damage overall was kept to a minimum. Japanese infrastructure is crazy!
that looked terrifying. glad everyone is ok.
Oddly enough, now when things are too much, I automatically say "Too much volcano". It often makes me laugh spontaneously, so thanks for that, at least. Not a small thing, homie. Good luck with the rebuild, you can now change/add stuff you thought of after seeing the original studio. Bright side. Plus vodka...
they must leave Japan. many warning messages have said that Japan will disappear into the ocean. leave if you can.
I remember the 6.1 I felt in Puerto Rico. It was hard to sleep after that. Best wishes and hopefully things get back to normal soon.
Glad you three are safe, fellow Sendai-jin!
i was eating a sandwich as you said no sandwiches for anyone and had quite a sly smile, hope everything goes well on the recovery front for everyone affected though
Stay safe! that's fucked up
Glad you're all safe but sad to see the ramen shop in that state
Chris, I blue tack everything - and nothing broke in this earthquake. I suggest trying it for precious happy cats and the like. 😉
Sorry for the damage and thank goodness you are all okay.
Glad you and everyone are Ok Chris.... You can replace all the broken stuff, but we cant replace you guys. Stay Safe... we are thinking of you all.
it was fun lol XD. It was for few minutes lol.
We can all breathe a sigh of relief. Japan's national treasure is safe.
I’m so glad you’re safe! Knowing you live in the region, I was so worried about you and your crew.
Glad you are ok!
I'm so sorry to you, your staff and everyone in japan
Have the Maneki-neko repaired using the Kintsugi technique. Treat the breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.
Asia specially China is super mega floods, Japan is super mega earthquake and tsunami
Don't worry. A 7.0 is most likely only happening once every 10 years. So you are fine now until youtube ends its existance :D
Honestly with all the broken ceramics it'd be a really cool idea to have quite a few repaired using kintsugi, and would bring even more character to the ramen shop area
Jesus that's horrifying. No wonder folklore was created that explained such things. Could only imagine being in the middle of that centuries ago and wondering if some god or beast was pissed for some reason.
I am glad you are safe and sound. I hope everything is better now.
Definitely wouldn’t be walking around sockfooted with broken glass and water everywhere.
You putting the picture back up and straightening the photo on the wall got me emotional. I'm glad you all are safe. Take care ❤
Maybe you guys already did, but do take a look at the terms of the fire insurance contract. Most of those comes by default together with the rental deal and some of them actually covers damages of earthquakes quite well.
So very sad to see this happen to you and many others in Japan. Very glad to hear you are safe and looking forward to seeing what is new to the studio to replace what was destroyed.
I hope theres some form of insurance to help you out in repairs and item replacement.
You are so low key.. I would have been A WRECK!  So glad you are ok.. I just can’t imagine!!  And I live in California!😂 Stay safe and hoping all goes well for you.
Earthquakes are horrendous and they leave you shaken for days. Although you had some damage, at least you are all ok.
I see many hours of happy jigsaw puzzle type of work. Your cat put back together, with a little wonkiness, will add to it's character, with a good story to it! Put a few of the bowls back together and display them in the background. Looks like minimal damage to what I would've expected to see. overall the extra work to get up and running again sucks, but you and your friends look ok. That is far more important!!
Glad you and the team are safe. 🙏
Hope it all is ok, glad you are safe Chris
I'm just glad you guys are alright. People tend to be a bit more difficult to replace vs trinkets and other material stuff after all.
I am from Glendale CA and we had the Northridge quake in 1992 and boy I was a doozy and was only a 6.5   7.4 is big.
I am glad your ok
Honestly by this day nothing shocks me anymore. First COVID19, then war (I am Russian, born in Ukraine, living in Germany) we had blood rain here last days... The durst from Sahara passed by and during the precipitation, it looks like blood... And you in Japan have the biggest earthquake since 10 years. I mean what else?!... You know what sucks more than 2020, 2022...
man wasnt even log ago the studio was built, :( this is sad <3
Of course basically as soon as you create a kick ass studio something terrible happens to it. It’s heartbreaking!
My English is not good but, I wanted to cry when I saw your hard work destroyed. But I am really happy that you guys are fine. Traumatizated, but physically fine. A big hug from Italy/Swiss (me and my bf's country).
I had to go through earthquakes living in California, but never one that bad. But still, even though it sucks a lot of the items in your apartment were damage, at least eveyone isn't hurt. Those things can be replaced, not the people! But again, seriously glad everyone is okay.
Have you considered kintsugi for the maneki cat?  That would look pretty neat.  And a memory.
What’s the studio for?
so sorry to see your studio get ruined by the earthquake. Glad that no one was hurt. Hopefully you can rebuild the studio quickly! Stay safe
Honestly, the damage would be worse. I'm surprised that more didn't break! Still unfortunate that some objects did, though. I hope the journey to complete restoration is swift!
I heard in Japan broken things are repaired with gold, so I think your place will hopefully shine even more when all is done! 🙏🏻❤️
I hope you didnt throw away a lot of thous plates/bowls ect out, cause you can do the "Gold Cracking Decoration" that they do to make it have character! And yea its horrible, but it gives a new start. Like the Neko Cat, if you find the pieces you can do the same thing with the other pieces. Glue them back together, put gold leaf on most of it, or even just leave it as is after gluing it, and then use them for decorating your back drop!
Really glad you guys are safe and well, it's really sad to see so much damage in the studio but hopefully you can manage to recover all. Be safe and keep it up ! (dont know a lot of word of encouragement, english is my second language sorry)
You're much calmer than I'd have been.
Very sorry to hear about this. Like other say, some of the wreckage could be used as props or souvenirs. Something to do with Godzilla or whatever perhaps? The model food is the most crushing for me because each of those is made by hand I should imagine. I mean the custom stuff in the studio itself doesn't seem that badly damaged at all thankfully and water ingress with your floor should be covered by insurance but it's still very sad for you, and everyone else in the area of course, to have to go through this. My commiserations.
use bluetak!
First investment for the new ramen shop layout: a bucket, mop, and broom
Just leave that cursed Country. I lived there 12 years (2002~2014)... I experienced the big earthquake in 2011 in Tokyo.  At that time I was in my office and I saw the cracks being created on the walls in real time and nobody couldn't leave the building because it was in Omotesando. The risk to be killed by the cracked shop windows was very high... Oh, geez! I prayed all the known Gods. And then... The Fukushima disaster... So I decided to quit everything...  Thank you Japan for the great experience (with highs and lows) but we Europeans are not ready to deal with these disasters. Especially if your Country is surrounded by Mediterranean sea (so peaceful). I'm from Rome... I'll never-ever leave my Country anymore (except for tourism or some business trips).  We all should value the merits of our countries, too!  Just my 2 cents. Peace and love!
Never heard anything about this on the news (USA).
March 22, just saw this and my heart broke for you mate. Lots of Aussie love coming to you from the USA
I wish you the best and am sorry this happened, you've made bad days infinitely better since I found you. I hope everything bounces back for you <3
I remember feeling like that in 2011 and I was just in Chiba
Living up in the mountains of North Carolina, I have only ever felt one earthquake in my 36 years of living, and it was BARELY even able to be felt at all, just a little vibration. So I couldn't imagine something like this.
All the best to you and everyone in Japan.
Chris, I’m so sorry about your studio. That’s awful! But the best news is that you and everyone you know is safe.
Damn, that is quite a bit of damage and, yeah, hearing that water dripping is quite concerning so hoping you're able to get someone over there to fix it quickly.  I can't say I know the fear of being in an earthquake myself as I've only ever been in 2 my in my whole life, the most recent one being about week ago and so small I pretty much slept through it, it only slightly shaking my windows, so I'm not going to pretend I know how it must've felt being in the earthquake.  My best wishes to you, Sharla, Natsuki and everyone during this time and all the best getting everything back in order
I am honestly surprised with such a large earthquake the damage wasn't much worse.
Dang that’s crazy
Aww 😢 I’m just glad you’re safe Chris 💕
Glad you are ok Chris and Crew!
As someone who lived in Tokyo during the great 3/11 disaster - this is eerily similar. Glad you're ok.
hmm never thought about it this way but apparently one of my teenage parties had the effect of a 7.4 earthquake.
@ 0:10 why does it look like a missile strike?
So sorry that happened to you, bro. That is sickening and saddening to see such waste laid to the studio.
I’m sorry to hear what you’ve been through
Glad nobody got hurt
All this hard work... gone... just like that. I feel so bad
I hope you're doing alright Chris. You should keep the cat. I remember some kind of tradition where broken things are repaired with gold? Mabey you could do that?
Oh my, I wish you all the luck, Chris! :(
0:09 the fuck was that light?
Could have done a whole video series of gluing your stuff back together. "This episode brought to you by Crazy Larry's glue-like substance. We can't call it Glue, so don't ask."
I was genuinely upset to see the studio all fucked up like that. Chris seemed so pleased with it, and it really was gorgeous. Glad everyone was alright though, that's the most important thing.
So glad you all are safe. Sucks to lose things and have to clean up, but very glad you all are ok. Hope everyone in Japan is ok from the Earthquake. Blessings.
NOOOOOOOOO THE STUFIO THE STORE AND THE RAMEN CAFE NOOOOOO
If an earthquake like this happend in the UK, a lot of stuff is going down.
0:10 what was that light?
Time to get secured shelving & tye / glue everything down.
Glad that everyone is safe. But please take this as an opportunity to secure everything for the future. Don't pretend like something can't happen because clearly it can. (Hope for the best plan for the Worst.)
Connor be like: MY JOJO!!!!
Looks and sounds like a regular Speedcore party  Daaamn i miss it..
This is why I don't live in JP. The safest place on earth where people don't raid your house, nature does.
Maaan he really liked that new studio
Dude. Kintsugi that meneki neko. That will restore you on a spiritual level.
You could do a episode on Kintsugi during which you repair your favorite maneko neko with gold.
I visited Japan and Kobe in '95.  I know there's psychological upset.  Be gentle :)  I'm glad that new buildings are built to a stricter code.  That's reassuring.  I'm glad you were in one of those new buildings.  Your maneki neko can be replaced :)  I'll keep an eye out here - you're probably going to be flooded with them.
Chris now says 'like' a lot. He got that from Conor. No worries
Do a Kintsugi with the cat figure!
Sorry for you and all in Japan, although least you know you have good friends coming to support you. Thats more important than Stuff at the end of the day.
Hopes and prayers for all those affected
Seeing the Studio broken hurt me too, I am glad you and your friends are safe!!!!!!
I feel emotional about the studio and it isn't even mine 😭 I'm hoping you guys can get back to normal soon! So sorry that happened to you.
I can't fathom how scary that must've been, and how heartbreaking to open the door to your dream studio in shambles like that. So glad you're safe!
Hope you all are ok
nooooo
Duuuuuude, glad you're safe.
Chin up Vhris.... you've come so far and though its a bummer to go through what your going through the "broad" in abroad in japan is still alive and well, so too will everything else be! Best regards mate
Where were you when the earthquake happened?
I feel for you. You just basically completed the ramen shop build and got it the way you wanted it and now this.  I live in Tornado Alley in Kansas, but so far I’ve managed to avoid that “ I’m gonna die now” moment, but the way you said it, I know you caught a serious scare. Best wishes for a speedy recovery process!
Things can be fixed and replaced, but you guys can't be. I'm so glad you guys are all well other than stressed
Earthquakes are horifying experience that I have also had and I might say you are extremelly lucky. This building looks intact. All the items and souveneers are nothing as a loss compare to loosing your home or life or survive by a miracle but severy ingured and homeless. So this building looks quite safe after I saw there is not even cracks on the walls.  In my case, with magnitute 6.8 my building survived but at the cost of shifted walls, cracks everywhere, damaged main columns of the whole building and totally demolished roof. And I thought I was lucky to still have a home...
A little kintsugi here and there and you’re good as gold!
Holy crap!  I think it's time to "Earthquake Proof" my office.  I've got a ton of bookshelves and it would be total chaos if those items came down.  I hope you get your office squared away soon.
Pretty glad you are safe
That looked like a 10 on the rectum scale. Max pucker
It sucks this happened so shortly after you built the studio, but at least everyone is okay. You can always rebuild.
Really glad you're all ok, not great news to see the studio in such chaos, but on the bright side, you're all alive and well, and it could have been much....much worse, looks like there's just a bit of cleaning and a bit of fixing needed but over all, just happy to know you're all safe <3  Best wishes to the lovely people of Japan, stay strong guys <3
Where I live we don't have earthquakes, but, once every 100 years we're supposed to have huge one, about 8 on the Richter scale. Soon the 100 year are due, and I'm genuinely scared. If this what 7.3 looks like in a country that's used to them, in here it will be devastating, I fear for massive casualties when it happens.
Yea this one woke me up, thankfully I'm over in Kanagawa so it was ~3.0 for JMA scale. After the preshocks I felt it go for about 10 seconds and knew right away that this was a big one. Thankfully the largest I've experienced was the March quakes last year when i was over at Narita airport picking up some folks.
You should get the Maneki Neko 招き猫 reassembled with Kintsugi (金継ぎ) to memorialise the earthquake. It will bring it back more beautifully (arguably) than before and keep it as a good keepsake.. Hope the overall damage cost wasn’t too high and your building’s insurance / or personal covered it 🙏
Stuff can be replaced, as long as you're safe thats all that matters.  Sorry this happened tho. :<
As someone from a sismic country, I'm really glad you're ok. The material things, although difficult, can be recovered. I know you're shaken up, I wish you tranquility in these days so you can recover mentally.
Such heartbreaking, to see the studio like that, hope you recover soon Chris
Did you have insurance? If not, then where's your patreon?
Tohoku always gets hit by earthquakes, I am glad I moved out
Come on you have to Kintsugi (金継ぎ, "golden joinery"), also known as kintsukuroi (金繕い, "golden repair") the lucky cat
Come back stronger brother.
Glad that you're safe! 😥
I hope everyone is safe over there. My thoughts are with you guys. I didn't know about this till now.
Giving the manekineko the kintsugi treatment might be pretty cool
Magnitude was around 4 here in Tokyo . We do often has similar earthquake coming from Chiba . Hope you are doing well .
In my country nobody knew or talked about the Japan earthquake not even the news it seems the only thing that matters now is Ukraine they completely stopped talking about coronavirus too , something weird is happening
it was indeed a big one. Almost lost half my whisky bottle shelf. Being in north kanto we always get the worse these days. Still, that one was not even close to the 2011 one. That one was absolutely unbelievable. It is hard to describe. The buildup, the ominous low rumbling sound before all hell broke loose, the power, the LENGTH, so slow uncomfortable waving as it slowed down. And the nuclear meltdown. After a really big one, the medium ones seem laughable so that's a positive for you! Hope things get sorted out for you and glad you and yours are safe. cheers.
Studio can always be fixed!!! At the very least... You are safe and sound... Take care, Chris.
Actually a few days ago my country also get hit by an earthquake, my school was in the middle of a test and suddenly the ground start moving and everyone is panicking and screaming hiding bellow a table. I also took advantage of that incident to see my friend answers.
Sorry that happened to your "stuff" but hey, it's just stuff! I felt sad to see you be emotional over "things" that just don't matter in the end eh? Turn it around and use this as an opportunity to become a minimalist, you will be happier as a result. Break your consumerism habit folks, the planet will thank you.
Glad to know you and your team are safe!
I don't recommend watching the intro on 2x speed.
Could have been worse, you could have been an anime figure collector
Thank god you are safe
I know this doesn‘t help but I do feel really sorry and hope the damages weren‘t too severe. I‘m just very glad you‘re at least bodily unharmed, at the end of the day that‘s the most important
I've felt a few of Japan's recent "big ones" and nothing is as scary and as humbling. It's truly scary at a base and instinctual level. A missile or lightning strike is over immediately. A flood or typhoon you can prepare for. A pandemic is an ongoing struggle. But an earthquake? They just *happen* and all you can do is hold on and hope that mother nature has not decided to kill you that day while your world literally falls down around you.  It's *scary.*
I’m sure you’ve already looked into it. But please do be careful handling anything near that water before having an electrician come out first. There could be live wires and you don’t want to get anyone hurt!
Keep Safe
Glad you’re ok. That must have been terrifying! Hope everyone is doing ok x
I'd truly like to help with the cost of repair. Could u set up a crowd funding, so those who want to help might be able to help?
It's additionally scary when it happens during the dead of night while you are sleeping and the violent shaking wakes you up abruptly, your mind still hazy and still processing what is happening, then the power goes off plunging you into darkness
I'm happy that you're ok
how come when you said oh fu*k but the sub said oh god?
Always look at the positives... At least it wasn't GODZILLA !!!!!!
I don't know why but I was under the impression Chris lived in the same place as the studio/ramen shop . Seeing the wreckage, I'm so glad he doesn't.
Japanese earthquakes have a thing for mid march huh
glad you're safe there mate
Glad you are ok, Chris! That’s really scary! Thanks for your great content! It really helps me learn Japanese and the culture of Japan! 本当に感謝します!
Glad you are ok!!! This earthquake was not a joke. One question though, do you know that you can use a bucket instead of plastic bag?
So sorry to see this happen to you Chris, I hope the water did not cause too much damage? If you managed to find all the pieces of your Maneki-Neko, it would be a great opportunity to try out some Kintsugi
Terrifying? It was awesome!
It does not actually look too bad
I’m not experienced with earthquakes and where I was (Zama), it was a 4.3. I really feel for those that were closer to the epicenter. I hope you guys and everyone else are able to quickly recover!
Much love to you!! The most important thing is you are all ok !!!!
I’m sorry to hear 😢. Hope the rebuilding process is successful 👍🏻
As long as everyone is safe that's the main thing, Equipment and "things" can be replaced, I really hope everyone is alright!! ❤ That sounds absolutely terrifying, and my heart goes out to everyone who was impacted
If you don’t click the power switch, there wouldn’t be any moment of truth…. Just kidding, hopefully the rebuilding will be quick and painless
Oh and we thought a mag 6 was bad lol
I guess Eren really started the Rumbling.
Are you Japanese fluent?
If you find all the peices to your lucky cat, you could get a Kintsugi kit to fill the cracks with gold.
Glad u r safe!
Glad you are safe!
Hope you stay safe. You could try to fix your broken ceramic with gold, the japanese technique 'Kintsugi"
The fact you can hear the impact this had on Chris in his voice is really heartbreaking. Hes always got such a calm and collected voice, but you can tell just how shaken up he is from the earthquake and seeing the state of his studio… Ive only ever experienced one teeny tiny earthquake, but Ive been in some pretty bad wind storms and a EF 4 tornado before and thats scary. I cant imagine how an earthquake must feel, though I know the New Madrid fault, which is sort of near me, has been overdue for a decent sized one for quite some time now.
Oh no, not the ceramic greeting cat and china set! Those were the best parts!
Heart-wrenching... it is true sadness seeing all your hard work in pieces... But I am glad you and your friends are okay... take it to heart life is more important then a cracks Ramen Bowl... Be safe over there ^_^
😨😓❤️🙏❤️
man stay safe i hope the afterschocks arent as bad
Shit. I feel for you
I heard about this vaguely on the news, and sort of hand waved it away, thinking it was pretty small and was just making headlines because it was the same place as the 2011 earthquake. Seeing this gives me some perspective now. Thanks, Chris. And stay safe. And like you say in your comment, what a blessing that you live in such a developed country where you can get help in situations like this. Looking forward to more content, and hoping the studio can be repaired without breaking the bank.
I was *VERY* near the 5.3 earthquake of Salt Lake City.  I was in South Jordan the city right above SLC, so I understand.  I hope you are doing ok and I hope things get better.
И в этом тоже Русские виноваты?
Damn seeing this happened, im more grateful now that my country is safe from most natural disasters
This is sad but glad everyone is ok! Hope to see the Ramen shop restored to it's former or upgraded glory. All the best guys!
Take it easy, man. When the september ‘17 earthquake hit Mexico my área wasnt that affected, but still it can mess with your head.
Gaaah really teary-eyed watching this. I know you can bounce back from this. But there's so much love put into it... heartbreaking. Wishing you and your team a good recovery.
When you're neighbors having sex be like :
The cat should be fixed with kintsugi its traditional Japanese technique
You show the reality of what that earthquake did to a home. I was in Japan as a teen, and not much frightened me. My mom was knocked out of bed by an earthquake the first weekend we moved into our house. I don’t remember that, but my mom mentioned it enough that it became a memory.
I’m so glad you guys are safe, I’m so sorry about the studio and generally having to go through this. Hang in there 😥
be safe Chris, that's absolutely terrifying
Hope everything gets cleaned up OK. At least you don't have the mould issues to worry about with the concrete like in the Australian floods.
So sorry. Thankfully, you are okay.
deserved
That really sucks this was the coolest studio on YouTube
I'm so sorry that you all went through such a frightening situation, but I'm glad you are ok. Sending good energy your way 💫
All I can say is unlucky mate, and I’m not being funny, I genuinely mean it’s just unlucky nothing you could’ve done, you never know when these sorts of things can happen, It’s actually mental when you stop and think about it.
Oh man!!! I really hope the water thing was not a major problem!!! But it's great to see that the team is doing well and Natsuki is safe too!! What about Natsuki's shop?? All good too? Maybe a second part of the recovery of everyday people would be good, maybe with some cameo by Ken!? I don't know, just an idea:)
I am glad you are doing fine. That's the most important part.
how did I not even hear about this
kintsugi the whole studio 😭✨
Wow, so much destruction only for an 7.4 Earthquake? That's weird =O
What’s that big flash of light ?
I wish you can get over this bad situation soon ! The world needs more Abroad in Japan!
That sucks about your studio man but I'm glad you're alright!
If an earthquake hit, Japan is the first and only country i’d like to be in. I’d feel so much safer there.
I told this to my friend once the last time we had an earthquake in Canada I couldn’t felt led to where I was but I told her I never knew the earth can 😳orgasm like that 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Last time I felt the earthquake is when I was in St. Lucia with my mom and her sister my aunt it wasn’t too bad or just a little vibration😅
I’m glad people are OK it’s a shame your studio took a big hit😅
You can imagine what type of what dream the earth had to shake that much relief🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Chris is gonna be Abroad in Debt once he fixes his studio
I just moved to Tokyo in January and this was my first ever earthquake, luckily I’m far enough away that I didn’t even realize it was Japan’s worst in 10 years 😱
Glad you're safe
Good to hear you and the others are OK! Hope the recovery effort goes well for the affected areas. Surprised there wasn't more damage to the set at that magnitude!
So sorry about your studio.  You worked so hard on planning that all out.  I am glad all of you are okay.  That was so scary to see.  I hope you all get things back in order soon.
Oh so sad. But, glad you are all safe.
Glad you are safe my friend!
So glad you're okay. Things are just things. I hope the worst is over. Stay safe out there!
I was in Christchurch, New Zealand for there big earthquake, they are very terrifying
Thoughts and prayers
I hope everyone is doing ok and staying safe.
Oh man... the studio :c
I’m so sorry to see this Chris, you’ve been so proud of your new studio and it’s really sad to see the damage. Sending lots of love
On the plus side, the water and bit of debris really adds to the "back alley ramen shop" vibe? Glad y'all are safe.
🫣😮‍💨
They have had 7.3 so while this was technically biggest, its more of meh.
Im glad and happy that everyone is good and oke there. Stay safe please
Im happy that the tsunami didnt hit too
So sorry your studio got damaged, I'm glad you and your friends stayed safe!!
Studio can be replaced but Chris abroad can not. Glad your ok mate
Am glad your all ok hope things can get sorted soon the earthquake left everyone shaken up is from the uk really feel sorry for everyone stay safe guys xxx
Madde geri gelir canlı gelmez buna şükür
I was worried about the set when this happened...I cant imagine how u felt. Im so sorry Chris! 🥲 Hope it gets better soon! I'd help clean up if I were there 🙋‍♂️
So sorry to see your studio messed up like that after so soon after you got it, but glad it's not worse than it is. I hope the aftershocks have stopped by now.
Just built that studio!!! :-(
Take care of yourself, Chris! The studio will be repaired and you're still gonna create kick-ass content outta it.
I'm glad that you're well. I have been in Japan and I live in California. Both places are known for their earthquakes, so I can relate. All the best and I hope that you're up and running soon!
Chris + Abroad in Japan Family - Our family is sending positive vibes to you- thank you for sharing this clip.  We heard about the quake and were surprised at the total lack of earthquake coverage - yes other things are happening right now but still - we live just north of the Golden Gate Bridge so we assumed we would hear more as we live with earthquakes as you do.  You really have created something special with your art and learning about how people live all over the world just makes us all better people.  Your art is so important - I'm not a good commenter - just THANK YOU and TAKE CARE.  Lulu
This is utterly heartbreaking to watch, hope everyone is staying safe x
Hope you're insured!
I moved to California after the worst had already hit in the late 80s. My brother was in SAR (Search and Rescue) when the Tohoku Earthquake hit. He rescued bodies (dead or alive) from the wreckage, and offered food relief. Earthquakes are a harsh reality in the Pacific. Building codes need to be updated. I'm glad you're safe, sir. You can always rebuild the small damages.
At least you weren't shooting  there when it happened, glad you're okay.  When you did the studio reveal video, I was thinking about earthquake readiness, and how dangerous it is if there's a quake when you're in the middle of shooting. But now that this has happened,  do you think there is a way  to make it more safe? Especially the middle wall part.
I think it's time for the cat to enjoy some Kintsugi ^^ Glad you're okay !
Pleased to see you're all OK, sorry to see your Ramen Shop damaged, but at least no one hurt.
devastating to see the studio like this :(( Hopefully it can be repaired!!!!
Very scary, hope you are alright.   Let's all pray
I still remember the 2011 one when I lived in Japan.  Everything shook before the big one and then it shook more when we had the big one.  My friend actually lived in Sendai and the city etc lost power, she had to move into the school for a week or more as they had makeshift camps etc.  It was a lot worse.  Fun fact I learnt as well: Japan has its own richter scaler.  or rather its own scale (just like its own calendar).  You will always encounter earthquakes in Japan; stay safe!
Much love from Rochester, NY - so glad you were not injured - take care with the water and electricity please!  Mold is toxic to people and starts growing immediately.  I know you’ve heard it before.  Love to all the people who went through that with you.
I feel the horrible feelings with you... lots of work to get the studio back to working order and many lots items that you had emotional attachment to. Maybe a minor good thing: Rebuilding the studio will let you produce a few videos that will be unique.
Oh no, I was just discovering your new studio with couples of videos from Connor n Joey, now after watching this update i feel so bad, thank God you guys are safe 🙏
Shocking. Hope you are well
The scientists say the big one will come. The question is when?
I hope everyone is okay! Stay safe and sending hugs! That earthquake looks terrifying...
im glad to hear that you are ok mate, stay safe.
ayo the light blast at 0:09? id think it was a nuke setting off afar
omg this is depressing but glad you're all ok
Had wondered if worth doing some Kintsugi with some of the broken items if you are able to retrieve all the pieces, it can be quite beautiful Really sorry for this event, seemed so scary and so sad to see what happened to the Ramen shop where a lot of passion went in!
Yeah! I second what others are saying :) Learn some kintsugi to fix the cat
Stay safe and I wish for the best!!!
I was thinking about this video about a week ago then I see this (( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xoGmqNLyr4&ab_channel=DarksideofJapanYuki
Damn, tragic
Hey bro I really hope you are doing well 🙏 and I hope everyone is doing well as well
I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'm glad you and everyone else is safe.
Thats awful.. Im glad to see your okay, Chris
Yeah those aftershocks are a nightmare... It genuinely took me a year to get over just the slightest tremor when the last big one hit Japan.
I'm very grateful you and the trash taste  boys are ok 👍
Glad you are OK. Greetings from Colombia 🇨🇴.
As a chilean  girl... you made me remember our 8.8 eq back in 2010, I know how scary and disastrous it can get :( we had no electricity nor water for weeks! I 'm glad you're ok!!!!
i just recently watched the video of you showcasing the studio. made me really heart broken seeing all the ceramics smashed to pieces. man.... glad you're okay Chris
@0:09 it legitimately looks like something smashed into Japan from the sky.
Glad to know you guys are all ok. Sorry for the losses but they were material. I’m once again just really glad you are all fine.
nooo not the new studio
ever figure out where the water came from?
Make the manekineko into a cyborg to fit the scene even better!
Chris - so sorry about all of the damage. You will recover from this and I am glad that you are safe.
Probably the most expensiv content you ever made 😬
This is a good reality check. That was also the first time I ever felt terror from an earthquake. And I was alive during the Northridge earthquake in California.
Kintsugi (金継ぎ, "golden joinery"), also known as kintsukuroi (金繕い, "golden repair"),[1] is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum; the method is similar to the maki-e technique.[2][3][4] As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.[5]
is there someplace to donate to help you pay for rebuilding and fixing of the studio? with all the fun and joy i have gotten from your videos even as a more sorta casual watcher, i would be happy to help, and im sure others who watch would too.
Had you are ok 👍🏻
Glad you're ok, and live in a building that can handle earthquakes....my literal first thought when I heard about the earthquake was wondering how well you and the trash taste guys handled it.  Although you're the only one who has posted any vids about it so far!
Chris, your heart must be torn to shreds but thanks for putting up a good face for us.
This is so sad, couldn’t of happened to a nicer YouTuber. Ffs, hope everything gets sorted. Best of luck from Brum
I'm glad you and your friends are safe mate. Hope others affected are okay too. Stay safe guys.
My heart goes out to you and i hope that you and your studio are going to be okay. Its awful that you all had to go through that kind of earthquake. Thank you for all your videos you utter legend. Im sure i speak for all of when i say that your ramen shop was so beautiful and it will be again.  rip little makineko, i hope he can be fixed along with everything else.
Oh, shit! I hope everything turns out okay after the aftershocks!!! Good lord! I hope everybody is okay. I heard about a number of deaths and of course injuries, but not the numbers I was expecting (THANK GOODNESS!). People over there seemed to have figured things out for the most part (except for abandoning the islands altogether...).      I mean, you are in Japan. It is, in fact, one of the most geologically active places on Earth...
Maybe make like a resin cube with the cat inside and shards flying off... That would probably look cool and safe a bit of the memory
Shaky
so sorry chris ):
stay safe and good luck with the cleanup efforts afterwards, will keep you guys and japan in our prayers!
OMG the scenes of the earthquake with bright flashes in the skyline, I can't even imagine what kind of explosions those are but I'm glad you and your friends are ok. I hope the studio is insured but I'm sure it will recover. If the maneki neko is not replaceable, it doesn't look to hard too fix IMO.  Unfortunately earthquakes are a part of life in Japan, and I remembered among the madness of preparing for the first trip there, I had a discussion with my partner on what to do in the event of an earthquake.
I’m going to make my own studio as well and yours is one of my inspiration, then some minutes ago I came again to your “ramen” studio, wow.. I didn’t realise that it was an earthquake some days ago and now I’m watching this video, really it breaks my heart. I feel sorry for this happened to you. But I’m sure everything will be back soon. Ganbatte Chris! ❤️✨🙏🏼
Natural disasters are such a steep price to pay to live in such a unique place 🙏🏻 prayers for all those affected
I totally feel you, Chris. I experienced a massive earthquake back in 2017 here in Mexico City and I could sincerely relate when you said that it was the first time you actually thought you were going to die. It's a very traumatizing experience, and the fact that it's collective makes it very different from other bad life experiences. But living in a place with so much seismic activity has taught me that you have to trust that whatever you built once, you can rebuild. As long as you and your loved ones are OK, the rest will eventually come back and sometimes even better. I send you a huge hug and I promise that the unertainty and fear that you feel right now will eventually pass.
Really sorry that this happened Chris. We felt realty sad about the damage to your amazing studio so I can only imagine what you and your team must have felt.   Best wishes and much love from Romford, UK.
Just gets the studio and the earth destroyed it. 😔
All Japanese people should migrate to US for good
the Sad thing is the earthquakes are only going to get worse from here on.
Hey Chris, really good that you and the others are fine. Hope you can get the studio that you worked so hard for back in the best condition possible. And than you all can have a after earthquake studio party together. Honestly i would love to fly over and help. Keep on going chris
Wtf. Well done Sir. I love your typical English man reaction.glad you're ok xD
Damn bro!!!! Iat least you were not hurt .. glad you are safe
F
As someone who's just had a water pipe in the attic drip and ruin everything inside the drywall underneath it, that dripping water sound triggered me. Hope you don't have to repair any soggy walls or get any mold.
Glad everyone and your studio are okay. I was in the middle of the Northridge Quake in California in '94 - it felt like a steam locomotive ran through our bedroom. My studio was 3 feet deep in books, and the kitchen had the delightful combination smell of soy sauce, Lee and Parrins worcestershire, and catsup from the broken bottles thrown out of the cupboards.  It took a year to really get over the trauma - you don't realize it's there until a year goes by.  Take care of yourself.
I was in Nagoya and even here it felt like i was on a boat. It was crazy
Glad you're safe lovey things can be replaced but as long as You're all ok then you can continue making and living happily!
I’m sorry you had to go through this bud. I live in a hurricane area and I can understand.
Glad everyone is ok. Glad there was alot to selvage out of the wreckage. Maybe the Lucky cat was protecting. Those lucky cats are pretty awesome. I don't think that cat will be majorly expensive. But possibly not cheap either. My guess is 2000-6000¥ on Amazon assuming the price range in Japan is similar to Canada. Hope the rest of Japan is as fortunate as you and your cast. God Bless 🙏.
Glad to know that you're all OK. Sorry to hear about the studio. It did nicely demonstrate what becomes of a ramen shop after a major earthquake in the Tohoku.
Unless you had an off-camera meltdown you handled this far better than i would have
well that's tragic
Glad you're okay and that your main money maker, your ugly mug, is still in pristine condition.
😭😭😭
im glad you guys are safe
Oh wow. Glad you're all safe.
Video idea: try your hand at kintsugi
Really scary.  Glad you are OK Chris!
Glad all of you are well ❤
I hope the water issue was fixed. Glad everybody is OK.
I’m sorry man. Glad your safe, but I hope the studio can get fixed!!! Stay safe
Holy shit. I would have been terrified. I've only experienced one bad earthquake my whole life and it was nothing like that
sad to see your studio and its not touch on wood its "Knock on wood." any way hope you get back on your feed.
Glad you were safe, really sucks about the studio :(
Chris saying hi and waving hi from San Francisco!! I thik\nk we are next!!!
I thought it was a BBC channel
Biggest earthquake in 10 years??? But February 2021 also Fukushima prefecture have earthquake too magnitude 7.3....
Glad everyone was safe. Take care.
Glad you guys are ok
I pray for all of you to be safe!
can you do a video on Kuril Islands?  "The Kuril Islands dispute, known as the Northern Territories dispute in Japan, is a territorial dispute between Japan and the Russian Federation over the ownership of the four southernmost Kuril Islands. "
Aw man, I'm so sorry. I hope you get it fixed soon and even better.
This pains me.
Oh no that's really awful to see, i hope everyone is ok and everything gets back to normal for you all over there soon 🙁
pretty much the aftermaths of a bar fight....with ghosts fighting.....
im glad you're ok chris!
I expected more damage honestly. Lots of things still standing. Physics works in funny ways.
Man this was so sad, glad you all are okay.
Mate this is heartbreaking, I’m so sorry this happened. My first thought when I saw this was I wish I was there so I could come help you guys clear up and get shit sorted. Hope all is well now, much love from Essex 🇬🇧.
Awwww, poor unlucky kitty. 😟 I agree with ThioJoe, and hope you get it all sorted out soon!
wowww that was so scary. Im glad your ok I really feel sorry for everyone in Japan. We are lucky here it just flooded and made a mess here in brisbane.
I'm so sorry about your studio! Hopefully you manage to fix everything soon! Definitely true it could've been a lot worse
Here I was thinking my room is a mess! Glad you're all safe.
Earthquakes are just one of the reminders of what our Earth is capable of. Hoping you keep safe. You got off lucky, what about all the people who died and lost everything. I think if I lived through one Id be moving home..Best of everything for you . You have the right attitude to get you through this.
That's a beautiful studio! I'm glad you're ok at least.
So sorry Chris :(  Sending love ❤️ I hope you're doing alright
You could plant something in the broken cat statue, would both be symbolic and cool-looking,.
You are truly Japanese in that you didn't say, "I'm leaving --- mou kaero kana?!?"  *Best wishes!*
I hate that your studio stuff is a mess but I am so glad to see that all of yall are safe and ok.
glad your ok
Glad you are ok , have suggestion , put together a wall collage of some of your favorite things or have a ceramic artist repair the kitty. Let yourself get artistic about repairing some of your stuff. Really love your studio and how it reflects your personality. Have a wall  reflecting the earthquake in art the below it have. A one finger salute.
Damn! Glad you're not/ weren't seriously injured. Hopefully life for you and Japan returns to normal relatively soon?!
peace to you
It's such a shame, I feel like you've just opened the studio. >.< Hopefully, not much oerall pricey damage!
Fix the cat.
Good thing I’m a minimalist if a Earthquake happens, I got barely nothing on walls or any items. Just good old bed, couch & the t.v is on the floor. Uhhh what else.
😥 Plastic utensils and crockery for the meantime. That's what we use in SF. Sorry this happened to you. Hope everything turns out ok for you and everyone in Japan.
Glad you're okay Chris! I would be terrified for sure..
Something fell from Heaven. The Flash of Light - Look at it at 0.25s speed! I saw Satan fall like Lighting?
I'm quite used to earthquakes, but experiencing a large one is still terrifying. Glad the damage wasn't that bad, all things considered.
Please tell me nothing happened to the "Jumping - Pounding the Rock" cap!!
No nuclear melt downs no Tsunami's you all are OK that's what counts I belive there is a lot of YouTube Content here as well. when life hands you lemons make lemonade Look forward to watching video updates of you preparing your studio.
Aww the lucky cat is missing an ear and maybe an arm but SHE STILL LIVES!! This is a good omen! Yay!
shit man, hope you guys are ok!
Maybe you should leave Japan (you said once you interviewed that actor you would be done). Maybe it's a sign you should be off. Maybe go to China, or South Korea.
It’s so nice that u had Natsuki and some other people coming with u. Hope you guys are safe and plz take care! Chris, I don’t think any of us would hate you for not posting for a while! Take care of your body and your mental health my big boy❤️ Natsuki you too! ❤️❤️
Holy shit dude I'm sorry your cool studio got ruined and I'm glad your ok
Kintsuki your neko :)
Had to like this video twice so i could dislike it..
I know it might not be your jam but fwiw I'd throw a few bucks at a GoFundMe to help with the repairs. I know there's a lot of damage in the entire region, so you might not be comfortable with that, but if you wanted to, I'd be willing, at least!
Good luck!
I am sorry about this. I recently started watching your channel, and I was so excited when you revealed this studio.  I am glad you're alright, and always remember human life/health is most important.  Please stay positive and keep trucking brother, I really appreciate your content and I hope you keep going for as long as possible.
Better yet - do the thing where you fix the broken pieces with gold for the maneki neko.
Glad to see your all safe! The damage could have always been worse, hope you can get your set back in shape soon!
Glad you're all safe and sound <3
So sorry to see the new studio trashed like that. I hope that leak gets fixed quick. What is insurance like over there for earthquakes?
This crushed me. Chris, you may have handled it better than I would’ve. Your new place was a get away for all of us, and we all felt apart of it. Seen earthquake videos, but never had personal attachment. Your lost was a personal attachment to all your viewers. With you all the way buddy!
Glad you're all safe  <3
You have no paper towels to wipe up all the stuff.. Sad.
I’m am glad everyone is alright. All the best with the damages. Take care, We hope for the best.
looks like the ramen shop corner want to be used as cooking corner instead of just as props chris
Your lucky neko kept you safe by giving you its good luck.  I'm glad all of you guys are doing okay after that earthquake.  U look forward to your Japan vids
仙台の映像、なにかが爆発したみたいに見えるけどなんだろう。。
Has anyone been down in one of those deep parking garages during an earthquake? I've been in the ones in Taipei and it freaks me out just being down there knowing a quake can come at any time.
As soon as I got the notification of the earthquake,  I thought of you!
yea, kinda better to put fragile items in closed cupboard when not in use rather than open space especially in japan
With how hyped Chris felt about setting up the studio, it's super sad to see the damage. A setback but thankfully he's safe nonetheless.
Happy you're safe, a studio can be rebuilt. Stay safe and more success to you!
It might be cool to repair the cat using kintsugi?
With all that happened in the past 25-40 years there in Japan, you did not earthquake proof most of the studio, why?
Hi Chris! I'm really glad you are ok. Seems lately the world is a little bit more crazy than usual. Everything on the studio is replaceable but you and your friends aren't.
Aww Chris, this all sucks so bad. Can tell you're trying to hold back emotions and really hope you get it sorted and back on track soon.
I was watching someone's livestream when the earthquake started, luckily everything was fine for them
That must be really scary! 😱 So sorry to see the damages in your studio. I hope you’re able to rebuild soon. Stay safe 🙏🏼
Aw man. Glad you are safe. Hope you figure out the water part. The studio otherwise actually looked like it survived pretty well outside of many items falling and shattering, which sucks of course.
Glad to see you are ok. Just some sweat at scrubbing the studio, and a well-deserved dinner, and life will be as usual.
This is heart breaking, but at least everyone is well, which is most important ... stuff can be replaced, people not
I am sorry to hear that your studio was damaged.  The bright spot in all of this is that you are okay.  Thankfully the damage isn't as bad as it could have been.  You will have that ramen shop back up in no time!  I wish you the best. 👍
Sorry to hear that, I can't imagine that. Sending much love from Serbia!!!!!!! Stay safe!!!
Be well Chris.
Chris: I have a new studio setup. Earthquake: bzzzzt..
Safe is the most important thing good luck！
:(((
Besides the material damages, at least you are ok. 🙂
Hope you fall on your feet guy, love your videos
Damn.. That made me really sad.. :( I wish you the best!
Fortunately, that neko is *very* replaceable. That mess on your floor, here in California we call that "salad" when an earthquake essentially takes everything in the room and throws it in a pile on the floor.
Thank God you are safe Chris, i didn't even know about this earthquake before your video here :/  I hope for a speedy recovery for all of Japan, knowing that they are a tough and hard working people i know that things will be back to normal in no time!
0:08 this might be a dumb question but what was that flash?
Wish you and all well!
Damn man..... I'm so sorry for your loss 😔
You this party's lit man 🤩🔥
Thanks for sharing! I've never been in an earthquake before, but my girlfriend lives in Sendai, and I am really worried about her! I had an idea: If you saved the shards of your ceramic cat (Maneki Neko), it would be wonderful to use the "Kintsugi" technique to try and repair the figure. Not only is it beautiful, it could serve a strong symbolic message of recovery, and so on~
Glad you and all your friends are safe. you can rebuild. keep your chin up!
you  can glue  the cat !!
Damn that is nuts.. Glad you guys are alright. Stuff can be replaced, people cant.. Hang in there man, on the upside, maybe some vid ideas.. Going around interviewing people about the situation and talk to some engineers about how they make the buildings earthquake resistant..
Stuff can be replaced- you, and Natsuki, and Sharla cannot be. Glad to see you're all OK, however shaken.
0:11 what was that light?
The important thing is that you, Natsuki and everyone else are still alive.
My suggestion is find all the pieces of your beloved cat and get kintsugi done on it! It took a tumble and mostly survived and if done right will make it even better :3
Glad to hear you're safe and that the studio isn't totally lost!  A real shame about what was lost but I hope you will find plenty of cool things to replace what was lost <3  Hope cleanup goes well and that no one was hurt!
man.. that fish was big!
You should try repairing some of your broken trinkets with that art style in Japanese culture where broken or cracked items are repaired with gold or other precision metals. There is probably someone in Japan who could teach you about it or show you how but maybe with a cheaper media (ex aluminum or gold paint)
Oh no~!! I'm so glad no one was in there when that happened! Such a major shame, all that damage and water... But glad to see y'all are ok and that it may be mostly fixable... :x <3
Build Back Better Chris!
Literally every earthquake in Japan: has epicenter off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture. Nuclear power plant engineers: it's free real estate.
My friend, I spent 25 years in Japan and it is the land of earthquakes. If you plan on staying, get accustomed to it.
Thats a lot of damage.
as soon as u clena it up u will return with a better studio than before for sure! the important thing that u are ok, that everyone is ok! and as we are foreigners in the country with mose earthquakes we dont know how a big one will impact our stuff and what to do to prevent such things because we cant think we have until we experience one for ourselves
This may be a great moment to ask if fans would like to send you stuff for your studio.  Don't think anything else would better represent the channel, than fans contributing to your studio!
As strange as this might sound, I think this eartquake in a way adds more soul to the Abroad in Japan Studio, if that makes sense. No wonder were some of the mentality the japanese kintsugi art tradition originates from.
Hi Chris, look into buying something like museums putty, museums wax, quake hold etc. I use it to fixate things so that my cats are not throwing decoration down shelfs Its sad to see the studio like that, try it! Should save you some future heart break for all this cool and interesting decorations
I am so glad that you and everyone are okay. It sucks what happened to your studio, and especially having to reinvest all that time and money into things. But I am grateful that you are safe and well!
How did natsukis san salon do post quake? Hope he faired up ok considering.
I cried for you if you didn't cry Chris :(( I hope your stuff isn't too broken, I'm sorry about the kitty decoration :(( <3
Just glad to see and hear you are all okay! I think some of the stuff from your studio have a lot of character now, and hope you don’t toss a lot of it out! F in the comments for your studio, good luck with the clean up!
Why not use a mop?
Is there any kind of insurance you have to help cover this?
This is honestly terrifying. It's one of my biggest fears when i move to japan.
Wow... that's what I call bearly an inconvenience.... incredible. This would probably take most bildings down in my country...
My girlfriend lives in Fukushima, this was not a fun one…
Heartbreaking.  I am so sorry this happened to you.  I am glad you had good friends standing beside you. Glad you're all in one piece... or three.
What was the light at 0:10?
Best of luck repairing the studio. It's always sad when places important to you are affected by natural forces.
Japanese word for god is humorous
I would be taking the opportunity to learn kintsugi and fix all those plates or mosaic or some sort of second life. Glad to see your safe.
Chris...the way you handled the situation is inspiring. You my kind sir are a great inspiration to me and many others! Wishing you the best moving forward from this, you got this! If not then Connar can just clean it all up innit ;)
I hate to be insensitive but did you know that mops exist
Arija
How does the studio play into the video you produce for the channel?  I truly thought you were going on location for much of the content you produce. It’s nice to see behind the scenes view of the studio. I’m glad you all are physically ok.
I'm sorry to see the state of your studio. That manekineko was particularly sad, since it had lost its beckoning paw. That "neko" won't be "maneki-ing" again  :-(   I am happy that you and your friends are safe, though.
Wish you and the rest of the folks in Japan all of the best, especially with getting your studio cleaned up and back on line again, I know how much you've put into it.
The resilience and positive outlook shown by Chris in such a dire situation is incredible.  I hope everything turns out okay.
I'm surprised that the mirror is still standing tbh
I’m always curious why people who live in known earthquake zones don’t arrange their house in a manner that makes it more likely that their belongings will survive. I live about 30 miles away from the San Andreas Fault and pretty much everything I own that is breakable is stored in padded boxes unless it is being actively used. I’ve been on the edge of two quakes that were over seven on the Richter scale and only lost one saucer.
Hope you are OK big chap
Oh no I'm so sorry this happened to you. But glad you are at least ok and alive and hopefully well. The water could of come from aquariums, bathrooms, your fog machine uses water, anything. But yes, you should turn off the electrical appliances everywhere. OMG. I am sorry about your studio. Hoping you got disaster insurance for everything.
Most important thing is that you’re safe 🙏🏾, everything else can be fixed or replaced. Good luck 👍🏾.
Kintsugi the cat :)
Hope everything works out and hopefully insurance can cover some of the damages?
That sucks , You are safe that is what really maters :)
very sad about your studio Chris... It was the most fantastic studio i ever seen. And im glad you are safe physically.
The cat can be fixed if you find all the bits. There are professionals who can restore vintage ceramics.
Earthquake is like destiny of Trans-Pacific country. and most of the buildings in Japan is constructed securely. but, you may pay attention to earthquake , and especially tsunami when you visit Japan.
Wow! And it's only 10 years!
Hi Chris, sorry to see all the damage, glad to see you are all okay though and to hear that your main apartment wasn't too badly hit. Hope the clean up goes well and best wishes to you and the team.
The Rumbling in real life??? 😮
I’m glad you’re alright Chris and I wish you and your studio recover soon. We do not have bigger earthquakes in Czech Republic. But I have a house nearby a river and I know this feeling to run out of the building with my family to be save from the rising water and then comming back to see what remained and what was lost.  Not mentioned the mental demoralization. Wish you a ton of strongness to manage the repairs and good mood. Stay safe
Ooh man, sooo sorry that the studio copped a bit of a bruising mate. But good to see all are safe. Remember its just a bump in the road and youre still going forward.
So sad to see your amazing studio looking like this. But i'm glad you and all your friends are safe! 🙏❤
Glad to hear your safe and well, even if your studio isn’t. At least that can be fixed and replaced.
I pray for all of you to be safe
I guess Im way to positive of a character, but when I saw that mirror at 1:31min I thought WOW that didn't crash?! Of course I know how devastating the damage in the Studio is, but considering the power it had, you 've had a lot of luck. Maybe Im just saying that cause Ive seen earthquakes pulverise walls.  Im sure the shock is still deep, but I promise in a year or so you will think of this day as a very very lucky moment within natures forces <3 also a moment to appreciate life itself.
You have this it will be ok in no time . Thank God no one got hurt , it's a bummer that the studio is a mess but it will be ok !!!!
Please know you have a giant family all around the world sending love and good thoughts for your peace of mind and safety. Be well and hold tight to your good friends for support.
All of you are safe, that's all that matters. Nature can be fierce.
Haven't watched this channel in a while, so was most surprised to learn Chris has a ramen shop in his studio flat now? How does that work exactly, does he let anyone walk in for a steaming hot bowl of katsu ramen? Guess I'll have to watch that video to find out!
Should have a mop and bucket in a place like this :P  But i'm glad you're ok and it's just minor damage.
im so sorry about your studio  and im glad your doing okay
#japantravelban
Putting so much effort and time build something so beautiful only to get damaged by nature itself. This feels sad, but hopefully, it's fixable. Also glad that everyone is ok
You could have the Manekineko repaired with gold lacquer if you kept the pieces. It’s a Japanese tradition called kintsugi, watched a video on it recently. 😊
I'm so sorry this has happened to your area of Japan - I hope as many people as possible had security on their main homes to prevent too much damage. I'm devastated to see the new studio like this - I hope it's salvageable for the most part. Best wishes, take care and stay safe.
Kanagawa was also very shaky. The large pet sheets absorb water faster and you are less likely to get hurt by shards of glass.
This is devastating and absolutely terrifying. I'm glad you all are okay!
Wow! So glad all three of you are well. I live in California, but have never been through one that big. Take care, stay safe!
I wish I could come help you guys 😞 just very glad you're all safe xxxxx
So glad you guys are okay. Hope everything will be back to normal soon 🙏
https://youtu.be/pbx89MR8UrQ
Scary! glad you are ok
Hell, I dont envy the clean up. The 7.1 in AK a few years ago was a mess. Hopefully pickup/repair goes smoothly. The water pipes are probably obvious but makes sure to get any gas lines checked too. We had hairline cracks in everything. Also be prepared for aftershocks for awhile. We were told to expect them for for up like 5 years. Nothing as major as the first though. (Super glad it didnt hit mid winter too, stay safe)
Studio can be fixed.  Glad you and the crew are safe.  Hopefully the next video is more joyous.
Oh gosh, hope no one else got in danger.
Holy crap......how horrifying for you all......hoping the loss,of life was minimal.
Truly terrifying. I'm always impressed with how you and the rest of Japan soldier on after something like this. Stay strong Chris!
How does insurance work in Japan? Do you get covered for this?
I was actually sleeping during the earthquake.....I can't fkin believe it....
I’m sorry Chris. This was heartbreaking to watch after you put so much work into your studio and just got it going. Glad you and the rest of the crew are alright.
भगवान सबको सुरक्षित और सुखी रखे ।
Glad you’re all good Chris, and glad the studio didn’t take any serious damage 🙏🙏🙏
Oh god, that's so bad 😱 I feel so sad seeing all the things in your studio smashed into pieces, but luckily only  things got damaged and you all are safe and okay! 🥺 Whish you all the best with getting over the shock of the earthquake and with repairing and replacing all your stuff!
You have pretty big apartment considering its Japan
I've put a like but this... breaks my heart. I'm sorry, Chris, from the bottom of my heart.
This is so sad after all the work that was put into everything, but hopefully it won't be too bad to fix!
Philippines is also an earthquake prone country, a 5-6 intensity is already scary for us, i cannot imagine our buildings withstanding a 7.4 😰
Hey chris I'm glad you and the gang is all ok but have you ate this so called takoyaki icecream you can get it from lawson's you should try it in one of your videos and give it A review I'm curious what you might think about it I've never had it so I wouldn't know and you like takoyaki alot so why not win win am I right.
Sorry to see the damage but glad you are all ok!
Glad you guys are all safe! Crazy when something like that happens… especially when not expecting it! Quick question - what system/computer do you guys use for editing your videos?
I've never actually seen footage or felt an earhtquake, much less an earthquake of that size. It looked terrifying
Disasters suck.  Just be glad that you are OK,  keep eyes looking forward,  and help out those that you can.
Hope you recover soon Chris...I still remember my big earthquake and I know that if you force yourself to improve everything you had damaged even better and stay active it will help you recover sooner 😇.
Damn. Just...damn. Sorry, Chris. I'm so glad you're all safe, though! Definitely keep us posted.
Chris you have a mac but you're using Premiere over Final Cut what are you doing!!! (it's just a joke, glad you're safe)
I'm excited to see the revamped studio. Maybe with a bit more gaffer tape than before but, hell, it fits the aesthetic.  (Keep the gacha machine)
Wow, I am glad ye are ok Chris! Earthquakes are very scary, thank god ye weren't there at the studio when it happened, I am glad ye are safe and I also hope the people of Sendai are ok as well! I know earthquakes are common in Japan, but even then, 7.4 earthquake is terrifying. Again, glad you are safe and hopefully other people as well are safe too.
OMFG I can't believe that happened to your place
So glad you're ok
JFC! I've been in many big quakes growing up in California, But not like that, really thought that apartment was coming down, yeah I would have been worried about that one if I was in a high rise. Probably going to have aftershocks for days, welcome to the ring of fire mate.
I remember the earthquake in 2011. I was 6. One of my  clearest memories from when I was little. I lived in Saitama and I was in kindergarten. We were outside, in the small yard of my school. The students were in the middle of learning how to ride a unicycle, and the ground started shaking. All of us went into the middle of the yard, and bent down huddled together. I remember looking up, and seeing the glass doors of my school shaking. It was terrifying. I'm happy you are ok!! Stay safe!!!
Hmmm what was that huge thing dropping from the sky right at about 0:09 !?
:( so sorry. Im relieved some of my fav content creators are safe but so sad to see the space in disarray 💔
Holy shit I’m so sorry dude  The set was so fucken cool  I don’t think I have ever been so emotional while watching a video
I hope everyone is safe and a speedy recovery for everyone in japan stay safe 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Chris, I am so sorry that happened to your precious studio. We have just come through the worst flood in 250 years in the Northern Rivers Region of New South Wales Australia. The devastation throughout the region is unbelievable. It is the loss of personal, irreplaceable, nostalgic things ( such as photos, keepsakes, books etc.) that undermine your resilience in such a situation. I am so sorry for poor little "neko". I catch myself saying "it's just stuff".. it dosn' help but it gives you something to say! Stay strong. Cheers Muffy from Oz
Maybe the Meneki Neko saved the rest of the studio in some way. It's a lucky cat, after all. Glad you're all buji desu.
I'm sorry Chris. Health his wealth so we are glad you and your mates didn't get banged up physically. I hope the studio gets a speedy recovery. Will join the patreon shortly. Take care!
Lived through an earthquake of this size in Alaska and it was horrific. Glad you guys are all okay. Cheers.
Really scary stuff. Even small earthquakes freak me out because it could possibly be 'the big one'. I live on Shikoku so earthquakes aren't exactly common, but when they happen, it is scary as hell. I can't imagine the feeling in Sendai and Northern Japan. Another steong aftershock this morning as well. Stay safe Chris and hopefully you can recover the studio fast to make more awesome videos.
Glad everything is relatively ok. Glad your are all safe more importantly!
Thankfully you're all well.
Sorry mate, I hope you get everything sorted out and back in order.
I didn't know there was a Earthquake in Japan until today when I noticed this video, I haven't seen anything about it on BBC News which has kinda shocked me.
A bit emotional indeed man. Your studio is so nice still . Just some broken item than can be replaced. Don't be too down bro. Let remember to not get too attached to the material world but I don understand losing cool stuff that might have really good memories in them but remember it's the spirit of the memory that lives on.
Take as long as you need to fix things, I’m glad you’re ok Chris
I'm so sorry Chris - I hope all the repairs go well with the studio, mate!
Oh no! I really wasn’t sure if the beginning was real or special effects 😱😱 glad you’re ok though! 🤗 🤗 take care of yourself
I am so sorry to see this damage done to your YouTube studio, Chris. Truly saddening to see so many things broken. The water on the floor, with all the electronics and such.... that makes me nervous! I hope it won't be too expensive to repair the studio. I was so happy for you, when you first got the studio and gave us a tour. Be strong and keep moving forward! I want to believe that you can repair it and make it as close to the original as you can.   Much love for your content, Chris. Your videos are something I genuinely look forward to. 💜Your videos manage to make me laugh, even when I am having a bad day (the Wacky Weekends with Connor, are the best!).
Dang be careful and stay safe glad you all made it through the quake. Stay strong
Holy fuck
It's cause you finally interviewed Ken Watanabe. But in all seriousness, glad to see you made it.
It was pretty bad. Is your studio in Tokyo? I do wonder why you didn't make it more earthquake proof. I mean you do know it's possible any time. Our place in Shinjuku shook heavily but 0 damage because apartment and furniture is secured, cupboard lock automatically, etc.. It's really worth investing some time into making it shake proof and can be done cheaply. Best wishes
Where's the snow beef episode?
I'm glad your all safe. Thanks for showing us what you went through
That's looks terrifying hope everyones alright.
Should use the moment to film a apocalypse/cyberpunk themed video
Plates and dishes and posters on the wall or just things, the only important thing is that you and the people around you are safe.
This is so sad, seeing your beautiful studio all smashed up. All those nice decorations smashed to pieces. Are you insured? Will you be able to replace all this and build it back up?
Awww Chris it's good to see that your safe and Natsuki  and your friends are too! So sorry about your studio,hopefully it will be sorted out and fixed. Sending hugs and well wishes your way. Stay safe! 🙏🙏🙏 Xxx
yikes
I am saddened to see all the damage at the Abroad In Japan studio but I am glad to see that everyone is alright.  I have some family/relatives in the Yamagata/Sendai region and hope they are OK.  It was eerie that this happened so near the anniversary date of the tsunami/earthquake of 2011.  My prayers and best wishes are with everyone their!
If you need any help replacing stuff make sure you let us know, we've got you Chris. I know how scary they are, I live in Christchurch New Zealand and they're terrifying
Wait!  There was an earthquake in Japan?!?!   I guess what with Russia and China and Canada turning evil, and America made irrelevant with that senile old man in charge, and everything else going on, some little detail like a major earthquake kind'a got overlooked by the media...
I hate that you’re dealing with this much damage to your studio and I can only imagine that the earthquake scared the daylights out of you. We’re all really glad you’re safe most of all. Those things can be replaced, but you can’t! Please stay safe.
Stay safe guys, love your content, you can always buy more stuff, glad you are all safe!
Hello from the San Francisco bay area... Happy Earthquake!!!
Glad you're safe!
Here’s to the KINTSUGUROI episode, I heard it’s a beautiful restorative craft that originated in Japan…it would give the studio a touch of authentic Japanese (like a) magic and inspire others that have had it worse - if the tower has to crumble then a new one rises like a Phoenix, galvanised by the flames it remakes itself from and people see, where there was darkness, through the cracks, shines light 💐🙏💐 (But don’t go David Dickie Bargain hunt over it!)
Yikes! I'm glad you area all okay. ):
I got into the country 5 days ago and this was my first earthquake ever. -_-
For real, is there a donation set up to help bring back the ramen shop? Insurance or not, this breaks my heart. Hang in their Chris, don’t be too British and push this all down.
Things can always be replaced.  I'm glad you are ok.
We had an earthquake here in PH a day before Japan (or so) and I am alone. I am just glad that you guys are well!!
I kinda think it would kinda cool to keep the broken neko statue.  No real reason, I just think it would be cool
That's so sad, you put so much time and effort into the new studio and not even a year after it's finished something like this happened. Good thing you're ok though.
all those broken bowls. time to practice your Kintsugi.
I feel for you mate, especially since you put all that time, effort, and money into the space and you haven't had it very long. It must be heartbreaking.  On the up side, it's very lucky that you weren't in the space at the time, and it's great to hear that you're doing alright.  It's probably a good idea to make note of what could have hurt you when it fell, and take that into account when you're rebuilding. Things can be replaced, people can't.
Chris, I've been watching for years and love your videos. I've sent 8 of my 15 years in the US Navy stationed in Yokosuka. Your videos have been amazing for my family and I to get ideas of things to see and do in Japan.  I'm personally heartbroken for you and your studio but I'm glad you are safe! Keep it up man.
Forward him to Aki's earthquake videos...
It was a tough time for you. I am glad you are safe. There is a possibility of earthquakes wherever we are in Japan. When a big earthquake hits, things will break. That is why we should not get attached to things.  On the other hand, we feel sorrow for broken things. I feel the beckoning cat had sad eyes. I can't help but think that it must have been very scary. That is wabi-sabi. This is the wisdom of our ancestors who have learned from the Japanese since ancient times.
👋🏻 …so sorry to learn the fate of the AMAZIN’ ‘Ramen Shop’ Chris; it’s more important that you’re OK and safe! *Bro hug!  - Tony [Anthony Aaron, FHQ NEWS|FINITE]
Just glad the damage wasn't to bad and the water didn't cause a fire with the wires.
About the cat figurine, there is a japanese art called kintsugi. It is about fixing broken things with gold. You don't need to fix it with gold obviously but it could be a way of transforming something that you love into a better thing.
Glad you all are relatively alright.
I am so sorry Chris! Am sadden for you but we are so happy and glad that you are safe!!!!!!!! Let us know if we can do anything to help you!
i am very sorry for this (unfortunately) new catastrophe. at the same time, living in japan for 20 years, i can t help observing the evidence and the facts : the japan s east coast, and most particularly the touhoku area has constantly been exposed to a maximum risk of major earthquakes and (of course) tsunami for a very obvious reason : the huge 'scar' scaled trench located a few kms away only from the coasts underseas. that particular zone should be a no man s land for the security of the people. or at least not built with high structures or buildings. the authorities do have a serious responsibility with the issues of these areas allowing construction of everything or anything. i personally would never  live in touhoku; it is simply insane. i wish you the best chris, as well as to anyone having suffered that (again, new) major cataclysm.
That sucks as it is such an amazing studio. I told Andrew Dobbie from MadeBrave that your studio and his are the two studios that are the best. Hopefully, the water damage is not too bad. Will insurance cover some of the damage?  Keep rocking the content creation!
Oh I'm so sorry for you😔 - all the best!
I see Risottoro survived your great earthquake scheme as well Chris, better luck next time...In all seriousness though, glad you all are safe!! Hopefully the electronics survived all the aftershocks as well 😢
Oh man...hope you are able to recover emotionally and practically from this disaster soon! Good thing you have some awesome friends to help. <3
Maybe fix the manekineko with some kintsugi?
I wish everyone to be alright and any broken thing  ... well we can fix it back !
Stay safe!
wow spooky. glad everyone is all ok.
I'm so sorry you have to go through this and the mess and everything - at least you have friends to help you out and most importantly you're safe
Kintsugi, my man. Kintsugi. For your Maneki-Meko.
As one of your aficionados I am glad you are ok..Regarding your studio, it’s going to take a lot of hardwork but I am sure it’s going to turn out even better than before! 頑張ってね！
Chris, that must be terrifying. Stuff can be replaced so thank goodness no one got hurt with falling stuff or buildings. I’m sure all will be fine in the end. Stiff upper lip old boy. Bulldog spirit and all that. Loving all of your content so keep up the amazing work. 👏
I'm glad to see that the 3 of you are ok. Everything else is just stuff and can be replaced.
i just got into the video in a panic. i am glad your safe. feel bad about the ramen shop too man.
Glad you're safe mate
Glad you’re ok Chris. I can’t imagine how heartbreaking it was to see your studio that way. I wanted cry for you, we all know how much you love that studio and how much work was put into it. I’ll pray for the studios recovery as well as everyone else who was affected by the earthquake 🙏🏻
Glad you are safe. it sucks about the studio but as others have said, it can be rebuilt. Best of luck to you.
I'm so sorry Chris! I got very emotional watching this, please stay safe! Sending you Love from London  ❤❤❤
Shake it baby! Shake it!!!
WHY DOES EVERYTHING BAD HAVE TO HAPPEN IN MARCH
😀
:(
I feel for you, Bro(ad). However strong i wish to visit Japan, i certainly fear witnessing this kind of natural disaster.
Glad all of you are ok. Love you guys!
Heartbreaking to the set in such a sad state but I’m glad everyone is safe
Unfortunate climate change is hitting japan so terribly
Does some sort of insurance cover this?
Its good to know that you guys are all ok
Don't worry Chris, the alley looks  more authentic now
i am really happy that you are ok and was not harmed it must have been such a terrifying experience to have gone through that and its so sad to see my fav ramen shop in this condition i really hope it will be rebuilt and stsnd in glory once again  <3
Noooo not the Studio. It's not even been a year :(
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
At least Natsuki is still with us
I'm real sorry the damage to your studio and I'm happy you can keep a positive attitude, hopefully you can restore the shop and make it even more awesome
Damned bloody shame I'm not there, I could have had the studio in proper nick in an hour or so. Glad to hear you're all safe though.
omg, glad you guys weren't hurt
For the little trinkets and odds and ends on the shelves, I'd be securing them down with museum wax. You can still lift things off and it wont damage anything, but it's great stuff for earthquakes!
Ouch
I may be a day late for this, but you guys should buy a squeegee if you hadn't already to sweep the water somewhere to drain. It's a lot faster than using a towel and less exhausting.
I've never had to experience an earthquake, but I can only imagine how horrifying it must feel.. Especially one of that magnitude. It must feel so surreal... I'm glad most of the set is salvageable.. Maybe the team who put it together will be willing to offer a helping hand in finding new pieces for the set! Best of luck!
Nooooo, not the kitty!
Glad Chris is ok. Was watching and thinking "what if that happened when he was in that $12K luxury hotel suite! 😮
Glad to see you guys are okay!!
It's kinda crazy earthquakes are a thing in Japan and other countries in Asia don't have to worry about them. Kinda f'ed up too
I'm glad you and the team are safe
at a buffet, i personally sneak corndogs into the buffet so others can enjoy them. I hide 6 corndogs in my jacket pockets. it then, is a joy for me to see other patrons of the establishment eat my corndogs thinking they were part of the buffet
Im working in a japanese company and i was in a vc with a coworker that was in japan and in the middle of the call she said hold on "earthquake" and was gone x))))  she played it down later and now its in the news everywhere holy moly
hope you found the source of the water !
❗*Friends, welcome to my channel!*❗  Incoming calls, screen recording of new and old models, reviews, ringtones! Beginner girl blogger, support with likes, I will be very grateful to you! New video every day))
https://youtu.be/IKwhHJpNxG4  glad you are all okay.  very frightening ...
jesus fucking christ that shit is ruined after you just built it
It pains my heart to see all of your hardwork on this studio getting undone.. Hope you manage to mend it back to how it was before.
Put all the electronics in rice bags 😅
Stay safe Chris
Hey that earthquake happened on my birthday… Happy birthday to me
Hope you and Team are all well with roofs over your heads and food in your bellys and everything else is either replaceable or fixable.   Loving your work
Scary! Hope the water didn't cause any major damage? Subscribed!
Who would have ever thought an earthquake would happen in *earthquake-prone* Japan? Soooo confusing lol
Oh my God. I am hppy you are alright. I hipe all your Friends are well too!
Gutting as it must be to walk into your apartment, especially when you got that street setting up not long ago and hope there's not too much water damage and won't have to rip everything out to fix broken plumping. Considering that, most of all everyone is fine and no one was in there when the earthquake hit.
Hopefully the water isn't indicitive of over all building damage
Jesus Christ I'm so happy that everyone is okay. Hope you can restore your set, you only had it for a few months!
Glad the worst has passed... but no one dries their floors like that since the mop was invented...... just saying.
Kind of the hard way to be trending on YT, isn't it? :' ) Hope you get the studio back up to speed soon!
Same thing happened to my house when my first wife walked down the hall
I'm sorry about your apartment
It’s fine as long as ur safe m8
https://youtu.be/r_G0xPVSUEI
Glad you're all okay. Too bad about your studio. All the best. Hope you recover it all well.
i’m so glad you’re okay everyone 😢♥️
From Arizona, glad you're alright.
I think i said oh no about 10 times watching this, your beautiful set! Really feel for you Chris but sets can be rebuilt as long as everyone is ok that's the main thing! x
🥺💕
This is terrifying. 😳 Take care. 🌺
I'm glad you are all safe! Really sad for the set, but the pictures on twitter made it look waaaay worse that it actually is. Stay safe! Hope Japan doesn't get another big earthquake in a long time.
That is so heartbreaking to watch .... Hope you get everything sorted out! At least you are alright!
Over the past few months, I've watched all your videos. I've been disabled for almost 5 years and I enjoy watching your videos as a way to escape and travel to a place I won't ever be able to visit. I am so very glad that you are safe and I will continue to watch anything you ever publish to YouTube. I sincerely hope the studio renovations go smoothly.  ♥️ From North Carolina
shit.....
Glad your safe Chris. I'm very sorry for the beautiful Ramen Shop. It will see its glory again, and I expect like never before!
That's terrifying. I hope you solve the water problem with minimum damages. Be well and take care of yourself. <33333
Lolz
I’m so sorry about ur studio :( I’m glad ur safe tho ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for the video! You have a very interesting channel! And I am 20 years old, unfortunately I am disabled, I live with my parents. I never had friends in real life, as well as relationships, I spent my whole life on the Internet. I also created a channel that can draw attention to this, though so far little has been done ((( I am writing this comment just to wish you health and good mood. Rejoice and connect with a friend. And if you suddenly feel bad at heart, remember this comment Only forward! Looking forward to your next . Good luck
At least you can make dirty Ramen with the water
Glad all of you are safe.  Things can be fixed/replaced.  Keep up the fine work.  All of you.
I didnt know you had a production team. Thought it was just you.
This suckssssss man. But we are very happy that you are safe and unhurt
Luckily that delicious Ramen and Gyoza survived. No but in seriousness I hope this isn't too rough on Chris.
Glad everyone is safe! I hope recovery and replacement of everything is possible!
I'm so sorry your ramen office got a ruined glad you are safe and the rest of the studio seems to be ok
Covid stoping everyone from visiting and now earthquakes will destroy everything before they open up
Glad you guys are all safe! <3  I say keep the Maneki Neko "survivor" :D you could maybe glue some of the bits back onto it or leave it as is. Good luck with putting everything back together though!
Stay safe. I'm glad that you 3 are alright
Glad to know you're all alright 👍🏾
Must've been rough. Glad that you, the boys and everyone else are fine. Wish you the best.
Glad you’re okay mate hope you and the crew can get things back up and running in no time💪🙏
Im so sorry for what happened...i hope you can recover from this. Stay safe chris
glad yall are safe, thats the most important thing.
Must be one  of the most terrifying things to experience... I was thinking about those videos you did about super tiny apartments in Japan... I hope those people living there are also ok :/
Oh my God this is heartbreaking to see!!!! I'm so glad you are okay, though, Chris!! The best of luck getting the water sorted and cleaning everything up. I understand how this could be extremely traumatizing and I'm so glad you are okay 💖
Now there’s going to be actual moss on the ground for the extra realism points
Glad that you are safe
Lot's of opportunity for kintsugi. Maybe even the gatchapon.
You only just basically built this.   I guess you can repair and keep going but it sucks so much to finally achieve a goal and only enjoy it for 5 minutes before something that is not you breaks it.  It's just material things but I still feel for you.
Being Chilean, I know exactly what this is like. I hope you’re all fine and stay safe. Remember aftershocks are a thing.
Sad for this, truly. I'm recalling how thrilled and happy you were when you unveiled the studio, only a short time ago.  Very glad you and your friends are all safe, though.  You didn't mention—do you have insurance that will cover some of this loss? Maybe will you set up an earthquake recovery donation page? We'd be happy to contribute. Best wishes from us here in New Jersey, USA.
Kitty smashed? Fifty years bad luck.
I’m so thankful you’re all safe. I’m absolutely gutted for you Chris.. sending you all my well wishes 🥺❤️🙏
Im glad that its not decimated, but im sorry it got wrecked. Living in humble Massachusetts, i dont think i can imagine the trauma of a serious earth quake. I hope the best for you and your studio.
I wish you can get your studio back to shape soon, Chris. Thankfully, we did not have a tsunami this time.
Glad you are ok! Sorry about the studio that's rough, at least it's mostly intact. Good luck with the clean up!
Wow.  Thanks for sharing.  I'm glad you are okay.
Despite how scary it might have been atleast no one died so thats relieving. If this had happend somewhere else in the world the aftermath would have been a lot worse.
When i was a child, i had experience so many earthquake and it still traumatize me until now. As the result, i get scared of mountains, hills and even sea😩
To be honest i expected worse, they werent kidding when they wanted the buildings earthquake proof.
Really glad you're unharmed, Chris. At least physically! That must have been terrifying, it absolutely looked terrifying. Really hope you don't have to go through that too often ❤️
The Japanese had been living with earthquake since the dawn of time... it's good to know that you Sir were in good conditions there.
Chris, my heart shattered when I see the condition of your studio, but more importantly you are alright. It's alright, the studio can be rebuilt, and your spirit is stronger than ever! Take care!
So happy to see you and your friends are all okay, Chris. The state of the studio is heartbreaking but nothing that can't be fixed. I hope the aftershocks are short, weak and few, so you can get your life back to normal as soon as possible. Stay safe. I'll keep you in my prayers. Lots of love from Texas. <3
Oh, I'm so sorry about the studio, Chris, but I think what matters most after the quake is that you and your friends are all okay. I hope the next one isn't nearly as bad, and that getting the studio back into shape is as swift and painless as possible.
So thankful you and your friends and crew are all safe!  Hopefully the water damage isn't too extensive and the studio will be back in shape soon!
Hope it gets better
So sorry you had all the damage but I'm glad you're all okay.
Hope it gets better
Chris, I'm so sorry that was such a lovely studio. However, I'm glad you and all the mates are safe!
Glad that you, Natsuki and Sharla are all alright. Sorry about the studio getting trashed by it Chris. Even though stuff can get replaced it doesn't make it any less sad to see so much of it broken
jesus, i’m glad you are safe and okay chris ❤️
For the cat, if you can find the broken pieces, you can find some tutorials on how to glue the pieces together with some gold strips. Like a cool disaster scar! Glad your okay. Hoping there won't be a second huge one. Praying for y'all!
I live in Chiba and I think my daughter was more annoyed she was woken up rather than scared of the quake.
I hope the water issue was resolved Chris and it was only drinking water.  What a shame all the lovely china was broken.  Stay safe.
I love your positive outlook so much. I wish we could see more of it in wacky weekend :)  Sorry about the shop
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
I was in Sendai and I was cleaning up my room to move when the earthquake has hit. Honestly it reminds me of 3/11. I was afraid that huge tunami might hit the coasts again but thankfully the tunami was really small. It was really terrific to experience that.
Oh My God, I adjust admired your ramen shop and I'm sorry to see it ruined! But I'm glad you and your friends are safe. That's the most important.
imagine using a mop... (but fr I'm glad you're okay)
Ahhh mate, I'm so sorry to see your studio totalled, its so cool.  I hope you rebuild soon, im sure itll be better than ever . Glad youre safe though x,
Chris don't throw out the Maneki Neko! If you find the other shards you can glue it back together, maybe even using Kintsugi, that technique where they use gold to repair the cracks! I'm sorry to see your studio got hit so badly. But I'm glad everyone is okay ❤
Man so sorry about that ! Tnx god you are safe! Lets put a donation button, lets build it back together ❤️
So for ramen shop 2.0 you shoul probably get some rubber anchor and earthquake puddy to anchor secure the shelves (rubber ancor is a foam rubber MESH originally mean tto keep rugs from sliding but you can now get it to use to line china cabnets to geep the plates from sliding out
0:10 What was that massive light beam? Was there some explosion due to the earthquake?
Oh my god. Some dishes fell on the floor Lord help us
heartbreaking to see the studio in such a state
I am a bit confused. Admittedly I have zero experience with earthquakes and have no idea how much things move. And I don't want to sound heartless, because I'm sure it was terrifying. But how come certain things like the giant mirror and glass bottles on the counters not.... shatter?   Don't get me wrong! I'm glad not everything was destroyed! I'm just really confused why certain items survived.
I am so glad your alright!
I was there for the last one - on the other coast in Akita, but even we got shaken up pretty good. Glad you're okay!
A few years ago we had a 6.2, 5.4 and 7.1 within 48 hours... It was the first earthquake I'd been through and yeah the 7s sure are crazy. I wish you all the best, hopefully just a few days of small aftershocks for you.
Take care
Glad youre okay man. Suggestion for the cat, perhaps rebuild with kintsugi?
Glad you are safe and so is everyone else. You can replace broken items in the ramen shop but your earthquake trauma will be much harder to forget!
That earthquake certainly made me wonder if I'd be able to find all the emergency supplies once my apartment succumbed to the intense shaking. Thankfully, it stopped. Didn't sleep very deeply after that, though.
Wtf was that dropping out of the sky
Feels bad man with the studio, but happy that you're ok! Hope there's some kind of insurance when it comes to water damage after an earthquake :O
Too much earthquake-o!
Glad you guys are Ok.
take care. God bless !
We love you
i was in Kobe only weeks before KOBE 95 quake, Thank god. had a few small earhquakes in Tokyo . was strange to see friends hiding under the table while i was standing there taking it in , looking at mount Fuji, memoires. cheers Japan.  Real damn shame about the set man, gutted for you .
Glad you're alright mate. Sorry to see the set a mess. I hope none of that water left any damage too.
Best of luck & wishes for a speedy recovery. Glad damage was only material & not your person.
In a weird way the Ramen shop is even more authentic now!
Just felt an aftershock while watching this hahaha
Ffs is the appropriate response
So as soon as earthquakes start, start recording the cameraman never dies.😂😂
Hope everything will be alright :) glad you are okay!!
もう10年か…
I'm so glad that you and the others are okay. it was one of the first thinks I thought about when I heard about the earthquak. and I'm so sorry about your thinks got damaged.
I'm from New Zealand which has also had its far share of major earthquakes (on the ring of fire) , I know what you're going through - the cleanup can take sometime, just glad everyone is safe - objects can be replaced, lives can't. Stay safe.
At least your safe. Hubby said their was a sunami warning. We felt in Tokyo. But we have felt many in 20+ years, items are replaceable, humans are not. Love from shinjuku
hope you're alright man keep your chin up, much love  from Australia!
Oh no I'm so sorry Chris... I can't imagine how you must be feeling right now. I'm really glad you're all okay tho! Do take a break from things if you need to, I hope you get everything gets sorted out soon and take care!
So so sorry you had to live through that Chris. As someone who still lives in the UK, we definitely take our seismic inactivity for granted 🙁 stay safe! ♥️ From 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Stay strong mate, the important is that you, and your friends, are safe and sound, the matirial damages can be fixed. You are a very good youtuber, very good person, you have very good friends, and for all of that you are rich. Materials will come and go, relationships than worth more than  gold is hard to find. Take care your self, and your friends, and beware the after earthguakes, Im from Greece and we know a lot about this situations. Stay strong.
Ow god😵🚫
That genuinely sucks but I really hope that this doesn’t discourage you too much, I know that’s probably a huge bummer but you’ve got a ton of support behind you in your corner
What was that huge light in the video recording outside in the beginning?
❣️
I'm glad you're all safe Chris! I hope you all get through the cleanup without issues and get back to sharing amazing content.
I hope you have insurance, but as long as you're okay that's what matters
HOLY SHIT 😮
Oh nuuuu stay safe please!!!! Everyone in Japan, may you be safe from these disasters ❤
"Chance of sinking" The fate of "Tokyo sink"
Sorry about your studio, but atleast you are fine <3
Glad you're okay Chris! I have that exact same manekineko. My family got it when we bought a Sony back in 1999 - year of the cat. It's a shame the memorabilia did not survive the earthquake.
New top 20 rap song:  Too much Earthquake.
Ohhh no, where am I supposed to get my late night ramen and beer now. Jokes aside, it really hurts seeing the studio that has had so much work put into it be rattled like this. It feels like someone saw how awesome the studio is and decided to destroy it, quite a rude earthquake indeed. I'm glad your fate turned out to be more safe than the lucky cat at least.
This is so heartbreaking, although you really did react like a typical Brit 🤣 also you may have to open the new studio up to the public to cover costs 🤔  Really though, glad you're all okay, love from Manchester ❤️
Glad you are all safe. That must be terrifying. Do people in Japan typically secure their belongings on shelves in case of an earthquake?
kintsuki the manekeneko! glad you’re all ok. was surprised by it even here in tokyo, can’t imagine what it would have been like there.
I’m glad to hear that the building that you always use for your work didn’t collapse during the earthquake. Hope you will keep making more fantastic videos in there!
This was indeed a scary one I live in Miyako one of the cities devastated in 2011 and live 20m behind the tsunami wall. I immediately got dressed after the quake as I was asleep and ran to the car and drove to the nearest evacuation point. And it was nowhere near as bad as you had it down in Miyagi, very scary indeed and my heart goes out to everyone affected. 気をつけ皆。
Holy shit.
Best wishes in not just the material recovery, but your emotional recovery from such a traumatic event. I hope all is well and easy to replace. 😣
The post-traumatic stress from the aftershocks is real.  I still get a pit in my stomach every time the ground shakes and I haven't been in a real earthquake since '96.  We kept shoes by our beds in case we had to walk through more broken glass.  Glad you're all safe, best of luck on the rebuild.
Glad you're safe. I was there back in 2011 and was scared shitless as well
Good to hear you're fine.  Please continue to pump out videos once you get the studio sorted!
Jeez, that had to have been terrifying to go through, I can't even imagine. Thankfully everyone is physically ok. Really sad to see the studio like that after all the work you put into it. Good news is you can always buy new items. If you need anything at all, I know I wouldn't be alone in saying it either, let us know.
Two years ago Utah went through an earthquake. It took me and the cats a month to trust the world wont shake to death.
Your face looks like an Earthquake
I'm glad you're okay Chris!
Did anyone else notice that something falls from the sky at 9 seconds, then there's a big flash?
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Wow, sad to see the studio in such a mess. Breakables are hopefully replaceable or repairable, people not. Glad that you guys and gals are all ok.
You're a great guy and you are going to be fine. So sad for your studio
Hope insurance will cover the damages, and hope everything can get up and running soon!
Man, that's sucks. But i'm glad you're ok
Good you are ok, I experienced the Kobe quake in 95' almost same magnitude...it's scary when it goes on and you don't know when it will stop... stay safe
Saw a 6.5 aftershock hours later
The Happening begins. Somebody find Mark Wahlberg. And Will Ferrel, to mock him.
Omg, I'm so sorry! I felt that in my heart when I saw the broken ceramics of the ramen shop. I hope you get your replacement neko :<  Obviously glad you and your friends are unharmed.
Take care Chris! Yes so awful and I love your studio so much! Stay safe !
Dude, you & the Abroad in Japan team are safe, that’s the main thing. Everything can be rebuilt!
Is there earthquake insurance to help cost for the damage in the studio? Glad your safe and hope the studio gets put back together soon 🙏🙏🙏
Hugs Chris
Gutted about your studio Chris, I just felt such dismay at seeing it like that. I know there's not much words can do, but really, I feel so bad right now :(
Only a minute into the video, holy shit Chris, so glad you're safe!
Sorry you have to go through that! Glad you all are OK!!!!
FUUUUUUUUUUUUuuuuuuuuuuck!  I was in Kanagawa (13 years in Japan) when yesterday's quake happened and I almost didn't even notice the earthquake while I was sleeping.  None of my things fell and my place was built in 1980s...  Chris, seeing your things all over the floor and some damaged makes me feel so bad  man.  I've always wanted a chance to visit the OG studio, but looks like that opportunity has been taken from me...  I've been watching you since your proactive start in Japan.  I hope your able to salvage that silver lining like you always seem to find a way to do.  I saw some news that there was a 1 meter Tsunami near Miyagi.  Please prepare a good Earthquake resistant set up and a Tsunami evacuation plan to be prepared for that just in case.  Good luck Abroad~
Excuse me Sir/Madam  Are you saved? If you died tonight are you going to heaven? Jesus loves you
This would.be awful. Feel like the whole world is ending im sure 😕 🥺🥺 but I hate to say it but this will happen again and again as time goes on.. just always be aware your surroundings and stay safe man 🙏
Glad you are all safe. Structurally, the studio looks in good shape. Also, the mirror at 1:33 is still standing!
The most important thing is that you're all safe, the studio may be in shambles but as long as you're alive, you can fix the damages.
Wow🙀 you're so lucky majority of that studio made it!(🥺 sad seeing it like this) When I saw the magnitude last night, I seriously worried about all my Youtubers' lives!! Hope your friends and crew are all safe too😇🙏💕
Fuck it. Just monetize everything. Does anything ever happen where you don't think "let me turn on my camera for my channel?"
Omfg are u oke is the studio goin 2 be oke are all the trash taste mambers oke are all the other realy Nice and good japenese streamers and tubers oke kaho i and natsuki and more i have dislexya so if i did type some thing rong 😅
It might be an odd first impression but when I first laid my eyes on the display case among the destruction of the studio, my mind went "wow, you got a slice of Fukushima now." That aside, hope the clean up goes well!
Hope you guys and everyone else in Japan are safe
that's awful Chris :( Hope you can get some help fixing the place up
Omg! (Haven't even started the video yet) I thought of you 1st! Immediately after hearing about that earthquake last night!! 🙀 Making the assumtion here thinking you're safe 🙏 , seeing that you were able to post this video!😅👍😇 💕 (now I'll watch and see how things worked out)
Your all safe thats what matters, time for rebuilding, maybe it gets better then it was, just make sure it gets earthquake Proof this time.
Glad you're all ok, that was horrifying.
Wow Chris, I was really hoping that fallen hatrack would be the worst of it. The lovely studio, in shamples. Who'd have thought. Maybe you can ask Ken Watanabe for assistance, he seems great at rebuilding a shop after a natural disaster!
Awh gutted for your studio least everyone safe
Japanese engineering at its finest. It is amazing that those huge buildings survived
So sorry that you and yours had to go through this but your standing here is a testament to the fact that you're all the most important part of anything that can be shaken or fallen by the earth itself - you're the ones that get back up. Take heart my friend, by standing strong while the world shook, however frightful it may've been, you've moved the world forward with resilience. Be well, all of you.
I'm really sorry Chris :( but also really glad you weren't in the studio when the earthquake was happening. All the best for the rebuild x
Glad you're okay man. Looking forward to how you rebuild it
Bless ya Chris, mostly cosmetic stuff at least. Duno why "it's the first time I thought, I'm going to die now" cracked me up so much. That shaking looked mental and synical sense of humour I guess.
From Los Angeles where we always worry about "the Big One," I definitely understand that fear. We've been having a lot more seismic activity in the past few years and it's hard not to imagine that could easily be us. If anything, earthquakes leave me more shaken! (pun intended?) & I'm so sorry it hit so soon after getting the studio together! Scary stuff. But I'm glad you all are ok and hopefully the studio can get back into ship shape in no time. May the force be with you!
I heard a random conversation somewhere, that there may be another earthquake soon...... may or may not be true. Just FYI.
First Trump, then a pandemic(attack on the congress and the murder of George Floyd) , then Putin invading Ukraine and now fucking earthquakes. I was trying to stay positive during the Artemis SLS rollout but the world is relentless. You easily forget you are lucky when everything seems so shit.
Stay safe Chris and team. As long as everyone is safe, things can be rebuild.
Get some gold colored glue and practice your kintsugi
اور انکو زلزلوں اور آسمانی آفات سے آزمایا جائے گا تاکہ وہ توبہ کریں اور ہدایت کی طرف لوٹیں۔ -Enlightening
I am so sorry to see the studio in bits, but most importantly I am incredibly relieved to hear you are all safe and uninjured. Would it be possible to repair the broken manineko with kintsugi? It might make for a great start of the recovery of the studio, and the piece might even be more treasured afterwards.
I'm happy you are unharmed♥️ I grew up in the Oakland Bay area , California. Earthquakes part of life. Six fault lines 😲 be safe and thank you for all the awesome videos .💜😉
That’s so scary! Glad you all are ok, and I’m hoping the electronics survived all that water :/
get a de-humidifier
Could've been worse. And it's all fixable. But at least you're safe!
God was making it clap
We felt it over in Akita too, and I knew the longer it went on, the worse it likely was on the east coast. Glad to see you're alright and made it out mostly unscathed!
I am glad youre safe and didn't get hurt. I hope you can salvage a lot from the ramen shop and rebuild the studio without more problems! Crossing my fingers the electronics are ok
Sad to see the studio that I'm sure was a milestone for you in pieces, but more importantly your friends and family seem to be safe. In the luxury showroom design industry, we use "museum putty" for our really expensive sculptures and pieces as an extra precaution around clientele. not expensive and if there are staging pieces you don't move around, might be worth spending the time, it will look invisible to the camera and isn't too expensive. Thanks for the videos <3
I left Japan 3 months ago after living there for 15 years. I still love Japan but this is the number one thing I don't miss about it.
I am so sorry Chris!:( I am glad that everyone is safe!
Glad no one was harmed and just material goods.
I'm glad you all are safe! Now, there's a lot of kintsugi to be done
I'm glad you're safe and most of the studio was still standing. I hope the clean up goes well and you're able to replace everything. Hopefully there aren't many aftershocks. Take care Chris!
This makes me really sad :( I love your vids and all the people around you. What's the best way to help you rebuild?
I'm glad you guys are ok. Hopefully you guys can get back up and running soon. Wishing you all the best.
Despite everything, everyone is safe, so that's the best thing there is!  Hopefully you can get the ramen shop back up soon! Maybe take it as a chance to do a little re-decorating for the studio.
Maneki Neko fix with gold/glue! Traditional Japanese way :) will have more meaning behind it and can be a story piece.
I don’t know if you have noticed it but it seems like almost every 10 years there happens to be a massive earthquake on the same location in Japan. Thank God this time no nuclear accident occurred
I'm glad that you're alright Chris, Even if the studio was totaled, Abroad in Japan would still live on because it's main component is you, and you can't be replaced like some of the broken pieces there. It warms my heart to see Sharla and Natusuki with you, those two are absolute treasures more precious than gold, you are all beautiful people, with Love from New Zealand. ❤
I am so sorry Chris, I hope that you're able to salvage your studio :(
Thank gosh your okay
Ok this is truly awful but why the fuck are you emptying water in a bag?
Man this is absolute garbage, just got the dream place and freaking Japan decided it was gonna have a massive wank, hope everything is up and running soon man and that the stuff can be easily replaced
I’m going to visit Sendai next week.😨
:(
Glad you and the crew are ok. All the stuff can be replaced, you can't be. Some small lessons to be learnt perhaps but all in good time.
I guess you are not a real Japanese until your ramen shop gets destroyed by an earthquake.
I am a Korean. I'm sad that something unfortunate happened in my neighborhood.
Glad your all safe. Sorry about the mess though that's awful
poor guy cant afford a bucket
Man, shit! Glad to see you all are fine and hope it will be better than you might fear
I'm so sorry Chris, I'm glad you are all ok,  I'm gutted about your studio, I really hope you manage to get it back to the way it was, I was so excited to see it when you announced it. Sending love to you all from N.wales ♥️
Really sorry this has happened to you Chris. Hang on in there, this too will pass.
I’m sorry Chris it really sucks to see this but glad you and everyone are okay hopefully everything can be fixed up
That neko need some kintsukuroi love. Stay safe
Stay safe everyone. 皆さんおげんきで。
I'm glad you are okay. I'm currently living overseas, but as a person who experienced Kobe earthquake, I cannot stop thinking how people in Japan would felt with that earthquake. Please stay safe.
It was only a 5+ down here in Ibaraki and even that was pretty bad! I can't imagine how scary that must have been. Makes me worry about my apartment in a 50-year old concrete building... first floor. If it comes down, I'm screwed!!
Glad you're safe and the studio doesn't look like it too much damage. I hope the earthquake doesn't trigger another tsunami (like the oil spill on the coast of Peru). 🥺😭😭
Hope you have a smooth repair of the studio ahead fella. Glad you're okay. Love your content
ahh so sorry bro 😢😢😢
Good to see you’re ok 👍
Holly shit man,this truelly seems like a horrifying experience. so glad yall are safe,i rlly hope rebuilding the studio won't be too bothersome,stay safe and take care guys,best wishes 8>
I was so worried when I heard the news about the EQ the other day.  I live in New Zealand, and have experienced some moderate ones. Never had one as bad as you just had though. I hope the aftershocks settle down soon.
Guess it could have been worse but this is pretty bad already. Can you even insure yourself for Earthquake damages in Japan? If so the premiums are most likely rather expensive.  Hope things get patched up soon.
Engineering at its best! 👏👏👏 Those buildings and structures are indestructible!! 👏👏👏 Im so amazing!
Hey Chris, it’s better to have broken stuff then a broken body… glad you all are safe!
I hope you can salvage as much as possible. Sad to see the destruction to the studio you put so much heart in.
Glad you , Sharla and Natsuki are all right.
I’m so sorry for the traumatic experience and also the damage to your set, which has been your pride and joy. The high and lows annoyingly are all a part of life, and if someone said that to me after your experience I probably want to punch them in the face!!! Thinking of you ❤️❤️
Does the goverment not provide grants or recompensations for damages at times like these?
After shocks
For the maneki neko, maybe you can bring it back to life with the Japanese art of Kintsugi? The art of repairing with gold.
@Abroad in Japan  Please repair the Maneki Neko with Kintsugi PLEASE
glad you are safe, stay strong
now i know what the next trash taste episode will be about
chris: builds his new studio earth quake: haha no
Glad you are doing fine. It seems in today’s era in the Pacific Ring of Fire earthquakes are becoming more frequent. We also I don’t know if it is connected to global warming. I'm not a scientist but I hope I am wrong about it. A country like Japan is lucky because of their laws and guidelines to make buildings earthquake proof, unlike our country. I guess what we need to do nowadays is just prepare and be alert.
I'm in Northern Ibaraki and an older apartment.... Yeah, when I came to experience living in Japan... Wasn't quite what I had in mind. 😂
Wishing you all the best Chris, glad youre okay!
Good thing you’re safe Chris, since I live in Hawaii I heard from some others to brace for possible Tsunamis and when I found out why I was really worried for everyone in Japan.
This is a sign… a sign for you to open a real ramen shop.
Maybe could try some Kintsukuroi with the cat?
Hope you are ok Chris and so was everyone else.
Stay safe, best wishes from Russia 🇷🇺
Bloody hell, that's absolutely catastrophic! Not the maneki neko!!! At least the bowls of ramen remain on the counter. Hopefully the cleanup isn't gonna take too long, and insurance covers most of the cost.
Hope alls well!! You're part of the reason I chose to go Japan the place I love only second to my son.
Get back up broda!
You could kintsugi the ceramic cat?
Warms my heart to see Natsuki there to support u bruv. Give him a big hug for me!!!!
Hey man. Glad you and all the friends are safe. So sad about the studio -- I feel that for you man. Sending love from the US and CN.
Glad yall are okay, dude.
Moves to most volcanic nation on earth. Moves to most volcanic stage in said nation. Isn’t even remotely disadvantaged by a volcano. Million views. What am I missing?
The most important thing is you're ok. All other things can be replaced. So sorry for your experience.
Glad you're okay. Maybe you could do some kintsugi.
As heartbreaking as it is, everything can be rebuilt as long as you are okay. Hope the studio comes out okay. Best wishes.
I know how this all feels!!!! I didn't go through an earthquake, but I just had a massive f3-f4 tornado destroy my home and my business that sits at the back of my property. On sep 1st 2021, we had 7 tornados in south Jersey USA... and I was home when the eye of the tornado passed right over my house! I was tucked under the basement steps and saying my goodbyes out loud! I'll never, EVER forget that noise. It sounded like a freight train crashing into a jumbo jet!!! I felt the hoise violently shaking and breaking. and I heard and felt all the trees being ripped out of the ground around my home..  and thrown through my house like darts. All the windows blowing out and my roof being peeled off like an orange peel. I had to climb out of a pile of ruble that was once my home. Then after it started down pouring and the basement foundation started filling up with water. I lived in the woods, very thick woodlands... and it's all gone. It literally looks like a gigantic lawnmower came and cut down all the woods. I wish I could put pics up here. Iam glad you are okay, and like I said  I know how ot feels going through mother nature's WRATH. I lost close to a million dollars with my art studio and bindery. Professional artist grade art supplies, leathers, rolls of paper, tools, equipment, my rare pigment collection... my personal belongings were also destroyed and my poor sons stuff is all gone. Iam currently at a rental home still, while my home and business are being rebuilt. I really hope you take care and keep your head up. Cheers
Morning Chris. Just watched your video. Can’t quite believe this has just happened to your studio. I am so sorry for you, that must of been heart breaking to see your new beautiful studio looking that destroyed. I really really do hope that one way or another, you can get everything about that studio up and running again, because it was a masterpiece of design. You haven’t even really had a chance, I don’t think, to get it properly up and running, with new episodes, fully utilising the space of your studio.   I’m so relieved that your ok, shaken up I’m sure, but still here, at the end of the day.   Will be thinking of you and your studio and the abroad in Japan team and your close friends in Japan and wishing you all a speedy recovery in every sense.  Kindest regards  Tom North
OMG, so sad to see the condition of your new studio... Hope it can be recovered just as good as new...
Holy crap, I heard an earthquake hit but I didn't know it was a 7.4.
Just glad that you and everyone else are bloody alright, mate. Sorry about the studio, but at least you can rebuild. Take your time and stay safe.  Love you, man <3
Sorry to here / see the new studio so banged up.  Hope there is not major structure / electrical damage.  Thanks for the videos and I'm glad you're ok.  Hope everything works out for you. (As good as it can.)
Glad to hear you're all ok.
Glad you guyz are ok, sad to see the damage though
Awesome to hear your safe and sounds; that quake was rough even up here in Misawa
Wow scarey Chris glad you were not there but on another note what a cool studio with a ramen shop can we have a tour when its all fixed
I want to cry for you man :(
Prayers to you all! Best of luck! And keep creating!
Shame about the studio Chris, but glad to know you're safe!
Glad you're safe Chris! Sorry to see the studio like that and hope you guys can get everything back up. Felt this down in Tokyo and it was already terrifying.
So glad it wasn't all destroyed. Maybe sort out somewhere in the studio stable and clear from overhead stuff you can shelter if you get a quake while you're in there. Stay safe x
It would be super cool to repair the neko with kintsugi if you can find the pieces
Wow ur studio quite big compared to typical family size japanese home.
Perhaps you could fix the Neko with Kintsugi?
I had no idea this had happened. Glad to know that you and your friends are all ok, though.
A good time to do some kintsugi
his eyes were so red thankfully he manage to hold his tears. thats really sad thinking you invested a lot in this studio and you still havent even used it that much. wish you could recover the studio cuz i really loved it. be safe my guy.
aw noooo, thats terrible
I'm glad y'all didn't get hurt or worse! Those earthquakes can be scary! Just glad that y'all are alright. It's too bad the ramen shop didn't hold up so well. Good luck with getting things back in order! Stay safe! Take care!
Glad you're safe. I was in Shiogama when the earthquake happened and it was my first big earthquake I've felt. Truly a scary night, I'm sorry for all your lost and broken things, please take care in the coming aftershocks!
Fuck the studio. I'm very happy you're doing okay!
thank goodness you guys are ok. I hope everybody else got by with little to no harm
I’m really happy you’re okay and safe despite everything that has happened. I hope you can get everything back to together
time for some kintsugi i suppose. really sorry about the damage to your studio. it feels like it was only just finished!
The studio is all messed up glad you're safe🙏
I'm glad to see your OK, though keep us all updated on the repairs.  I'm very worried!
Oh man, this is genuinely really sad to watch. Having heard all the podcasts with you talking about how happy you were with the new studio.
Good guy Chris, cleaning up the streets. Glad to hear your alright, hope the studio doesn't have any long term damages
I had a ceramic figurine that I really loved and it broke. It ended up with a big hole in its head and I stuck a small pea plant in there. Then I loved it even more.
Flag you’re ok mate …stay safe 👍
That sucks mate. Most important thing is that you're all ok.  Wish I could help clean up!
Anyone noticed the amount of aftershocks after the initial large quake something not right with the plate near fukashima I've been having dreams of a tsunami larger than the 2011 9.1  earthquake 😔 let's hope not 🤞
Glad you are okay bro..At least the Ramen Bowl Survived
Even the aftershock sounds violent in that studio...
Rumbling.........rumbling......it's coming
I'm sorry that happened to your studio, but glad everyone was okay.
I always wonder if sharla and chris are together ❤️
7.4M would mean death sentence in my country, there will be a lots of bodies under the building rubbles Japan really is built different 👍
So sorry, Chris. I hope you and the studio recover quickly.
To be fair, it does look more realistic now with the water feature 😁 But yeah, earthquakes suck.  That 'this is it' feeling sucks.  That being on edge waiting for the next aftershock or earthquake sucks. Glad to see you and the other guys are alive and well though.  Take care of yourselves
I'm just happy you're okay. keep being awesome.
Insurance?
I’m so sorry Chris, but I’m glad you guys are safe!
makes me think Mt Fuji is waking up
Stay up bro fist bump from Cali keep your head up hermano 😎👊🙏
Glad you all are okay.
Don't apologize for being quite literally rattled.  I've only experienced very minor quakes here in British Columbia- like a jolt or two and that's it- and that was enough to cause a few sleepless nights worrying about "the big one".  I can only imagine it's worse to grapple with a big quake.
Wow.
holy cow! i hope everything else is also okay for you guys and the rest of Japan <3 i know earthquakes can be horrible.
Damn, quite a shake up if I do say so myself.
I am so sorry about this man. Prayers for you and everyone who experienced that!!! God bless!!!
You have a lot of kintsugi opportunity ahead of you. Glad you are okay.
water sound
So sorry to hear :( that's awful :(
Stay safe fam
Im just glad you're okay
Thats horrible stay strong Chris everything will go back to how it was and even better ❣️
I haven't experienced an earthquake before but did go through several intense hurricanes. Natural disasters are terrifying and besides precautions, there's really a sense of helplessness in the moment of it. As they say material things can be replaced, but glad you're safe.
So sorry for your damage. You are an inspiration to all that watch your videos we have been watching your videos everyone of then. Stay safe and keep your head up.
Poor Chris. Only good thing is you weren't there.
Glad you're okay, homie.  Hope all is well.
At least you can rebuild and tweak it, stay safe Chris
So sorry about the water damage and the things you lost in the studio (rip maneki neko), but I'm relieved to hear that you and your friends all seem to be safe, albeit a bit shaken up (pun not intended, my b 😅). I hope that things get fixed quickly and you feel a bit better soon. 💖
Man, this is honestly heartbreaking to see. My thoughts go out to everyone affected
Man so sad such a horrible thing happened right after the studio youd wanted for so long got finished. I dont know your situation with the property but if possible maybe salvage all the un damaged things, wait a little while and re build it in a more earthquake safe spot? I dunno thats prob not doable but I would hate to see you put all the work in to re build there and it happens again
Holy shit that’s cool-
Sadly the center area of the earthquake hasn't calmed down completely yet. Still multiple M4 happened in that area in the last 24 hours. :(
That's so scary. Stay safe Chris!
Dang, looks like the studio was pretty close to the epicenter. I hope you have insurance! So sorry this happened so soon after establishing the studio! Glad you stayed safe!
Glad the Team is Safe.
Glad that you are well! All the loves and prayers to Japan!
Glad you're safe Chris! Sorry to see the studio like that and hope you guys can get everything back up. Felt this down in Tokyo and it was already terrifying.
That's a certified ground breaking experience, glad your safe 😌
I'm glad that you are okey, I hope everything works out fine with the studio.
Glad you are ok!
Kintsukuroi the cat
damn that sucks
Japan's paper bureaucracy is infamous -- every time there's a quake, there's footage of offices and stacks of paper falling about.  When will Japan embrace the paperless-office?
Yikes! That's so scary! 😬But glad you're okay!
😭😭  That stinks man.  Glad you guys are all safe!
stay safe my guy, the damage was painful to watch but i’m really happy you’re safe :)
Good to know that you are all safe.
Sorry to see your wonderful studio trashed, but it can be redone. I went through the Loma Prieta quake in 1989 in California, and it was intense. Your studio looked like my apartment back then, but I was lucky in that houses collapsed only a few blocks away. Stay safe!
The earthquake has made a Britishman slightly emotional, that's how you know it was really bad.
That's heart breaking
Hey Man I lived in Nagano for 5 years and moved down to Okinawa last September. The earthquakes here can be terrifying but just remember you and your loved ones are alive and well, the studio is just stuff that can be replaced, people can not. I survived a horrific bus accident when I was traveling in India several years ago and trust me seeing dead bodies missing limbs or in half is not easy to deal with.  Glad your ok and looking forward to seeing some more content when you are back up and running. Ganbarimasu!
Damn, the new studio is in shambles. At least you weren't there when it happened and you didn't get hurt.
sorry chris …
F
As someone who was in Kobe for the earthquake in 95 (actually in Shioya outside the epicenter) I'm glad you're okay, understand how terrifying it is, and the next few days will have lots of small earthquakes that are also terrifying. Hopefully water, power, and gas are still working and the destruction is not too terrible. Hopefully you can get out and volunteer to help with those who didn't fare as well.
Glad you and the crew are safe and sound. Take good care and wishing a fast recovery for the people of Japan.
Oh man.  Obviously stuff can be replaced but so bummed for you.  Glad you’re okay.  Thoughts go out to you and all the people in Japan cleaning up (and those injured or worse).
I'm so glad you're safe!!! I hope everything settles down for you. And that you find time to decompress. Best of luck and wishes.
I'm glad you are all safe. It was definitely a scary earthquake.
This makes me so sad, your studio is awesome, and that's mother nature I guess. So sad cuz it's such a new studio, tough times but I'm sure you will rebound and I'm watching every video plus ads! Lol 😂👍
Chris, I'm glad to see you're ok. It was scary just listening to you talk about the earthquake. My thoughts go out to you, and I hope you and your loved ones are all able to recover and get back to normal life without any serious issues.
What is that flashlight over there????
I'm glad you are safe, I'm sorry about your studio, but glad its in take for the most part.
Geez, Chris, I’m so so sorry. But I’m so glad you’re safe and unhurt! Sending good thoughts from Tucson, Arizona…
Oof sorry about the studio. Really hope you had insurance. Happy you weren't injured and it's good to see that you have the support of your friends. :-s
Not the kitty cat!! But in all seriousness, glad that everyone is safe.
Glad you all are safe.
I'm glad you're safe!
You should keep the luck cat as a reminder.
I live in California you always prep for earthquakes even if you haven't had one in 20 years
Glad you're doing ok Chris, heartbroken to the damage caused to the studio. Hope Japan gets through this. Love from India
Chris, I'm from Mexico City. I don't know if you know this but Mexico and Japan are friend countries, we send each other help during earthquakes because we get some of the biggest. 7. 4 is fucking scary, I'm really glad you're alright. Those recordings you showed at the beginning looked awful, I'm really really glad you're ok. Hardest I've experienced is 8.2 (but it lasted wayy less than what you showed) and I almost shat my pants, thought I was going to die there. Seriously, I'm so glad you're ok.
So glad that you're safe! ☺️👍🏻 Hope you guys will be able to restore the studio back to before... 💪🏻💪🏻
Stay safe, maybe if you can find all the pieces of your maneki neko you can get some gold glue and kintsugi it
Could have been worst.  Please get it back to normal quick. At least this doesn't happen too often.
Please check in soon guys.  And maybe you could use kintsugi on the broken cat?w
Surely there's a kintsukuroi specialist left somewhere in Japan - make that Maneki-neko whole again, but this time with a story to tell.
The scariest part of this earthquake is liquefication. Luckly it didn't happened. In 2018 an earthquake with the same magnitude as this one struck palu, Indonesia. During this earthquake extreme liquefication occurred to the point where villages were moved up to 3km, thousands of buildings sinks and virtually all infrastructure were destroyed. It killed around 5000 people and destroyed tens of thousand of homes Here's an example: https://youtu.be/0PoSTUr9nik
Now you have abandoned ramen shop, I couldn't say its a blessing or a cursed one
Nice minimalist apartment  /Sarcasm
We had a 5.7 magnitude earthquake where I live in 2020, completely unheard of here. It woke me up and honestly was the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced! The power to the building was knocked out in the process and I was just braced in an archway, the building swaying, in the pitch black. I absolutely cannot imagine what a 7.4 would be like and honestly I was heartbroken to see the damage to your new studio. Hopefully things can be good as new there soon <3
Thankfully you guys are safe but I’m sure is frustrating from all the hard work you put into the shop
Glad u r ok
Damn
Good! Survive!
I was literally going "oh no, Oh no, oh no as we all walked in with you. Living in San Francisco I do think about what might fall down in an earthquake. Mostly just try to make sure there's nothing that's going to fall on my head if the quake happens in the middle of the night. Glad no one was hurt in the studio and hopefully much of the crockery is replaceable and the rest repairable. Take care.
glad you are safe. keep on keepin on.
Glad you're OK.
Glad you are ok, hope everything is good there. Wondering how's your bff Connor doing? :)
f for the studio, glad to see yall safe. time to drink all the booze and replace em then
Glad you’re safe Chris! Hope the damage of the studio will be repaired. Really one of my favorite studio
Drop. Cover. Hold on.
Damn, well nobody can prepare you for that. Good thing you're safe. I was thinking the same thing with my stuff here at home, I could put some small safe guards to at least stop the stuff from moving if a quake hits. A comment I saw below with 3M strips and an additional suggestion of mine might be like soft mats for those items to land on. Alas, wishing you more safety and success.
Glad to see everyone is alright and safe! but also very impressed at how that stand up mirror was still standing up xD
Terrible
I’m glad y’all are ok. My thoughts and prayers are with y’all.
I'm glad casualties were fairly low and that you're alright but it's so sad seeing the studio you're so proud of in such a state.... I hope repairs and fixing everything is manageable and things go back to normal for everybody!
So glad you’re safe!
so you DIDN'T turn your apartment into a noodle bar?!?! I feel so deceived
I'm glad you are all OK. It looks like a Newcastle kabab shop after a Saturday night fight. Love to you all.
I'm sorry for your studio, mate. Glad that you are Ok with your friends. Take care.
Sorry to see this Chris, all the best.
The main thing is you and the gang were safe at the time. Glad to hear you are OK.
Glad your ok, what broke sucks but can be replaced in time. Grab a pint of bitter and breath. I've been through several natural disasters and lost most everything but still here and you are too. Move forward, rant if you need to we can take it and keep going as your my favorite British wank on youtube, LOL.
The poor ramen shop, this has been a sad week. Stay safe everyone ❤
Yeh it's gonna happen again and again. Because Japan.
Hopefully you can get the studio back into good shape. Glad you are ok and safe!
Personally I have experience two great Earthquakes in Awaji island,Hanshin one on the 1tth of January,1995 and Northern Osaka one on the 18th of June,2018. tara for now
I'm so sorry this happened. I love your channel, I genuinely hope this doesn't set you back too much.
So my heart broke but I’m happy YOU AND OTHERS ARE SAFE 😭
I hope you and everyone in Japan are safe
Wow, big difference between the shindo 6 in Sendai and the 5 here in Ibaraki. We were rolling for sure, but not anywhere near that shaking. Ive lived mostly in mansions here in Tokyo above 4 stories, but my house in Ibaraki is one story, very different feeling that close to the ground.
Really hope it all gets fixed up and there’s no serious damage to the studio!! Glad to see you and Sharla and Natski are ok.
Glad you're safe, hope you get the studio back up and running soon.
Dude, I'm so sorry. I can't really do much besides watch your videos and send kind words though. I'm so so sorry.
The big ass mirror did not break! That's a plus in my book
hope u're alright man
I hope you guys are ok
Stay safe guys
My heart breaks watching this. Will you be moving to a new building? (I know you've invested so much) but-- I don't think you should stay there either. :( glad to know you're safe.
Felt it all the way over in Yokosuka on Tokyo Bay. We just had light shaking of the buildings thankfully no damage.
keep safe chris! from the philippines
Check if your property insurance policy covers the damage asap.
Glad you are safe man. Stay safe brother
I’m glad you’re okay! It’s a shame so many souvenirs fell and broke. What was the water source? Did a pipe break with all the shaking?
Gee whiz Chris! I feel awful that your studio was hurt so much, but it could have been a lot worse and I'm glad everyone's okay!
I'm glad that you're okay dude
Rip studio... Hope it gets back to top form.
Shit. So sorry to see this. I’m glad you are all okay ❤️
Hard worker, Good Slipper 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Poignant as ever Natsuki.
Glad everyone is ok.
The action figures :(
I was in Chile during an 8.8 earthquake and I genuinely thought the world and humanity were ending. It was a crazy moment so I know what you went through!
Glad to see you're safe. It feels horrible to see the studio in that state. Even the cat looks sad.
Imagine falling asleep at like 10pm and waking up to this.
So sorry to see this 😞
I'm so sorry for the damage, and so glad that you're all right otherwise.
Is your wifu collection safe?
Ugh you can just see and hear the pain in his face and voice 😔....Very glad ur okay and don't worry the studio will make a comeback better than ever ❤️
Sorry about your set but I'm glad you're alright. I was in an earthquake once, although it was nothing compared to this, but I understand how frightening it can be, wondering if it's going to get worse and bring the house down. Take care and good luck getting things replaced and repaired.
I am glad you are doing ok, oh that's so scary to watch, hope most people doing alright .
It would be awesome and really add character if you could get the cat fixed with gold connecting the pieces like glue- there's a name for it, but I forget
3:16 Damn, that sucks, all of that would be a good candidate for some kintsugi though! Better than just getting rid of it all
Glad you are okay, Chris. God bless. I plan to go to Japan in October/November once the border opens up and there are no quarantine restrictions. Hope I can meet you in person !
Down in Kanagawa, it was much weaker. But it lasted for an usually long time. I'm glad that you're alright
You should keep the broken cat, it has more character than before.
Best wishes on getting back to normal Chris.
Thank God you all are safe. I'm sorry of all the damage...🙏 for everyone affected. 😢 (I am from California, so, I know what it's like.)
Glad you're safe, man! Large quakes like that are terrifying. Hope the studio repairs aren't too bad.
Do insurance do anything to Earthquake damage? OMG studio...
Why does this world keep going to shit everyday... Stay safe man
Oh, that sucks so badly! I'm glad Natsuki was ok, though! And Chris, I guess.
Hopefully there will be some time before the next.
I am so glad you and everyone are safe.
Jesus... Glad to know y'all safe... Stay safe as always
Damn. So sorry this happened to you. Hope all is well my friend.
Hope you had insurance
It just makes it more authentic 🤗
Glad you and your friends are safe ..
0:09 What is that lightning?
I’ll just be another one in the sea of support! But take care everyone!
Glad you guys are ok! If you have a shop vac, those are really good for cleaning up flooding; if not just a mop and bucket works. I'd recommend having someone check for mold once you clear up the water and figure out where the leak is coming from; they might recommend drying inside the walls so mold doesn't form there, depending on how the water leaked through.
I'm so glad you guys are okay!
I'm so sorry about the studio, Chris, but I'm glad you all are ok!
Maybe this calls for a kintsugi episode? Half serious jokes aside, glad you're alright, Chris.
Awww damn, it’s so sad to see the studio all damaged ! Glad you and the others like aki, Joey, Connor and Sharla are ok !
All of that work to get the studio set up, only for it to be completely totalled by one of mother nature's period tantrums. Chin up, mate.
This made me genuinely sad :(. I know everyone's safe and that's awesome but seeing the studio in shambles after it made me,. Chris and everyone else so excited 😟
I'm so so sorry 😔 I'm glad you are not hurt. In 1994 I lived down the street from the epicenter of the Northridge Earthquake in Los Angeles CA my apt was destroyed it was the most difficult thing I ever experienced. I'm glad your friends were with you it's ok to be sad and it will definitely get better. Hang in there
Glad everyone is ok. Material things come and go. Youll have another cat
glad you're okay! cheers m8 wish you the best!
You should kintsugi that cat figurine.
GLad to hear you and your team are ok! Stay safe.
bring aki, she would earthquake proof everything
Possessions can be replaced your life can’t!  Be lucky you and your friends are ok!
stay safe that suck  best wishes for fixing the studio
Love Natsuki…
brooooooooooooooo! that suuuuuuuuuuuuuucks. I hope insurance covers all the damages :( TIME TO MOVE THE STUDIO TO A SAFER BUILDING
Yo Chris, glad to see you're safe and damages are minimal. Though I'd suggest the ceiling attachments and wall decors be inspected to ensure it's securely attached for extra safety reasons. Stay safe wherever you are brother, our prayers to everyone in that region so they won't have to go through that fear in the nearest time and hopefully for times to come
That sucks man. Definitely get that water stuff taken care of ASAP (you probably have, you're 16 hours ahead). It's sad when things that mean a lot get broken like that, I'm glad you guys are all safe and I hope you feel better soon.
Glad you, Sharla, and Natsuki are ok. Hope Conner and Joey and the rest of the expat youtubers are good as well!
Oh, Chris I'm sorry this happened.  Will there be insurance to help with the repairs?
Stay safe.
I'm glad you're alright, but it pains me to see all that time and effort in the studio reduced to a mess in mere minutes. Hopefully it's reparable, the damage at least, and stay safe over there!
Thank God you're all right, the studio being in shambles is hard but, least you weren't in there when it happened. Being from NY, I've never experienced an earthquake, but I can only imagine how terrifying that would be.   Be safe.
Good luck, stay strong!
That studio would have been a sideways ceramic shitshow! Is the candy ok?!
Felt it really good up in Aomori, so I can only imagine how scary that would have been in Sendai!
That hurt me to see the studio like that
Man, i don't even own the place but why i am feeling so sad now. I feel sorry for the ramen god that was on the wall though.
Be careful Chris! We hope you guys are safe!
I like how you had to use a plastic bag because you didn't have a pail. Well, I guess you have to deal with the aftermath just like ramen store owners would have to. You're legit now! xD
Happy to see youre safe. God bless you.
Oh, Chris, I’m so sorry! Your beautiful studio!
Glad you guys are safe. Hope the studio will be back soon!
Damn
Apple 🍏
I'm sorry to see Chris.
I had a 6.3 a few months ago, and that gave me Anxiety for a few days. nothing fell over, but it was a heck of a ride. A few years ago some debris from the Fukushima earthquake washed up near our shore. One item was a small boat from a school in Japan, and the locals fixed it up and returned it.
Buy a mop
Glad you're okay and the damage is minimal but even small inexpensive things can hold a lot of value to us. I hope your most treasured items survived this. Much love your way
My husband and kids sleep through. I was still awake... And I was so dizzy.  The house felt so wobbly...
This is why I don’t want to live in a building, I am genuinely scared of going through this  Anyways I’m glad you’re okay!
Is Tsunami warnings
気をつけてください！
I've experienced a 8.8 and it's not funny at all, good thing japan has good buildings
Thankfully yall are safe.
So glad you’re safe!
It was scary reading the news. Tsunami alert had me worried for a little. Your fans love you and your community. Let us know how we can help!
glad you are all okay! really sad to see the damage to the studio, best thoughts and wishes with the rebuild/cleaning
Could you fix the cat with kintsugi? Glad y’all are safe
Hope all you guys are doing alright. The beauty in this is that it makes you that much more grateful for life. Good luck rebuilding!
I remember my 1st big earthquake when I Nepal few years ago. It was terrifying thought we were going to die. Hope everyone in the affected place is alright.
About ten years ago in Chile we had a huge earthquake. It was around 3am. I woke up, realized it was an earthquake and stood up. The ground was moving as if we were on a boat, I couldn't stand. I tried to go to my sisters' room and I got hit by the walls like 5 times. We somehow got on top of a bed and the three of us hugged as shit was flying over. Books, a sheet of glass that was on top of a furniture, the tv, computer, clothes... Everything flying and then ended up on the ground.   All that while listening to our whole kitchen breaking. When it ended a lot of neighbours were trapped inside their apartments, so we kicked their doors down.   The cleaning afterwards is the worst. Our tv fell on top of our dvd and we were left with no tv and a flat dvd player. We had no glasses, lost like half of our dishes and we had a lot of wine and pisco that broke, about 15 bottles of booze or more. All the liquid was soaking the kitchen cabinets, lol. Imagine the smell. Then with every "replica" (the small baby earthquakes that come after the big one) we got petrified. We slept together on one bed for 2 weeks because my dad was on a trip and he couldn't come back to the house. We felt very unsafe.  Eventually things got back to normal, but once you live an earthquake you develop a really cautious mindset.
I’ve heard some people warning there might be another one in a week or so? (10-20% chance?) Not sure of the sources on that, but stay safe!!
im glad you guys are a oaky and the studio is atleast still standing
can't help it... I have tears flowing.
Be safe. Hope everything stays alright.
Chris. I'm really glad everybody is ok. Everything breaking really sucks, but I'm just glad you're alright. Cheers to your speedy recovery.
Super sorry about all the damage dude, what a shame.
Glad you all are safe!
I’m glad you and all your friends are alright!
I grew up in Hawaii with an active volcano and never had I ever experienced an earthquake that big!!! Wow!!!
Chico Xavier from Brazil mentioned the world will start shaking and reacting bad after 50 years of trial if the human race won't change. It has been three years past and we still in conflict. The best for you my friend.
Other people: Would probably be crying while filming the damaged studio British Man: **Quiet disappointment**
Sending positive vibes your way!
That’s so scary! Glad you all are ok, and I’m hoping the electronics survived all that water :/
Glad u guys are OK. Eepecially Sharmz-Senpai. ♥️🇵🇭
This is really painful to watch, everything you worked hard for damaged in just one night. Hope you don’t take this hit too badly my guy. We all support you.
I'm just glad you all are safe and healthy
Sorry to see the studio, know you put a lot of effort into creating that- but looking forward to seeing it back better!
Oh no this made me really sad, seeing how much time and effort went into the amazing set. Hope you manage to get it sorted x
Even in Tokyo the earthquake felt really strong and I can't imagine how bad it must have been in Miyagi/Fukushima. I actually had a similar thought, like "If I stay in my place, am I going to die now?" 😅 I was trying to figure out if I should go outside, bc other earthquakes are normally not that strong. You know that it's bad when the earthquake doesn't seem to end. It was really scary 🥲
I’m glad you weren’t filming in the studio at the time. Sorry it got messed up after getting set up recently. :(
Watching the studio in that state physically hurts me too
Put in ads in your next video. I will watch all of them to help you restore your studio!!!!
As Japanese, when we see things placed on top of shelves in other countries, we naturally think, "Oh, it would be dangerous if an earthquake were to occur. It is a trauma from experience, and it is always a fearful, unconscious caution that Japanese people have. The reason you were not aware of this is because you were a gaijin. But now you are a real Japanese. We are glad you uploaded to show real Japan on live. Our all prayers with Japan. Love from Australia.
Damn that was terrifying 😱
Maybe you can turn that Maneki-neko into Kintsugi art?
EEAS Official: Human Rights Is a Must, not Optional  Dominic Porter from EEAS called in to the meeting online.  Dominic Porter from the European External Action Service (EEAS), an agency connected with the foreign and defense ministry of the EU, also called in to the meeting online. As head of the division responsible for China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Mongolia, he said the EEAS is seriously concerned about the organ harvesting in China.  Porter noted that the hearing attendees had heard many findings from various investigations, including disturbing allegations ranging from sexual abuse, torture, DNA testing, and illegal detention to organ harvesting in China. More and more evidence collected has shown that Falun Gong practitioners, minority ethnic groups, and faith groups in China are being persecuted in China.  Porter also said that the EU strongly condemned the crime of organ harvesting in China because it is inhumane and immoral. Respect for human rights is not optional, it is a basic requirement that we should all follow, including in the field of organ donation and organ transplantation. He emphasized that human rights conditions will continue to be a focal point at multilateral forums for EU human rights actions.
I am sorry to see this, I wish you all for the things to get back to normal
Chris I’m so sorry your studio was damaged but glad you, Sharla and Natsuki are ok. The footage of the earthquake in the beginning of your video really shocked me, so frightening, I can’t imagine what it must’ve been like being there. 😢
Things can be replaced, but lives cannot be. I'm glad you are safe, the studio will be better than ever before!
well luckily you're safe
Damnit.... That was such a cool set I was looking forward to a year of amazing videos with all your friends
Damn, hopefully insurance helps a little with the cost of repairs/replacing stuff?
:( Damn it, but at least you guys are alright.
I feel so sad for everyone that experiences it.
I thankful you’re all right!
Dear Chris. What a relief to know that you're ok, guys. All the love and energy from Chile, the other country prefered by earthquakes 🥲.
its only material damage.  main thing is everyone is fine and not hurt.  gambatte Chris!
Super Glue All the Things back together! It can be rebuilt! It can be made better, Stronger! More Neko like!  Broken things still have character. Put the pieces back together and start anew <3. Be safe out there.
Glad you are ok. Hope you have insurance. Stuff can be replaced. Breathe.
I’m glad that you all are ok.
"Oh, I'm gonna die now.." This really resonated with me, felt exactly the same way when I was living in Fukushima during the 2011 earthquake. Stay safe mate.
I'm so sorry Chris! I'm glad you guys are safe and we look forward to your next video. In the meantime I will go back and try watching all, if not most, of your videos hoping that will help. Stay safe.
Glad to know you, Natsuki & Sharla are safe! Wish you guys all the best and recovery from this natural disaster.
Thank god for insurance.
Glad you're OK! Scary stuff :/
I don't think I'll ever want to live in Japan.
Glad to hear you're safe!!!
You need a mop and bucket. I think that would work better for that amount of water. Sorry for all that broken china... so sad 😔
I experienced a 6.7 quake in Hokkaido in September 2018 on the 11th floor of a hotel some 24 kms from the epicentre. My first quake and I too thought that was the end. Place was shaking, swaying and groaning but I kept telling myself the building was built to withstand these shocks and that kept my sanity. This one was far more powerful. The next day I was still in shock. Filled up my car and drive off without the patrol cap!  Thanks for the post Chris.
Glad to hear everyone's ok, Also the Neko can be fixed with super glue it doesnt look as bad as some of those ramen bowls.
Good that all the food you have here is fake.
Wow those were the most horrifying  videos of earthquakes I've never seen , hopefully you are ok, material things can be replace but never lifes
I was in the town closest to the epicentre Namie just last week and luckily for me came back to my safe home in Oita before it happened but unfortunately one of the host families we stayed with lost their grandfather in the earthquake. Quite devastating really. Wishing everyone recovers quickly
Stay safe man
Aww Chris, I'm so sorry especially with the new studio just being finished, glad you or no one else were hurt though
It woke me up from my sleep and I was like omg I'm going to die. Luckily I live in a safe building too. I'm glad you're safe too
Glad you're okay chris 🥺
Jesus.. take care!
“Hey guys! Check out my awesome new studio!” Enter a terrible earthquake. I’m glad you’re safe and I know it’s a “first world problem”, but I’m sorry your studio took so much damage.
I'm glad you're safe man. I hope studio 2.0 is everything you wish for and more!
🙏
That's really sad to see it all in pieces...  I'm glad that you're safe and that damage is not as bad as it could be. Also, lessons learned for the future I guess...
Glad y’all safe although studio was damaged it is just stuff and they can be replaced, Chris broad can’t. On the flip side you can film an abandoned ramen shop.
I ALWAYS WONDER WHY THESE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRIES WITH THE NICEST PEOPLE LIKE JAPAN, INDONESIA, TAIWAN  ALWAYS GET THE BRUNT OF MOTHER NATURE  AND THOSE F** UP COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH KOREA, CHINA AND RUSSIA ALWAYS GET A PASS... GOD MUST BE PLAYING FAVORITES.
Nooooo way not the studio please tell me your not abandoning the studio
why my wife is scared to return.
What is that light in the 3rd clip?
Glad you're safe and I'm sorry for the damages. Build back better and stay well!
holly shit
I was actually supposed to go to Sendai for spring break during this time. Glad i missed it. I never been in a earthquake.
Didn't know you guys had one till I saw this video. Glad you guys are okay.
Glad that you are okay Chris but it is a real shame about the studio which still was quite new. Do you really need to re-create it from scratch or maybe it is easy to fix? It is good you remembered not to switch on the lights due to the water leakage to avoid short circuits and danger to your health, not sure how good the electric safety measures are.
the fact that mirror still stand still is impressive
Pet sheets are way better for absorbing water on the floor, Sharla will know what I mean.
I remember the 6.9 in California and how at its worse I was bouncing up and down about a foot while laying down in my bed. Fun times and stay safe
Glad to hear you are okay sir been watching all your vids you actually inspired me to try and move to japan breaks my heart you had to go through that hope all is well stay safe
I sorry Chris that sucks major ass
what was that downward moving light at @0:09 ?
How is Natsukis salon?
I live on the Japan Sea coast and we are mostly immune from those huge quakes. Dont know how people live over that other side with the constant threat of the big one
I'm so sorry for your studio! You will rebuild and become stronger! Love from Tokyo.
"oh I'm going to die now." is exactly what I thought during the 2011 Earthquake here in Christchurch. As horrible as is this is, I'm glad this didn't eventuate into something worse. I feel deeply for those in the Tōhoku region many of whom were only recently commemorating loved ones they lost in 2011.
How is your newly renovated apartment?
Hopefully some of the damaged set pieces get some wabisabi treatment
Glad to see you were fine after an earthquake of that magnitude. But... that clifhanger tough...
Risoto did it, the sorceror!
I wanna invest😩🥺
I'm sorry about your studio, Chris.  That's really heart breaking.  I'm very happy that you and your loved ones are safe, though.  And I'm glad you've got people with you so you don't have to be alone cleaning up the aftermath... even if all they do is film and provide commentary :D
I’m glad you’re all ok
Well, this whole thing is obviously Natsuki's fault. You should sue for damages, Chris.
Ok but why is someone Titan shifting at 0:09
No matter the severity of the damage, it’s always hard to see something you worked hard for become rubble.
Glad you're safe guys.
I live in Tochigi and even here it was shaking a lot and I was honestly quite scared. Our building kept on shaking for way too long and we also had a lot of stuff falling down. But your studio took quite a heavy hit… I'm so sorry for that. It's good you had your friends with you to keep you company, it's really nice to know that Sharla and Natsuki were there for you even though they must have been terrified themselves. The news said to look out for another possible heavy earthquake during the coming week, so please take care and try to stay safe. It's probably better to stay at home for the time being than editing at the studio.
Does insurance in Japan cover earthquake damage??
Where did the water come from???
That's so sad =( I'm glad you're all safe though! Goodluck with everything!
So sorry your new studio took so much damage. Its not a loss of life but it is a loss. I hope you are able to recover and rebuild somehow even better.
That really sucks. I hope things aren't as bad as they seem in the studio. But overall, just glad you are safe!!
Sorry to hear about the damage. I felt it here in Nagoya. Not so strong, but strong enough that I knew that somewhere was getting hit really hard. It definitely was reminiscent of how the Tōhoku earthquake felt here. Hopefully this will be the last big one for a while.
I'm super glad you guys are all alright, I cant imagine what it's like for the earth under your feet to suddenly gain a will of it's own. I don't think I would ever trust anything again after that. Also, I didnt realize the studio wasnt where you lived. I thought it was an apartment as well. Might want to get some gloves for cleaning up that water though, could be someone's sewage line.
Zauq
Glad everyone is safe, material items can be replaced.  Hang in there.
This is truly awful. I’m so sorry mate. Prayers for you and everyone that’s been affected by the seismic event. Wish you all the best.
Oh my!  So glad you all are safe. The ramen shop looks better than I thought it would.
Don't worry, global nuclear destruction is coming soon, so all these earthquakes, pandemics and massive inflation/price rises will seem like nothing in comparison because we're all going to be killed horribly and our countries blasted into ashes and years of darkened nuclear winter. For context, modern nuclear warheads are 1000 times more destructive than the ones dropped on Japan in 1945, and Russia and the US alone both have about 6000 of the things each. All it takes is ONE nutter in power to launch a single nuclear weapon and the instant response will trigger a chain reaction between multiple nations.
Wabi-sabi the broken pieces! :(
Jesus I’m glad you’re ok!!
I see that on the USGS. Why are there no earthquakes in Russia or Ukraine? There doesn't seem to be any tectonic activity.
Damn, if I had the money, I would donate man. I really enjoy your channel. Stay safe bro.
I'm glad to see that you yourself are ok. Really sorry about the studio; it's obvious how much it meant to you.
Anime man's room - destroyed.
So glad you’re all okay!!
So sorry. But glad you were unhurt. Thoughts are with you.
Oh man Chris so sorry about the studio damage but thankfully you weren’t there in person or got hurt. Thanks for the update and hopefully everything gets back to normal
Damn only a few months old for the new studio and it’s devastating to see what happened to it and go down the drain, hopefully it could get back to operational status soon
I'd rather experience and go through an earthquake event in Japan than anywhere else on the planet. And yes, it is a disturbing experience, regardless. Glad you are all well.
just super glue
Lemonade out of lemons. Studio cleanup livestream!  what do you all think?
Please stay safe Chris!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see you safe ^^ If we can ever help with anything we gotchu! Hope you're able to get everything back on track and stay safe
I wish you all the best in recovering your studio. I love your content and know you will get back on it!
Glad you are safe. I'm sorry about your studio. I hope you are able to get things better situated soon.
im so sorry about this happening to you and everyone in japan chris, i wish you good luck and i hope everything goes well tho :) <3
I'm glad to see you are safe out of all this, Chris! I have best wishes out for you, and anyone in Japan affected by this earthquake! I saw news about this quake while at work earlier, and it made my heart sink. 😭 May you, Chris, Abroad in Japan, as well as anyone there affected, be well and safe; I keep my heart, mind, and thoughts abroad, and out for the people in need.
In regards to your favorite smashed pottery, perhaps this might be an opportunity to repair the broken ceramics with Kintsugi, i think that may be overkill with the kind of ceramics you had, but if a certain one means a lot to you, perhaps it worth it?
Hey Chris, I’m so happy and glad to know that you, Natsuki and Charlette are not harmed. Sorry to see the damage done to your studio. Let us fans know what we can do to help.  Big love from BC, Canada 🇨🇦
Glad you're okay Chris! hope the studio comes back better than ever!
As literally 95% of my relatives live in Japan and Okinawa, I always hear about how used to earthquakes they are, but this one was still a doozy. Glad you're OK, and I feel bad about the damage to the set. Good luck repairing everything, and thanks for the update, Chris!
Forget the earthquake, is that literally aliens landing at the 0:10 mark?
can you make your instagram handle just the actual link to your instagram in the bio section like twitter and facebook is?
When I heard about the earthquake near Sendai yesterday, the first thing I though about was your studio.  I'm glad to see you are alright and that despite the broken dishes and the water leak, things don't look too bad.  がんばれ！
Glad you all are ok, from Canada
I'm very happy you all were spared injury and are otherwise OK.
Glad you are ok mate, my god.  I'm quite broken up and sad about the set, more than the set is broken up.  I'm all teary eyed.  I'm so sorry, all your hard work and wonderful effort... but you know what... it's ok.  You can do it again, you can do it better, and EVERYTHING You didn't like, you can fix!  I'm just glad you are ok and everyone else is ok too.  Hugz! <3
Syukur kau nda apa apa oh chris… jaga diri chris …
I think a good positive video to do with this would be the before and after the clean up. Just to show there is still hope and life moves on even after a earthquake.
maybe natsuki was there already, but the fact natsuki was there to help during this was really touching. seeing your friendship in the toughest moments was touching.
No it will happen again it's just a matter of time. You need to fix down the main appliances. Use dampening springs if you have to.
Afterquake. Happens after a big earthquake.
I'm glad you're all okay. That sucks about the studio, please take care.
That looked f*cking terrifying.  I'm so sorry about all the damage to your new studio, but the most important thing is that you're safe and you have your friends to help you sort things out and vice versa. What has me worried is that flash of lightning in the distance during that Earthquake footage. It was like something went off and made a huge explosion.
3:15 I imagine you will get a tonne of these now from fans..... at least 30 I'd say.  Sorry this happened to you, hopefully all of what was damaged is either fixable or easily replacable.  You could try to find all the pieces to fix the lucky cat, or you could try find some in Japan. There are very similar, if not the same, ones on Amazon but they are pricey, probably because they are imports I assume.      4:48 BOO SLIPPERS!!! =3
Holy cow!
I pity the person on the toilet…
Man, you've got balls of steel living in Sendai, I swear. Glad you're okay <3
5:00 Oh man, would you look at those dope slides
I'm glad you were safe, Chris. Sorry about the studio but you being safe is much more important!
Oooof. Worst I've had was an upper 6-level earthquake when I was in high school! That was no fun, but also wasn't the worst ever, and is something that reminds me about how the magnitude scale isn't linear. Also, Chris you maniac if you get a big aftershock go under the damn table!
Im glad u are ok, I live in chile and in 2010 we has a 8.5 richter, I know how horrible the experience is, hope everyone is ok.
Glad you're safe!!!
For me the next video recommended is one of yours Chris, ‘12 reasons to NOT move to Japan!’ If earthquakes aren’t part of that, then I think this can be added to it?! 😂👏👌
The ending felt like a cliffhanger for the next episode 😮
Thank God you are ok.!!!
not to worry, those cats they sell everywhere
Whoah, Chris Ramen bar suffers the most... i wonder if Ryotaro is Ok, since i just saw Sharla and Natsuki in the background
Chris! Please stay safe I’m from uk & wanting to visit Japan soon seeing your genuine reaction as an Englishman is pretty scary
I'm so so sorry about your studio, but I'm glad to know that you are ok...
Aww dude praying for you and the rest of Japan. Hopefully you will bounce back bigger and better than before.
Oh my God. Luckily nothing happened to you. Where did all the water come from?  I wouldn't know what to do in an earthquake.  Hopefully not too much was broken.
Glad you are all okay. As soon as I saw the alert on my phone, it brought back memories of when I was living in Tokyo during the 9.1 earthquake in 2011. Especially since this one happened at night for you all. I remember all of those aftershocks waking me up after the 2011 earthquake and being woken up from a dead sleep like that is scary as all get out.
NNNOICE. Oh well gotta keep on. Ramen Shop 2.0?
Your poor studio😥 Glad you and your friends are safe!
I feel so bad, he just got his studio made properly and he was really proud of it, hopefully he can fix it back up
Hope that gets fixed soon so you can start videos again. Also please get extra insurance for property damage and contents Incase another earthquake happens. Take care.
Happy you are okay.  I think your apt looks better than I thought it would because of the size of the quake.
Aki secured her apartment really well…you should talk to her…glad you are ok…
Hang in there man.
Well I hope you get the Ramin shop up and running soon. My prayers and best wishes are with you.
May God provide resolution and restoration. ✝️❤️👍🏼
Glad you're all okay mate - good luck with the repairs
Best of wishes from Canada
Where did you hide when it was happening?
4:20 top left 🤨
So happy you're all ok out there!!
One of the things I admire most is Japan's response to the 1995 earthquake. The development of technology for resistant structures in the face of earthquakes is important to where I live. I think I was maybe six or so when I experienced a 6.8 earthquake, and while my US State is still behind in adopting better developments, progress has been made at least.
Sending love!
Hey so sorry to see this I know how much work we put into our studios best of luck in your and your teams recovery
Glad you're safe!  Did you figure out where the water was coming from?
This is crazy. I am in Alaska and hardly felt it
I'm just thankful that you all were not hurt. ❤️
I'm glad you had friends with you it woulda been so much harder. I was very emotional and it's not even my studio ramen shop.
So glad you & your pals are okay!  What a pain to have to clean up all those shattered bowls and things though :/
Having experienced a 7+ myself that caused so much damage etc I feel you on the being terrified. I am glad to see you're physically okay and sorry your studio got damaged. Fingers crossed you don't have many if any big after shocks like we did.
keep safe guys!!!
Holy shit  sauce
All that matters is you are ok 👍🏻 love your channel and content God Bless Chris stay safe . 🥰
Some things got broken, you wound up with a leaky pipe most likely, but the damage doesn't seem too bad. Honestly you got off pretty well considering the damage that could have been done. Nothing for it but to let out a sigh, pick up the pieces and get it sorted. Be safe, check on people, help out where you can and carry on.
Holy crap! My Japanese teacher lived in Sendai for 13 years and she got emotional during class today as she was worried about friends  they were all ok thankfully!
In 2019 we visited the Okumura museum and I experienced the earthquake simulator chair. The 7.0 was genuinely terrifying and I was almost in tears imaging what it was like for Japan. I'm truly glad you and the team are safe. Love from Canada ❤️🇨🇦
💖
Oh no this is terrifying! We are all glad you are ok! Hope to see everything back to normal soon :)
Talking from experience, I live where earthquake is not uncommon. You will NEVER get used to it.
dang that sucks, and it wasn't even up for very long too
My Father was sent on a business trip to Tokyo and stayed in a new high-rise hotel right around the time they were implementing the new building codes. My Dad's room was up on the 30th floor of this hotel. He was looking out on the skyline and it was moving. He called the concierge freaking out and the concierge told him it was a earthquake. The concierge came up and took him into one of the basements of the hotel and showed him one of the many springs the building was built on. They were extremely proud of it and I can understand why.
Hope you and all your friends are safe Chris
Glad everyone seems to be OK. I hope you can get the set back up and running soon!
Fix your cat with Kintsugi!!!
GOOD LUCK🙏👍
I felt really sad seeing the studio like this after being so happy for Chris finally getting it, I hope you can recover some of the damaged items and glad you are safe Chris🙏🏽
😢
"aah, everythings better now" as he places the picture on the shelf: had be laughing so hard i fell of my chair
Glad you're safe!  That's the most important thing!
Oh man, I feel so sorry for you and all the other people that have so much work ahead of them to repair and rebuy things that they put their heart, time and money in. Of course, staying safe and not being physically affected by an earthquake of this quality is the most important thing. But man, seeing you walk through your shop that you built with so much care and love to detail. As someone that's into art and aesthetics and loves this studio like everyone else, I really feel your pain o.o Wish you guys all the best for the upcoming days, fixing this mess. Hopefully even the tiniest patreon donation can help substituting some broken things. ♥ Much love from Germany
Honestly all that matters is that you are truly safe. Things can be rebuilt, but there is only one awesome Christ Broad!
I'm glad it destroyed your idolatrous cat doll, hope you can let that kinda stuff go and get on your feet and do good things. :)
I know how special finally having your dream set is to you so it's sad to see so many items broken everywhere. I hope they fix that water leak and replace that part of the ceiling soon to avoid mold and more damage. I'd say definitely keep the Maneki-neko as a reminder that you made it through that day and aren't giving up. I'm so glad you're physically okay though. When I found out about the earthquake I immediately went on social media to check if creators I follow were okay.  All that footage you added at the beginning looked terrifying. I've lived my life with the whole "the big one is overdue" thing in Southern California and I seriously hope I'm not living here when that big one does happen because our construction isn't as good for withstanding earthquakes as in Japan by the looks of it. I don't have any high bookcases or pieces of furniture and anything ever hanging near my bed because I always think about what would happen in an earthquake.
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
I live in New Zealand (not a local though) and will never forget my first earthquake. While it was nowhere near as bad as yours, it was scary nonetheless. So I really feel for you. So good to hear you are safe! I hope you can recover your studio. Kia Kaha, love from NZ.
Glad that Chris' safe. Having close people like Natsuki & Sharla in times like this is priceless.
I can see you're really affected by this given that this set was really one of your goals. At least it wasn't as damaged to the point that it's irrecoverable. Most importantly, I'm glad you're safe Chris along with Natsuki and Sharla. :)
Honestly you're apartment looks like someone rob you. Keep safe
I've only ever experienced a very minor earthquake (basically the aftershocks of an earthquake coming from further down south of where I lived). It was like a gentle swaying for a minute or so and felt really weird. My brother and I were in the living room when it happened and we asked each other if it felt like we were swaying. We then looked up at our chandelier and it was swinging side to side. x_x
Damn, Chris, that doesn’t look great.  At least everyone is okay.  As for rebuilding, let us know if you need anything.  I think between everyone here, we can probably get a good load of stuff your way.
I'm so glad that you are safe Chris. Two days ago there was 5.5 magnitude earthquake in my province. Though I didn't even noticed it. Like Japan, Indonesia is also prone to earthquake. I hope things get better soon.
That's honestly so horrific..I'm glad you're ok, Chris!
gonna be hard to replace the props
Glad you are safe Chris! hope you all stay safe.
What’s that huge flash of light around 10 seconds?
I'm sorry your studio got damaged, you just built it. I hope you can repair or replace everything.  I'm glad you and your friends seem to be unharmed.
At least you all are safe!  All the “stuff” can be replaced.
So sorry, glad you are all safe though
So glad you’re alright. But the damage to the studio is so sad to see. Does Japan have earthquake insurance for houses and businesses?
Thank you for the update on your situation in Sendai.  Very sorry to see all the damage and broken keepsakes.  But as you said, it was a good thing that you and your staff were not in the studio apartment.  Please take care and be safe.
So sorry dude -_-
Glad to see the ramen is still intact
本当に大変な地震でしたね
Genuinely gutted for you dude but great to see you’re doing ok. Poor maneki neko: fix him with gold!
Glad you are safe sorry about your studio.
Sorry to see what has happened to your set, it was amazing. On the bright side, all that water on the floor adds to the ambience of your grungy alley way vibe.
Glad to hear you're OK, stuff you own can be replaced and covered by renter's insurance hopefully! Keep your chin up, stay positive, and the studio can be restored soon. Thanks for the update.
We are all so happy that you guys are OK! The ground cannot defeat you!
Puts life in to perspective innit
So glad you guys are ok🙏🏼❤
I'm so sorry mate. Seems like the whole planet is F*ed right now.
Wow... just wow. 👀
Glad you are safe Chris and Friends.
Should turn most of these items into kintsugi art and reuse it and have it as a memory :)
Mate stay away from the windows during an earthquake. Best of luck to you and the crew
Glad you are safe, now go watch the anime “Tokyo Magnitude 8.0”.
That lucky cat is from Daiso
This experience probably made you a little bit more Japanese. Glad you guys are ok.
It would be a tragedy if Natsuki's English improved even the slightest.
Things can be rebuilt, stuff can be repaired. It is painful to see the studio in this state but I'm glad that you are alright. Stay safe, take care and best wishes to everyone affected by the earthquake. ❤
Glad you're ok, bud. It's just stuff. Btw, what's the insurance situation like in Japan?
I hope you can recover from this Chris. Take your time to clean up and just do whatever you need to during this post-earthquake. I cannot imagine  how terrifying it must have been but I want to emphatise of your situation. Stay safe.
ok i heard it was a 6.0 and i was like 6.0? being a californian thats not that bad. japanese can handle that no problem. we will see minor structure damage if any. 7.4 changes the game a bit. thats getting a bit bigger. those are big boy numbers. glad everyones ok.
I'm so sorry this happened 😞
Good to know that you are safe and well. I hope you have seen the last of it. Good luck!
"Oh, no, all the water." *Stares at you in Fukushima.* =0[.]o=
I also got a little emotional watching this and the studio. Glad you guys are all well! Thats the most important part but yes it is also just fine to feel like this really sucks!
you should now do a whole episode, where you find a craftsman who does that thing where they piece a broken thing together, but with gold, and have him do that cat you like.
Honestly it’s just such a shame since he has been dreaming about this place for years and only recently got it built. I actually really feel for you Chris. Hopefully you can fix it up soon
Chris, what about doing Kintsugi on your favorite cat statue? It would make for a great story if you can find the other broken bits from it in the mess.
Happy to hear you're safe Chris. My condolences about the damages to your studio, but most important of all: YOU are irreplaceable, and the key ingredient that makes your channel exceptional. Stay safe, and good luck with the repairs!
Thought of you and Sharla when I saw it was near Sendai. Glad you are OK. It was a 4 on the Japanese scale here in Hachioji, west of Tokyo. Knew it was a big one because Hachioji is usually pretty stable in earthquakes and this was the biggest I had felt in a long time.
Not the brand new set!!!! Glad you guys are safe out there!
I am glad you all are safe. I work for Japanese company but my office is in London. I was really worried about my colleagues and friends in Japan. It looks so scarry !! It's a miracle.
Chris I would love to help in any way I can. I live in Hourinouchi and would love to meet as a big fan. You have helped me during my move to Japan.
Best wishes Chris!
I don’t understand how I slept thru this!  I live in Yokosuka and I didn’t wake up at all. My dog didn’t even bark. In fact he was passed out asleep along with me and I live in an apartment.
Glad you're safe man... that really is terrible that it happened. but hopefully it wont be too bad to replace the broken stuff
Glad you're all OK and that you didn't get squished by the fallen wall.
I'll blame this on the nine tailed fox that got out of that rock last week🦊 we're having a great 2022 so far.
Need some Earthquake Putty sent from California to you? Great for anchoring knicknacks down!
Hope everything goes back to normal sooner than later! Great to see u guys up and about so soon. Thoughts and prayers to all friends in Japan 🙏🙏🙏
As long as people are ok the rest while sad might be able to be fixed. Stay safe.
Oh I was so sad to see your lovely studio damaged. But glad you are safe . X
Oh geez. Well, we're glad your okay at least!
Stuff like that changes you a bit. When the power went out in Texas in the winter 2021 I honestly was never so unprepared and worried about the next winter good luck
So tragic to see glad everyone is ok that's the main thing everything else can be replaced. Very sorry about everything.  P.S. nice slippers 😉
Oh wow!   That would have probably been on the NHK channel as well.  Glad you guys are ok.  Stay Safe everyone.
is it bad that when they walked in and saw all the liquid on the ground i just assumed it was a massive waterfall of smashed liquor bottles that caused the floors to be wet lol
Impressive you were able to get this up so quickly, im glad you're safe and I have to say, as soon as I heard the news, first thing I thought was, "Hope Chris' studio is alright". Which I'd have to say, the detailed facades all look like they help up pretty well. Good luck sorting out all the knick knacks that were thrown about, hopefully a lot can be salvaged.
Wishing you all the best Chris. ❤
... this has to be so heartbreaking after going through all the trouble of getting the set built for you. :(
I'm glad you're all ok.
Sad to see what happened to the Blade Runner theme studio. Its just a few months old and now this happened. Hopefully everything there will be nailed down or double taped.
破壊と再生 Welcome to Japan guys.
Bollocks, sorry Chris, hope the leak gets sorted quickly
I was living in Japan during the 3/11 earthquake. At the time I was in Tokyo but it was still quite scary, especially since it was the first earthquake I actually felt.
Holy crap...thank god you guys are all safe.
I'm glad you're all ok! It's sad to see the poor studio in such a state but I hope you get the water issue fixed soon. Priority is that you're all safe - I can't imagine how frightening it was
Be a reed, not an oak tree. Bend with the wind.
Bro... that smeems bad. I cant do more than this but the best of luck to you.
Oh my. Thank you are ok. Words fail me. 😨
Chris it's so sad to see that happen to Japan, but thankful you're all safe.
that looked brutal, hope you get everything fixed and replaced ok. the main thing is your safe and healthy!
That's really sad. But hey, now it looks just a Yakuza 0 alley after Majima have beaten the s* out of some random goons.
Thank goodness you guys are safe!  Now I know why the dishes are cheap!  Be careful guys!  Greetings from Canada!
When God send a message how about 2 nukes aren't enought for their sin...
Shit mate, when you showed us the set for the first time and told us it was in a very old building I always thought, why make it here, what happens when a big earthquake hits and it destroys everything??? But hey atleast you and everyone is safe and sound. It's sad to see the place in it's state now, hopefully everything will be back to normal and maybe look even more badass in the future! Stay strong bro 💪
😢 I'm glad you guys are safe. The moment I found out about the earthquake, I immediately dmed my friend who lives in japan  Thankfully he is safe as well.
Damn, hope you can get all things back to normal and glad you're all safe. Maybe you gotta glue some props stuck to make it a bit safer or something!
I'm so sorry to see this man. It hurts even from an outsider perspective. stay strong! things get better.
It’s been years since I have commented on any YouTube video. All I can say is I’m sorry man. Looking at that made me so sad. Everyone knows how much work and love was put into your studio. Thanks for all your very entertaining content!  I know thanks from your fans don’t fix things but know you have a lot of support from people around the world. Love and respect always.
Hope your studio is insured, I really do. Hate seeing all the damage after earthquakes and tornados and things. Keep us posted.  Good luck.
Glad that you are ok, Chris. I felt the tremors here in Tokyo and while it wasn’t too bad down here, the shaking lasted way too long for my tastes. Japan would be great if it weren’t for all the natural disasters. Coming from the east coast of America, I never experienced an earthquake or typhoon in my entire life and it’s shocking to release that I could loose everything in a heartbeat.
Wtf Nope
Oh boy, hope you've got insurance on the studio and get that water fixed soon. Water damage can absolutely ruin a building.
Hopefully you have some good insurance and can get things back to normal sooner rather than later.
Glad you're okay. It's a shame about the studio, but those items can be replaced. We can't replace you! Take your time recuperating  and stay safe.
Living in California- this inspired me to get sticky putty for my special items and move pottery.... down... far far down.  Im sorry for your loss of so many good items like your Makineko, but more glad you all are okay/safe after this!
4:20 Uh, well, unfortunately...there WILL be another one, very soon!  That's how earthquakes work.  It's called an aftershock.  And then there will probably be a 3rd and 4th and 5th one in the coming weeks, too.
Oh Chris, I'm so sorry... My heart goes out to you. So much hard work just lost in an instant. 🤯
I stop watching for a little bit and now you've got 2.5 million subs and your own studio??? time flies, much like most of the crockery in this video :-)
you and your new studio don’t deserve this…
Really unfortunate to see that happen Chris. Words of comfort may feel shallow, but I truly do wish you all the best.  Tough times for sure, but it's the fact that we get through it all that makes us strong.  Hope to see you doing better after this. After all, a snarky, sarcastic and happy Chris is the best one  :P
You should go off grid and buy more Mid Century Modern furniture.
I'm glad to see the three of you made it without injuries!  Hopefully the water damage wasn't from the toilets upstairs...
Glad you're safe. ❤
That area really hates March.
sorry bout the studio man, thankfully no one got hurt
Damn. I've gotten used to sleeping through Earthquakes since I live in California, since they are mostly always so small. I doubt I'd be able to sleep through that though. Glad everyone is safe.
Glad your safe. We had a 7. Earthquake a year or two ago here in Utah and I where I live was a few miles away from the origin area and it shook the ever living shit out of my house so I totally get the on edge feeling. Glad y’all are safe and can re build and fix the studio.
Glad you guys are all right and the studio is (mostly) in one piece. :)  Maybe try super glue on the cat if you can find the other pieces?
I was about to say that someone went in and vandalized the set, but i remembered that's actually how Chris made it xD jokes aside i'm glad you`re okay mate, stay safe!
Damn, and the studio was brand new too. Obviously great you guys are save but it's a shame about the studio getting wrecked
Hope you get everything sorted out quickly!
So sorry for you beautiful, beloved studio. But I'm glad to see that you haven't lost your sarcasm even in those terrible circumstances. ;) Take care, Bro!
best wishes dude, it takes a lot for most ppl, let alone men in the modern world to actually say they were legitimately scared for their lives and Id say you're handling it really well. I've never been in an earthquake (I'm an east coast American) so if you say it was crazy bad, Imma just have to take your word for it.
Actually got a bit emotional watching this. I know how much Chris loved this studio so it must really hurt seeing it taken down like this. Super happy Chris is okay though
how did I not know about this da fuc
Glad to know all you guys are safe! I could never imagine being in an earthquake. Sending well wishes 💜
Are you chubbier ?
I'm hesitant to give a thumbs up cause I feel heartbroken from all the damage, but glad everyone is safe. You can rebuild and will be stronger from it
Aww, man! So sorry, Chris 😟
Jesus and I thought I was having a bad day, I'm glad to see your ok bro.
I'm so happy you're doing alright Chris! I can't even begin to imagine how terrifying it was. Let us know if there's anything you need help with to repair your studio like a GoFundMe or something like that. I can't imagine how uneasy it might have been during those aftershocks though 😰
Great you're all good. Only broken stuff, could have been so much worse.
oh that was terrifying even in Tokyo, I really thought my house would break down. I recommend not to buy anything yet, since the second comeback might happen any time soon. I hope the next one won't be this strong. Everyone stay safe!
Genuinely heartbreaking to see the studio in such a state. I hope everyone is safe and can start to get everything back in order! <3
Save that cat and if you can find the prices glue it back together to keep as a memorial to the event and a link to the past.  It may not be meaningful to you , maybe it is, but through your channel you know have many thousand people around the world , that when they heard of an earthquake in Sendai, we thought “I hope Chris and Natsuki are ok”.  Greetings from/aus Sammamish
Glad everyone is safe
So glad you and your friends are okay.
F
as someone that has lived through 2 large earthquakes only a year apart each that took out a large part of my city, i know what its like. you will be on edge for a bit but the feeling will pass and all will be good. glad that you are safe
I hope everything is ok in the end!
I heard about this earthquake after the fact from people on social media. I honestly didn’t expect it to be how it was from the footage you clipped in.
Japan's Engineers are commendable to keep as much safe as it has!
I'm glad you're OK.
Best wishes things can be replaced but at least your okay
Glad you're doing alright Chris, but watching you go through the studio was heartbreaking 💔 please keep the neko, hope you can rebuild the studio again
Glad to hear you’re ok, you’re all ok. Must’ve been absolutely terrifying. Stay safe all.
Wow! I live in Fukui and I didn't feel anything. I was in Gunma during the 2011 earthquake.
Glad your safe
Keep the manekineko cat as an reminder of today. Glad you are the team are all safe, objects can be replaced, people cant.
Atleast you and your friends are fine Sad for the Studio and everything tho :(
RIP Kitty
Glad you're safe. I think others have said the same thing, but if you've been able to save most of the pieces of the maneki-neko, there's a golden opportunity (ugh) for a kintsugi/kintsukuroi video.
Im glad you are ok but this has to suck for you.... your studio is so new :(
Glad you’re okay Chris, sorry to see your studio damaged.
dang he has to clean a ramen shap, a street , and a store all in one sitting. Things only a few men in the world can experience
I am so glad you are all safe!
I'm happy to see you're OK!
man im gutted just seeing this, i can only imagine how you feel. glad your safe.
Glad to hear you, friends, and staff are all safe! Hope there's no nasty aftershocks.. shakes?
I think a beautiful idea would be to gather all the Maneki Neko pieces and put it together using kintsugi?
You can pull a Ken Watanabe and rebuild during the calm after the storm, best of luck!
Our prayers are with you in your team. I'm glad that you weren't hurt or anybody else keep on being awesome.
When I heard the news I immediately thought of Sharla due to her last stated location that I could remember anyway. I did not realize that all of you were affected.  Thank the Gods you are all ok 😮   How’s Norm?
Scary that this was an aftershock from the 2011 earthquake and that more are expected.  Stay safe!
As someone who lives in within the Pacific Ring of Fire (I'm from the Philippines), we got used to earthquakes and it really is devastating. Last year we have like 6 earthquakes within 5 months and it's horrifying if you live in a tall apartment complex. Imagine you're in a 23rd floor and the building collapses. Hope you're all safe there Chris and everyone in Japan.
Glad everyone is ok! Experienced the earthquake in Kyoto back in 2019. I thought that was bad but this took the cake. Glad your alright~
Glad to hear your safe Chris! Wishing you and everyone in Japan impacted by this well and stay safe everyone.
As the great Rutger Hauer said in a certain movie in the early '80s as you well know....."that hurt"... Hang in there! 👍🥃
Just glad you’re okay! Things can be replaced at least. Sending all the good vibes to the people of Japan as they bounce back
Glad you’re OK Chris! Stay safe…!
You're kind of lucky. It's a joke. I'm glad you're all alright 👍
Glad you're okay and sorry for all the damage done, especially to your expensive studio. It's a good thing the building didn't collapse, I live in an area where an earthquake that large is a possibility and nothing here is built to withstand anything larger than 6.5 magnitude earthquake
Bro I'm soooo sorry that absolutely blows :(
This was and still is the coolest set. I'm sorry, dude. As a long time fan, I know you will bounce back from this.
Wish I could share my jar of museum putty. To this day I'm still further earthquake-proofing this house in Washington state (in the Ring of Fire) but it seems like there's always another thing to do. I recall Aki & Joey got quite well set up for earthquakes. Perhaps that's something you guys can Collab on; video or not.   Maybe that lil broken neko can be ur first try at kintsugi. 😹✨
I worry about anyone i watch in Japan when there us an earthquake. Glad your safe.
Trip to kappabashi-dori Tokyo should replace a lot of the broken china
Good time for Xanax.
5:22 those Taiko drummers really don't know when to quit though
So pleased you are all o.k. Studios can be rebuilt, as long as you are safe and well, that's the most important thing x.
Glad to hear you're safe Chris! Watching this was pretty heartbreaking when you put so much effort into this set. :( Hopefully your new set is more earthquake proof?
I've been following you and the rest of the Japan vloggers posts on twitter, I'm so relieved all of you ended up being okay! I'm sorry to hear about the studio, wrecked as soon as you got it. Luckily a studio can be repaired. Today is a day to thank all the engineers who built buildings that were able to withstand nature like this. Without them, who knows how different today could have been for all of us. All of you are irreplaceable and I'm so happy you and your friends are safe, and strong enough to make it through!
So glad you are alright! The studio could have been much worse but it's still sad 😢
Oh no! So much work put into the studio gone in moments. That's so upsetting, but thankfully you are ok Chris!
Glue that shit down
Glad you're alright, and so sorry to see the damage to the studio. Could feel the earthquake in Yamanashi, and though it was   probably not even half as strong as what you felt in Sendai, it went on for a while and was pretty scary for us, too. Can only imagine how much scarier it was there...
Oh no, of course your safety is the most important thing but the damage to the studio is such a shame, the ornaments and general items around it were so nice with so much effort put in 😞
Oh Chris. I'm sorry to see what happened to the studio. I can't even imagine going thru a situation like this. Hope I don't sound like I'm minimizing your feelings, but I'm glad to see that you came out of this physically okay. I pray things get better and that repair cost are minimal for you Chris❤️✝️.
Wow! Glad you guys are ok !  Stay safe and thank you for sharing.
So glad you're okay! It showed up as an alert on my weather app and I was worried about y'all! I just watched a documentary about the tsunami a few days ago...weird
I'm so sorry about your ramen shop set Chris and I'm glad that you're safe.
hey chris, i think many of us would be happy to take part in donating to cover this unfortunate damage, especially it being so new.. anywhere i can donate to help??
Maybe you should keep something that was destroyed during the earthquake as a memento. A grave reminder of sorts?
I'm starting to think the 2020s are going to be the worst decade in decades, hope things turn out alright for you Chris!
I'm just glad everyone is OK!
Time to kintsugi the hell out of that maneki neko, Chris!  Happy to see that you're well and safe <3 Hope you'll recover ASAP from the shock \[T]/
So glad you are safe. Im sorry you had so much damage.  Hope the equipment survived.  Scary....I live in USA and just after texted my son in Osaka...."what earthquake?" Well. It was big enough to feel it in Tokyo!.  Stay safe!
Bro..dont tell me the evil baby was destroyed
Glad you are ok
Hi Chris, I am glad you are ok. I was worried when I saw the scale of that earthquake was above 7.
This came as news to me today. Happy to hear you are safe. I know it's cliche but things can be replaced even those it sucks at the moment. I have lived in California my whole life so I've been through my fair share of earth shaking events. Gotta love 7-11, Lawson's and Family Mart.
Oh my god chris, are you okay , mega hugs and i hope you are safe xx
Glad you're safe Chris! Sorry to see the studio like that and hope you guys can get everything back up. Felt this down in Tokyo and it was already terrifying.
Sorry to hear about your studio, but I’m glad you are all okay.
I live in San Francisco Bay Area where we have our share of earthquakes, but nothing like that since 1906.  Thankfully, I wasn’t born at that time.  Glad you’re okay.
Hope for the best Chris, I know a few people there & it scared the 💩 outta them because of the last big one & the tsunami. I hope everything gets sorted soon.
jeez.. glad youre all okay.. been looking at moving to japan for a few years now but one of the things deterring me from doing that is earthquakes as an aquarist, i dont want to risk the lives of my precious fish. i wish you a good recovery and hope you get everything sorted out well
I'm so glad that you guys are ok, and I'm so sorry about the studio....at least things can be rebuilt. At the end of the day your health and safety is the most important. It cant be easy to see something you worked so hard on be destroyed.  Sending lots of love to all of you from Canada ❤
Glad you're safe, sorry this all happened to you. We will stick by you and continue to support you! Don't let go of that Maneki-neko, allow it to be a reminder. <3
Glad you are okay.  Stuff can be replaced, you can't.  Take care,
NOOOO THATS TERRIBLE
God I fucking love this channel
I hope tou can fix all your studio soon!
We’re all glad you and your friends are safe Mate! Feels heart wrenching seeing the studio in shambles after all the hard work put into making it happen and seeing how proud you were of it. Hope you always have in mind that your viewers always wish you the best and for your safety. I’ve loved seeing you grow with your channel but most importantly as a human. You’ve created something big here so never forget how far you’ve come and hope you have the time to grieve because it is sad and traumatizing. Take a breather and slowly come back from the setback. We’re always here for you!  Love from Arizona!
just wow! that's crazy
Glad you're alright after all that.
Much love. Please take care and be safe.
I have family and friends in Japan and they’re all okay. But this really breaks my heart, especially after following you all these years, particularly my dad recommending you when I was like 17… I really hope it can be fixed and I love every video
I'm glad you guys are safe. Material things can be replaced but lives can't be.
Oy Chris, you wouldn't believe it, but there's a tool for straining water! It's a stick with towels that gathers water and strains it into a bucket. It's called a mop! Amazing innit? P.S jokes aside, that looks terrifying. Make sure you keep yourselves safe. Materials can be repaired
Use traditional japanese ceramic repair kintsugi for the cat.
The entire Abroad in Japan crew and friends was on my mind when I heard of the earthquake, I'm just glad you all are okay, Chris. ❤
The important part you are fine.  Things can be replaced, but your health is the must important thing.
😩 Could have been worse but damn! The ramen shop coped it !  Then after shocks! 😱
Shame the studio suffered such damages, but those can be fixed, I'm just glad you got through the earthquake unharmed.
Lmao, I remember being at school yesterday, and checking the news and seeing a tsunami warning.  Stay safe!
I'm glad you're okay, that's the most important thing. Hope rebuilding doesn't take too long
Really good to see that you weren't hurt chris, and all the best wishes in getting the studio repaired and running again. I can't possibly imagine how terrifying something like this would be, stay safe
On the bright side, at least it wasn't an expensive piece of art designed by professionals as a set for your youtube channel.
Sorry for what you're going through Chris. But the most important thing is you guys are safe🙌, the rest you can replace and rebuild, what japan does best ❤️
So glad you are safe!!!
Where is the fundme page??? I wanna help even if it’s just a little…glad you’re okay
Hey Chris. Relaxed. As a Dutchman. The only advise i can give you is. When the ground start shaking. Take to the sky. With some special Zen gras. (Question?) What,s the deal with japan and Cannabis. And ist is a good or bad deal.   Stay alive. You lost pommie abroad
Glad you're alright. Kintsugi the cat statue you really like! :D
Glad you're all okay,  take care!  Something maybe to think about the design a bit so it doesn't get smashed again
Glad everyone's safe and the studio isn't worse off. Good luck with the pipes.
Aw, Chris, so sorry to see your beautiful studio like this. So glad no one was hurt though.
Such a shame. You handled it very well considering. Get that great studio back up and running
Omg so sorry Chris, happy you're safe and sound though. Ramen shop v2.0 will be just as great.
Glad you are all safe 🙌, good luck with the cleaning
My prayers to you chris and the people of japan
Been in a similar quake. They can be terrifying, glad your ok! Sending all the good vibs
I'm glad to see that you're okay Chris. SOrry to hear about your studio after you put in so much hard work into it. Hopefully, it can be repaired and restored.
Glad you're safe. Sorry you had to go through that.
Damage isn't too bad, mainly just some broken ceramics and some water. All part of the japan experience! ;)
friend of mine in fukushima said that they're predicting a follow up 6.0 in the next day or two, so would recommend preparing for that possibility
I'm living in Fukushima and it was the first time i felt an earthquake that bad, and it was terrifying. Naturally after my apartment was trashed I still had to go to work -.-
Plastic prop dishes from now on?
Hope everybody’s okay mate
Sorry for the damage done to your studio. Maybe use some of the  3M or other removable tack strips or putty to hold items that would rarely be moved in place.
I am glad you are alright. It's unfortunate that this happened and all the cleanup that will follow. But turn this misfortune around. Take this as a chance to film the rebuilding of the studio. You could always put it on your other channel if not this one. Wishing you the best of luck.
I'm glad everyone is ok. As painful as it was to see the studio wrecked things are replaceable, people are not.
I'm so sorry that your studio took a beating as you've spent so much time planning it and money to build it as it's been a dream of yours, but I'm glad you're safe, Chris! I hope it won't be too long until the studio is up and running again and you will always have our support
I literally cried when I saw the damage to your brand new studio. I hope you can get the leaking water issue fixed and that there's no electrical issues caused by it.
Really sorry about your apartment Chris. I'm glad you guys are all safe.
Happy all is good, Chris. Estay safe!
Note to self if I ever move to Japan Velcro everything to the shelves.
I’m sorry that happened Chris - I’m happy you and everyone else is safe - and I’m sorry for what happened to your studio . Wishing you guys the best
3:11 - Have you considered Kintsugi?
Just glad you guys are safe ❤
I'm glad you and your friends are okay Chris! If things need to be fixed, take the time to fix them. Entertainment can wait for necessity.
Don’t worry Cinderella, Prince Charming is coming to save you. 😆 Hope you get everything fixed. ❤️
I like that you kept the smash-neki neko at the end.
I hope you have insurance, I like your positive attitude.
So hard to see the damage to your wonderful set. You are not alone, you have good friends, hopefully the building holds together and stays dry ❤️🌿
Really glad all of you are okay! I'm sorry about your studio but at least that can be replaced hopefully, stay safe!
auwwww....RIP Studio.
Oh on! My condolences, hope you get back to normal soon.  @3:16 Maybe you can do some of that Japanese art of fixing broken pottery (Kintsugi?) to fix the porcelain cat (manekeneko?).
Glad everyone with you is okay and the damage wasn't "too" bad (bad enough)...living in Wisconsin my whole life people from other parts of the country always ask how I can not mind the winters (be it -20 below or 2 feet of snow) and I always say it'd take snow over earthquakes and hurricanes any day
I glad you are ok, sucks for all the damage on the studio, I’m sure it’s going to look better than before
Glad you are all OK!
Money from this video easily paid for everything. You're probably happy this happened and game you a way to make more money.
My mom was actually living in Japan during that Kobe. Her neighbour pasted away.
Hurts to see the shop in pieces. Hope you have a good insurance...
Material stuff can be replaced. Seeing you , Sharla, Natsuki save is much more worth then that
Where'd the water come from? Good that nothing serious got damaged. The maneki-neko looks pretty standard, so it should be easy to replace. (inspired by some of the other commenters, I offer the alternative suggestion, of trying to find all the pieces of it, and have it mended with clear signs of it having been mended, as a kind of memento. If you want) As should be plates.
You should do kintsugi on that neko !
Glad you’re safe!
WHERE CAN WE DONATE
Gutted for you Chris. It's not long since you had the studio built. Glad you are safe and that's the main thing! I'd come and give you a hand if I wasn't nearly 8,000 miles away!
You can see how deeply sad he is under the presenter face and I just want to give him a hug. I hope he gets things fixed up with relative ease.
please be safe, I read somewhere on twitter that before the massive quake in fukushima there was a prequake quite similar in magnitude to this most recent one.
Well damn..glad everyone is ok. Hope everything will work out ok🙏🏻
damn he just had this built this too
Having seen your social media videos, I knew this would be bad but I can't imagine what you guys must have felt walking into the studio in that state.   Plus side? It looks like it's only things that were damaged. As expensive as they may be, they can be replaced. Lives are far more precious.  Wishing you all the best moving forward!
OH NO NOT THE RAMEN SHOP SET
oh Chris, I'm so so sorry!!  I'm just glad you all are safe!  I'll be thinking of all of you!
That is terrible! At least you're safe. Now you just have to rebuild
I'm glad you're ok! I can't even imagine living through an earthquake of that magnitude!
huhahu nice purchase
So sad for you. I hope you got good insurance coverage! Take courage! 🙏
Ah man that's heartbreaking seeing the ramen shop in tatters so shortly after you had it made to such high standard.
Glad you guys are doing okay and are safe!
I'm so sorry about the studio, Chris. That is so upsetting. But I'm glad that you're ok and didn't get hurt, it must have been so scary.
What was the huge flash
Glad everyone is alright and safe. Being able to see the occurrence of the earthquake and the aftermath on a local level such as your studio is a hell of a lot more shocking than just merely reading a news article about it.  Hope all of you are able to recover from this.
My thoughts are with you
Good luck with everything! I hope the studio comes back better than ever!
this happened on my birthday
Ah what a shame. After all that money spent on the new studio and half of it is in shambles now. Moral of the story: if you live in Japan, have your furniture and objects placed strategically in case of a big earthquake.
God chris i am so sorry
Hope you're doing well man. Hell of a thing to experience!
..  Cheers to you  ..
At least you’re safe mate.   And you can get a video out of this on how you made your studio earthquake proof.
It’s easy for me to say but still, take care and I hope you get your ramen shop full of more sentimental things from your friends and new adventures out.
You should put everything back with broken pieces missing and then film something scary...
Glad you guys are okay. Keep safe Chris, Natsuki, Sharla.
Chris! My heart breaks seeing your amazing studio in pieces 💔 I hope it won't be too costly to repair but glad to see you all are alive and well
i'm so sad for this. Is there any way i can support people in Japan besides words right now? Donations of some sort?
Perhaps you could do some kintsugi with the broken bowls. Would be fun to do yea?
jesus, that's a big hit wishing everyone in japan safety around this hard times
Do something like kintsugi for the cat! It will have an even deeper mening than before 😇
🙀 Glad you guys are OK 😺
Damn. I'm glad you guys are safe
Oh no! You just got that studio done! Obviously, the fact that you are safe is much more important, but that's really sad to see all the broken decor. I hope everyone is doing okay starting to pick up the pieces and rebuild.
Fuuuuuuuk……so sad, hope you were insured , good luck with the clean up!
Hope your all good, rip studio 😭😭😭
Glad you are safe and weren't hurt. You can try Museum Gel/Putty to help keep your knick knacks in place but not permanently stuck on surfaces.
Living in Cali you really learn to appreciate super glue innovations lol
Looks amazingly good given the magnitude of the quake. Most importantly you weren’t hurt. Stuff can be replaced.
March seems to always have the worst earthquakes in Japan.
What about your projector!! Hope thats not in water! Gutted for you man. Get the glue gun on the go! Will give it more character.
If you need to you should make a go fund me. I recall it costing a lot to make the set & after all your hard work for this studio it would be a shame to not get it all fixed up & running again right away for you to make more content. Glad everyone is safe.
You should get the Manekineko repaired with Kintsugi!! Glad you, Natsuki and Sharla are good!!
Praying for you and all of japan stay safe🙏🙏
I'm glad you are okay. I'm sorry to see the ramen shop in ruins. Stay safe.
Looked very scary mate
♥️♥️♥️
Oh Chris I'm so sorry. I could have cried watching you clean up the studio. I hope you can get it all back to normal soon. That set truly is something inspiring for me, it's a true work of love and art. Stay safe my friend.
maybe do Kintsugi 金継ぎ with the maneki-neko if you found all the pieces.
I'm glad you're okay Chris, and i'm sad your studio got one heck of a beating. I wish you a speedy recovery from this disaster.
I'm glad to hear you're safe!
I feel so much for you man. This thing was your baby.
I’m glad all you fellas in Japan are ok
I'm really sorry to see about the damage to the Studio, I know it was something you put a lot of money and effort into and were very proud of.
Glad you're ok. I can only assume how scary was this whole situation.  Stay safe.
I’m just really glad there seems to be not much issue with fire, as things like gas, electricity and water like this seems like the most dangerous part of an earthquake.
the cat at 3:17 is perfect the way it is now. you can't get more japanese than a maneki-neko that was perfectly damaged by an earthquake. beautiful wabi sabi style (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi).  If you find the proken pieces you could get it fixed in 'kintsugi' style (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi) - Maybe even make a video about it?!? For me, I think it is 100x better now it's broken
at least the building is still intact
Damn that sucks, glad you’re okay
On the plus side at least the ramen shop already looked dirty/distressed. Sorry to hear about the stress and terror. Hopefully you can get everything fixed and get back to normal life soon 🙏
glad you  guys are ok  some crazy shit
saw all of the videos from people in Japan experiencing the earthquake, truly horrifying. Glad you and your friends are safe, Chris, I hope the studio is repaired soon.
im so sorry to hear this chris hope things are ok my warmest wishes to you
We're all glad that you're okay Chris. This could have been much worse. California has also had some good sized ones recently, but nothing to bad, thankfully. But that's what happens when you live in the Pacific Ring of Fire. Many prayers of safety go your way, and I hope you find another lucky cat!
Must be difficult conducting any business that's dealing with fragile items when this occurs semi-regularly, not to mention collecting expensive stuff or running something like a museum with things of historic value. How do insurance companies deal with this? I'm guessing they are exempt from liability for these kinds of seismic events.
Man so sorry the studio was damaged, such a shame it was so cool so much work and time gone into it 😞, hopefully it can be restored! The real tragedy is now pewdiepie wont see it in its full glory
While I am glad everyone is okay, this kind of hurts my soul a bit. When you watch the video of the new studio reveal and how proud Chris was to show it to everyone, and then to see the damage, it just makes you feel the loss that much harder. I hope you have good insurance, and that most of the items can be replaced.
So glad you’re safe
Im glad you’re safe! You should hire Aki to come in and earthquake-proof your studio; she’s become pretty good art it judging by her videos 😃
prayers for Japan
water sound
I’d put a plant into the cat, you know? Reuse, Reduce and Recycle ✨
If those vending machines still functioned I'd be dealing with current events with a bagful of Suntory 196..
Glad you're safe!
what's wrong with this year :')
very glad you're safe, so torn seeing the studio though :'(
Everything can be fixed or replaced except you. Glad you’re ok! 👍
Big Mouth farted & earthquake started & that’s how Chris studio died.
Glad you weren’t hurt!
ummm if you slow the video down at 0:10 you can see something come down from the sky and strike the earth just before the massive ball of light appears. this looks at lot more like some sort of attack than a natural earthquake
i'm glad you and the gang are alright, material stuff can be replaced or fixed with some glue or duct tape
I feel so sad 🤧. The studio 😔
Glad to see you guys are all right at least.
Fix the maneki neko with kintsugi! Hope you're able to get the studio back up and running in no time.
Damn that's tough. But glad you're all ok.
I'm really glad you guy are okay!
Why not do some kintsugi on your broken ceramics?
Immediately thought of you guys when i heard the news. please have a contractor check for structural integrity on the set.
I'm so sorry to see this Chris. Glad that you guys are safe. I can't imagine how terrifying that would have been.
Seeing the damage brought tears to my eyes, genuinely...!  Your beautiful new studio...!  God damn it..
Oh man that’s aweful! What a mess! Wish i could go help clean. Glad you’re ok though. Good luck my friend. Start a fund sp we can donate.
Not gonna lie my eyes got watery
Im surpise after all that there is no tsunami
While it's heartbreaking to see the studio having suffered such damage, as you say everyone was safe and nothing's beyond repair.
Me watching broken kitty: Time for Kintsugi  <3
Can't believe you managed to keep it together long enough to film! The last time my city was devastated by an earthquake (2017), I couldn't pick up a single piece of glass or debris without sobbing. It's weird to be faced with the (very real) thought of "this is it, this is how I go". Glad you're all ok!
That's SO upsetting. He literally just got the new studio too. I'm so glad they're all safe though. It can all be rebuilt but it doesn't change the fact that this must all be so frustrating.
Can someone explain what that impact and subsequent flash is at the 00:10 mark?
It's sad to see the studio in such a mess after all the hard work that went into designing and building it. It looks like you've had a visit from Dr Gelignite. At least you're all safe.
Glad you are okay. Very sad to see the damage, but I know you and the studio will come back even better. Maybe you can kintsugi the cat?
Glad you are ok sir. Be well, and hang in there.
We send you the power of love ❤️
The studio wasn't as durable as Fukuoka-Tower.  Good Luck tho
Make sure the building is really safe!!! Might have foundation damage! Stay safe
Well fuck mate, huge bummer about the studio... That's terrifying. Glad all of you are safe.
Cool place you got
so sorry chris ;; sad... glad you and friends are safe though
Damn and you had just built it a few months ago, glad you're safe tho Chris
Like leave your shoes on lol... With all the broken glass and shit on the floor i wouldn't worry about keeping it clean...
I have that cat, think it's the exact same, happy to send it to you.
Glad you're ok! That must have been terrifying! x
Really sad for the studio but at least you're safe Chris.
So sad, you just built this studio. :[
Kintsugi that maneki-neko :)
I was sitting at work in Australia when I heard the news of the earthquake and instantly thought of you guys! I am glad to hear everyone is okay ❤  Never having even experienced a small earthquake, it's hard to wrap my head around how it must feel
This is quite sad   Becoming Connor now
With your Neku or one of the bowls with that gold repair then the Japanese used to do just as a remembrance of the day
Glad to see you are all okay, though I must admit it is more than a little heartbroken to see this damage.
maybe you can ask the production team where they get some of the stuff or they can help you with rebulding the studio.
Glad you're safe
Stay safe, things can be replaced, studios can be fixed.
Keep us posted when you can. We are interested in your well being and maybe chatting with us a bit can help ease you. Glad to see that physically everyone is ok. I'm sure the new nicknacks will look even better on that set.
Mamma Sharla helping to clean up. How nice
Can't you just jump and you won't feel the quake?
Actually really wasn't all that bad. I've seen pics/vids where people had much more damage done.
It had to    heartbreaking for you buddy ,after long time you managed to do your dream studio and now it was damaged due to unforseen circumstances 😢.  I feel for ya ,its good that You are in One Piece ,all the best mate
Isn't there a Japanese thing where you put smashed plates etc together and put gold on the cracks to celebrate the imperfections ?
You can try to find someone who fix  broken ceramic with kintsugi
Awww that's awful, I'm sorry about the studio but I'm super glad you're alright
keep all the broken stuff so you can keep a record of what you are missing and need replacements of when you go to buy new ones!! don't want to be left with an empty feeling like something is missing.
sorry men  😏😱😱
Im from Chile, and here a 7,4 earthquake is like the weakest quake, its kinda funny Glad you are alright btw Chris, love ur vids
Glad you're alright Chris, we feel bad for what happened to the studio and will be looking forward to you coming back in full swing!
I'll be sure to keep a keen eye on your channel and watch all the follow up videos on this unfortunate event.  You're all safe and can rebuild and repair.
New series to travel across Japan to find new souvenirs to rebuild the ramen shop
I expected much worse when you said that it was built before the laws.  I can't even see any cracks in the walls.
i wonder what the flash of light was at the start
0:10 Was that lightning, explosion, or a strange light? I recall people reporting strange flashes of light during earthquakes? Glad to hear everyone's okay
Damn. After all the money you spent on the set.
It's sad that so many of your possessions were damaged, but at least you're okay and weren't in the studio when that happened. Stay safe!
I'm so sorry about your shop and the traumatic earthquake. Sending positivity from Nebraska
Glad you're safe, and that mostly the things that broke in the studio seem easy to replace Stay safe and alert but don't let it get you down
At 0:10. What was that really bright flash??
200 beers for you 😫
Damn dude, hopefully you got insurance.
Heartbreaking as it is to watch, you guys are all fine, and that's really the only important thing.
Im sorry for your small losses and glad you guys are ok. I had no idea Japan had a semi big earthquake till the video.
Man seeing this is  heart breaking but same time am just glad you guys are safe and sound through all of that. Wish you guys all the best hopefully no more of these happen x.x
This is so heartbreaking in so many ways, but I'm so happy that you, Sharla, Natsuki and the rest of the crew (and friends) are all okay.  It's terrifying to see such destruction and don't ever be ashamed at being on edge after something so incredibly traumatic.  That's just a natural reaction to something like this.
Sorry dude. At least most of it survived...sort of. Sorry to hear about the cat.
So glad you’re safe! My sympathies to you and everyone else effected by this natural disaster. I’ve been watching for years but decided to go support you on Patreon today. Hope it helps you rebuild little by little even though I know it can’t replace the memories ❤️
Texas time 09:43 AM - Work chat, "Is anything happening in Tokyo?  We have a lot of devices alerting that they're down." Texas time 09:44 AM - Employee in Tokyo, "Yes, an Earthquake.  Massive.  It's almost midnight here, can I check in the morning?"  (Spoiler alert, the answer was no) Texas time 09:56 AM - Checks news, sees Chris Broad's Twitter account "big one...panic attack...etc" Texas time 09:57 AM - Hey team, I have reliable sources in Japan having panic attacks, this is legit. (Glad the damage was minimal.   I'd totally have a panic attack, too.)  <3
Just curious, is there Earthquake insurance in Japan? I can imagine it being quite pricey!
Hopefully everything worked out for you Chris , good luck and stay safe
I live in Canada and we very rarely get earthquakes. Come to think of it, we never had one where I live. I couldn't imagine going through that. All the best to the recovery efforts and getting the studio repaired and back up and running.
When are they going to make a live action "Japan Sinks"?
its crazy that even when inspecting damage from a earthquake yall still take your shoes off. speed running glass in your feet. glad you are safe though!!!
Hope you can solve all of this! Glad youre alright chris!
Heart broke when I saw the state of the studio, but am glad everyone is safe.
Hoping for some good fortune for you and yours. Cheers
Oh Jesus— I hope you’re safe! Sounds very scary! 😱  I’m glad you’re safe and all of your friends are safe! ❤️
I think when a lot of people think of earthquakes they think of a lot of vibrating. This one was like someone picking up buildings with both hands and thrashing it back and forth
格好やばかった。。。頑張ってください
Take care you all.
Just glad you are alright. I know you worked so hard on that studio but everything can be replaced. Hopefully that will be the worst earthquake you ever have to live through.
There was an EARTHQUAKE!?
Quake Wax is the bomb. Tiny pea sized bit of it to secure things to shelves. Tried and true.
You are supposed to use a wet vac or a mop. :D Glad you are okay. Time to add another reason to "12 reasons NOT to move to Japan".
Glad you and your friends are safe, hopefully clean-up and repairs aren't too rough a job.  Keep being awesome Chris!!!
Aw fack, I can't believe you've done this  Maybe you can super glue the neko back?
Oh nooo the new studio.... D: I'm so sorry. That sucks so baaaad. :< I hope it isn't too bad to fix back up. :<
It's sad looking at the damage but you will rebuild. I'm glad you are safe
Glad everyone's safe! You need to lean Kintsugi so you can repair your cat!
Shit! That is terrifying. You definitely appear to have been quite traumatized. Best of luck at restoring the studio and hoping you feel at ease soon.
At least you're safe
Omg 🤯.. glad your all okay. 😘
Glad y’all are okay.
3:10 you should collect the pieces of the maneki neko and possibly find a ceramic artist that does kintsugi on broken ceramics. You'd be able to preserve your cat with a story attached now to it about this place and event. Glad you are safe!
So glad you guys are ok
Would be cool if you did a video about Kintsugi where some of your broken things get fixed!
Things can be replaced. you can't. Glad you're okay
Scary stuff, but I'm glad you guys are all safe, and glad your building is still intact and everything. Sad about all the dishes and the leaking water though... hopefully the lights and other equipment weren't in too bad of shape
Bloody natural disasters. It saddens me to see your beautiful  set in pieces like that. Happy that you are all ok.  We have just had some major flooding in Australia,  with many properties destroyed.  Hang in there I'm sure that just like the Aussies the Japanese will be in there boots and all getting things back to normal asap. You could always sell off the damaged  parts of the studio I'm sure there are many of your supporters that would happily buy it, but please keep the cat. Stay safe. We look forward to seeing the studio back to its old self again, with maybe a few changes you could challenge us to spot.
Wave goodbye to the 'lucky ' cat, so sad
Sending you all my best wishes Chris <3
You can rebuild. Glad you are OK.
It was heart warming to see Sharla and Natsuki on hand to help.
Crazy that through all that, somehow the 6 foot tall standing mirror was untouched.
As someone who experiences earthquakes all the time living on the big island, I totally understand how traumatic/terrifying the experience can be. Glad everyone is safe and well. Thank you for sharing ❤️
Aw fuck
Oh no, my heart really hurts for you after seeing this Chris. I know how excited and proud you were of the studio. I'm thankful you and the squad are all safe but damn man. I hope you can get it up and running again soon.
The downside to a highly detailed studio with lots of knickknacks. A somewhat famous utaite I follow tweeted these little sticky pads she uses to keep a lot of decorations and small things in place through earthquakes.  "Soekewo" can get over 100 of em for $10.
Stay safe everyone
Good luck, Chris. I hope it's not too expensive to get everything put right again. Fortunately it wasn't worse.
Glad that you all are okay. Sending my best wishes to you all. 💛
I'm so glad to see everyone is well and that all you lost were things that can be replaced and repaired. Sending love. Be well and stay safe!
the main thing is that youre ok. every other thing can be replaced.  yourself cant. and i am glad that you didnt get hurt
If you could find the pieces you could glue the maneki Neko back together. You should hire Aki to earthquake proof the nicknacks when you replace them. Norm goes to a lot of 2nd hand shops, maybe he can help you replace stuff. Thank you for making a video letting us know 👍great to see Sharla and Natsuki 😻
damn it deestroy ur studio
best of luck Chris. I'm sure its tough to deal with but I'm thankful you aren't hurt
Sorry man I hope things go well for you quickly
Stay safe Chris.
OMG! I'm so sorry to see that happening to your new studio at least you are safe.
I'm glad you and your friends are safe ❤️
First off, I’m glad you and everyone are safe. But sorry for your set. I know how much you love it and hopefully you can bounce back and it doesn’t cost you too much. 🤙🏽
So sorry about your studio. I'm glad you are safe though. My sister actually was an English teacher in the Miyagi prefecture a year after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that rocked that region. She was in the country side mostly but often visited Sendai. She always spoke highly of the spirit of the people in that area who overcame such loss.
The important thing is you guys are ok.  I've gone through a flood which destroyed a lot of stuff and while that initial reaction feels like the world had just ended, you quickly remember what is replaceable and what is irreplaceable.  Hope you guys can get things sorted out quickly and get back to making more quality content.
Aww, Chris. I really feel for you. Seeing this video made me a little emotional because it was amazing to see the studio in use and to see what joy it gave you. Hopefully you can bounce nice and quick.
Crickey, whatta mess! Hope we can see it cleaned up and resurrected? Long live Ramen Shop II
Could you take the lucky cat for kintsugi/kintsukuroi? It might cost a little but if it’s sentimental I think it’d worth it.
I'm sorry about the damage but am very glad everyone is ok there. Stay safe!
Thankfully you are safe and the only things damaged are crockery.
I have an exam next Monday. Is it possible to get one of those here by sunday evening? Early monday morning is fine too
I'm so glad you and the team are safe. Take your time to put everything back together, we can wait a little longer for videos.
I am so sorry for you
I remember my dad telling me about his experience with the 1994 Newcastle Earthquake in australia in which he experienced, magnitute of 5.6 and it was absolutely devastating. Buildings crumbled like paper. Earthquakes arent common in australia and usually isnt an issue but when they do happen, being inside is the worst possible fate. Its crazy how buildings in japan are still standing after a 7 magnitude 🤯
Sending much love from New Zealand and wishing for a largely successful recovery for you and everyone and your studio. I hope everything in the studio can be recovered in some fashion or replaced or even upgraded.
Glad you are all okay worried about you all. Glad Sharla is okay and Naski as well.
I'm so sorry for the studio, you and everyone affected! it has to be overwhelming to know what to do next. i hope everyone is safe!
Glad you're okay. And so's my wife. Glad, that is. I don't mean that's she's not okay! She is. I mean - she's more than okay, she's great!   I'll start again...
Japan buildings are engineering marvel
You should keep the broken cat. Will be a Great story for every visitor.
This is so depressing to see, but im so glad you're all alright
Would be cool if you could have someone that does kintsugi fix the cat
Does anyone knows what was the flash of light in third footage of the earthquake?
I'm glad to see you're okay!! I hope you're able to get the studio up and running again soon. 🙏🏾
I’m so happy you guys are okay. If you put up a gofundme or something similar, please post it. I’m sure many of us fans would love to contribute to the clean up financially.
Time to do a video on Kintsugi and hopefully fix some of the things that are broken! So glad you're okay, hopefully your friends and neighbors are also safe. My best to all of you!
Glad you and everyone else is well!
kintsugi the maneki-neko!
Man, I really feel your pain. For some odd reason, every September there's an earthquake in Mexico. There's also an early warning alarm installed in Mexico City, which is very useful, but scary as the earthquake itself. 8.2 magnitude is not fun.
I wish I could be there to help clean up honestly. But the bit about the aftershocks was funny.
Wabisabi, you should repair the cat. He's just another part of your journey.
i can only imagine how fucking scary it must be to experience a strong earthquake. I've only felt minor shakes, and what I felt was a dread and fear I've never felt before. There is no way you can be prepared, it can strike anytime, and you never know if it's a small or a big shake.
Shame about the studio at least it's salvageable, but glad you're safe and alive!   Will you be able implement any measures to protect the studio from future quakes?
Sad to see the damage, but I'm happy more wasn't destroyed. Most of all I'm happy you're all safe.
I guess even god became jealous of the studio
Maybe someone could do Kintsugi on your ceramic cat👍
Oh no Chris, I'm sorry your new studio was thrashed. Fucking sucks after it's taken you so long to build it too, for it only to crumble down.
Damn. I'm really glad you are okay.
Dont worry chris, all that matters is your safe, you can pick up the pieces and keep being a broad in Japan :)
Do you have insurance?
I hope you have insurance to cover all the damage!
Ah man, I am sorry.  Thank you for updating us.
Good to see that you are ok, and Sharla and Natsuki, glad there wasn't too much damage. Hope the after shocks have stopped now. ❤
We first look at the scattering of things.  However, Your first check for leaks of water and gas and electric.  The next important thing to do is check for cracks and damage to the building for Next earthquakes.
The good thing is u came out safe
It's so sad to see this. I hope everyone is safe. Stay safe guys.
Glad you're all okay other than the office
Glad it didn’t go worse
Just turn the cat on the side 🙂 it will look good as new
Just passed the 3/11 anniversary 🤔
I hope you, your staff, and all the people of Japan can stay safe and hopefully the after shocks won't be so terrible. :( :( :( It's been years since I experienced a earthquake and they are definitely very scary when they get above 5.... :-/
Oh man, I am sorry to see your absolutely magnificent studio in such a condition. Time to break out the elbow grease and make it even better!
Just glad you're all safe! Maybe.. Kintsugi Ramen shop? At least the cat deserves some gold treatment.
I’m guessing you have got insurance? 😊
Living in the UK (north), we don't get hardly any earthquakes, but seeing the damage and what it's caused is honestly terrifying. I'm glad you and everyone else on the team are okay. Even if the state the ramen shop was left in is heart breaking at least that can slowly be replaced.
I'm sorry Chris:( I know this isn't fun cleaning up
That Maneki-Neko must be filled with luck. It's the most intact glass thing left.
Clearly march is a bad time in japan. You could call it earthquake season
On a lighter note, the dystopian neotokyo aesthetic now for ramen shop is ever better enhance!
That's crazy how earthquakes in Japan cause such massive turmoils. Just think of the great Kantô earthquake, or more recently the one from 2011. Stay safe Chris!
It’s kind of scary to think that Japan will sink and my homeland will be gone but we will continue to prosper our culture! I’m glad you’re okay man!
You got this Chris! Sending Prayers!
So how does insurance work in Japan
Good to hear all you are safe! Good luck with the studio.  01:05 When i was in Japan in 2019 during october, the taifun came and it was announced all shops and so were closing, but the 7 eleven stayed open and we asked the staf if they gonna close and they said no and shrugged it off :D.
🙏🏽I’m glad you’re safe
You're all ok, that's what's more important. 💙
Really sorry that this happened Chris. Hope you manage to get the studio back to the its former glory.
I’m so sorry that this has happened but I’m so glad to see you’re okay
Glad you and the others are safe. Absolutely heartbreaking about the studio
Man, I am sorry you had to go through that. I was there in 2011 and I can honestly say it was one of the single most terrifying experiences of my life, and I truly know how it feels to experience that coming from the UK where we basically dont have any seismic activity. Once the broken stuff is replaced, it will be like it never happened, so chin up!
Glad to see you and the crew doing good, stay safe.
glad you are safe Chris!
Good luck chris! for all the good luck from someone across the world can do
Guarantee there was not one crime of looting. In America.... people would have set things on fire.
Oh no, your beautiful new studio :( I'm sorry, I know how excited you were
Stay safe man
Hi do you like hoagie rolls. My friend wants to know
Glad you are safe, that's the most important bit. I've never felt an earthquake but they are terrifying. Maybe gather the pieces of the  Maneki-neko and take it to a kintsugi shop or something for repair? Could that be a thing? That way you can keep it but the beautiful repair would add to the story?
I'm so glad to hear you're safe Chris!
Didn’t think you would suffer a serious earthquake! Where do you think your living! California, Seattle. Japan is earthquake central mate, plan for more.
Im glad the whole team is ok. Material things can be recovered, probably not the maneko neko, but the important stuff is every one of you are safe. Take care and get some Family Mart fried chicken to feel better.
Bunch of dramaqueens, a bit of water and crying
Aw man, sorry that happened. Hope everyone else in Japan is safe and their homes/belongings aren't wrecked.
Glad you're safe!
I’m glad you’re all safe but this is slightly devastating, what with all the hard work that went into every inch of the studio. Hopefully the water issues isn’t too much hassle and you can order more bowls and a rice cooker and a steamer etc.  The fact you can have a laugh and you still have super sharp wit despite your studio being buggered is testament to how strong you are Chris. And again, very thankful you, Sharla, Natsuki and the trash taste lads (and everyone else!) are safe
Ok, I've been in some Earthquakes back in CA...but seriously THAT was an earthquake! Best wishes to everyone there!
When I first heard about this earthquake I didn't  comprehend how strong it was.  I'm glad that you, natsuki and others are okay. Hopefully your studio will be up and running again soon.  Once again Japanese work ethics and engineers save the day.  Kudos to Japan...
First of all, SO glad you all are ok.  I'm always so impressed in Japan's infrastructure and that so few people died or got hurt during such a high magnitude quake.  Please never forget that as AMAZING as your studio is - it's not why we watch.  We watch for you.  We watch for your interactions and you could broadcast from a side street alley (oh wait, you have done!) and we'd still happily watch.  I wish you the best in your recovery efforts, please be safe and I hope there are no more earthquakes.  ❤❤❤
We had one in the uk a while back (Feb 2008) and it was only a teeny 5.2 scaled one, my ex slept through it all while I lay there freaking out praying the roof doesn’t cave in. The most terrifying thing was the sound, it was demonic, like the earth was screaming. Felt like it wasn’t going to stop. Mother Nature likes to show her dominance to humans now and then just in case we get too cocky with ourselves...
Dang that's crazy, glad you're alright!
Glad you're ok
OMG! Stay safe.
What a kick in the dick! ..could probably auction off some of the busted stuff if needed. Pretty sure some wld pay good money for things from your 1st studio. Glad to see ya safe, man. Scary shit.
Gojira studio mod looks great, you really went the full measure. Seriously though, glad you're safe and I hope repairs are swift (free content?)
Everything still looks great, don't lose heart :)
I'm so sorry this has happened to you Chris, but so glad that you are all okay
Now your bladerunner-esque set is even more dystopian.
Im sorry what happend to the studio bro, but glad that you guys are ok
I am sorry for your difficulties and I am glad everyone is ok but its called a mop Chris :)
I am very glad that you and the team is safe. I’m sorry about what has happened. In time things will be really replaced and restored.
So glad you're safe. Real shame about the broken items, but at least you're okay, and it looks like a lot of stuff survived at least to an extent.
oooof thats rough buddy. GLAD U ARE ALL SAFE
Sturdy apartment it was a 11.2!!
So sorry to see the damage in your studio but glad that you weren't hurt! Hopefully everything can be fixed and you find a new maneki-neko!
So sorry. Everyone be well and safe.
This should be on the reasons NOT to move to Japan list. (EDIT: wrote the comment before seeing the studio damage. Kinda heartbreaking… well, you are safe and material goods can always be replaced. Much love from Sweden ❤️).
Man that sucks but I'm glad you're OK like you said it's a good thing you weren't there at the time
Sorry to see all these earthquake damages in your studio. Glad to know you and your team are safe and doing well. All these damaged things are replaceable. Your life is not. Take care.
I was looking at all the broken crockery and the nice cat that you have.  It may take time but could you Kintsugi any of it? If you find any of the pieces that you can more or less return to a complete state, that would make some epic things to sell on you merch store!
Im just thinking of all the cat cafes and them being very spooked too. Also is it known where that earthquake came from?
Chris, it was clear how proud you were of this studio. Should you start a kickstarter to help with repairs I’d be happy to pass the link onto my wealthier friends.
Such a tragedy, thankfully no one was hurt. Hope you have insurance even though some of this stuff probably cant be replaced easily.
Living in California and living through a handful of pretty powerful earthquakes, I can empathize!  Stuff is stuff and glad you are ok!  Isn’t there a tradition to put your ceramics back together and pain with gold?  At least do that to your cherished cat!  Cheers and be safe!
glad to hear your safe
Sending you and your friends and team good wishes. Hope everyone stays safe!
I’m glad you are safe. Good luck with the repairs!
Stay safe ❤️
Glad you're alright, Chris, and I hope you can get the apartment all cleaned up and back to how it was soon!! <3
just glad ur ok chris love you man
Kintsugi mend your kanekineko
Sorry this happened mate. But at least you’re all ok.
My heart sank when I saw the thumbnail. Glad to see that most of the studio is safe. Love from Brazil!
stay safe you're one of my fav content creators, thank you for everything and it also feels like ur making light out of a pretty bad situation
So jiggly lately! :O
0:09 what the hell is that giant flash of light?! It looks like a missile
I'm so glad you are all safe. Items can be replaced. 💕
Gave me anxiety just watching this video
Seeing your studio in this state was really heartbreaking. I hope everything can be fixed and/or replaced without too much trouble. Please continue to stay safe!
Love from Canada bud. Looked up your channel the moment I found out to make sure your ok. Glad you are and the damage is superficial. It can all be replaced, you can't. Take care bud.
I'm so sorry! I'm glad you're alright and hopefully able to sort this all out!
Insurance companies in japan do be in huge debt
I live in CA and happened to be near a shallow epicenter in Whittier 1987. It was only a bit over a 5.5 I think but my neighborhood had houses built up off the ground and not on solid foundations. Like Kobe prior to more strict earthquake standards. Our house came forward off its foundation and I've NEVER been right during the smallest earthquake. Just seeing footage of at the beginning .... eh. Glad you're okay man. Shit is scary AF. I would literally pee my pants during an earthquake like that and need a padded cell after!
I'm glad the studio was damaged completely but this does make me sad
Crazy those buildings can withstand that
Glad you're all OK and the studio is not too bad. It would be interesting to know how quickly Japan sorts the problems out. In the UK, as you know our government cant be bothered to even sort pot holes out over decades!!
Protip from an experienced aquarium shop employee here: dustpans are like a magic to remove water from your floor and return it back into the plumbing of your house where it belongs. Towels are for noobs. Also, time for a kintsugi experience video I guess?
much love your way! <3
So sad about your studio chris.  Sending love and prayers
Holy shit. Imagine being a deep sleeper and waking up to this.
Glad you’re safe!
Glad to see everyone is doing well and is safe. And I'm happy to see you still have your humor. Take care! Sending you love from Holland
I'm so glad you're okey
Stay safe Chris, Natsuki, & Sharla! ✨🤞
Hey Chris I’m glad that you guys are okay and this studio looks horrible. so sorry that is happened to you. that earthquake seems to be massive. hope everything will be alright soon, And you will be able to put together the studio again. So glad that you guys are all safe. wishing the best for you
Omg I hope that everyone is safe 😢🍀
You should keep the lucky cat! ^^ You could keep it broken as a reminder of the quake or fix it using the Kintsugi method and have it as a decorative piece in the studio!
I assume you have earth quake insurance? If it's even a thing haha.
Ur alive thats all that matters homie
Rough... well, the set will have even more character now. I was surprised to see so many of it was ceramic still... I really thought it was mostly plastic stuff with the world famous plastic display food! xD The whole thing about making things ready for an earthquake is also fairly counterintuitive... at least building wise, perhaps even for stuff like interior decoration. You'd think having everything tied to walls and made of strong materials is the right way of doing it, but it often ends up resulting in other types of damages because of how violent and sudden the shaking is.  It's an insane amount of energy to dissipate somehow, to the point that if, for instance, you tie electronics too firmly to a wall, it might end up more badly damaged than if it had just fallen from a stand or shelf. Anyways, glad to see all of you guys well... shitty aftershocks incoming, but hopefully the worst has passed. Also... very close to 11yrs after Tohoku. Wish you guys well, hope the coast didn't get too badly damaged this time...
So glad you’re doing alright Chris; sorry to see the shop and studio had some damage. While you may not know us, the viewers, many of us have gotten to know you over the years through your videos. The concern many have felt was the same as a friend for their well-being when hearing about the earthquake. Hope you and all those close to you recover, stay safe, and continue doing what you love.
I'm just glad you and the rest of your little band of J-vloggers and crew are all safe. Keep your head up mate.
Keep the broken cat as a memento
glad every japanese creator i follow is okay especially you Chris
That sucks
Glad you, Shar, and Natsuki are all OK. Maybe give the Maneki-neko the kintsugi treatment, to memorialize the damage?
I know it’s bonkers as we will never meet but my first thought was you when I heard about the earthquake. Sending hugs to all who experienced this - stuff can be replaced - people can’t.
Sometimes there stuff you just can't be prepared for <3. I'm glad your okay, and I can't wait to see studio part 2: studio Boogaloo.
Earthquakes can be scary. I remember one i was in we left the building and could see the seperate floors shaking/leaning in different directions
Watching you for almost half a decade now, it's heartbreaking seeing this. Friends texted me when their phones were sounding the alarms too and I was really worried for them. But I'm glad you and my friends are okay. Definitely a lot to clean up, but I hope you can find some time to rest easy too!
You and your friends are safe . That's what matters most.
Glad you guys are all OK, and the studio has good bones. Fingers crossed for the aftershocks
This makes me so sad, that studio was awesome!
Sendai gets large earthquakes frequently.  Certainly the other day was a large one, but that probably won't be the last.
this is a unique kind of horrifying event. i hope youre doing okay, chris, and im glad you werent hurt. i agree with everyone else, that the maneki-neko could make for a good thing to remember stuff by.
Glad to see you guys are okay. Hope the clean up goes smoothly and everyone there is safe.
That is scary... I'm glad you have friends to help you through it.
Wise not to mess with the electrics until they have been checked. Is it easy to get an electrician at these times?
oh man,  that was awful! I've been through one big earthquake in Mexico city and it was no fun at all, kind of glad I live in a less seismic region now :S
Now its a post apocalyptic set
It was so strong, my wife and I felt it all the way in Nagano, almost 500km away. I'm glad it was just a bunch of property damage. Property can be replaced - lives can't.
First the fox lady stone breaks and now there’s an earthquake...that’s not good
Dear lord that's terrifying
Glad your living space was safe and that damage nationwide seems relatively low. I hope Tohoku people are mostly okay- they’re very tough but it’s a hard reminder.
So sorry ❣️ keep the cat😁
When you get lightening with the shakes you know its a big one.
Thankfully you're safe. That's scary!
Terrifying-glad you're ok
Should've gone to a combini and asked to borrow their mop lol
Aww Chris I'm sorry mate 😟. However I'm glad you guys are safe.
Glad you're safe Chris, things can always be replaced, as sad as it is to lose possessions with sentimental value.
Ow no chris and team so so sad
Earthquakes suck! Glad no horrible destruction like a few years back. Chin up.
Dang that sucks. I hope the studio is easy to fix. Glad you're okay!
I would consider kintsugi on that maneki neko. Would actually look really nice and add some memories to it! really happy your all fine and healthy, and hope the damage was kept to a minimal considering the severity of it all! <3
Best of luck to you. Sucks when your place gets damaged beyond any normal wear and tear, let alone this. I am glad you and everyone else is ok however. That is the most important part.
Hope you get it back on its feet soon😭😭
Get the menki neko kintsugi it would be a neat effect
stay safe brother.
That's not as bad but I still Velcro and double-sided tape everything
Glad you're safe Chris.
Godzilla is pissed at humanity but this is nothing compared to 2011. British people in Japan, so afraid of earthquakes lol. Come on man. Stiff upper lip.
i'm glad that you are ok.  why buy? you can make the next videos showing how you repair the studio ?
It’s so unfortunate this happened. I hope you, the team and everyone affected in Japan stay safe and healthy.
A real man would of fought the earthquake back... nah seriously glad your all safe! Love love
You should definitely keep the smashed Maneki-neko in the shop as even though it is broken it still looks good and has sentimental value. Plus you could likely do a great episode where you go visit the factory where they are made and find it a brother
towels? you need a mop, you mop
Glad you're ok mate. Glad it was just stuff that's gone and not you.
I'm glad it wasn't terrible, little details can always be replaced as long as the building still stands! Also, interesting sticker on the wall at 4:18 Chris...someone at production was havin a laugh with that one
I’m just glad you’re safe! Praying for you my dude !
Damn, kinda sad since you recently got the new set. But most importantly I'm glad that you and your friends are okay.
Glad you're okay...opportunity to mend the maneko with a touch of kintsugi?
Glad you're ok Chris.
RIP set
I am glad that you and the rest of the crew are safe! Currently I am hosting an Ukrainian family in my flat here in Poland. Enough of bad news for this year.
better have a 7.4 earthquake in Japan than any other place in the world...
glad you guys are ok, the set back sucks for sure
Next time your cleaning a big mess like that tell Connor there's a JoJo figure hidden and if he finds it he can have it
does insurance cover this?
glad youre okay chris. I never experienced an earthquake but i can only imagine how terrifying itd be
Looks like you won’t have production in the studio in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, but it’s definitely going to be alright. I hope the situation is going to improve on your end soon!
Im so sorry about the studio Chris, but im glad to hear you're all safe and sound, albeit a little traumatised. Take care of yourselves :)
I'm sorry the studio had some damage, but I'm glad your ok.
Heartbroken for you! Can't imagine how gutting that must be.
You should keep the shattered cat as memorabilia
Just tape EVERYTHING down next time
I feel how you are feeling. 6 months ago our town had the worst hurricane hit since the early 1960s. My place got wrecked because the massive winds blew my door in. Just today, I'm finally beginning to put furniture in and move my belongings back. I hope your cleanup and repair does not take as long as ours has. Truly hoping for the best for you <3
Screwed up your studio. At least your hair looks good.
So glad you’re safe!
Im sorry :(  I hope the rest is intact.
I'm probably too late, but I think it'd be really cool if you could fix some of your shattered pieces, kintsugi style.
Glad you guys are alright man i've watched you for so long 0_0 and although the studio and appartment was damaged like that im happy you guys are okay and rolling
So glad you're okay!
I remember being in the 2011 earthquake back when I was stationed in Japan. Luckily I was farther down the island in Tokyo, but I still remember the intense rocking of the ground and things falling over in the house. When I heard the news, I couldn't help but think of my friends still living there.  I'm glad you and your friends are safe, Chris.
Chris: "Oh fuck, oh fuck." CC: "Oh god. Oh god."  Gotta keep the subtitles family friendly!
Glad you're alright bro
All love Chris I’m glad your safe, the studio can be rebuilt
WOW I am glad you're okay. Japan with another huge earthquake :/ I hope you're able to get the studio as it was before with no issues.
holy shit, didn't know it was this big I was sleeping when it happend didn't even wake up ( I live in shizuoka tho )
I'm glad the most important thing, Natsuki, is ok.
I was in science class during the 3.11 earthquake, still remember everything so vividly and man it was one of the most terrifying experience of my life. we  had small earthquakes for a week after and we didnt have any shows running just news  and the city commercials for a month
I'm so relieved you and yours are safe and unharmed. Bowls and chairs can be replaced, you can't. Take care and know we all love you.
I'm glad you're okay and man my heart broke when I saw the pictures on twitter. I'm happy most of it was still intact
Hopefully no one was killed or injured. Glad to hear you and friends are safe. Despite man's advances, Mother Nature always has the ability to humble us and keep us focused on what matters most in Life.
Glad you and the boys are okay, was searching all over to see news about everyone hoping they were okay.
Wow, that's terrible, glad you and the others are alright after that. It definitely must've been terrifying to go through. I sincerely hope you and the people most affected in Japan can return to normal soon. 🤞🏻
Glad everyone is alright!  All things considered the studio came out ok.  This too shall pass.
I’m so sorry about your studio :-(
Know how much you love that studio, I am so, so sorry. I hope you get the ramen shop up and running soon.
Please repair manekineko with kintsugi, that would be so awesome!
0:10 godzilla teleporting from the heavens
That is heart wrenching.  I'm just glad you are ok. Things can be replaced eventually, people like you cannot.
It sucks so much, but at least you're all okay
stay safe <3
I understand it's a cultural thing but, you guys need to keep your shoes on when there's broken glass and ceramic everywhere. Stitches suck, and tetanus shots suck.
Oh man, that sucks
You’re still at Japan after all these years😦😦
Good to say you’re safe!
I applied for JET for this year. This is kinda scary.
Hey Chris, glad you're safe! I suggest you keep the broken maneki Neko as a keepsake for the new studio. Later on it can be a cool reminder of how even in tough times, perseverance is key. Plus it fits in with the concept of wabi-sabi and all that. Cheers!
Thank god you are alive
Wow the Things you go true thanks for the report thank God your ok
use the set to film a post apocalyptic scene or something
As soon as you sort out the water problem you can make a Godzilla Vs. Natsuki video.  I'll buy some Abroad in Japan Swag to help pay for repairs.
I quietly lurk and enjoy your content and watch everything and upvote. I don't really comment, but I just wanted to say I am glad you are alright.
I remember when I was an exchange student in Tokyo some years back a magnitude 7 hit and I was on the top floor of my dorms. Really scary feeling the way the building just swayed back and forth. Glad you're ok and the studio is mostly in tact. It sucks but at least all the things that fell and broke are things that for the most part seem replacable (I hope that maneki neko is replacable!!!)   It might also be a good idea to hold off on reorganizing and remounting everything until the aftershocks are mostly gone
Really glad you’re all okay and well there, hope you get that water problem sorted asap. I heard that there are still aftershocks so please be careful there
Oh Chris… so sorry to see this. Hope the water leak gets sorted and there isn’t too much damage.
Ok wtf was that flash of light falling from the sky at 00:09?!?! 🤔
Glad to see you are ok.
I have the identical neko I will legit ship it to you 🥺🥺 I'm so sorry
Glad that you're safe! Abroad in Japan will come out bigger and better! You got this!
My words are kind of worth dirt since they can't undo the damage for you or the rest of the people affected, but I wish you and all of them well. I just found out about this whole thing barely an hour ago. As someone in an earthquake zone myself, it can be kind of freaky having that threat hanging over you, so, again, I wish you all well and hope that you can reclaim peace quickly.
My hometown in south of Iran a town called Bastak was hit by big earthquake at the same time as Japan long as there is no human casualties we will recover but in Iran that process is extremely slow or not happening at all (the recovery process).
Oh man so sorry about your awesome ramne shop. Glad you're safe and everyone else.
I'm sorry the studio didn't fare so well through the quake, but you guys are all safe and you can rebuild. Ramen shop 2.0!
Hey Christ you wanted a test see how well it could handle a earthquake and hey this one way you can fix props to look like in a earthquake lol or leave some things.. funny come think they put fake water now you got real water on the floor lol
Oh my god bro, this is genuinely emotional to watch I'm so sorry this happened to you bro you took so much pride in that studio but you are alive and that's what's important
So sorry Chris stay strong bro 🦾🦿
It's a sign Chris. I guess Japan wants you to leave after that Ken Watanabe interview.
I'm glad you're safe Chris, thanks God, it sucks that your studio got screwed up, at least material stuff can be replaced, I'm glad you're with your friends during that sh@ty day. Stay safe, we love you brother
Welp. Time for a kitsungi video I guess.
Its unfortunate that the studio will need some repairs but I am glad that everyone seems to be okay. I'm sure you will have it back up and running before we know it! Thanks for sharing this with us, still
If you can find the piece's of the neko statue you could always fix it with gold like the Japanese used to do ^_^
Well taken
So glad you're safe, Chris. I was in the 2011 earthquake and its stayed with me for a long time. Probably one of the scariest moments of my life. I've moved away since then, but the sight and sounds of an earthquake still really scare me. I'm heartbroken to see the studio like this but I'm happy you weren't hurt.
Kintsugi repair that cat!
So uh what was that bright light that looked like an explosion?
I wonder if there's anything we can do to help?
My immediate thought when you mentioned that you were with Natsuki and  Sharla was "Thank God he's not alone after that."  Studio's a mess and there's gonna be stress.. But everything's gonna be fine. Love and Best Wishes from Virginia
I'm glad you and your friends are OK.  And hope to buy you a beer when I visit Japan. After I win the lotto. 🇯🇵
this is heartbreaking to see - me and my boyfriend have been watching this channel for years while we've been saving to go to japan, so seeing this is so saddening, can't imagine how you're feeling !! best wishes to you and the team :)
EDIT: please tell me you got insurance!   If you wanna check out what the building with quake bracing, have a look at Paolo’s channel, day in the life of a house builder :)
Thinking of you all ♥️
So the nine tailed demon escaped from the stone and then Japan has its worst earthquake for a decade?!? I think that’s enough 2022
Glad you all are ok. Sorry things got broken.
i hope you all ok and when you moving back
Glad you guys are all safe and well.
Can't help but laugh at your comments but I'm glad you're all safe, looks so scary
PLEASE RENT A SERIOUS DEHUMIDIFIER and run it for many days until it gathers no more water.
I heard about this from Anri Okita! She tweeted about it when net services re-established.
I am sorry for you to experience this, Chris. I'm glad that you are okay though! Take care and be safe!
sorry about your earthquake . that sucks.
feels absurd to like this but hopefully the video goes around more for some much needed revenue... take care everyone.
damn bro! hope you have some insurrance for this type of thing.
fuck that sucks dude im sorry...
Holy shit 😳 I’m so sorry.  Truly relieved you are all physically okay.
sounded like Godzilla was wrecking havoc in the nearest parallel universe
This was so tragic to hear and then witness from the videos around the area. I'm saddened to see what happened to your amazing studio that you literally just got built not that long ago. I'm glad you three are safe. I'm hoping Joey, Garnt, Connor and the rest are doing well. Wish you guys a fast recovery from all this damage.
Think you need a mop…
Over here in the states, nobody even talked or mentioned it. And I talk about news and things all day now... not even one report about Japan quakes.  Wow. Says a lot. Glad you are safe, cheers man.
!
Ah fuck
Perfect time to practice that golden glue repair method. Else I'd like to donate money for a new maneki neko ;)
Hey Chris I hope everything is OK glad your safe mate hope you didn't loose to much have you calculated the damage how can I send you a 100 euro let me know as soon as you can
not the ramen shop :(
Hopefully you've got good insurance, what a nightmare !
We're all happy you're safe!
I’m glad to see you’re okay, Chris! Thankfully there are things in the Ramen Shop Set that are still salvageable so you can rebuild.
stay safe Chris!!
🇦🇬 So glad none of you got hurt. We experience small tremors throughout the year, sometimes you think you’re imagining them. Last big one was at 05:50:58 on Tuesday, 8th October 1974. Magnitude 6.9-7.5. Described as “severe”. I’ll never forget. 🙏🏾
So is Japan finally letting foreigners in or is the earthquake somehow a fault of #thisisapen as well?
Being a California brat, I've had my share of 4s and 5s. I seriously can't imagine a 7.4. Glad that everybody on the team is safe.
OMG that looks scary, I hope everyone in Japan is ok,
I'm really glad to see you're alright even if the studio and you have both been fairly shaken up by this. Please continue to stay safe.
Don't try and clean up the water!!!!! That water leak could just be a small spot leaking but a huge puddle in the roof. It could be draining off down into a wall and on wires. Just because you see a small drip does not mean its not a huge leak thats just mostly flowing off somewhere else. With a shake like that you want to flip off the breaker for the unit and have them inspect it.
Im glad to see youre alright! May the powers that be keep you, yours and you're places safe and in one piece
It just occurred to me that there must exist people that get aroused with earthquakes or that see them as positive. Would be a fascinating thing that happens without no one never knowing about it.
Im just glad you are safe and all, sorry about your studio but hopefully its fixable stay strong❤️💪🏼
Bet that was good for land surfing!
Glad you’re good Chris and this is why I’m not materialistic because of things like this lol.
Glad you guys are safe xxx
Is there a way we can pitch in to help with the repairs for the studio :)
Oh my God, I hope things are well enough
I think you got off easy. Is it sad your set was the first thing I thought about when the news broke?
This is extremely sad to see after seeing how excited and proud you were of the studio. And in such a short time too. I hope you can get it cleaned and fixed as soon as possible with minimal issues, and at least you're all safe! Much love to you and the Abroad in Japan friends.
Glad to see you are all ok. Sad to see the studio got hit the way it did, but hey, that's all material stuff and nobody got injured.
Gematria folks already know
I'm sorry for the damage incurred on Japan during this quake but I wish everyone over there my love and support. What little that does from 10,000 miles away I don't know but it's all I can do from here.   Best wishes to you all
Im so sorry Chris.. but at least you and your friends were safe
Heart braking to see the studio in shambles, thank God you are all fine.
Oh Chris your poor studio. You've kept such a positive attitude about it after being so happy with it. Rip ramen
So glad you, Natsuki and your friends are okay. 🙏🏻💛
Really glad you're all okay. Can't imagine how terrifying it must have been. Sucks copious amounts of balls about the damage to your studio, hope you manage to rebuild!
Does insurance cover the damage? Or does Japan not offer insurance for such natural catastrophies unless you buy it separate from standard homeowners insurance?
Glad you are all ok, don’t stress too much things can be replaced. Maybe you could invite Aki up to earthquake proof all the wee nik naks in the studio she did a lot of research on in last year
I would not be walking around barefoot.
I am glad you are ok, Chris and I’m sorry about the ramen shop!  Being from a quite seismic place myself, I do understand how scary it can be to experience an earthquake. Take care and be safe! ❤️
I'm sorry Chris. I'm absolutely terrified of Earthquakes. Thankfully most material possessions can be replaced or restored. If anyone had been in there and gotten hurt that would've been devastating.
Theres a silver lining to this: anime figures have been ruined Thank God 🙏
The cat statue could become an example of that wabisabi thing you talked about in the early days of the podcast if you can find all the pieces
Glad u guys are ok, so ironic that I watched sharlas recent video the day before and she spoke about the train line she took that just opened up within the last year because of the earthquake in Fukushima years ago.
Looks like you made it out with only minor damage. Be careful though, I'm slowy getting gathering data on the earthquake for research purposes but everything I've seen so far suggests there may be more earthquakes to come. This particularly one may potentially be related to left over stresses from the 2011 tohoku earthquake.
This is such a shame but I am glad you were not hurt Chris.
What was that explosion in the 3rd video in the beginning?
Oh yes I just realized your back seems to be ok now ( last  abroadinjapan podcast you said it got sprained).  Really glad .
I'm glad all you and all the "crew" are safe.
2:25 still intact 😉🤣
Man the studio nooooo man it needs some work all over again fk
I remember my first earthquake in Japan. I was 22 and only a few months in the country.  I dived under the metal desk at work. When I came out, all the Japanese in my office laughed at me (not in a cruel way). I found another foreigner and we hugged. Both of us thought we were going to die.  After a few years I became blase. A friend told me that if there is an earthquake at night, just look out your window. If there aren't lots of Japanese people running around outside, then just go back to sleep.
Well I GUESS I’ll accept a free flight to Japan and several day’s stay to help clean up the studio but only because you offered.
So I'm not a very spiritual or religious person, but isn't it kind of strange that this happened DAYS after that rock that was supposedly holding an evil nine tailed fox spirit shattered?
Hey you still alive. There's that.
Happy to see you’re all safe and sound. 👍🏿😎🌟
Glad you're OK Chris!
I'm so sorry about the damage to the ramen shop and what everyone had to experience. Im glad to see you, sharla and natsuki are okay.
That's honestly so scary! I'm glad you guys are all ok!
Glad you and the others are okay.  Stay safe during the cleanup.
wish we were there to help you guys clean up! Super glad you all are ok!
You can restore and rebuild x
What's most important is that you're all safe and healthy. =) Material objects can be replaced.
God that's hard to even watch, I honestly don't know how you're so calm about this, I would be completely devastated. Glad to hear you're safe, and wish you all the luck in the world with rebuilding! Edit: Just joined the Patreon to help out! Good luck!!!
Well drat, sorry Chris. Perhaps you can commission a kintsugi expert to fix or modify the cat?
How is the hair salon your friend owns?
Now it looks like an even more authentic Blade Runner set! But really glad you weren't hurt. Things can be fixed and replaced.
I knew that Japan's earthquakes can be bad, but this looked like an apocalypse without the flames! I am truly glad that you're fine and safe!
All things considered, the studio looks like it didn't suffer too bad, but it does suck that it didn't even get a full year without an earthquake.
I'm glad you and your friends are safe. But I feel so heartbroken to see all that beautiful work smashed to pieces. Watching you gush over every inch while taking in all the beautiful architecture and knickknacks put around the ramen shop and alley was a wonderful highlight of this channel. I hope that it gets settled and repair soon, and hopefully you won't have to deal with such a terrifying experience any time soon. Much love! <3
This dude's reaction to a missile from North Korea was irritation and wanting to go back to sleep.  So when this dude is scared of an earthquake you know that earthquake was really crazy.
Glad you're doing alright, sorry about the set. That must really suck. :(
You should do the Japanese custom of repairing the neko with gold.
Stay safe man, earthquakes are scary
Sorry for the studio, but I’m happy that you’re fine and that the only loses were material.
In typically British fashion I feel compelled to say "Well, could have been a lot worse!". Hope the water damage isn't too bad.
your studio has real weathering now
Find someone who's into Kintsugi to go for the Maneki Neko.
@2:27 At least Chris' favourite picture is still safe and intact.
I am so sorry!! :-(
Glad you're alright Chris. Sorry about your studio we all know how much time and effort you spent on that.
74 pots on the floor. Uses plastic bag to move water.
My god. I’m just so thankful you, Sharla, and Natsuki are alright. I cannot even imagine the terror that was felt when that earthquake came out of nowhere. I am so sorry about your studio. I’m happy to see the apartment building is still structurally sound but I know some of the props and decorations meant a lot to you. Fortunately you have amazing friends who are there for you and 2.58 millions fans who are cheering you on so I hope that makes it a bit easier to deal with your current situation. We are all wishing you the best reconstructing and cleaning your apartment and studio. Thanks for keeping us updated!
Do plastic bags in japan not have holes in the bottom?
heartbreaking
Hey Chris. I'm really sad for you and to see this happen with your beautiful set. If you decide to replace everything, you should stick it all down with this putty stuff called "Quakehold" that museums use. It doesn't damage your items or leave a residue, and it works pretty well for keeping things from falling during an Earthquake. Hope you see this.
I didn't expect it to be this scary. Gosh...
Holy shit, glad you were out of the studio. The Maneki neko nooooo maybe there's a way to glue the pieces back together if you haven't thrown them out, would make a nice memorabilia
Glad you and all are safe. Sorry about your Neko.
Where someone would see tragedy you saw an opportunity for CONTENT
just glad youre alright mate sorry about the studio
Im glad all of your friends are safe! What a scary feeling 😭
Please stay safe and keep us posted. We're praying for you all.
Love you Chris! So glad to hear everyone is ok
But nothing moved in the end of the video...  How is this possible?! Sounded horrifying though!
Glad you and everyone is ok, Chris.
Is earthquake insurance a thing is Japan? Do you have to buy everything for your studio all over again?
As a Californian, I sooo feel for you ... really hope the afterschocks will be mild. Be safe
Yeah, that was a biggie. Glad you guys are okay.
Kintsugi time.
KITSUGI it
Glad to see you're alright! Good luck putting everything back together!
im glad youre safe!!! that must have been so scary
Watching this is heart breaking, Really glad you are all okay though cause that's the most important thing, hope you can rebuild ❤
When you grow live in a prone to earthquakes country, you are always aware of things that may fall during an event... Best wishes and I'm really glad that you and every one we know are ok...
Oh no Chris :( so sorry! It's weird because I remember you literally saying how you hoped there wouldn't be an earthquake because of the studio and the building it was in, and now it's happened, it's so unfortunate! Sending good vibes to everyone affected. Glad you're all safe.
Glad you're ok. It looked terrifying. best wishes to all of you.
wish you all the best
I hope you all stay safe
Glad you're OK brother!
All the best. Hope the insurances in Japan cover all that!
Did you ever find out where the water leak was coming from? That is worrying given all the electrical components of your studio. I'm glad you were not there during the quake, Chris. I'm sorry this has happened, for you and for all of the people of Japan effected.
I'm sry chris, this kind of think is painful fo sure. I hope you can get the help and insurance money needed to get things on track again.
And you just built the studio! I'm so sad right now😥😥😭 praying for all the Japanese people.
Looks like a casual British persons bedroom on any normal given day of the year! I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT!  - PS: It's good to see you 3 are okay all considering the scare!
Ta ta ta TEST YOUR MIGHT!
I hope the majority of everything is okay, just glad you guys are all safe, and I hope you can rebuild and get back to normal swiftly! Best of luck to you!
I really hope you have some good insurance, glad you are safe though ❤
japan has an arts for broken things called Kintsugi (pretty sure you know this already), can you make a video about that on your makineko?
now you got nuke boom set
Glad you are all safe. That is the most important!
Do you have earthquake insurance? 😳
Sorry about your studio Chris, but I'm glad all of you are okay! ❤
Them buildings strong as hell, damn.
Glad you’re safe.
I say keep the broken luck cat to commemorate the event.
Now the shop just has character, it's earned its dilapidated look.
If you want to go that route as like a little symbolic fact of the place surviving that earthquake and keep the maneki neko you could do some kintsugi repair maybe lol. No idea how hard or feasible it is but that neko would become a good conversation piece
東日本大震災、関東大震災はこれの5倍以上は恐ろしいってのが地震が無い国の人にわかるのだろうか
Maaaan I love your studio and I was really hoping that you might allow your followers visit it someday. It's really heart breaking to see this, I know you put a lot of hard work and effort to have this studio built up and to see it shamble like that is just devastating man.. But I'm very very glad that you guys are okay! You can tell that Sharla and Natsuki are your real absolute friends as they came with you to check out the studio and help you. Hopefully there's not another earthquake that hits Japan or any other place!! Stay safe Chris!
Such hard work to create this studio and all the money that went into it and its gone in seconds. What a shame. At least i'm glad you are alright Chris. Stay safe. Buildings can be repaired but there are no spare parts for people.
I wish I could hug you! I'm so sorry Chris. :(
4:45 glad to see that ramen survived
I am glad everyone is well.
Stay safe 🙏
I m just glad everyone is okay! Stay safe
That sucks.  Glad to see everyone on the team is okay.  Take it one step at a time.
The crazy thing is that you kind of semi predicted a big earthquake might come during your one of your streams within the past few months, I think it was the one with Ironmouse's Speak of the Devil since a bunch of questions where asked in that one too. Thankfully it is just material damage and you and your friends are fine Chris.
That must of have been incredibly terrifying, im glad you're okay chris!
They have your cat thing in the kitchen shopping area in Tokyo, so it must be quite available.  So sorry that you’ve lost so many of your vintage things.
If you have all the bits of the broken cat,  you should find someone who does kintsugi.
💔 So sorry.
If I was there I would help clean up😢
i have no idea how things work in japan but wouldn't insurance cover a lot of the damage?
Stay safe!
I'm so sorry Chris! This must have been horrible for you. I'm glad you are OK and I hope you have good insurance and that the studio can be redecorated very quickly. I think these maneki nekos can be bought in a lot of souvenir shops, I'm sure you can replace it soon. Stay safe!
Aww damn ... well is just material things and not your lives hope it all gets better soon .
It's so sad that your and our beloved studio went through all that damage but it's okay till you all are okay...I know u will overcome this soon...regards from your big fan sir❤️
Oh, could have been worse! I'm just happy you guys are ok!
Glad you safe and sound, but rip the recently built studio
Im glad you're safe Chris.
<3
Im really sorry for you
I'm so sorry for your studio. But you're safe and that's all that matters ♥ Much love dude
Glad your ok mate 🙏
Maybe contact the production company to kinda see if they can redo the set? They did a fantastic job ans I’m sure they would jump at the opportunity to help remake it if not improve on it
This is what happens when you complete Japan and start a new game plus... Now you're on hard mode.  Glad you're all ok, hope the repairs aren't too extensive.
If you have all the pieces for the maneki-neko, maybe you could find someone who could put it together again using kintsugi technique. Would be a really cool to see :)
Such a shame to see that your set was damaged. Thank god you're all okay though.
I'm so sorry. I know you love this place. I hope the new version will be better.
I'm glad you're safe I'm sorry about all the stuff you lost. I hope you can replace them with newer better memories. However, you just had a 7.4 earthquake and you guys really still take you're shoes off before stepping inside your building. There really is no acceptable time to keep them on is there?
I'm just really really REALLY glad you're all safe.
Take the cat to a kintsugi place to get it fixed and then you can make a video about it!
Man that’s genuinely heartbreaking… I’m so sorry. I’m glad you’re alright though
I've spent my lifetime half in Asia and half in North America.   If there's a blizzard, you find shelter and warm clothes and you're good.   If there's a heat wave, hydrate and find a well ventilated shaded area to stay and you're good, but when there's an earthquake, there's no where to hide.  It is hard to describe for people who had never experienced it.
0:10 and he woke up 3700 years later not knowing what happened
It's not an earthquake, but I just had a fire about a month ago- absolutely terrifying. I'm so glad to see you have friends with you as I know such events can really shake us up.
I'm glad the whole Abroad in Japan team is OK. God bless.
Glad you guys are doing well and safe
When I lived in Japan, I always carefully think about where to put the items, especially fragile one. There are many items you can find to stabilize the items as well. So you might want to use that. Also don’t worry about Manekineko! They are sold everywhere in Japan so it’s easy  to find it.
Chris meets Ken Watanabe and Japan’s like, “You said you’d leave! Get out!”
what a crazy world these day all I watch because of the war unfortunately are news and I havent heart a thing so far about the earthquake
Bro wtf. I've never experienced an earthquake but honestly, it was astonishing just how much everything shook.
Glad you’re safe! Repair that maneki-neko wabi-sabi style and it will be a good luck charm for the next disturbance!
Perhaps you could try some kintsugi on the maneki neko to turn it into a keepsake?
sometimes the earth just needs to let it rip
Watching whilst on the toilet and it made me wonder. What happened to the people on a toilet during the earthquake? 😭
Glad you all are ok. That's what matters.  Those items can be replaced. You all can't.
So sorry Chris. I hope the water damage isn't too bad.
Very sorry to see this Chris, but glad you, Sharla and Natsuki are safe. And think of it this way: your ramen shop now has some stories to tell. Perhaps a few of those broken pieces could still go on display, as part of the studio’s story.
Glad you three are okay. Shame about the ramen shop,, but 100 yen stores to the rescue!
Sure but you can prepare for a 5m high tsunami and when a 6m one rolls up there will still be people asking why you didn't prepare for a 6m tsunami. Can't do everything
Dear Chris, just so you know: we are with you (and Sharla, and Natsuki, and everyone involved). It brokes our hearts to see that all the hard work results in this. Sure that all pf you will be back better thant ever. Greets, from Italy
Glad you and your friends are safe.
Good to hear you are all ok with some minor losses.
I glad you're safe 🍀🤧✨
so glad you are all ok and safe <3 you gotta keep the Maneki-neko! adds some character haha
Sad to see your awesome studio in that state but glad it's not worse. Hope you're OK and that you don't ever have to go through that again
Kind surprised how some stuff stayed up and didn't fall down.
So glad that you are safe, stuff can be replaced but you can't.  Love your channel, and love you.  Sharla & Natsuki are also loved, be safe.
Oh my! I'm glad you're safe!
noooo i'm so sorry man :(
Sorry that you had to go through something so devastating. Hopefully you get your studio fixed and everything can go back to normal! 🙏🏾
What matters is you're safe. For the rest... embrace "Kintsugi".
you never realize just how much stuff you have until you have to clean up after a natural disaster
Glad your safe, but WTF is that image on the wall at 4:18? lol
I can’t imagine what you went through prayers for Japan glad everyone’s okay rip ramen shop
Wow. The only footage from the earthquake I've seen was from NHK outdoor cameras. Footage from inside the buildings looked much worse. Glad you're OK and safe. Especially considering that you live in Sendai.
Very sad for you...after all the hard work. O know it may seem trite, but, as the Japanese say (usually in Japanese)..."Do your best." You will come out of this OK.
Best to you and all the people of Sendai.  I have been in Tokyo, on the top floor of what was the Mitsubishi building, during an earthquake.  The building swayed like a boat.  But we were all ok as was all of Tokyo.  Japanese architecture seems built to very strict codes.   Of course, severe shaking does damage.  But at least things aren't collapsing on people like they used to.
Comment for the algorithm.
I'm sorry about the ramen shop, man. I hope you guys are able to restore any damages.
Every few years or so Japan reminds me why I actually wouldnt want to be a citizen. I live in Cali. we only get those every 20-30 years or so. Chris, I'm so sorry about your studio. Seems like yesterday you opened it and now it's destroyed.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Mother nature is a scary one. Sucks about the studio but glad to see your ok. <3
Glad you're all ok, thats the main thing!
am glad that you, Sharmeleon and Natsuki are all safe, it did break my heart to see the studio messed up like that and yes I know that bowls and plates are just items but some of the stuff you have fond memories of and its so sad when they get broken, wishing you all the best of luck.
"Abroad in Japan 2022: The year I learned Kintsugi"  All jokes aside, sorry to see the studio in this condition, at least you're all safe.
sry to hear, just after u paid all that money for a cool blade runner style setup studio thing too which i thought was amazing.  Hope insurance covers it.  stay safe.
Glad to hear you're safe Chris, honestly - keep the Maneki-neko in the shop, it obviously has some sentimental value to you and now it's got some extra character to it - can't expect to run a ramen shop without a few tipsy customers breaking a few plates, can't imagine that's too uncommon somewhere like Roppongi or Kabukichou hope to see the set, the neko and yourself back in action as soon as possible <3 x
relieved to see you guys are okay, stay safe chris! props to ya for putting out a vid on it so quickly too to update us
i am happy that you are safe.! Sending much Aloha!
Objects are replaceable, you are not. Glad you’re all okay 🙏🏻
at least you are okay! thank God for that ♥
That poor beautiful studio 😭😭
Gutted for you.  Hope you manage to recover the studio!
Really glad your alrite chris. Do let us know what we as viewers can do to help
Glad y'all safe! Studio took a hit and it's gonna take awhile to clean up but the material things can be sorted out. Most important thing is that y'all are safe 💙
After you'd just done your studio up! Such a shame 😭 But the most important thing is you're all safe and these things can be fixed and are just things 💓
Luckily, it looks like most of the liquor survived
I'm very glad and thankful that you guys were safe and that there was no extensive damage to your studio. Prayers to those who lost their lives and to those affected
If you need any money for studio repairs, you know your fans will be there!
Take the cat to a repair shop - they can use gold to repair it!
I remember the fear I felt after that big one in Alaska recently. Worst part is that even tiny shakes give you trauma.
Hope you and everyone is fine
Time for a bit of 'Kintsugi' on the old maneki-neko? Glad you're ok mate, best wishes to all over there.
That manekineko could have had a lot more fall damage and it only lose a little bit of form, things like that does make you believe in the luck those kind of objects bring as silly as they might be
Get an artisan to fix the cat with kintsugi!
I couldn't understand the title at first, or I just didn't want to believe it. But man this was depressing to watch
No that is so sad anyway we can send you money to help with the repairs
I’m glad you and everything are okay. The kitty is more lucky blessed now. 💕
OMG... so sad but so glad you are alright.  Stuff can be replaced, you guys can't.   Many prayers for a quick and easy rebuild!
Not that bad. Everyone seems to be okay so that is the most important part.
Glad to see that you're safe!!!
Stay safe dude
Glad you and Nakski are safe, take care guys
So sorry to see, hope everyone is ok over there
This sucks, but I have to point out the stickers @3:03. The builders rly went all out with the decoration, huh? xD
Dude, glad you are okay 💚🍀
I'm just glad Natsuki, Sharla and you are safe and sound but the state of your studio is simply devastating. I would've cried, had I been in your place. I hope the electricity isn't ruined and that you can sort the water problem quickly.
So sad to see this but it's good to see you and the crew are OK. I know how much this set meant to you and I think I can speak for all of us here when I say we wish we could come and help you. I hope you can get things back to normal and the water leak isn't too serious. Stay safe!
Best part is you have your health. i hope everyone is alright.
Makineko survived (for you), keep it as a homage to everything that's important.  Whishing your springing back into action soon.  Hugs!
With all other things going on in the world atm, I had no idea about this happened too.
Oh Chris - I'm so very sorry this has all happened. Like others have said, I'm glad that you are ok. Please be gentle with yourself these next few days. Stay safe.
Glad you are ok , stuff can be replaced , you can't .
Damnit, I pointed out on stream before that those wires were a fire hazard. But an earthquake causing water damage? Eeek.
Studio 1.0 didn't even make it a year.
Oh my goodness Chris I am so sorry that your studio got messed up, I hope its all fixable and there's no severe damage. Its such a shame to see your beautiful studio in that state. Sending all the love and good vibes your way ❤
Glad you and yours are ok Chris. Hope nothing substantial was lost in the quake. Thoughts and prayers goes out to all those who experienced this.
At least you guys are okay.
I'm glad you're ok, though I'm sorry about your new studio.
Glad you guys are ok, I've been through one before, obviously no where near as bad but surprising none the less as I was living in southern IL at the time!  They are scary
Ah man that’s super sad. The videos in the new studio have been really neat. I hope it’s good as new soon.
This is the one of the saddest thing I’ve seen in my life , I’m just glad that Chris and friends are alright
Keep in mind you can always replace things. Can’t do that with people. Glad you are safe.
Glad to your okay man. Take some time if need be to recover and to get back everything in order
This absolutely guts me! I've been a viewer since at least 2017 and just started binging the podcast while working, which means your voice is in my ear for a substantial part of every day (at least until I catch up, anyway). I hope clean-up goes smoothly and the studio makes a quick, glorious return!
NOOOO :'(
Prayers  to all of you in Japan, seeing all that damage is heartbreaking…
Stay safe, Chris, everyone!
I'm so sorry to see your set in such a mess. But at least no one was hurt things can be replaced and you can definitely move forward.
Hope everyone is okay, I know it must hard to look at and to go through but at least you have your health. My thoughts are with you all at thos difficult time and thank you for sharing your experience 🙏
I pray for my beloved 🇯🇵
The studio now has battle damage
I have gone through a 7.1 when I was a child in Taiwan and I slept through most of it while my mom is panicking.
would be a great opportunity to do a video about Kintsugi with all those broken bowls and the maneki-neko
You've been an inspiration to me and since I lost all contact with my family I've been struggling to move on, your videos gave me a new perspective and seeing the studio in those conditions truly makes me sad, I wish I could help you.
*_GLAD YOU'RE OK, CHRIS._*
Nooo the ramen shop! Was it insured? The only good thing is that you get a whole bunch more content out of blindfolded guests being introduced to the shop again...
What was that huge flash at night it did not look like lightning?
Glad ur safe brother!
Stay safe Chris ⚘
sending a big hug from Italy, hope everything gets better soon, happy that you are fine<3
Abroad in Japan, much like the nation of Japan itself, is made up of resilient people. I'm sure that you and the studio will be back up and running in no time. I'm just glad that you are all safe. Take care, Chris!
Really glad you’re okay! I’m sure the set can come back in no time
Damn man, I really loved the studio 😭 Atleast you were safe. Hope the place can be repaired"
I'm glad you are safe and doing ok.
You have been in my prayers since I heard about the earthquake. Will keep them up. Hang in there!
Chris I'm glad you're okay!!!
i am just glad you guys are save
Scarry thing but you are fine. Sorry for the damages
The main thing is you and your friends are unharmed! Bless you 3 for holding together through this. But damn this must hurt. Take your time rebuilding, everyone here understands.
Hopefully you will bring your studio back to it's former glory. I hope nothing else of yours was equally as damaged as these things. This is the only thing I'm afraid of when thinking about moving to Japan, a fear of losing everything is huge, I feel bad for you. Stay safe.
Man that is upsetting to hear... I'm glad you're safe but I just remember you saying this set was a big risk and you were so proud/happy about it and this happens not long after. Hopefully insurance or some sort of coverage was put on it? :(
Invest in a mop and bucket dear boy... no pun there, just good advice I think. 😅 Dat Rag n Bad sitch  AINT IT, hoss.
The important thing is that you're well and everyone there! Massive respect to the japanese infrastructure. I hope you are okay chris! As always your videos makes me feel better every year 🥰
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, not the studio! Sorry to hear this man.
Damn! Glad you’re okay and hopefully the studio will be back up and running soon!
Dude at 00:10 something crashes to the ground from the sky wtf was that?!
Glad you're at least safe and hopefully the leak can be fixed soon-ish. For all the tableware, water damage is the biggest threat to the studio right now. Take care and chin up, aul' boy.
oh my god what if he actually dies
Glad you are all ok, stay safe there, hopefully there won't be many big earthquakes in the near future. Good luck with the studio Chris, it already looked a lot better at the end.
I’m so glad you didn’t get hurt! Really sucks what happened to the studio. I hope you can get things replaced easily.
still being able to make jokes after your studio got damaged that hard is pretty impressive.
I am so sorry this happened but am glad you are safe!!!  This tip MAY be in vain, but for any unsecured items on shelves, maybe try using museum putty to keep them in place just in case. The putty is designed to keep valuable museum items from falling off shelves and displays
Good luck Chris
It still looks authentic, now it looks like a ramen shop ravaged by an earthquake
God bless, Chris! I hope it's all as minimal cost to repair as possible! So glad you were okay! Take care!~
Glad you're okay. It's sad to see the studio in that state but I'm glad you didn't get hurt
man that feels really bad just by looking.. As a casual figurine collector i can't even imagine those in japan having their massive collections being smash and money gone wasted after looking at the amount of damage that caused your "ramen" set
“Touch wood” Garnt said the same thing during his stream, must be a British thing. Glad you’re all ok though.
So glad you're ok! Did anyone see Risottoro at the time of the earthquake??
Love you Chris
Meanwhile : Connor singing the Rumbling during the earthquake
am just happy that you not injured Chris
I think the Maneki Neko still looks awesome an now it's got one more story to tell, maybe you wanna keep it :D
Wow !
Hope your ok big man, all of us wish you well. IDK what to say but feel better ig lmao
ki o tsukete
what's a mess for if not to b e cleaned ?
Hope everyone is ok Prays for people to get back on their feet. :/
I hope you are OK???  I hope that Sharla, Emma, Aki, Joey, CDawg, Tokyo Creative, Natsuki , and Rotero are OK as well.  I heard of the quakes on the news, here in the USA.  Please be safe.
that's messed up, man but it's nice to know you're alive and well. hope you can get your studio back in action with no issues
🥺🥺
nooooo this place JUSt got a makeover too omg :(!!!! I'm so glad you (and hopefully the team) are ok though. Maybe the redo of the space will make it safer, like you said, have more of it screwed down and everything.
Glad you guys are OK! I understand how you feel (I've was in sendai for 3-11) and now this. I didn't know you were in sendai. Maybe I'll see you around. It will take some time but I promise you you will feel better, never the same, but you will recover. I know from experience. Keep up the great work. And make time for yourself to process this.
So sorry a lot of things got destroyed. Great that you are safe.
Stay safe Chris and Crew.
U can Buy New Studio and Equipment  . Bat U can't Buy New Abroad in Japan / Criss / Drip King . u cod Stream in Park or in your room   and i Wod Still watch u .
Glad you made it out OK Best of luck with fixing your studio.🙏
Things can be bought again, memories can be re-created again, as long as you are still alive. Glad to know that you guys are doing well! Please stay safe, take care, take a bit of time off to recharge and come back again!
I am so sorry to see this happening. You worked so hard for this, and to see it all smashed up breaks my heart for you. ♥♥♥
What's most important is that the quake wasn't worse and that's for the most part everyone is okay. Been meaning to for a while, but I'll look into joining the patreon for a bit to try and help with the damages.  I've been enjoying your content for a long time and you've been an inspiration. A few bucks a month is the least I can do for years of great free content, Chris
i am sad that all this happend but see the bright part now you have an excuse to show us how the whole repair with gold shit works (i think japan does this sometimes with bowls and so on)
Build back better……. :-)
Hang in there bro,  glad you are all ok, love the content, thoughts are with you.
Wish you guys all the best and a swift recovery for the Studio.
Chin up Chris, stuff can be replaced, you definitely can not be. Glad you are all safe, and holding out hope for you that you can get the space back to the way you want it.
What was the big light at 00:10 ?
OMG, happy you're okay at least! Feels kinda weird "liking" the video, but yeah... damn...
Really hope you have insurance Chris
I haven’t watched in quite a while. He’s got a studio?
Oh man you should keep the lucky cat as a trophy / reminder and take the opportunity to make the studio even better than what it was!
Good to know your alright. Forget the towels get a mop, a bucket and a broom for cleaning up. And for your props get plastic instead of ceramic at least those wont break. I can relate to the feeling, it catches you off guard and then you have to run. Here in Mexico City in 09/17 we had a very hard earthquake, many places where damaged and many people died, buildings collapsed and some had to endure the quake inside, hope that its wasn’t as bad in Japan. Be safe and always remember the procedures, that saved many lifes here.
Glad that everyone is safe. Hope the aftershocks aren't too bad.  So sad about the studio and so many people's houses... sending kind thoughts!
I wonder if after 10 years living there if returning to the west (like for visits with family) feels weird? Or has he lost the taste of a certain food or snack? .   Like, say he loved a certain brand of potato chips (I think a brit would call them crisps) but after 10 years of not being able to buy them at the corner store, he goes back home and tries them only to find they now seem nasty.
Best wishes Chris. Your one of my favourite YouTube's. Your my inspiration when learning Japanese and have made such amazing content. Thank you for everything and keep going.
Be Safe Chris! Happy you and the team is well...
scary af
That sucks! Glad you're okay though!
I'm really sorry Chris, I know how proud you were of the set. I really hope you have some sort of insurance. But most important, I'm glad your safe and well.
I hope everyone else who stays in that building is safe
Glad you're all ok and wishing for speedy recovery! That must've been very hard considering how new the studio is.
ahw, fuck
My wife lived in Tokyo in 2011, and she said it was one of the most frightening things she ever experienced.  The sky grew oddly dark, everything went quiet....the store she worked at sold out with water in a matter of hours. I have yet to experience an earthquake in my time within Japan.
Good that you are ok
Glad you're all alright and no one was in there 💙
This is legitimately upsetting. That studio was a true work of art.  I mean its better than one of you guys getting hurt. But still its upsetting. I hope you can get it up & running again without much issue.
Studio can be rebuilt mate, it's gonna be alright. At least y'all have your health
Let us donate! Make it fun!
Noo, not the studio! Glad you guys are safe atleast.
How is the mirror unharmed xD
Glad you're all safe.
Glad to see you not hurt. Sorry to hear about the studio.
It is great to hear you are safe.
I'm glad you're safe Chris. I hope insurance won't give you too many headaches when you try and claim this.
That guy put up a hard time making videos. Made a studio with his lifetime earnings. Even when his whole studio gets destroyed, he is still trying so hard to hold back his tears. He is still not trying to gain sympathy but is rather joking around. I salute you Chris. You are the best person I came across my life. Life can be so hard. I feel you.  T_T
Glad all of y'all are alright. You, Sharla and Natsuki. 🙏
Oh my! What an experience! Thank God you, Natsuki, and Sharla are alright. Prayers to Sendai for a quick recovery. Let's also pray the earthquakes are much smaller next time.  All your viewers are thinking about you and everyone there. If you need any help from the viewers send out the word.
definately a learning experience to take away
oh no thats heartbreaking. but in the end just damaged goods, glad you and your friends are okay.
fuck man you hate to see it. im glad youre safe and I hope others are also alright.
So gutted for the damage to your studio, but glad you and all your friends are unharmed.
it looks like an abdonned fukushima/ mining town
Glad he’s ok but sucks about the studio
Omg I'm so sorry this happened to you. But it's easy to see your priorities are in the right place and you will recover from this.  Best wishes!
Condolences sir.  tis but a scratch.   a mere setback.   you will rebuild.  ( use lots of duct tape)
Best wishes from Scotland, hope you get back on your feet.
It's sad to see the damage on the studio but the most important thing is that you're safe after that huge earthquake🙏
Stay safe Chris T_T
*hugs*
Glad you’re safe! Looks terrifying even with Japan’s prepared building structures
I am glad to see that you and those closest are fine and well. What a shocking experience to have to endure. I have family is Sendai and Yokohama, we were worried for a while but they are all safe and sound. I hope that the leek can be stopped soon and all dried out & repaired/replaced in no time. Just a thought - what is insurance like for you in an earthquake zone? Take care. TS-26
can anyine tell me what the huge light in the sky is at 10 seconds ?
Glad yall are safe. On a somewhat brightside for the studio, you have so many walk-throughs and tours with other creators so you could probably rebuild based on the combined footage.
Good luck putting it back together  !
Not the Maneki-neko D:
Kind of feeling glad I'm a minimalist now, as I want to move to Japan and that looks scary as hell, all the small broken things, especially glass.... I have only experienced the aftershock of a mag 6 earthquake from a state over that managed to work its way over, and even that was upsetting in the middle of the night. To experience this first hand, right in the middle, and all at once as you said, like a bomb versus a slow rocking buildup increasing in intensity... I would have probably peed my pants. Quite literally. So glad you and hopefully everyone are alright, and at least the studio survived! Best wishes to you, sharla, her cats, and natsuki.
Glad you're all okay. Hope insurance is good over there!
Just glad that you're all safe, and amazed at how few injuries occured during the earthquake - all the cheers for earthquake-proof engineering! The studio probably only looks as bad as it does because of the large amount of loose items that made up the ramen shop. Shows how well the main units were built since they all survived. Hopefully the water leak isn't too difficult to get sorted and that none of the electronics are fried afterwards.
I think the Kitsune really went out...
I am so glad all of you are okay & nobody got hurt! It honestly must have been terrifiying for you Ive only been in very minor earthquakes myself and that already puts you on edge but one of this magnitude must just feel like the end! Again I am glad that everyone is okay and that the studio wasnt "too" damaged and able to be put back to saftey in the after math x
Seeing the studio like this is genuenly terrifying and heartbreaking but i am glad that you are okay Chris, stay safe man! <3
Sharla cursing at 1:41 was funny. lol
wow..................that earthquake really did a number on the old ramen shop
I would had cried if that beautiful studio was mine. Chris , no rush in putting out content, we will wait and support your channel.
Glad you're doing good. Don't loose hope Chris. A Studio can be rebuild!
glad youre all ok. ill be sure to donate next live stream to help the recovery
Only Chris can keep a smile on his face in a time like this. I hope you can get back on your feet soon and I feel really bad for all the damage that has been done that will cost a pretty penny.
Glad you are ok! best wishes from the UK. Take your time getting the studio back in order!
Thank goodness you ok. I know you just invested in the studio, and now to have to restart has got to be supper difficult. If it helps any, if you start a gofundme all your fans can help you.
Once, while at work - this must have been at least 15 years ago - there was a 5.0 quake (middle of the Mediterranean; there is the occasional seismic activity). That was quite unnerving. A 7.4 quake is 250 times more powerful than that, so... damn right you were scared. It must have been absolutely terrifying.
So happy to hear you are safe Chris and have Char to support you in these tough times.
glad you're OK
About your Maneki Neko, it might be a good time to do a video about Kintsugi. I had heard about the earthquake but not realized how bad it was till watching this.
You have amazing friends Chris , it’s a relief to know you have such wonderful humans to help each other out in awful times . Just glad you are all ok . Natsuki and sharla are family you can tell . Lots of love laddy
This is truly very sad. Your set was so beautiful, and seeing it all fucked up really sucks. Im glad to see that the larger parts of the set seem to be mostly intact and its just the props that fell over.
i have the same maneki neko weirdly i tink i have had it since i was a tween gifted from parents (veterinarians) japanese clients... and it also shattered in an earthquake, since i moved from maryland to california, and i put it back together with cracks...
Bummed as we can be about the studio, I think I can say that we (the fans, collectively) are glad that you and your friends are safe after what had happened. We can rebuild, we have the technology!
Glad to see you're alright! I hope that the people around you are safe and sound too.
oh shit :( this sux
Fucking hell Chris, at least you guys are all safe. Hey, maybe if some of the pieces aren’t too shattered it could be an opportunity to perform some kintsugi and reassemble the shards with golden glue.
So sorry! hope people were not injured during the earthquake. glad you are ok guys
The fact you guys can laugh after experiencing something this bad is a testament to your grit!
I'm glad that you are OK . I know it sucks your stuff being broken, but they can be replaced , you can't !  Take care and be safe ! Cheers, Tony
The important thing is you're all safe. ❤ During your 5 hour livestream you did express a fair degree of prescience about this.
So sorry to see your set in such a state of disrepair, but I'm glad all of you are ok. I genuinely feel bad for Chris, as this set was a huge deal for him, and I can only imagine how it must have felt walking into the studio and seeing all the items that were destroyed.
That must have been so upsetting. Sending Virtual hugs Chris 🤗🥺🥺❤
Oh damn...I guess this is the single most offputting thing about Japan as a whole - the constant threat of these.  Good to see you're fine, and your studio is not annihilated, though it is a shame about the cat and the other stuff. Good luck getting everything up and running again!
Stay safe Lads!
so glad to see that you're all okay.  you were all immediately in my thoughts, when i saw the news.  stay safe & take care.
You're safe. No  matter how much you love it, stuff is stuff. We can't replace you. Glad Natsuki and everyone else is safe. Earthquakes are a scary part of living in Japan.
glad you're safe bro
Glad you were safe! Such a shame the studio props were damaged to that extent, relatively short after the studio was finished. Love you Chris and your channel.  You will be back on track in no time!
It saddens me that your studio took a toll, but I am glad to know you are safe.
Glad you are all OK and sorry to see the damage caused to your studio. 😕
I’m sorry this happened chris. At least you’re alright. Good luck in the future
I cant imagine losing something like that...stay safe 🙏
Chris: Oh fuck, oh fuck, Subtitles: Oh god, oh god.
😭 The ramen shop is ruined
Your abroad in Japan studio  i feel for you . just got build  and then and earthquake. I am  glad your safe and i hope the repair work goes well and wont costs you  very much.
Such a bad time, specially since you just got your new studio up. I'm just happy you're ok Chris!
Sad that some items that you were attached to got broken. Perhaps now would be a good time to finally try to take the title of Anime man and have Connor give you some of his cursed Anime figurines.
Take care Chris, Sharla, and Natsuki.
Hopefully the after shocks are minor
Hang in there Chris!
I saw the video on Twitter first, and all I can say is it was very heartbreaking to see the studio like that; as a viewer, I can only start to imagine how you feel. I wish you the best in rebuilding the studio, Chris, and we're all glad you're safe.
What the hell was that flash at the beginning of the video? Seemed like a bom went off.
It was only a 4 where I live and it scared the absolute shit out of me.
I am so glad you are safe. I would have been scared silly if I had experienced a earthquake. Hang in there
I remember the kashmir earthquake and it was horrifying so I can imagine. Stay strong 💪
Bless you all it looks sooo bad. Back here in the uk I started shitting it as I’m coming out there in April 😳😳  Keep safe you guys xx
Glad you're okay! It must have been scary as hell...
Unfortunately these earthquakes will keep happening and likely be stronger, but now you know to be extra careful/prepared next time hopefully will be not as bad, glad no one was hurt!
Luckily Chris himself, Sharla and Natsuki are all safe. The studio can be rebuild so best of luck with that!
Anyone doing a raise funds for new ramen shop? Let’s get Chris back his shop!
So happy you are all safe and so glad to see you have friends with you to help get through this! Stay strong guys! Thoughts and prayers to you and yours.
I live in Kanagawa and the shake was strong enough to kill the electricity throughout the city for 2 hours. I can't imagine the terror to be so close to the epicenter.
Glad to see you all are okay, heres to making the studio even better than before!
Could just patch the ceramics back together. Then it adds some character.
Bruh.mp3, my most heartfelt condolences, that's awful. Stay safe. I am glad you're alive and well, and so are Sharla and Natsuki. Hugs from Mexico.
Man it's a huge bummer about the studio but I'm sure glad that you are Alright, stay safe Chris!!!
Glad everyone is okay. Stay safe
Hope your and everyone else in Japan is ok
Very scary. Glad you are all safe.
Japan goes brrrrrrrr
I spent a few years living near a railway line that "rumbled" a lot... over time plates etc would creep off shelves, this was where I started using blu tac to secure items better... I know it's an earthquake, ie blu tac wtf? but even if some items don't leap off shelves, it's a win.  All Best from UK 👍🖖
News: Earthquake hits Japan. Me: Is Chris alright and has abroad in japan uploaded a video about that yet?
wish you luck cinderella!
Happy you're safe!
Stay safe man :(
As a person living on one of the biggest fault lines in the US this is kind of scary to see. Y’all are the ones getting me through being stuck at home so thank goodness y’all are safe and it wasn’t any worse than it was.
Glad you are all okay, and that the studio isn't completely destroyed. Excuse the silly question, but does anyone know what the flashes in the sky are all about?
News says more on the way over the next week I seriously hope they’re not as bad if they do come. I’m so sorry for your studio but so glad you’re safe!
You should get that cat repaired with Kintsugi, that gold filament thing. Keep it as a momento of the surviving spirit of Abroad In Japan
I haven't experienced a lot of earthquakes. I can't imagine how scary big ones must be!
Glad you're okay Chris and Thank you for posting a channel update!
Sad to see, happy you’re doing fine tho!
If you think about it, It's better that the earthquake hit and ruined the studio now than it is 4 years down the line when you have a lot more memories stored in there.
Aloha! Hope all is well! Please take care! Aloha!
I like how the mirror stayed up and everything else was fine kinda
Glad to see y'all are ok for the most part. Hope you don't have too many repairs to do and that you guys have some good insurance.
The eqathquake must be Chris fault. He always said he will leave Japan after Meeting ken Watanabe , he is still there even after the Gods send Ken, the Gods are now angry :D
Glad you're safe! That must've been super scary 😰
So glad you’re okay ❣️
Oh man sad about the studio but as long as everyone's safe that's all that matters. 🙏
I am so glad you are ok and safe. I am sorry about your studio. 😞 xx
Oh man Chris, I'm extremely sorry for your studio, but I hope you're doing well and nothing happened to you. Let me know if we can help you. Greetings from Bavaria
It pains me to see all this damage. I wish you all the best, stay safe
I Genuinely didn't know there was an earthquake in Japan, This Video is my first time hearing about it, glad You're safe Chris. Wish everyone a quick recovery, keep safe!
earthquakes are scary as hell.
Nooooooo😭😭😭
Glad you are fine man Please take care everything will hopefully get back to normal soon.Hang in there.
The important thing is the precious irreplaceables remained in tact, like the Trash Taste fan art.
GOOD GOODNESS THATS STRONG
F man that is suck
Maybe it's time to try your hand at kintsugi, particularly with the maneki neko!
There is this japanese technique to fix stuff with gold-glue. Would fix up the cat that way. ❤🐈
Oh, my heart sank Chris.
What a shame, hopefully you will be able to restore everything.
That sucks!!! But glad to see no one was hurt or in the studio at the time. Hope the insurance is able to cover most of this 👍 do you have a subscription link or any merchandise I can buy so I can show my support?
Damn, I can’t imagine how it would’ve felt. Really sucks that everything went down, good luck fixing everything Chris!
Hope things settle down, im genuinely sad for seeing such a cool man cave go down
Glad to hear that you are alive! Take as much time as you need to get back on your feet, we all will wait ! Keep it real Chris.
You can get your maneki neko fixed with gold and make it look better than ever!  I am amazed the ramen bowls didn't come off the counter.  Looks like the shaking was pretty bad there.  Sorry for the mess you have to clean up, but I'm glad to see the damage was pretty minimal.
I’m glad everyone is ok!
OMG - that earthquake looked as bad as the Northridge quake back in the 90s in CA. It was a scary feeling...something I do not want to live through again. Man, must be rough. Besides the damages in your studio, I hope you are doing okay (as well as you can be). It must be traumatic. Sorry you'd to go through that 😞.
i was worried you  would slip on an empty bucket of fried chicken
It’s gotta be hard investing in property in areas that suffer a lot of natural disasters knowing it could be destroyed at any moment. Even with insurance I’m sure it’s stressful knowing your investments of time and money as well as personal items could easily be damaged.
In 2017 there was an earthquake in Mexico City that was about the same magnitude. Luckily me and my family were fine, but there was a lot of damage in the city (a lot of which you can still see today). I'm glad to hear everything's ok bc that's certainly something to shit your pants to lmao
I just hope you have insurance.
Just how big was the reach of ths earthquake?
It’s sad to see your treasures in the studio being destroyed so badly, but I’m relieved that you’re safe. I hope everything goes well soon, best wishes!
Look out for yourself mate. Im glad you're all safe there.
IU am so sorry for your Studio ... you just built it :(
I’m glad you’re safe and the damage isn’t too bad! Take care!
It’s Japan
I am really glad you are ok Chris.  Studio got hammered pretty hard and you just got it build :(   Stay safe
Stay safe,
When the last big earthquake on land hit in Kobe 1995, the shockwaves woke me up around 6 AM in Tokyo.  For me it was too far away for any real damage, but still, the experience stays with you.  For Chris, this was almost a direct hit.  Good that casualties were so low.  Hope you can get things fixed.  All the best to you Chris, Natsuki, Sharla, Risottaro and everyone else!
Sad to see the damage man :(. Im glad everyone is okay at least! But thats gonna be alot of clean up. And its a shame to see it in shambles so soon....
This video made me sad, but I am glad everyone is safe. At the end of the day it's just stuff. You will fix, clean, and be back up and producing videos in this super space soon! Best of luck with the cleanup!
I'm just glad you Sharla and Natsuki are OK.  Hang in there.
Let's each watch this 5 times so Mr Affable can recoup the losses
Dam dude that sucks about the studio, glad your ok though. Things can be bought again and buildings can be repaired but your health and safety is most important. Glad ya all are ok.
We should set up a fundraiser for repairs...
That's awful! I hope everything gets back to normal soon, putting that much effort into something only to have it destroyed so soon is terrible.
uh, ok, what was the flash of light at 0:10 ????
I just saw the Q&A with Ryotaro and how you said you'd one day make a video about an earthquake since you've never done it.  Quite funny actually
oh no!
Glad you're all okay. Sorry about the Studio
I am glad you are safe chris but very sorry about your studio
sorry to see that happened to you man. best of luck in getting everything back to better than it was!!!
this is so sad i cant watch this . its was his dream studio man took him years
lucky it was not an up down earth quake or worse the both in a combo
I was in Athens for the 2020 earthquake, first time I’ve ever felt a building feel like it’s being tossed around with me in it. Luckily no damage where I was but a lot of devastation throughout the Aegean islands and Turkey where the epicentre was. Experiences like this are pretty scary but if we get out of it unharmed we’re the lucky ones.   For your studio, it might seem like a few steps back, but a few steps back on a journey that has had a million steps forward still stands you in good stead. Glad you’re safe and I’m sure the studio will be back better than ever.
Soooo sad, glad everyone is ok tho!
i'm glad you're okay and safe, sorry about the studio, but im glad you and your friends are safe!
Nooo ... Not the studio. 😭
stay strong chris :(
Hey Chris, glad to hear you’re safe and sound! Sad to see, what happend to the studio you put so much effort in. But it can be rebuilt, maybe even better than before. Keep up the good spirits🙏🏼
I honestly felt a pang in my heart when i saw the studio considering how much time and money you must have sunk into that place. Well....it could have been a lot  worse
Glad you’re all okay! Hopefully you can find new bits for your ramen shop!
Studio cleaning steam, let's goooooo!
Glad you're safe Chris🙏🙏
If you haven’t turned the water off yet, find the shutoff cock for the apartment and shut it off.
What was that big flash at 00:10  !!!!!!!!
Thank you for the update Chris! When I saw that one wall of the set had fallen over, I was worried how you were going to get that back up. I'm glad you were able to do so!
First 20 seconds of this video were genuinely scary for me, I can't even imagine this happenning at my home.
Thank God you sharla and natsuki are okay!
If anyone says why you didn’t prepare for an earthquake they obviously never experienced an earthquake
I am so sorry Chris
Seeing the studio made my heart sink. At least nobody was in it during the earthquake and you all came out safe. Hope you can get the studio back on track soon.
I'm glad you are ok. I contacted my friends there once I heard about it. Thankfully all of them are good to.
glad you're okay! hope the other boys are too!
What happened to the studio absolutely SUCKS! But, so happy that you and everyone are ok! Take care of yourself and take your time with everything. 💜
You might not see this comment but your broken cat. Turn it in to Kintsukuroi.  It would be even more authentic Japanese art.  Both in memory and application.
I thought about your studio as soon as I saw news about the earthquake on Twitter. To be honest I'm tearing up a little seeing the damage, but I hope you're able to get everything fixed and tidied up as easily as possible
I'm in Tokyo. Over 2 million homes here lost power yesterday, I was one of them. Over 300km away. Luckily it only lasted a little over an hour.  Been here 4 years, this was my first huge earthquake also. I was hiding under my desk, just hoping it wasn't 3/11 again. Prayers for you folks up in Tohoku, can't imagine the PTSD.
Gonna need a shop vac for that water or a large fan
❤️ 🇯🇵. Take care.
So it to day dam i wood of wish I wood of has be a god soul in japan
Its only important that you are safe... Other things can be replaced and cleaned ❤️❤️ Keep safe!!!
Loves your video. Glad to see that you are doing fine and your studio only have some damage. All will be better soon.
💔 I'm so sorry Chris. I know how much the ramen shop meant to you. I'm glad you're all safe.
Im glad you are OK.
Glad there are no personal injuries! The studio can be rebuild and restocked. Stay safe!
Chris's studio was the first thing i thought about when i heard of the earthquake, all in all tho its mostly ok so thats great and ofcourse glad all the youtubers in Japan are ok.
0:09 wth is that?
Chris should take up kintsugi.
As long as you are ok, that's the main thing. Objects can be replaced but you can't. Much love 💜
It's quite sad looking at all the shattered things on the floor. But, glad you're okay :)
Awh i'm so sorry Chris :c we all know how much love and work went into building this studio, how many years it took to get to this point...it really saddens me yet reminds us just how fragile life is. Just really glad you as well as the other Japan vloggers are okay! ♥
Glad to see you guys are ok. Things can always be fixed or replaced.
This really sucks for you man.... Really glad you're safe tho ❤️
I’m so sorry to hear so much was damaged, I live in California and can understand how hard it is to live with earthquakes
holy fuck I didn't know it was this bad °__°
Your studio had so much drip, this really is a shame. At least I'm glad you're safe! Hopefully you can rebuild with the help of all your mates!
<3 I'm so glad you all are ok!
Glad you're okay
Oh that got me emotional.. I didn't expect the damage to be this much.. It's good that you're safe though.. Hope that everything goes well and you can fix the studio asap.. Stay safe
Do you have a patreon? Id want to donate so you can rebuild and buy back if possible
Is there anyway we can donate to help repair your studio?
The most important thing is that you are safe.  Items can hopefully all be replaced with the help of the ones that got the studio built.   I believe there are various products available that could help keep things in place in the future.   I know Akidearest has shown some on her channel, not sure how well they would work for your stuff, but at the very least it could help prevent future damage.  R.I.P.   maneki-neko you shall be missed.
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
Oh Chris-I'm so sorry you've been so affected by this. Sending all the good vibes from a cloudy Plymouth, UK. Chin up- so glad you and the guys are safe.
Sorry about your studio but glad you all are safe.
I immediately thought of you and Pete and how he wants to be part of a “cheeky little” earthquake jesus glad you are alright but damn it hurts to see your studio like that. You seem very chill about it which is pretty admirable! Stay safe Chris!
I am so sorry Chris for what happened.  I am glad you and your gangs were safe!!
Natsuki is the only person that can make something tragic seem not bad
Kinsugi the Maneki Neko. Or the bowls.
We all know how important that studio project was to you, so sorry to see it in such a mess. Hopefully things can slowly get back into order. Most important we’re glad your safe!
for the ceramic cat it'd be really cool if you could get a faux kintsugi done to piece it back together.  Assuming doing it with real gold is not an option hahaha, but getting something to that effect could be cool :)
This is one of the main reason why I never actually thought about living in Japan (not like I'm actually good enough to do that but still...), the fear of suddenly losing everything at no fault of your own is just too terrifying to even just imagine.
I'm so glad you guys are ok I was so worried about you guys, it's heartbreaking to hear about all the damage Japan took... Stay safe
i'm just glad you are all ok, never experienced an earthequake, let alone 2 massive ones followed by the terrifying possibility of a tsunami. As for the studio, sorry for all the things you lost, but I'm sure it will be even more amazing when you rebuild it. Stay safe
Feel for you man! I
Fuck man that sucks
Just glad you're all uninjured
I'm glad you're okay! Stay safe and take your time to recover
Aww that really sucks for you, sorry this happened. Perhaps you can keep the smashed cat as a reminder of how lucky you were not being in there when the earthquake happened? I am glad you are ok though <3
Glad to see you are safe man. 🙏
You can use the repair method kintsungi for the neko and some of the dishes. Its good way to remember what happened and keep some things from this event.
I'm pretty sure there are glues and epoxys that you can use to fix ceramics.
4:19 top left wtf😂
I'm so glad you are okay! Hang in there and I know it's intense feels right now but you've got it, Chris!
Glad your okay chris. Sorry about your ramen shop. Glad you were not there when it happened. But I know you can rebuild an even better set. With an earthquake story attached as well.
Glad everyone's ok in crew!
Glad You are ok.
Keep your head up Chris! That's the right attitude! Maybe you can use as an opportunity to make new things to the studio(upgrade menu items) or outside. Best of wishes
Glad you're okay, that's terrifying!
Man. I hope you guys have insurance for the set. Jeez. Best of luck dudes.
One of the reasons i will never move out of Europe. The weather is shit, but no tornados, earthquakes, tsunamis or whatever else nature seems to throw at humanity everywhere else. Maybe flooding can get devastating, but it's really rare.
"2022 will be finally a good year!" Few months in and we have earthquakes and wars going on ⚰️
Happy to see you're safe mate!
Glad to hear from your video that everyone is ok. Hope the last quake at the end of the video didn’t cause more damage.
Glad you folks are ok!
material things and money come and goes but lives are irreplaceable. I'm glad you guys are okay! tomorrow will be a brighter day!
I'm sorry for the damage and the scare, I'm glad at least nothing else happened to you
Hot dam  Glad it wasn’t worse
0:09 wtf that's some Mecha sht
I lived through the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the beginning of this was the closest thing to PTSD I have experienced. Stay safe!
When I saw your tweet I didn't expect it to be this bad, but at least you guys are safe. It is unfortunate that the studio has taken damage but in the end Abroad in Japan is the people like you and Natsuki not a studio.
Glad you guys are ok!! 😦 Aw, the poor maneki neko... That is genuinely sad. You need some “earthquake putty” or whatever it’s called. It’s like sticky putty to hold down your knickknacks on their shelves. Hope the water damage isn’t too bad either… better get some mold killer cleaning spray just in case.
Hopefully the water damage is light and not costly. Luckily not all of your studio was destroyed. Happily you, Natsuki, and your camera people are safe and unharmed.
Glad yall are safe
Glad you’re safe Chris that’s the most important thing 👍🏻 glad Sharla and Natsuki are too
I'm so sorry brobro I hope this doesn't happen again
Glad you and your team are safe! Maybe this could be a video project about earthquake in Japan, and physical and emotional journey of Japanese (and foreigners in Japan) during and after the incident.
So so so happy you're okay, Chris. I've been zeroed in on work and had not heard about the earthquake at all so my knee jerk reaction was panic. Hope everyone in the area will be able to recover okay....so scary and upsetting.
Glad you're ok Chris, I hope you never get injured from any of these earthquakes. Earthquakes aren't very affable
I'm guessing the Combinis in Japan are like Waffle Houses in America. You know it's bad if they're closed. I'm just glad the worst natural disaster we get where I am is a big ice storm every 10-20 years.
Stay safe Chris.
Glad you are okay Chris, I hope after everything settles down you take a moment to relax and clam yourself <3
Things can be replaced, brother. Glad you guys are safe.
You need to earthquake proof the office.
Glad your safe Chris 🙏🏻❤
Glad you're ok. Not to say you shouldn't be, but I'm surprised how much you're affected by the earthquake. Thought you was the most stoic British man of all time with your reaction to the possibility of nukes from North Korea a few years a go
chris, vlog the process of getting the ramen shop back to it's glory days
Im just glad you are ok my guy things can be replaced people can't much love hope it's a speedy recovery
Glad to know you guys are ok !  Stay safe.
i got realy scared for you. im just glad you guys are all ok. thank god you where outside of your apartment.
We're all glad you're okay. ❤️
I also live in Sendai and I'm relieved that Chris is safe.  Seismological experts are warning of the possibility of more big earthquakes during the next week.  Please be vigilant and prepared.
I'm happy everyone safe, any word on where the water came from?
Good to see you are okay. Maybe you could restore some of the items to look like kintsugi styled?
Come on, peeps, let's donate stuff so we can fill up Chris' ramen shop again! :D *looks up shipping costs from Belgium* What about a nice postcard? :D
I'm so glad that you are alright Chris!💜  I'm happy to see Sharla and Natsuki ok too! It must have been a nightmare to go through that! 😣 Happy St Patrick's Day from Ireland! 🍀💚 I wish I could come help you clean up 😅
Glad you are alright,  sending love from Poland :D
Glad you and everyone are safe, but really sad for the studio. I pray and hope things will get back on track for you all. Be safe and happy.
As bad as it is with your studio, at least things can be replaced or fixed. I'm just glad you're okay 👍
Good to see everyone's OK. The fates were listening to the Ken Watanabe interview.
Buy some super glue along with the ramen shop this time! 😂
This was genuinely difficult to watch, glad you, Natsuki, Sharla, and Maro are all right. Heard reports of many people injured and without electricity over there.
Aw fuck ye mate fix the water problem first or you're gonna get bent
Stay safe, Chris!
Sorry this happened especially with the studio I hope you can get it fixed soon and good luck with the repairs
Really relieved you are all ok after this. So sorry about the newly built set but the main thing is you are safe.  Sending lots of love <3
Hugs to you.
Stay safe brother
what was that light at 0:11
Good luck in cleaning everything up, please don't cut yourself on all the little shards there. I hope you can find the little Neko figurine.
Damn. Oh. No. Too much Earthquake-o  Glad you are okay Chris. Sorry about the studio.
at least you're ok and most of the set looks fine
Glad you're safe!
glad you're safe man. stuff can be replaced. all the best from canada
Awww damn. Seeing your beloved studio like this made me sad, really touched me. For now I am super glad you, Sharla and Natsuki are safe. Breathe, everything will hopefully be fine again.
Just when we tough 2022 will be great and corona kind of event down. War ,big earthquake.Not a good start of the year. I hope you guys are alright!
He's probably already thrown it out, but I'd suggest a little kintsugi for the maneki-neko.
Sad to see the damage done but happy that you and friends are safe.
That is fucking terrifying! Glad to see you're safe though.
I’m so glad that you’re safe Chris! Thank goodness you weren’t in the studio during the earthquake! I wish you the best trying to get your studio back together! ❤️
Hoep you can get it fixed soon. Sorry to see what happened.
Holy shit that was a big one
Glad you are alright 👍 😉
glad you and yours are safe , hopefully life can be back on track  in a short while
Damn, at least you're okay and there was no tsunami. Hopefully you can get the set up and running again soon!
i feel so bad for u
And the next recommended video is 12 Reasons NOT to move to Japan...  Glad you're all safe
The first thing I thought of when I heard about the earthquake was 'Oh God I hope Chris and Sharla are ok' so I'm glad you guys are mostly unharmed. Hopefully that's the last of them and the studio gets repaired. Love from Ireland🇮🇪, your videos are awesome P.s I love the slippers
That lasted quite a while man. Jesus. So glad you are all ok. Sorry about your studio man. All material, you can recover surely, but the hest news is you are all ok.
Best wishes, Chris.
Kintsugi would fix those broken ceramics up nicely.   The pros: you get to keep your ceramics, and the fractures tell the story of past experiences, outlined in gold.  The cons: it's rather expensive.
Im glad youre okay and a lot of your studio is salvagable chris!! ;-;
Glad you're safe bro... This one felt quite big, i was pissing myself a bit when it happened (almost ran out the apartment which would have been a bad idea lol)... sorry about your Maneki-neko
I watched your entire journey on making this dream of yours come true, so I felt really sad as well seeing its state right now. But I'm glad your safe Chris!
Glad you guys are doing well. Hopefully the water did not damage any electronics.
Stay safe Chris ❤️
I’m so sorry but happy everyone is safe.
seems you came through the quake quite well. Too bad about the cat and bar, but here's your chance to redecorate.  rough times, but overall you came out unscathed. Good luck with getting back on your feet.
👍
Jesus christ Chris. Knowing what that studio meant to you and everything, seeing this fucks me up a bit. Can't imagine how you truly feel about everything. Glad you are good tho and weren't there during that.All I can say is that we are still here yo! Good luck on everything 👍
Glad to hear that you're safe, Chris! It really sucks to see the damage done to the studio, but I'm sure that it most definitely will be looking as good as new once again over time. 🙏
Just glad you, your friends and the crew are fine !Yall can bounce back from this for sure :) Been a fan for years now and your channel keeps me sane being stuck at home in The Philippines during this whole pandemic. Cheers !
I only experience a quick small earthquakes.. but watching earthquake videos in japan looks really terrifying. stay safe to all people in japan. 🙏
Glad you're safe, Chris.
Please take care of yourselves guys.
So relieved you guys are safe — the footage was quite shocking, must've been nightmarish...  I wish you all a proper recovery from this traumatic event ✨
It's shit seeing this as a lover of your content, and I can't imagine how you feel, seeing your dream project ruined. But I'm glad you are ok and have your friends to help you through this. I'm sure this would be a lot worse without Natsuki cracking jokes and Sharla helping with the clean up. Hope all you guys are doing ok, and hope things get better.
I am SO GLAD it’s not worse! Your glass display cases stayed up, the neon sign, things like that… seem to be intact! But most of all I’m glad YOU are intact!
I want to cry
Wow glad to see you are safe. Did not expect the earthquake to be that strong
In the back of Japanese people's minds is there the question of "is there a big one on the horizon?" or is it just going on and if it happens, it happens?
All things considered the damage isn't as bad as it could have been. It still really sucks though, and having to replace everything that did break is the worst part. I hope you bounce back quickly and I'm glad you're okay!
I can't imagine how terrifying earthquakes can be. I'm glad you and your friends are safe. The studio can always be rebuilt.
Hopefully the water leak doesn’t require the set to be dismantled to fix, but otherwise it still looks great. Now it’s for some real wear and tear for authenticity!
Glad you three are alright. And maybe you can get the porcelain kitty fixed up again, scars add character after all.
I'm very sorry Chris for the studio🥺🥺but am really glad you're okay.. Praying and hoping for ur life n studio
should have a latch that locks the moveable walls to the main wall or floor when not in use.
Oh Chris, I'm so sorry ;_; I really hope the rest of the studio will be ok.
I'm glad that all of you are safe!. I can't even imagine how terrifying was it D:
hey, ur fine, ur friends are fine, the studio is... fine as well tbh, your fine mate, it builds character :P
So sorry Chris 😔Glad everyone's okay
So glad you and the gang are safe and doing okay, Chris! So scary. I hope the local folks are doin' okay too. Hope you're able to get the damage tidied up without too much hassle. The water situation would have me overwhelmed and crying instantly. Maybe you can do some pseudo-kintsugi for the little kitty statue that broke! Brave little kitty did his best for ya!
At the end of the day it’s stuff which I know is hard to hear but you guys are ok.
WOW with Ukraine stuff didn't even hear about it! Glad your OK!
I'm really glad you're alright Chris. Anime may have been my gateway to Japanese culture but your videos are what made me want to fly to Japan more and more!
I am so sorry Chris about the studio but I’m mostly glad everyone is okay.
It's important that all you guys are ok. Horrible what happened to the studio but you will make it even better than before. Stay safe 🙏
Good you and the others were not heart.
Glad to see youre alright. Hope the studio makes a speedy recovery. Cheers from Wisco
Man this must really suck, the result of your hard work ruined in a small instant.
You’re okay man, that is what matters most. The studio can be rebuilt, and as long as your cheekiness and fun attitude is still around, I will keep watching. Thoughts and prayers are with you and everyone else affected.
Chris you are an inspiration for my future plans to live in Japan. I will say I am glad you are safe. Who would have thought that my first trip to Japan would involve one of Japans worst earthquakes to date. I’m currently in Sasebo so I could sleep through any effects lol but still terrifying to think that if I where to leave Japan a little earlier when I planned to I could have experience something so terrifying. Stay safe!
Really happy you're alright, those videos were terrifying and a panic attack is appropriate!  The damage of the studio saddens me given the heart and soul put into it, and hopefully the water issue isn't severe,  ut your safety is what matters most. I know YouTube isn't great for quick updates but for those of us who don't have/want Twitter, please give at least one update here :) Hope you're able to return to your normal filming soon!
Sad to see :( but happy that you all are fine.
Good to see you and Sharla and Natski are safe 👍
QUICK Eat all the sweets before they go bad! :D
0:10 dude thats not an earthquake....... thats the colosal titan...
Don't you need to wait for the insurrance agent to walk through it/see it before you start to clean up? At least where I am from, to claim money from the insurrance or any kind of reimburance, the damage needs to be assesed by an insurrance agent or technician first. And only after that you can start the cleaning/throwing things out/reconstructing.
I love that even Natsuki was shocked and sad upon first sight and only started making jokes once he realized the structure was safe
I am so glad everyone is ok. Things can get replaced you can't. So I am so happy you are ok. I hope you can find everything that got broken and replace that. I can't imagine what your going through I have never been in an earthquake.
Man - good thing you all are safe! Also that the studio didn't suffer too much - pretty much brand new and already has a major earthquake under its belt.
Good to see you healthy
You've got an illness with superlatives and clickbait. BIGGEST, WORST, MOST EXPENSIVE, FIRST!!! It's sick
So sorry about the studio, but glad everyone is OK!
Don't throw away the maneki neko! Mend it with kintsugi, the gold glue! Maybe you guys can fix all the broken stuff together💛 Especially the non food items are easy to do because you can just skip the traditional technique and use a gold sharpie💛
Chris is safe and build the studio stronger then ever before
I'm 30 years and I never experience an earthquake. I wish to travel in japan for a month octomber-november and I will probably panic so bed if i experience one. Il probaly have a protection helmet with me all the time
I'm so glad your ok!! That sucks that the studio got damaged, but it's just stuff. At least you and natsuki and everyone else is ok!
Stay Safe Chris I hope you and many others in Japan get through this together
Glad you're all safe. Even though the studio can rebuilt, it's still saddening to see, after all the work you and the crew put into it. Stay affable, dude. ❤ And if they have them there in Japan, a good wet/dry vaccuum would work wonders for the water cleanup.
God himself was himself was jealous of Chris’s kickass studio
wow I don't even have the words! I mean as long as y'all are okay that's the important part.
Damn
glad your all safe and sound, good luck rebuilding x
So sorry this happened Chris, I hope you can get the studio back up again. But most of all glad you guys are safe.
Good to hear that atleast you guys are OK. Sorry to hear about your studio.  Kind regards from norway 🇳🇴.
I’m glad you are okay that’s all it matters
the most important thing is that you are well chris, everything else will come into place.
You could say that maneki neko was guarding and protecting that studio that day. It did its best and it will be missed.
This is really a surprised for everyone. But hope you lads out there are all safe.
You could glue the neko cat back together and go over the cracks with a gold. Kintsugi
Actually, the water makes it look more cyberpunk
On the plus side, the retro back alley has a proper rainy asthetic.
So glad you're okay Chris (and Sharla and Natsuki ofc)! Remember, material things like the studio and the things in it sucks royal balls to lose but are in the end replaceable and ultimately unimportant to your happiness. Stay safe. :)
Take care man!
Omg Chris that is so scary! I’m glad you are ok ❤️🙏🏻
surprised that mirror at 1:32 is still standing!
Health always has priority,  anything else can be bought and replaced with time..  I'm glad that nothing happened to you guys!  I hope that nothing happened to anybody in Japan and everyone is safe!
:(
noooo not the beautiful, brand new set :/
Wow, that's insane. You can't do anything but stand there and look.
Too much earthquake
Shoulda, coulda, woulda situation I'm sorry man that's got to be a shitty experience...
Keep the broken neko once you get your studio and home back together.  Good to see Natsuki is with you.  Best wishes Chris.
too much earthquakeo
Too bad about your studio, but I'm glad you are alright.
All that matters is that you're safe man, I'm really happy you're not hurt. I feel for the people who lost their homes because of it, my best wishes goes out to them.
Glad to see the damage is relatively minor and you and the staff are safe!
I'm so glad you're all OK and safe - I can't imagine how scary it was to feel the tremours. I've only ever felt one once and that was over here in England in the early 1990s, was over almost as soon as it started and I thought it was a big lorry going past (it woke me up from a sleep). Do you think it might be a plan to have a mop and bucket in to be on the, not really "safe" side, but just in case you need to clean up any more big water spills? So sorry about everything that got broken and your maneki-neko. Have you got a page that people can donate money to you in the short term that's separate from your Patreon?
Sorry to see so much broken but happy to see you weren't hurt. It's okay to be shaken up after something like that. Don't be ashamed to feel those feelings and talk about them. I hope all your friends and colleagues are okay too.
This is pretty heartbreaking to watch knowing how much effort went into making the studio. But I’m glad you are ok and with you the best for rebuilding it.
The damages are hard on the heart but glad that you're okay, Chris. Glad to see the others are safe too. Where would we be without Natsuki's broken English haha
I was 14 at the 1999 eurthquake in turkey. Which was also ~7.6 magnitude. around 30k people died at that time. I was never afraid like that ever again since that point in time. There is something about the very earth you are standing on turning hostile. There is literally no place to run because you cant fly. The hopelessness and control-lost at that moment is unique. Its all luck either the building is secure or not. And since you do not and cannot know that the very uncertainity of your life and death makes you quite panicked. not scared, panicked. some people were jumping from 5th floor window just like the people in 9/11.
Ich hoffe, du bist in Ordnung.
Praying for all in Japan. 💞🙏
Glad to see you (and the crew) are safe!
I dont get sad that easily but this video really hit me. I hope you guys are safe and sound, wish you all the best chris! If i make it to japan anytime soon id be more than happy to help you rebuild the set. Stay strong!
Kitty :(
Sorry this happened mate :( you're a hard working dude and it sucks to see this :(
I’m happy that you are safe my man, and hopefully everyone else
Happy to see you and friends safe <3  Also very sad that the studio got wrecked right after you had it completed :( let me know if there's anything we can do to help.
I’m grad you ok
Maybe you can keep some of the broken stuff around as an earthquake display? 100% glad you and your friends weren't there and I hope you and they are all OK.
Everyone is safe and alright and the studio is mostly intact - sounds like the lucky cat did its job! Display it proudly in the new shop, I say
Glad your ok Chris. Things can always be replaced. People cannot.
Sorry Chris. Hope your safe
oh man so sad to see it like this but as everyone will say you’re safe and that’s what’s important
I cried once I saw the manekineko! 😭 it suddenly looks so mellow..😭 I'm happy you guys are alright. Sending much love 💙
Glad you guys are safe Chris!!
Sorry you had to go through it, mate.
I really hope Japanese insurance covers earthquake damage like this for you. Glad you three are all safe!
Holy cow that's so scary. Glad you guys are okay physically, hope you're okay mentally/emotionally as well.
Worst one i've ever lived through was the 1994 Northridge earthquake and that was only a 6.7 and ruined a lot of homes.  Glad you are safe.
Glad you are alright. Unfortunate about the gorgeous studio.
As long as your healthy ❤❤👍🏼
Hopefully the monetization of this vid will pay for some of the repairs :(
If you have access to floor box fans or commercial floor blower fan, it will save you in long run to dry up water around the studio and partitions that you can't mop up. Glad everyone was safe.
I'm so glad you guys are safe!!! It's sad that the ramen studio that you love so much took a hit Chris. I do hope you can get it back in a way that you are going to love it just as much as before or even more than before! Hope everything goes wells, take care Chris!
THE CAT! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
💔
Glad you brought Natsuki that glorious man has the ability to lighten the mood boosters matter how bad it may be.
Glad you're alright buddy. Terrifying event...
Holy crap... I know it could have been so much worse, but I'm sorry you had to experience it first hand. Glad to know you're ok. The ramen shop will be up and running in no time! You've got this!
Glad you're safe! You could try to repair some of your favorite ceramic pieces in a way similar to kintsugi.
You are alive and well. That's all that matters, everything else is replacable :D
Glad you guys are all safe, shame about the damage but as long as everyone is safe you can work towards fixing that. People are less easy to repair. Hope you continue to be safe and that there arent any more for a while!
big F man :<
" _That was not wood_ "
Oh wow, horrifying pictures of the aftermath. Glad to hear you're safe though!
Commiserations on the damage but glad you are all safe!
Glad you’re okay Chris, keep up with the good spirits, I know how hard you’ve worked on this studio hope you can rebuild it as you wish this time again, stay safe 💟
So sorry. All the best for you.
don't have to buy everything dude, embrace the brokeness and fix them. That's "wabi sabi"
I am just glad you guys are safe!
Hope you and everyone in Japan are safe!
Glad the damage to the set was minimal and glad you and yours are safe and sound! <3
Another disaster to add to the list
We're glad you're safe Chris. We all pray for not only your safety but everyone who had been affected by the earthquake, and we wish that another large earthquake like that wouldn't happen again.
I'm so sorry about your studio, Chris. I know it was a really expensive set and you may never get it quite right the way it used to be. And it was such an awesome set. I wish I were in a position where I could help out. At least you're still alive and well. I wish you the best.
We get plenty of quakes in Greece, its not only the main quake that is a huge suck but the ferocity of the after shocks that can last for weeks and can be as strong as the first one. Always be safe first. Here in Athens we also a wait for the next big one after the level 6 we had in 2000 and made my bed slide on the floor with me on it and wall turning into gel. Was QUITE the experience. I will never forget the noise, like earth itself was growling. Terrifying yet magnificent experience reminding us how small and insignificant we all are .
Wow, this must have been groundbreaking
Now you could reframe your studio from retro 80s to a post apocalyptic studio. (Just thinking outside the box) It was a surprisingly long duration for an earthquake. Keep us posted and take care mate!
Do u have insurance?
stay safe everyone.
I started reacting to the smallest shaking after I was in an earthquake once, much lower magnitude than what you experienced.  Absolutely terrifying, glad you are ok, consider talking to someone if you get any post-traumatic issues. <3
Chris I am so glad you're OK.  I'm so so sorry that your studio got thrashed. You were the one who influence me to start building a studio in my basement for my own channel, so I know the amount of effort, thought, work, sweat and money that goes into it - and mine is gonna be 1/50th of yours. Thank you so much for posting this video and for continuing to do all that you do. You bring so much joy and amazingness to everyone who watches you, and coming from some one who has been watching your videos for like 7 years now and only written like 2 comments, thank you for everything you do!
Hang in there.
Most importantly you are ok. items can be replaced - although it does stink. thank you for sharing. i would have been super scared.
I'm very sorry for all this mess. But very glad you three were safe. Ask Aki about earthquake proofing the space. Very best wishes.
I have been so worried about you all since yesterday. I’m so glad you’re okay, and so grateful you three checked in with us. I was worried sick.  I was over the epicenter for Northridge quake, (which is in Reseda,lol).  I was thrown at my ceiling. It was so over the top, I was awestruck, and weirdly silent because it was so loud my hearing cut out for a few seconds.  I bet your set designers did secure things well, a quake that big will shake things apart.   I know it’s scary.  But bravery and courage aren’t about not feeling scared, but about feeling scared and doing what you need to anyway. I think you’re all very brave.  You all should let us know if you need any help, resources or funds.   And dammit, I’m an old lady with a heart….thingy, keep checking in please.
Glad you're alive and well, if a little shook up. That Manekineko that you love might best be repaired using the Japanese Kintsugi / Golden Joinery method as it's emotional value will then only increase. And doing something small and delicate might be some sort of antidote for the load of cleaning up you have to do. Either that or buy another one. Keep safe.
My hometown went threw a 7.1 earthquake, I know the feeling of shock and worriedness. Glad you are ok chris stay strong 💪
Glad to see your okay sucks about the studio hopefully everything can be fixed just glad to see your all safe out there!
Chris why don’t you glue it back together with that traditional Japanese way with the gold paint?
Aww, Chriiiiiis :(
I remember thinking that all of the swag around the set was gonna come tumbling down in the next earthquake. Guess I should have said something.  Glad you weren't under it, at least.
I’m glad you guys are alright and it’s great you have each other.
その割には平気そうだ。。hmmm so british people act happy and positive when they're upset? and act unhappy and pessimistic when they're happy? guy walks around his destroyed new set all calm and positive... yet when he's chillin in all his acquired success and material goods, with good friends, he acts all pissy  on a serious note tho:  I'm glad Natsuki is ok
Maneki-Neko looks really salvageable though! Assuming you found the missing piece and put it back together all Kintsugi-style. It'd make it way more memorable and charming! Or if you already tossed/didn't find the missing piece, I bet there's an artist (Or many few haha) in Japan that would know how to reform back its missing part with some form of sculpey clay. Or whatever is the best type they use in Japan- japan's home to some of the BEST clays out there what with their huge anime figure production line. I know sometimes you can find those hobby model making craft stores- maybe one in your area will have some people who will be helpful? As an artist myself just looking at it I see so much potential haha! Much concern for your dear Maneki-Neko-chan
Holy crap! Glad you are safe!
Keep safe Chris!
Living in California, watching the first part of the video makes me nervous, since we are way less prepared for an earthquake than Japan is
2 years ago I experienced my very first earthquake, ever. It was a 5.6, so not nearly as intense as what you just experienced, but I felt that same "on edge" feeling you described for weeks. I am so glad you and the whole gang are safe. Good luck with the studio❤️
whats important is that you sharma and natsuke made it...most of the studio made it cool...
I don't know why, but seeing chris crack some jokes after going through all this is kinda wholesome
The only thing I have experienced is minor flooding and that can be scary and gut wretching. So I can't imagine an earthquake or other natural disaster that can't be controlled at all. Glad to hear you and company are safe and in good spirits, despite the damages of your amazing studio. I know a lot of hard work and time went into it.
Stupid earthquake!!!!
geez bloody earthquakes are terrifying
I'm sorry for the damage, Chris. Glad that you and everyone are safe.
yo chris it was seeing the tears in ur eyes, so sorry man. Hope you will recover asap from this trauma!
While I'm heartbroken to see the damage left behind, I'm so grateful that you and everyone else are safe. Just know that we're all here if you need us! The least I can do for now is watch your videos so you can gain the revenue for repairs. 🧡
Hey I`m glad you`re safe and well! These disasters must be terrible and I hope you can get things to normal again soon! thanks for the great content!
Wherever CDAWGVA goes he bring Chaos and destruction 😸
Glad u guys are safe.. take care and stay strong.. come back stronger!
Nice to see you and your friends working to help each other out.
Glade to see your studio was at least somewhat intact, and most of all you cam out of this safely. Don't let this get you down, i know the stuff you lost means a lot, but the memories will carry on in there place.
It's really good to see the three of you are all okay tho!  That's the important thing (as far as I'm concerned).
First off,I am glad you,Natsuki,Sharla,and the team are safe. I hope you guys can rebuild and restore.  Remember the Japanese spirit of "gaman" or the British equivalent of stiff upper lip.   I hope the Abroad in Japan studio comes back stronger than ever.
Sorry about all your stuff, I'm glad you guys are ok.
Stay safe Chris. Feel bad for the mess at the studio but it could make a great scene for a post apocalyptic japan mini movie.
Glad you’re ok!
Aside from water leak, looks like the basic foundation of the studio is still intact. Hopefully that Chris can get the studio in working conditions again  More importantly, Thank goodness Chris, Sharla, and Natsuki are safe.
I'm really glad you guys are okay.
Wut Whun Did I Crossed Dimension Or Something    This Is Tooo Surreal For Me but Glad Your Okay I Still Don't Feel Like This Is Real or Am I dreaming
The important thing is that you guys are safe.
With everything going on in the world right now, why this too.  Glad everybody's okay, and I hope you can get things back up and running with as little difficulty as possible. Take care Chris.
A. S. O. Too much earthquake-O!
Oh nooooooo! Not Chris' Ramen Shop!  On a serious note, I'm glad you're all safe there. I see you with Sharla and Natsuki so that's a relief. I'll give you something unique from the Philippines that you can add as a decor in your ramen shop (hope they lift the ban on tourist soon).
This is heartbreaking to see after all the time and effort you put into the studio. I'm gutted for you mate, genuinely gutted.
Glad too see there was no structural damage to the studio, it could have been a lot worse.
didn't manage to record the earthquake inside my apartment because the lights went out immediately. 1st time I experience of a power outage during earthquake late at night. scary shit.
Glad to hear you're okay Chris!
I'm glad you and everyone are okay!
Extremely sorry for your studio man
Meanwhile Connor on a Karaoke room during the earthquake: "Fridaaay , Fridaayyyy!" 🎤🎵
Growing up in Southern California, I'm very use to earthquakes. A 7.3 is a different story though. That's enough to scare you even if you're use to earthquakes. It's such a surreal feeling. Glad you're all safe.
crap I hope everything is ok soon. be safe always chris!
Dang. Terrible to see. I’m glad to see everyone is ok. Hope the studio gets repaired soon. Cheers
Thank God you and your friends are safe material things can always be fixed. Hope you guys get back to normalcy real quick look forward to more of your videos
Thank god that you are all okay
I'm so glad you, Natsuki and Sharla are all okay through it. Love you all. I'm sorry it was so traumatizing and messed up your studio.
Hope that everything gets sort out real quick  Stay safe man ❤️
Just imagine bringing your girl the most intense orgasm because, not only the bed, but the whole house is vibrating..
You should save the maneki neko pieces and have it repaired using kintsugi!
I live in California so I have experienced some bad earthquakes they are terrifying. Glad you are ok man. Sorry about the studio, that is rough...
Sending love to you all!
Glad you are okey. If you find the remaining pieces of the cat you can put it together kintsugi-style
Glad you're ok
I just hope all your friends/coworkers are all safe is damage helped by insurance?
-hug-
Not as bad as I was expecting but must still suck to have all that loss and extra work. You have my best wishes xx
I like your boo slippers chris if that helps :c
Glad you're okay. Maybe now would be the perfect time to pick up Kintsugi as a hobby?
Chris- try something called “museum putty” if you don’t want to commit to gluing items on shelves. You just twist and lift to detach, not gooey or messy. Easily removable
Its great to see that you're safe regardless, and that the anxiety of the situation hasn't eaten you alive. The studio will be back in no time, you got this!
Very unpleasant earthquake.
That wasn't an earthquake, it was just ur mom coming to town.
I agree with you on the water leak! That seems like it might be a structure issue. Hope it gets fixed soon! Like many others I'm super relieved to see so many known faces being okay in spite of the big scare.  Poor ceramics, though! It was so pretty!
Glad you are safe Chris, and good thing you were not there
wow scary
Main thing is you and everyone else In The “team” are ok! A bit of authentic damage will make the ramen shop look even more like the one from blade runner!
Damn Chris, I’m so sorry about the studio! You worked so hard to put it together. I hope the clean up goes well and it comes back better than ever! I’m glad you’re ok. Best of luck!
This made me sad, but im glad you are all alright. ❤
Wow.
I'm so thankful you, Sharla and Natsuki are safe. I hope you can get your studio back into shape quickly. Stay safe Chris!
Sobering what the damage is given that this quake was in a depth of 60km. In comparison, the Tohoku quake was at 32km (and of course many times stronger to boot).
Glad you are ok, RIP to the deceased
glad youre okay dude
I'm ashamed to admit that when I saw on the news that Sendai got hit by an earthquake, my first thought was "Oh no, my boi Chris!" 🙈
Glad you're safe! I know it might be hard but theirs that repair air you could use that uses gold. I know maybe not for everything but maybe that cat could be fixed and made even better
Glad to see you safe and sound! Sad to see the studio damaged so soon after you finished building it but at least nobody got hurt!
Japan picked a perfect time to display things like this when I'm moving there next month....
Yes, I was thinking what happened with Chris' new Neo-Tokyo Ramen shop when I heard the news. Such a mess. RIP Manekoneko.  Good thing you're all safe.
I know it is a major bummer that your beautiful studio is now in disrepair. While it is unfortunate and definitely something that sucks, I am glad you and all of your frequent guests on the channel are safe. Those things in the studio will be replaced, you and all of the people you bring on the show are not. Glad you are still around to keep making such great content and we are all here to support you into a revamped studio. :-)
What was the glowing thing that hit the ground? Lightning?
Glad to see you are all safe and sound! As for the studio, sucks what happened and hopefully you can get it set up again soon. We are all just glad you are ok 👍🏼 stay safe!!
So glad you all are okay.
Nice that you guys are ok
Japan seems like a place you need to VHB tape anything that moves.
So glad you guys are ok
Oh man... I can't imagine the terror in the slightest, I'm 30 and from Germany and never ever had I experienced an earthquake and I thought it would might be interesting. Now I know it's truly not what I ever want to experience. Not for me, not for anyone else. Stay safe brother! ❤️
Even though seeing the studio furnishings in bits is painful I am very grateful you are alright.
take care man. today my turtle died, i can understand the sadness of losing something u like and work hard for gone. hope the worst is over and stay safe.
Kintsugi! 🙌
*water sound*
nooooooooooooo
I’m so glad you are OK!
Lot of Love Chris, you can sort this out in no time!
Use WoodGlue on ceramics and repair the cat
Oh fuck sums it up perfectly :(
That looks really rough. I'm glad you are not hurt. Stay safe!
this looks absolutely devastating, and i‘m really sorry for you all the other people that got things destroyed. that set didn’t stay undamaged for as long as you hoped i think, that’s pretty sad. but maybe you can ask your best friend ken watanabe for help, he seems to have a thing for helping people ;) but anyway, i hope you get everything in order soon.
Glad youre doing well, wish you and your studio a quick recovery
Just glad everyone is ok.  As painful as it is, stuff can be replaced over time.
Damn bro those desks be slippin n sliddn n shyt
love you man, i’m sending prayers towards japan! 気を付けてね
Just glad to see that you are all fine!
get LOTS of mops or a Shop Vac
Glad you're ok Chris, what a bummer about the set tho
Glad to know that you're safe Chris Praying for you and your friends
Stay safe Chris and others involved with Abroad in japan. Any chance of claiming from your insurance for the repairs and contents damage?
I don't know anyone on these channels personally but in a way I feel I do. So I'm glad to know that everyone is ok and things could have been worse considering other pictures I saw from yesterday's earthquake. Just hope they will have fried chicken for you you get soon.  :)
Important thing is you're fine, I hope you can fix up your studio, I know it means a lot to you, and even us the viewers ❤️❤️
A perfect opportunity to film a fake bar fight scene in your ramen shop!
❤❤❤
Not Earthquake but KAIJU'SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, Pacific Rim incoming
Earthquake: Messes up Chris' stuff.  Chris: Fool, I'll have my revenge by turning you into content!
At least now your street setup is now complete with authentic water leaks.  Seriously though, glad you're ok.
Hope the damage wasn't severe.
As someone who experienced the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, I'm glad you're okay and are staying positive! It can be hard with earthquakes because you never know when it's going to hit next, but there's nothing we can do for now. Wish you the best, and be careful around windows during strong earthquakes! 💜
sorry you had to go through that!
I am glad that you and everyone are safe! It hurts to see the studio like that... all the hard work you put into it just destroyed in seconds. Hopefully everything goes well in the future!!
That is scary !
Glad that you are ok! To bad about the ramen shop set.
5:23 wow that even more disturbing . I would have run away
So glad your ok buddy, it must of been terrifying
I am so glad you all are okay! Don't throw it out, why not use Kintsugi?
terrifying!
Oh thank goodness Natsuki is ok
Glad you are ok Chris. Real shame about your studio being smashed up :( On the plus side, at least the bowls of ramen somehow survived on the counter! 😁
AAA! Not the Lucky Neko!!! Too far gone to fix?
Oh no, Chris! So sorry that happened. I’m glad you are okay though.  Hope everyone there is okay as well!
Glad your all right. I use to live in Japan and know of earthquakes years ago.  I don't like them.  Loved the set.
I’m really glad your safe chris hope you’re able to rebuild the studio
I'm glad you and everyone are safe Chris!  Also...Natsuki, why didn't you just get a mop and bucket??? 🤣🤣🤣
Glad all of you are alright!
Thanks Chris. That studio has gone through alot, But not more than you :D.
This makes me so sad, but I'm glad you're all ok.. 💙
Chris when I saw this my heart literally sank, like I felt it sink.  I'm so sorry about your studio, dude. Absolutely glad you are okay of course.
Aw Chris I'm gutted for you and the damage to the studio. The amount of broken pottery has me wondering about kintsugi and whether it is historically stemmed from the geo-cultural conditions of earthquakes? Hopefully, after some repairs, you manage to salvage a lot of the studio!
The footage is just insane, like if I saw that in a movie I'd think "well someone went a bit overkill with the earthquake special effects".  As everyone has said, I'm glad you weren't in the studio at the time. And I have faith you can rebuild it and use insights from this to make it more earthquake proof for the future.  Definitely kintsugi the manakineko, that would be beautiful.
Glad you are safe
As sad as it is to have so many things break, they are but things and can be replaced. You guys being safe and healthy is all that matters! I can't image what it must have been like, scary stuff!  On the bright side, some of the items probably take on an added charm with a crack or two in them. You might even give the studio an even grungier edge if you keep one or two of the broken things on display!
As others have said here, it's better the studio being broken than you! But the shock must be terrible. That said, how about fixing the maneki neko with kintsugi? That could be something nice for a future video.
Really glad that you are all safe!!
So glad you're all safe! How terrifying. Japan always seems to be right at the precipice of the realm of the gods' fury.
Glad you and the gang are safe Chris :)
so glad you and everyone is ok...... doesnt Japan make insurance to cover things in case of disasters?
"Liking" this kind of videos always feels strange. i hope you see it as an expression of support :)
I agree...glad that all of you are OK. I saw from the BBC😲. Good luck to get it all back to how it was.
I'm glad you guys are ok. I was very worried about the people affected.
0:09 ok but what was that flash ?  Was it an earthquake or a bomb ?
I was stationed at Presidio of Monterey for training in 1989 when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit (I looked up the actual name. Pretty sure we just called it the San Francisco earthquake on post back then). Even well away from the epicenter and out in a field (where we were suddenly dancing without our consent) it was scary. Stay safe!
So glad you are all ok! if you have the pieces you could have your maneki neko fixed using kitsugi. <3
A shame what’s happened to your studio :( Hope everyone and everything else is going fine. Wish you all in the best!
Biggest quake I experienced in Japan was an M5, that was scary enough.  7.4 looks fucking terrifying, good to see you're OK and the damage to studio seems superficial only.
I hope you are ok!
FUCK, man! That looked terrifying as fuck! I'm so relieved that you are all ok, and my heart goes out to those less fortunate.
Its a shame to what happened to your studio, still it's good to know you are safe.
As long as you and your friends are okay thats the most important, your fans aren't going anywhere even though the studio has seen better days we are still here to support you!
feel so bad for you Chris, i know how excited you were for your ramen shop studio.  Thanks for the update I was able to message my friends in Japan in time from UK. They are all ok, glad you are too.
Sorry to see the studio like that but I’m glad you and your friends are safe.
never give up bro!we luv u
I’m so sorry about the kitty, as a sentimental person, I know objects can mean a whole lot to your heart
Uwaa scary. I'm glad Sharla and Natsuki came with you. Things are less scary with friends. Stay safe all of you!
Happy you are safe man .
1:17 looks like a movie scenario where you try to escape but the door's blocked.
Glad you are all ok over there, I hope you all have a quick recovery and that the water situation isn't really bad
I'm glad ur okay! Sorry for the studio... great time to start practising Kintsugi
How scary! So grateful that you all are okay! Hoping the water isn't sewage and is easily cleaned! 🤢
I’m so sorry about the studio. Hopefully everything can be repaired and replaced. I couldn’t know how much effort and work went into making it. Best of wishes!
Im thankful you weren't in the studio durring the earthquake and you were safe the studio stuff can be replaced but your irreplaceable. Please be safe
The only major earthquake I've experienced was the 7.1 that happened during Anime Expo 2019. I was doing a photoshoot on the 32nd floor of a hotel and by god its an awful experience. It's truly horrifying to be swaying in a small room knowing there's nothing you can do. The worst part was that the first earthquake was a 4.0 and it was the aftershock that was much more powerful. really makes you stay on edge for days. I am so happy you and everyone else seem to be safe, and I hope the studio electronics are an easy/inexpensive fix.
Sorry there was so much damage. I hope u get things back up and running soon. Good luck guys.
Glad most of the studio is still intact, minus some plates and the poor neko! And glad you stayed safe through it all!
Man, you were so psyched with your new studio =/ good luck rebuilding it all man, maybe you will make it into something fun with your community. All the best!
Oh man the shaking is insane
Glad you’re safe Chris! It’s a shame about the studio but hopefully it’s salvageable
Oh, that sucks. But I'm glad that you're ok, + you have your friends help. Take care!
I'm glad you are all ok. I know it doesn't feel like it at the minute because of all the work you put into the studio. But it can all be replaced and fixed. keep your chin up cocker all the best from leeds.
What a sin. So sad for your set but at least you are safe. A few dishes came be replaced, you can’t.
Stay strong Chris Sharla Natsuke.
Things can be replaced, people can't. Just glad you are all ok.
Yikes! I live in San Francisco, CA and have been through that kind of earthquake..it's terrifying!
Firstly I’n glad everyone’s okay and that the majority of the set is fine. It’s quite unfortunate though. Hope you the best Chris.
I'm sorry for you Chris, but you kept the most imortant thing which is health and safety
Really sorry to hear about the studio. Hopefully most of it can still be salvaged. It already had a bit of a back alley feel to it, but that doesn't mean it needs dripping water, honestly. Glad to see the three of you are unscathed and let's hope it takes a long time before the next big one.
Glad you're okay Chris, hopefully the studio can be restored
It always happens in March. 😭😭😭
So god didn't like the Ken W doc?  God can bugger off!
Thank god you're okay. I'm sorry to see that happen to your studio. Hoping everything gets sorted out quickly and easily.
Glad you are okay. It must be a terrifying experience! A while back YouTube recommend your channel and I asked myself why they would suggest a channel in Japan to a person living in the Caribbean. Now I realize you living in the same town as Yuzu I guess that's where the connection comes from. Stay safe greetings from Tobago
Ooh, a 7.4 is quite the shaker!
I'm glad all three of you are OK. I can't imagine how terrifying that was and it's always amazing to see how good the response from the Japanese public works system is. It really sucks this happened so quickly after you go the studio built but it is nice to see it mostly appears to be cosmetic damage and replaceables that won't be too bad monetarily.
Glad you three are alright but it's definitely sad to see the studio in shambles like that. I've been through a house fire so I can somewhat relate so I hope insurance helps out (not sure how it goes in Japan) and that you can get things back to normal as soon as possible.
Omggg chrisss i'm so glad your okay!!!!
Great to see everyone isok. Stay safe guys👍
japan as a super infrastructure any other country would be destroyed... good luck with the studio
I’m so sorry about this. Hope everything turns out alright
Glad that you're ok. Sorry to hear about the studio I know how much it means to you. Just remember things can be replaced lives cannot.
Glad you're ok, stay safe
Courage Chris!!! We send you love and good energy!! Be safe!!
Just a suggestion here. Go watch thetokyofoodie story about her auto-lock cabinet where in the case of earthquake, the cabinet shut it self automatically and prevent stuff in there from falling violently. Maybe you can invest on those cabinets.
Glad you're safe man Sucks about the interior but that's replaceable 🙏
I'm glad that you and Natsuki and Sharla are all okay.  Seeing the damage in the studio is heartbreaking though.  I hope you are able to rebuild/redecorate without too much difficulty and that the water leak gets fixed soon.
Aw damn....;-; thst fucking sucks man😭😭😭 i wish you all the luck in restoring your studio💔 im glad you guys are okay💜💜💜💜ive been watching your channel for a few years❤
I feel you man. I felt that "I'm going to die now" in 2017 earthquake in Mexico. I couldnt sleep after that, thinking all the time apartment will go down on me... Finally I moved to a small house outside of Mexico City. Much luck, sorry you have to go through this... Much love from Mexico mate!
結構くるよな…。精神的にも
What was that at 0:10? Looks like something fell from the sky 😳
Glad you're safe mate.
whenever there's an earthquake in japan i always have to go check up on all my favorite hentai artists on twitter
You have probably thought about taking all precautions to prepare for the aftershocks, but in addition to securing all items around the studio remember to check the lights, wiring, everything electrical.
Japan is sinking
Is it worth it to risk your life to live in such a disaster prone part of the world? I'd ask aki how to earthquake proof your loose items, she bought a bunch of wedges to stick under shelves, some double sided thick gell tape to stick down figures, she bought those plastic shelf footings that go on top of shelves that secure snug to the ceiling to keep large furniture from topling over during earthquakes. Just food for thought to protect your investment in such a natural disaster prone part of the world. You may live in peace for now, but it only takes one bad disaster to put your life in real jeopardy.
I'm relieved that you're okay out there Chris, I wish you get the studio fixed... I really love the studio but it's a shame this has to happen... stay safe Chris!
First of all, glad you and everyone are okay. Sorry that the studio didn't hold up as well as you'd hoped. It sucks seeing that, and I hope you can get that resolved with as little annoyance as possible.
first off-im happy you are okey mate, thats the most impotent thing,  second off-NOOOOOOOOOO so sad your studio got shocked so short after   it was built, :(
That cat is fine! Dont you dare throw it away!
Jeez. This isn't even on CNN yet. I hope no one is hurt. I had to keep checking the date to make sure we are actually talking about right now.
good luck repairs
When nature decides to throw a tantrum, gosh tho really appreciate you filming this, must be really hard for you to see but it’s encouraging that your trying to put a positive spin on it. Hope your able to recover some things. I think you could use some of the broken bowls to try out that Japanese art of Kintsugi (glueing gold in the cracks to repair it)
Glad everything is okay. You are probably going to feel aftershocks for a few months. Earthquakes are weird and truly frightening
Glad you guys are safe and not injure
Good opportunity for a Kintsugi video for your cat thing. Silver linings and all that.  Stay safe mate
All the best Chris. I got emotional as a viewer so I can hardly imagine how you feel.
Meanwhile in the UK, it's a bit blustery.  I hope you and the Gang are all ok, possessions can be replaced, people cannot.
As a people that live in earthquake-ly place, the most terrifying this is not the earthquake itself. I can just shrug it of and continue the chore (or sleep)  No, it's tsunami. Once the local news says so, we must pack necessary and go into safe place. Which both hassle technically and mentally.  Edit : I also developed light sleep the more it went on
I'm happy that YOU didn't go down Chris! I happy that you guys are all safe!
Any tsunami on the way? /panic
On the bright side, now you have the swimming pool you always wanted in the studio. Perk...no?
hope u had insurance
i believe Japan is forcing you to leave because of your joke about leaving after meeting Ken Watanabe. stay strong, Chris.
I guess time to attach some cage walls to the shelves to keep them on the wall.
Wow terrifying, thanks for the update and hope studio isn't too much work to fix.
I'm glad you're safe, my british grumpy man! May your grumpiness will scare the earthquake away. Amen
I was so worried about you when I saw your message about the earthquake. I'm glad you are ok.
Hey Chris I am sorry for Japan and you for what happened to your studio, RIP Ramen shop, but I am happy most of the studio is intact :) let's rebuild! I am not trying to be funny, but do you have earthquake ensurance? The studio cost quite a bit. Hmm.
Oh my goodness so glad you're all in one piece you can always replace but you can't replace you! Glad you guys are alright!
Sad to see. Glad you're all OK though.
Must be terrifying to experience an earthquake. I am glad that you'r alright Dave, the studio would need some new decorations tho. I've heard that one Shinkanzen derailed due to this earthquake.
I hope nothing sentimental or irreplaceable got destroyed
I'm glad you are safe, its a shame about the stuff in the ramen shop but at least you all are unhurt which is the more important thing. I hope everything goes well for the clean up and I hope you start to feel less on edge as the days pass.
That was one heck of an alarm clock. Glad you guys are okay.
that looks horrifying. glad yall are save.
So scared but managed to make content
:( the effort you've done
oh dear , I feel very sorry for you. I'm glad that you are safe. things broken can mend again, or get a new one. looking forward to your reborn studio. you do have a positive mindset. Gambatte Chris !
Oh Man! Glad your ok, thanks for the earthquake video! First I've heard of it!
the plastic ramen was built for this
Oh, my heart...the studio... =< I hope the clean up is fast and there is minimal water damage...how awful is that. I'm glad you're all safe at the very least, but my heart lurched at the sight of the damage to the ramen shop.
I saw your post on this but damn seeing the footage itself is terrifying. Makes me thankful really, for all the complaining we Brits do about weather we really are one of the luckiest places in the world, we get no extreme weather and the worst 'disaster' we might get is a little flooding.
Really glad to see you safe.
I've never experienced an earthquake myself so I can't imagine how frightning that must be to live through but seeing your hard work getting damaged by one can't be easy either 😬. Glad you and your friends are ok and best of luck with the repairs! 💪
I'm glad you guys are okay. Material possessions can be replaced. You guys can't be. Sending much love to you and the citizens of Sendai.
I remember the Tohoku 2011 earthquake as I was in Tokyo studying at the time. I can't imagine how it was for those people up in the Sendai area. I'm so glad you are safe! I hope all your friends are also safe! Those huge earthquake are scary!
Holy shit!
I know the fear that you went through I was in the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in Alaska in 2018
Time for some Kintsugi on the ceramic cat. Build Back Better!
Just glad you guys are ok😌
My town had the worst flood on record 2 weeks ago. This is very relatable. Lots of people without houses. Very traumatic.
It's pretty tragic that this happened after Chris reached another one of his peak in the last video, but I'm more glad that he's fine
That's really sad, I'm just glad youre all safe and you have such a good attitude about it all. You're a legend man 🙂. Lots of love from some random guy in Australia
Thank god u are okay! please be safe! wish everything gonna sort out well for u..
Hope it isnt too hard to get everything back to normal! Stay safe Chris!
fuck i am so sorry after you worked so hard to get all of this together
Survive !
Glad that you are safe and sound! Unfortunately the ramen shop got hit pretty hard. Wish you the best repairing the shop and be happy!
I’m happy that everyone is safe that what is more important then materialistic stuff.
Wtf was that flash of light that shot down at the beginning?
I'm just glad you guys are okay. We actually felt that quake over in British Columbia! All day yesterday, the house I was in, was shaking constantly on/off and because I own Betta fish, I had to make sure my tanks were secure. Just really glad y'all are safe! Items can be replaced. Human lives can't.
Accidentaly stepped on a butterfly in America, sorry chris! Wakey wakey!
Glad you’re safe Ironmouse Luckily nothing too big broke.
Liking bad news videos always feels a bit dickish.   I hope you are able to sort this mess out
This is honestly terrifying. I hope everything resolves soon enough~!!
How is natsuki's store?
So glad you all weren't in the studio. Sorry about all that. Random internet stranger hugs!
Suggestion: For stuff like the maneki neko that are real special, you should see if you can, or can get them, kintsugi-ed back together. Then some of the special things can live on and just become more special.  Super glad you and everyone are ok, even if our beloved ramen shop is in shambles.
Oh, man... my heart to you. Hope insurance helps cover it
That footage at the beginning and the end there is genuinely horrifying, and it's honestly difficult to imagine just how scary it must be to actually be there when an earthquake of that magnitude hits. I don't want to look but I also can't look away, it really goes to show how resilient Japan is given how often natural disasters like this happen there. It's one of the few aspects of the country that keep me from wanting to live there unfortunately. That said, I'm really glad you guys are safe! I'm sure the studio will be back up to snuff in no time, what's most important is that everyone is okay.
Glad you’re safe boss 🙏
That's awful! Glad to see you're all okay. Let's hope things only get better from here!
Wishing you and all affected, all the best. If it’s anyone that can rise back up, it’s you and the gang.
Bad time to invest in a studio man. Hope you're OK.
Had fever during earthquake. No alarm during the quake so legit thought I was hallusenating p.s sorry for spelling mistake
oh God. im glad you are all safe guys
I think this is the first tour we’ve gotten of the new apartment
Wow
Chris, if you can find the rest of the pieces perhaps you could try your hand at kintsugi? Glad everyone is safe!
Mate. I'm so sorry. For you and everyone in Japan. It seems that every year since 2019 has been a very giving year... In the wrong direction.
So glad you are safe Chris that's the important thing, I've heard a lot of people talk about museum putty, keeps things in place without disturbing the look. Hope all this gets sorted soon, I'm glad sharla and natsuki are safe too
Oh my God
Glad you’re doing well Chris! Stay safe! 🙏🏾
Glad to see you safe Chris. Hopefully the damage isn't too bad.
Glad you’re ok!! Stay safe
Oh god hope your stuff are fine!
Take care of yourself man, glad you are alright 🙏
Omg I’m glad you’re ok!! Man feels like not too long ago I was in your live it’s crazy to see the studio all messed up.
I hope you are doing well. Hopefully you can rebuild your studio anew!
I'm just happy that you and the crew are safe.
How dare that Earthquake destroy your favorite Neko Statue... Ok, but on a serious note, I'm so happy to see that you and your friends and family made it out ok, tons of shit could've gone wrong and that the only things that did go wrong was a busted water pipe and a lot of broken dishes...
That's terrific! I'm glad you're okay.
A 7.3 magnitude earthquake in a highly populated area and "only" 4 dead shows how good the building structure in Japan is. Nothing is perfect, but everything you lost can be replace. Glad you are OK.  Plus: the flash of light from the substation at the beginning of your video looked terrifying.
Sweet beejeezus! I’ve been through earthquakes but that was scary! Glad you’re okay.
A very sad event, hope rebuilding the studio will go well. Glad all you guys are safe
Omg
Glad to hear your all safe, the rebuild begins.
Insane brotha. Glad you're all safe
Sorry to hear about the situation you all are experiencing. Stay strong and keep up the good work on YouTube when you're back in business!  Peace!
Dyaaaamn
Shit this is the worst .. Still though, so gald to see that you're safe and Sharla and Natsuki as well💜
Glad you’re okay. I still want to live in japan though
Man, that sucks as you only built it recently. But still, at least you're all safe. The stuff can be fixed/bought again, it's just a pain and takes time.
Now, the hole kintsugi-thing makes sense, because you have to glue everything back together after another earthquake.. and again... and again. Maybe you can do that with your Maneki-neko?
I'm glad you are ok. I wish you good luck with the studio and everything else.
Glad you're alright Chris. The most important thing in situations like this is that you're safe!
I am so sorry you had to experience this. I hope that you can put your studio back again and that the water leak isnt to bad. I was in the Los Angeles earthquake back in 1994 and it happend at night so woke up to the shaking and all the noises. Terrible feeling. Im Swedish so are not used to those kind of nature disasters. Take care 🌺
Man I am so sorry!  I couldn't believe how hard everything was shaking! I hope you and your family are alright!  Have much luck!  🍀🥺💐
Thank you for sharing. I’m glad you and your friends are okay. I hadn’t even heard about the earthquake on American news because of all the stuff in Ukraine. 😭
I'm happy to know that you and the others are fine.. so sorry for the ramen shop, hope to see you soon with everything sorted out. Take care
damn that's pretty bad hope the repairs go well, seems like it's gonna take some time to fix the studio was hit pretty bad but at least it seems fixable! also it was already recorded in yutube+camera before earthquake  this earthquake seems to have hurt a good few people :(  someone once said natural disasters unite people (?) so maybe u feel united idk  wish u good luck on the recovery, looking forward to an update / another vid  / anything
thanks Sharla
Glad you're ok. Nice studio btw. You've come a long way since your tiny dinky apartment. Have fun with the clean up.
I watched this all happening live on Twitter. I’m glad you’re at least ok, Chris! That must’ve been terrifying..
Reap and sow, there's space for a new tree to grow. Best of luck.
Glad to know you are safe chris.
I'm glad you're okay
Stay safe, you and your team 🙏
The important thing is you guys are alright… cant imagine being shaken by a 7.4 earthquake, 5 was really bad enough… hoping for a quick recovery!!
The first thing I did when I heard the news, was look at twitters to make sure you were ok. So sorry about the studio! I am so happy you and natsuki are ok.
I didn't decided what i wanted to do after my be in civil but now i have decided imma get masters in earthquake engineering
Glad you guys are ok!
I am glad you are good and safe, Here in Costa Rica that is very common, I hope you can get up and running soon enough!!!
I'm glad you're all safe! So sorry about the studio though. It could have been much worse, but it's sooooo cool! Maybe you can take us to a trip to Daiso? I don't have one in my area, so I can live the experience through you (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤  Be safe!
Glad you're safe! One of the biggest things keeping me from living in Japan, it shouldn't, but earthquakes just terrify me
I would recommend you to change the coat hanger into something less obstructive. Imagine you were inside the studio when that happened, I  think it won't be easy to open the door.. and get out..
It's really sad to see your apartment like that - really hope you get it sorted soon. I know you put a lot of time and effort into it, mate.
Ouch. Just keep reminding yourself the most important thing is everyone is safe. Physical possessions, no matter how rare, will come and go through life. Can never get another Natsuki!!
I'm so glad that you, and the studio, are alright. Let us know how we can help from abroad!
im so sorry to hear about this, im glad to see your safe and i hope you and the rest of japan can get back to being normal as soon as possible
Hulk smash 💥
I seem to have gotten off pretty scot-free here in Tochigi, considering I'm right on the border of Fukushima. Had a reasonable amount of shaking, but all that fell was my knife block and bottle of mirin. Considering how many things I have precariously balanced on shelves, I'm surprised it wasn't worse. That might be due to the different building codes you mentioned at the beginning of the video! Hope you get it all back together!
So sorry this happened but I’m so glad you guys are okay. Take care of yourselves and each other.
Part of me wishes someone could find every piece of that Maneki Neko, and glue it back together.
Glad everyone's okay, so sorry about the set. Maybe you could do a video using Kintsugi to repair the maneki-neko?
Glad you're safe!
Chris. Are you planning on more videos on this earthquake and aftermath ?.  Eg. How the Japanese people rebuild after disasters like this.
Oh shit man, you loved that studio so much and now it is like this. Thankfully you are fine and really admire you for the way to handled seeing all the chaos in there.
This honestly feels so sad. I remember watching you in trash taste and when you showed everyone your studio how excited and proud you were. FeelsBadMan
Hope Japan can recover quickly as usual, best of wishes 🙏🏽
Can you kintsugi the cat? I'm sure you can epoxy the little red machine's top.
Don't worry Chris the studio is just Wabi-Sabi now. Much love bro.
Wtf I didn't even hear about this earthquake till you posted this video you'd think it would have been bigger news around the world
I'm so sorry this happened Chris. I feel terrible seeing how bad you were affected.  This is my first time commenting in one of your videos and although the situation is not ideal, I'm really glad you and your mates are safe and sound. Much love from Brazil, take care <3
Why is the wiring all connected to one switch?! #fail
Get the strong arm maneki neko
I'm glad you okay, but heartbroken to see the set got tear down like that
Happy you made it Chris! What a great story to tell your grandchildren.
think god that u all safe
Surprised you sounded so composed about the state of the set. You only got to enjoy your dream for a few months before all that destruction. Certainly can be rebuilt, but that's still got to sting. *hug*
Well you can only hope that that faultline doesn't move a lot for the rest of the year. Rapid plate movement causes the earthquakes.
Man, earthquakes in Japan never get old. Fortunately for me Osaka was just fine. The earthquake was very large so I'm glad Sendai isn't in a Kobe situation like in 1995 or a Fukushima situation in 2011. It sucks to see the studio shattered, but it definitely could have been worse. Hope it gets fixed soon!
Absolutely gutted for you, Chris. But at least you are okay and I know that you can come back with the studio looking fantastic once again! Just have to keep that British stiff upper lip mentality to get through this.
Oh no, I feel so sorry ;-; It genuinely made me sad
Does the insurance cover this ?
Totally gutted for you Chris! Glad all is OK and hopefully most it can be replaced.
You're safe  and ultimately that's what matters the most.
This is heartbreaking to watch! I know how much time and effort you've put into seeing up the authentic little ramen shop... I know it's probably not much consolation to you right now, but we really need to look at the positives here - you guys are not hurt, and will keep Abroad in Japan running! If you need to take a break from making videos fora while, that's perfectly fine! Take care!
Glad you are safe! thank you for the update on yourself and your studio.  Wish for everyone 's safety.
🙏
God that is fucking scary  Hope everyone came out of it safely without injuries
Glad you are safe!
Truly terrifying. Hope you stay safe and sound. I visited Japan once and train stopped due to Earthquake that I barely feel. People in train just sit like nothing happen though it’s pretty funny to me that I’m the only one panicking.
So sad to see the set like that. Please stream soon because I will definitely be sending donations your way to help pay for replacement set items!
I’m sorry, Chris. I’m glad everyone is ok!
*Puts one picture frame on the shelf* Chris: ah yes everything is better now  Seriously though, we are so glad you are okay and sorry for all the damage
I can't imagine how difficult it is for you, to see your studio in that state.  Just remember, the fear will subside. The water will dry. And, you can rebuild a studio. The most important thing is that you're still around, to rebuild.
Thank you for updating us
I feel very sorry for the damage... Be safe, all of you guys!
I’m glad you all are safe sorry about the studio
i hope everyone is safe over there 💕
0:10 anyone know what that massive light was at the 10 second mark??? also i hope all the people of Japan are okay, that earthquake looks absolutely horrifying. and sorry about your studio chris, glad youre okay but
Glad you're okay, sad to see the props in the studio ruined. Maybe use velcro or magic double-sided tape to secure the props for the next time
So relieved that all of you are ok. When I first saw the news I immedately thought of you. At least things can be replaced. Stay safe and forge ahead.
Kintsugi video coming up?
I feel so sad for the ramen shop but I'm glad everyone is ok
Glad you guys are ok.
Perfect chance to practice some Kintsugi and make a video out of it! Happy you are safe!
Glad you're okay Chris. All the best, mate.
im glad your safe bro, plates can be replaced but you cant be.
I hope you recover really soon from this. I felt really sad watching all this. You probably did and tried your best to stay in character
Glad you're alright! I can only imagine what that must've felt like. Take it easy on yourself today and do whatever feels best.
Where did the water come from?
Just got the set near this year and it's already destroyed at least it was not connor who destroyed it
The studio can always be rebuilt! we're all relieved you are safe and sound and you weren't seriously hurt.
Maybe homes in Japan should be built like an interrior of a sailing boat to minimize damage.
scary o.Oh full body mirror leaning looks intact for some reason
Chris gets heavier and all of a sudden there's an earthquake...👀
Good to see you made it through unscathed. Sorry to see the state of the studio, but it can be fixed up with new items added.
Nam myoho renge kyo... So sad.
What was that massive flash at the start of the video there? I hope you all in Japan are doing alright. Stay safe!
Glad you're safe and healthy chris even though you probably caused it fatty!💀❤
NOO THE LUCKY CATTTT!!!! :(((((  This is a real bummer for your awesome new set! I hope Japan's insurance is decent or something, At least you and your friends are still alright!
I wish you the best of luck and am sending positive energy your way. I lived in Northern California for a few years and the whole time was terrified the "Big One" was going to hit. Earthquakes are awful. Thankfully you are safe. 💙
oh no. thats so crazy. now u know how to make it more qquake proff??
Thank you for the quick update! I hope the comments are as comforting to you as being able to see how you’re doing is for all of us who were immediately worried when we saw where the epicenter was. Gambatte!
Prayers everything and everyone is okay 🙏🙏
Aqui em Sampa Thor tava puto ontem
i’m sorry for your loss chris! super you and everyone else are safe, let’s hope something like this doesn’t happen again anytime soon!
The ceramic cat could be repaired using kintsukuroi, it would look gorgeous and would be a cool reminder of the event.
Oh Chris I am so sorry, how devastating for you after all you have put into your brilliant studio, sending you much love and hope you can claim on your insurance and get it back to your brilliant studio xx
I'm so sorry Chris, will you be putting together a go fund me to help fix the studio? I'm glad you're okay
Glad you're all ok! The videos I've seen on the US news from NHK are intense.
Oh man how awful.. And also in regards to your studio, considering you just got it built and it's already in ruin :(
mop. mop bucket. please
Thought all that stuff was glued down or something
There will be aftershocks for days to come, unfortunately. Sendai is really close to the epicenter, so it must have felt really big.
Glad you're safe, Chris!!
hope you got insurance
Crazy going from Japan's biggest actor to having to clean water into a bag. I am glad you are already and hope the shop can come back stronger than ever. Thank you for the content and stay safe.
:O fucking hell ! stay alive plz ;D
do you have an insurance against earthquake?
i feel soo bad for this dude he spent alot of money on the studio just to see it turn in that. atleast he is safe
You got this Chris! Abroad in Japan studio will be back in no time. I'm just glad that you and your friends are alright. Hopefully the situation gets better soon. No more aftershock and earthquake of that magnitude please god. Stay safe always! 🙏🏼
Maybe find the broken pieces of the Manekineko and do some kintsugi to it for the wabisabi aesthetic value
Glad your safe, in the words of our fearless leader, build back better. Hugs for all.
2:32 is that wall thingh in the middel supposed to be leaning that much?
Aww fk the cup noodles fell
2:27 😭😭
I understand where you are coming from regarding the earthquakes.  I live in Alaska and in 2018 we had a 7.1 earthquake.  We were all on edge worrying about aftershocks and other things.  We came home to broken dishes and my refrigerator had moved away from the wall.  My cats were hiding because they were scared of the earthquake too.
Glad you're safe. Such a shame this happened to the studio, but I hope the damage is not going to be huge and hopefully you have most things insured.
Lived through a 7.4 in Eastern Hokkaido back in 94.  It’s an unreal experience
Glad you’re safe all safe! Hope repairing the studio the way you want won’t take too long. 🙏🏾
The earthquake was probably caused by your thick toes plodding on the concrete streets, Chris!
You should start a gofundme to pay for repairs I'd love to help out and I'm sure a lot of others in this community would be more than happy to help. Stay strong ❤
Glad you and the guys are safe, Chris!
Please get some cleaning tools and supplies for your studio! Wishing you and everyone affected well 🥺🥺
This sounds absolutely terrifying. I love Japan and would like to visit it sometime, but this kind of thing really puts most people including me, off from trying to live there. Hope you are doing well, and that the lights are working!
You and your friends are safe and that’s what matters. The studio can easily be replaced you guys can’t. Best of luck Chris we believe.
Insurance doesn't cover these kind of things?
All the best wishes on the recovery of your studio Chris, glad to hear you and your friends are safe
I’ve lived on the Gulf of Mexico my entire life, and this past hurricane season our home was almost entirely destroyed. Everything gets better :)
So glad everyone is alright, I could not imagine being in the centre of this. I'm hoping everyone and yourself recover safely and really hoping everything can be replaced, much love from Scotland mate. <3
I cant even imagine how that felt... just watching the Intro alone made it look terrifying regardless if the building was made to keep safe during a earth quake
This is awful but I'm glad you're all safe. Moreover if you need funding to help rebuild the ramen shop and have it be more secured for something like this we'd all love to pitch in if we can. Much love always Chris, and hope you're well while you look over what needs fixing!
I think you need to employ better engineers given the water coming through etc. Hope you guys are all ok
What matters is that everyone is ok. Totally breaks my heart about the studio. But hopefully  it can all be repaired in a timely manner, with some precautions in place.
The important part of you’re safe. Things can be replaced.
Open a real ramen shop, i'll come visit and help donate to the cause. If you do, send me an address, and serve me a meal. Could be Instant ramen, or could be actual ramen.   Anyway, glad to hear you're safe.  - Stay positive! Never give up!
sad to see the studio that way but glad that all the team is ok
I heard the earthquake was caused by the Nikkei hitting rock bottom💀
Love u cris ❤️
Ayo!?!?! What happened to you Chris?????? Why did u cut it like dat 😭😭😭
Well... once you invest into something and nature just spits in your face... damn.
Maybe replace the broken ramen bowls for plastic ones and glue them to the shelves. Glad you’re all safe ❤️
As much as the damage sucks the important thing is you are okay to pick up the pieces and move forward. Glad such an affable man is still out there. Take care of yourself Chris!
Holy cow! 🐮Thank goodness you're safe and thanks for the quick updates.  I hope the rest of the gang (Sharla, Ryotaro) up there are also ok!
I'm glad you were safe during the earthquake. Sorry about what happened to the studio. I hope everything can get fixed soon
Glad you guys are save Chris. And about the set, don't worry the water damage add characters
Japan was shakier than a Vietnam vet at a fireworks museum
Yeah, that earthquake was quite frightening.
Just glad you're all okay.
Jesus Christ mate looked like a seriously dreadful time. Glad you’re all ok good luck with the cleaning process I’m sure you’re dreading that.
Chris, glad that you, Sharla and Natsuki are ok and not injured. Re your maneki neko, just a thought but why don't you take it to a Japanese Kintsugi sensei and have it repaired in the traditional way. They can even do it when pieces are missing. It would add great character to your neko, and it would become truly one-of-a-kind. Like you! :D
2:29 the only thing to get you through a crisis is british humour😁
I think it'd be cool if you could repair the Neko with Kintsugi
Glad you and all your friends are ok. Things can be fixed and replaced in time. Be safe.
I’m glad you are all ok. That is the most important thing.
If you have not seen these videos, I do recommend these from Akidearest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWau4o2prsE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mstiPlTUcG8  Especially this one:I Protected my Japanese Apartment from a Disaster: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gCDgM6LQ-Q&t=501s
Mate it’s a blessing in disguise because you’ve a great studio but it was full of shit once that’s cleaned bet it just looks more professional of a workspace
So y'all did the Harlem Shake without us, cooools👀
please stay well.
First thing I did right after hearing about this was contacting my loved ones in Japan and running towards Twitter to see how you were. I am genuinely so sad to see the studio like this but so relieved you, Sharla, Natsuki, Joey, Aki are all ok. I know you can rebuild Chris because you're awesome and you have all of us to support you! Sending you lots of love ❤️
im glad you're ok man
Im so glad youre safe!! That looked so scary :(
If you want things to stay in place in the ramen shop but still be movable you can try museum gel. It's super effective
Bro... SO THAT KILLING STONE THING WAS REAL??????
Brokenhearted for you, Chris! So glad you’re safe, just sick about the studio. So glad you had friends around you when you went in. ❤️❤️❤️❤️HUGS
The most important thing is that you guys are safe, the studio can be rebuilt.
I totally forgot about the ramen shop.🙁
glad to see that at least you guys are not hurt. Are the damages covered by insurance, if any? really curious about this.
Oi, Chris-san, glad to hear and see that you are safe and sound. I find it remarkable and soothing that the big mirror to the left of the entrance was intact. I lived through a few earthquakes in Europe (granted not to the scale of this one in Japan) and usually the first thing that falls or breaks is one of the mirrors in the house.  I think this is a sign of good luck, hopefully you will be able to repair and refurnish everything in no time!
I am so sorry this happened to your new studio. I know it's all replaceable in the end but still heartbreaking. I am glad you and everyone else are okay though, which is what matters most.
Feel real sorry to hear abt that mate hope for the best and rebuild the studio again we're all here with ya
Well I guess your studio set is really cyber punk now 🤷🏼‍♂️
So unfortunate that this happened so soon after getting all this set up, glad you are safe and the building is still standing!
Glad you're ok. Nice to have friends that give a hand of help in these moments, right? :D
Thank you for sharing this. I don't miss earthquakes, they scare me so much 😱 I am glad you are okay. I pray the rebuilding process goes as smoothly as possible for you.
You got this!! No one got hurt thats the most important part!
wow  thats a shame  i really like the ramen shop set, well on the bright side maybe after using it a few times and there were those "maybe we should have done it this way or that way",  adjustments can be made.               i dont live in an earthquake zone so i dont really know what one is like but im thinking they must be terrifying
That looked terrifying, glad you're unhurt but it's a real shame about the studio
Glad to hear you're ok. Stiff upper lip mate! 👍🏾
I hope you can get that mess sorted out quickly and smoothly. It really sucked to see everything broken and thrown around.
Too much volcano 😢  Jk glad you're safe, sorry about your beautiful set
To everyone that says "I'm not scared of anything" I always tell them to try and not be scared during a massive earthquake. It's a terrifying experience.
chris on happy times: it's shit innit chris on disaster: very positive  jokes aside, good to see everyone is safe.
LOL
OMG 😥the studio! But I'm glad that you're all safe!
This is heartbreaking to see.. seeing your dream studio be demolished like this must be beyond frustrating 😞😞😞 I really wish you all the strength you can muster up right now to get through this!
Is connor still drunk??
May I ask, what was that bright light from the video? Looks like a missle that hit ground.
Well I am glad you are ok. Sucks about the studio but nothing that can't be repaired.
I'm sorry that the earthquake did so much damage to your studio. I hope the water issue isn't too difficult to fix! Glad you are all safe!
This comment section is like a broken record... Jeez "glad you're ok" 500 times in a row.
For someone that's terrified, you seem to be very happy about what's happened
Honestly heartbreaking to see something you worked on and clearly cared about be heavily damaged like this. Hope it won't take too long before you get your studio back the way it was.
Damn. The killing stone thing real.
Good to see your safe.
Holy shit!! That's absolutely crazy👀
Glad you and the rest of the gang are safe ✌️ I hope a speedy recovery for everyone 💪
That mirror didn't fall and break. Proof of bad luck deterrent right there.
so sad to see all this damage!! Im so glad you guys are all okay! I hope there won't be any other earthquakes any time soon! Please take care and take time for yourselves as well
Glad to see your okay Chris and sorry to see the studio like this
Just glad you’re all safe
SCARY! Glad you are safe!
Glad to see you were safe Chris! All the broken stuff can be replaced, but your safety is the most important thing.
I can't imagine being in an earthquake like that. I'd be terrified, too. Glad you're okay though, and hopefully you can get the set back in working order.
Glad you're safe Chris. Hope you're able to get things back in order without too much additional stress.
Objects are replicable, People aren't. Blessings that the damage was minimal and non-life threatening. Even for a 7.4.
Feel really bad for Chris His studio is fucked Glad hes safe tho
no😭all that precious work
Hot damn bro that is some serious shaking.
Horrible and horrifying, glad you guys are ok!
If it helps Chris the Maneki Neko that broke is made by a company called Huang Fong, you should be able to find an identical one through them but they do lots of variations so the same one might not be painted exactly the same way, something to specifically ask for.
Glad your all safe. Be strong Japan.
Hey Chris, does this mean that now you can fix the ramen shop bowls and other broken stuff the Japanese traditional way, with the golden thingy, and keep it as a memento?  Glad to know you and your loved ones are safe. Cheers man.
You must kintsugi the ceramic manekineko (sorry for spelling) and put the cat into a display box  Take care So glad you’re all safe
Hopefully you have insurance for all that
I'm just glad that all of you are okay. I heard this is the aftermath of the biggest earthquake that happened 10 years ago around the same time too. Please stay safe and take care of each other. Studios can be rebuilt, things can be replaced but your lives are worth more than that. Sending yall my love and prayers.
take care and all the best to you guys!
Thanks for the perspective and insight into your experience of the event
Stay safe Chris
My god the devastation that an Earthquake can cause even in a place made to withstand it.
Sorry
Collect the pieces of the cat and get it kintsugi'd back together.
Just glad you're safe man! You can always rebuild your famous ramen shop, this time with Blackjack and ... uhh maybe just blackjack :)
Thats horrible, hoping everything will be good and better again soon! Glad you are okay and you nor your friends are hurt!
Good to know you're all ok..
Good luck
Things can be replaced, I'm glad everyone's ok.
o7
holy fuck im so sorry
Hooo, glad you all are okay! Literally my first thought was I hope Chris and his new studio are okay since your channel is the biggest connection I have to Japan. Hopefully it really is just superficial damage, dishes can be replaced but people can’t. I’d definitely keep the cat and give him a little bandage job (or even pay someone to do the gold repair, kintsugi) and display it. Earthquakes terrify me and I can’t imagine going to hrougb one that can actually cause that level of damage, not surprised your pretty shaken up. I’m glad you and hopefully all your friends were in a safe place when it happened💜 best of luck with the studio!
BRO IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY IS THIS A SIGN?!
I used to live in Japan as well. Felt a few but never that big. Then I moved to California...
Sorry and glad nothing happens to you. You can glue the doll and it would be Kintsugi
Glad you all are safe.  Stay as safe as you can.
Man, sad to see the studio in that state.. you just got that whole set done.  Good to see you and your friends are safe. I hope you can get the damage fixed, waterdamage can be a pain.
Was wobbly in Tokes. Not like that tho. Good luck with the clean up.
I’m glad you’re alright Chris, but this is absolutely terrifying. I was in Kyoto and felt the earth shake a bit. Best wishes for recovering the studio. Stay safe!
Stay strong man we love you
I'm glad you're safe.
Sorry about the shop but glad to see the 3 of you are safe. I saw Sharla also had quite a bit lost in her place too so hopefully you can both get everything recovered.
Ok all damages aside; that apartment is the flaming tits; I would adore to live there   Edit: I just want to add that I just read the transcripts and I absolutely missed the part that it happened yesterday; I thought it happened ten years ago and you were checking an old apartment. I hope you’re ok and I really hope you are able to rebuild. Take care
I can imagine how it feels to walk into that beautiful studio that was built so recently and see so much destroyed. Luckily, all the bowls and small items can be replaced in time... but you are right to worry about that water. If the studio is taking water damage that will cause the most damage. Good luck, stay safe, and keep on keeping on Chris!
Glad you're okay, Chris!
We LOVE you!!!!
every problem is opportunity in disguise. while ur studio is under repair, time for a wacky weekend at some random hotel w/ connor!
I'm glad you are safe.
glad you are ok, Chris!  Keep your neko,  it gave its lucky paw 🐾
Glad you are okay! <3
I’m glad you all are safe - that is what’s important. Much love from the US. Happy to help however I can and I’m sure others in the Abroad in Japan community are as well.
Avoid the coastline
This sounds very silly, but the Maneki Neko raised paw being broken gives the idea that it "gave its life" to prevent less destruction.  Glad you're safe, and that the damage wasn't more devastating 🙏
4:20 the poster
I knew you were safe, but seeing the studio made me tear up a bit.
I'm just glad to hear that casualties were low mad tht ur alive
And now, its is ankward feeling to click "I like this video" button.
Sad to see the studio like that after so much work went into it. But it can be built up again, and shine once more. I'm just glad you're all OK after something like this. Must have been terrifying
have you considered a gofundme for the repairs to your studio? i feel so bad about it, especially since its so new.
I hope you're able to restore your studio soon Chris, maybe with some anti-earthquake measure too But more importantly thank goodness you're safe and sound! Keep safe Chris :D
this is the only thing stopping me from living in japan
Best of luck team, I watch all of you and hope you are all safe!
Stay safe!!
Chris you should have left the water, it adds more authenticity to the "out on the street vibe" lol. But in all seriousness, I'm glad you didn't die....but if you do next time can I have all your stuff?  J/K!!
Glad to see you all well. Wish you all the best.
I’m so sorry to see this happen when you’ve worked so hard on this space. I am glad you are all safe & you had Sharla & Natsuki with you. They are good friends.
Would be cool if you could make a Kintsugi piece out of that Neko.
Happy ur ok man
Wow, the footage at the beginning looks much worse than I imagined. Hope you can rebuild your studio quickly.
Glad y'all are OK!! It was sad to see the set in shambles, but I love how you still held onto the luck cat 🐈
Thank God ur all safe ❤️🍀🙏
I'm glad you safe dude.  all the best for the future.
Goku and Vegeta gotta start going to another planet if they wanna train that hard man.
Safety is no.1 so I'm relieved you are ok. It's really sad to see the studio being torn down like that hope it won't take long to see its former glory
Im surprised you managed to hold yourself and continue filming, its your studio Chris, the biggest project you made for yourself, for the channel.   Its only been 4months since you opened it. We know how excited you are to show everyone your studio, sharing every bits and mini trivias you can find. Its sad to see it like this.
Wishing you the best Chris, glad you are ok.
Well atleast now your set is full of pre disaster antiques
Glad you're ok man!, Now you must be patient with the aftershock quakes, some can be really strong (like over 6), I'm from Chile and we are a very seismic country.
Oh my god i hope your ok. its sad that im first hearing this from you.
Glad you're safe Chris!
Glad you are safe!!
I'm glad you all are safe and well, I'm sorry about your studio though, that's rough.. :(
Is this Joe's Room in the Intro or what
Things can be repaired and replaced. Annoying but better you are all ok.
Shame on the studio, but glad that you all are okay. Take care, man.
Riotaro at it again .
So glad you're okay, Chris!
Should do an episode where you try and repair the porcelain with traditional methods. Would be super cool and meaningful.
Hope everyone in Japan is ok looked scary
Glad you are safe.
Glad to see everyone is doing alright! Good luck cleaning 🧼
Hi Chris, glad to see you are okay. So sorry to see the damage to your beautiful studio.
I didn't even know there was an earthquake till you posted this. 'm Glad you're Alright my man! Stuff can be replaced but memory's can last as long as you dwell on them.
oof
Man, that’s terrifying seeing that.. May you and your mates be able to pick up the pieces steadily (like literally and mentally)! You will be okay.
I know the absolute pride you took in that studio Chris, I genuinely felt bad seeing in so soon from completion. I hope you can make everything spick and span again bud, good luck mate.
Feels weird liking this video but I hope it gets the video/channel more attention and more revenue.
I’m so sorry Chris! I hope everything is ok. We appreciate you!
yikes i'm glad you're okay<3
Im just glad that you are okay, Its a shame that many things broke, but they can be bought again. But its important that you or your closest friends havent been injured. Sending love from Czech republic ❤
breaks our heart to see the new studio suffer
I'm glad it seems no one was harmed other than the Menekineko? The cat thing, I had never experienced an Earthquake before cause I loved in place that didn't get them then I moved to a place that did and was scared cause it was like 4-5 I can't imagine a Magnitude 7
it's interesting cause I had a friend JUST land in japan when this happened.  she and my other friend are safe and Im glad to see that you're doing good too =)
good luck with sorting things out, natural disasters are unfortunately unavoidable, hope u can save most of things. I live in Finland so i havent ever experienced earthquake but i can believe its scary and the damage is shockingly depressing, compatte
Take care.
0:10 this was some explosion or what?
First
I've experienced one earthquake in my life. On Rhodes about 15 years ago. That was a 5.8 or something and I was terrified. Can't even begin to imagine a 7.4. Stay safe out there, and good luck with the cleaning.
I'm glad you are okay Chris. I'm sad about the studio.
Glad you're safe Chris!
Glad to hear that you and the others are safe. It's also nice that you could still crack jokes even while you were assessing the damage. It may take some time, but things will get better.
You now have 13 reasons not to move to japan rather than 12. But saying that amazing country beautiful people. Every time something is distroyed the re built its always better. Looking forward to the improved studio. Thanks Chris from your fans back in the uk
Happy you are not hurt at least. 😅
My apologies for the earthquake…. I was digging to China and think I made a wrong turn, hope all is well!
WOW You are OK the rest can be made better in time. A blob of hot glue on he bottom of the set dressing "might" help in the event of another one.          2x👍
the fact an earthquake came while u were editing is horrifying. hope u r fine.
Fix the water issue ASAP! I've lost so much due to water that I've developed a phobia from leaks from what I've lost. Hope all works out and it isn't as bad as it looks
Glad you're okay. Things can be replaced.  People can't. Hope Sharla is doing well too.
Thank you so much for posting this I had no idea and I have a friend that lives in Japan. Because I saw your post on Instagram I checked in on her and they're fine thank goodness.
Glad you all are safe, which is the most important thing!!! Everything else can be rebought, you all can't. I'm still sad to see the damage in your place though.
You said it's 7.4 on scale, but some news sites and even in Netherlands, they said about 7.3. That is just slight less. So, which news is correct? 7.4 or 7.3? Glad you survived it and studio damage is not big.  But Japan is near spots where earthquake will happens sometimes. I am kinda surprised you have no idea how shake feels and why it's important to secure everything to reduce loss of valuable items (or special collectors items). Nobody give you the advice to secure everything more in place? Of course they're not important, your life is important and that is what it counts you survived it.  Stay safe. Also... part of earthquakes have also after shocks in the future. It means you must just stay on alert next month. It happens in some countries with after shocks. Secure everything now if possible.
Dang, glad you and the gang are safe Chris. And I really like how you keep you cool throughout the whole thing, I would have been devastated to see the damage if it were me. Very positive, very POG
Why does it seem that people have so many nick knacks in the same place most prone to earthquakes? Like are they expecting to have there stuff broken.
I was living in Japan 2010-2011 I experienced the one that was apparently 9+, man I thought that the ground will split and I will be gone... will never forget that... I survived obviously :P but do not wish anyone to go through it. I was at home at the time, so ran outside away from any potential debris that could fall on my head, or a roof falling on me... people aged 90+ ran outside crying... that was one of the most intense moments in my life... and then aftershocks... eventually after a day I just got used to earthquakes, and every time there was an earthquake (especially at night) I was just like ohhhh shut up, and keep going back to sleep :P During the day just stood till it passed. At first it is scary AF, but then the more you experience earthquakes the less scary those are.
At the end of the day, this is stuff and stuff can be replaced. It looks like you and your friends were able to make it through relatively unscathed, so that’s what’s important.
Glue the new bowls and plates and screw them to the shelves
Keep safe ❤️
Happy you , Sharla, and all other Sendai friends are okay despite the material damages. I know it will all come together again 🤍 We love you guys.
Sorry about the studio; glad you guys are ok. I've experienced two in my life (southern calif) and its the aftershocks that can go on for weeks is the thing that would put me on edge and keep me there.   When you rebuild the studio, gonna have to glue down some stuff........it sucks, sorry.
Trying to once more get a shout out from the Japanese government, like with the missile incident. Well played, Christopher Broad
my first thought was if most of the broken cat statue can be found, it might be a great opportunity to find someone that specializes in kintsugi! but with all of that broken ceramic though, it might be difficult to salvage...
stay safe chris!
Stay safe man
Stuff can be replaced ❤️ Chris can't
I’m glad you are ok man.. it’s devastating to see it happened. I hope you n the studio can get back up. Wish you the best of luck! 🖤
me from malaysia ...i'm glad u ok & sad about u studio chris-kun
Sorry this happened to you Chris and everyone else.  You should be able to reach out to the team that did the studio and they should have some kind of list of what they bought.
So glad you're all okay!
Do you have insurance?
Seeing the damage to the studio was devasting. Luckily it seems like it's mostly the small parts. Now we gotta make sure the next ramen shop is earthquake proof 🤞
Good to see nobody hurt, looks like it's mostly just the bits-and-bobs off shelves that need replacing. Did you go upstairs to see if they know they have a burst pipe? Hopefully insurance can cover most of it.
You Dead ??
Sorry this happened Chris, but at least you guys didnt get hurt. Good luck fixing up the shop!!!
You need to get yourself some sugru and start glueing thing down
Well damn the new studio did not last long
I'm glad you and everyone else is alright though! That's all that's important!
Glad you are all OK
Dude, this is a GREAT Kintsugi opportunity!  You can send your viewers (or patrons) the broken pieces of something (Maneki Neko anyone?) and they can do the kintsugi magi and send it back.  Or they can keep it.  Whatever.  I think it'd be amazing to have some portion of your studio to have beautifully repaired  objects that were brought back to life after the earthquake!
so sorry this happened to your new studio. do you have insurance to cover the damages?
At least the booze didnt fall down
Bloody hell mate I hope you and the gang are alright
Chris i hope to are safe now..that must have been the worst experience ever to you
I’m sorry about your studio, but I’m glad everyone is okay! I can’t imagine going through an earthquake that bad.
Thank goodness you're okay! Good luck with everything over there, and stay well and safe!
1:31 How in the world did that mirror survive
Aw man, I felt a emotional for you seeing all those smashed bowls and the cat.
On the upside now you can get into the gacha machine
Wow, just terrifying. It is so surreal watching those videos. The power of an earthquake is just insane. I am glad y'all are ok, that is most important.
My Hart sinks for you 😔😢
You know it's really bad when this earthquake scared Chris more than a nuclear missile Shame about the studio but really glad you and everyone else are ok Stay safe and take your time fixing things
i hope your home is restored and you're comfortable again as soon as possible. what a scary event
Glad you're good man.
Over the moon to see you and others are ok, but I am sorry that you lost a lot of the studio. I was scared seeing the water, had a leak recently that could taken out the lights, computer, all sorts of stuff if it wasn’t spotted at the time but that’s nowhere close to this. Hope you’re feeling a bit better now. As Natsuki said you’re a hard worker and I agree! :)
i saw this on insta, good to see that ur not hurt :))
Glad you guys are safe!  Sorry  about the place :(
Omg your studio 😭
Feeling terrible seeing your beloved studio in that state. Strength to you and your team Chris! Things will get better and please stay safe ❤️🙏
I am so sorry about the studio! I am glad yall are safe!! 🙏❤
I felt so heartbroken when I saw the Studio. We know how hard you worked to get it the way it was. And I feel like I was part of it as well. Glad you guys are all safe.
jesus is coming back soon . pls repent and believe in jesus . go read from gospel of john now
I love how the little Nemo was mostly in one piece, defiantly cute to the end
I’m glad that you, Sharla and Natsuki are safe. Good luck cleaning up the water and restoring the studio to it’s former glory. Keeping my fingers crossed for few aftershocks. 🖤
We're all glad you are alright! Feel so bad about your studio and all the people who had to go through this in an older building!
ok but what was the blue flash at the start of the video?
what was that flashing light?
Glad you're safe n sound. :) Seeing for the first time how the studio and ramenshop look like from a zoomed out perspective. I was so confused earlier that you turned the studio into ramen shop, and i thought all of it was turned into the shop. But now i see. *Feels enlightened*
The footage of the city is so terrifying! What was that huge light that lighted the skies????
I'm really glad you're safe, but I'm pretty sad the studio got destroyed, you spend so much time decorating the place :((
I am feel really sorry for yor studio I hope you will be able to rebuild it
Take it positively my mans :)
Think of all the kintsugi! Glad you're okay and damage limited.
I'm glad you're all okay.  All I can suggest is make yourselves a nice cuppa. Pick yourselves up, dust yourselves down and carry on.  But everyone else is right things can be replaced. Take care.
i'm so sorry this happened to your studio Chris
Thanks goodness at least the building is not collapse, Stay safe my British friend
So glad you and everyone else are safe.  I immediately thought of you guys when I heard about the earthquake yesterday, considering your proximity to the epicenter.  Also glad to see that the Fukushima nuclear power plant is still intact.  I would hate to see Japan have to relive that disaster.
Thank goodness you’re alright ❤️
I’m glad that most of the set survived and that you are alright.
God that's so terrifying. Glad you're okay. Im sorry for the damage to your studio.
Oh man. That sucks. I hope the water damage is not too bad. Quicky find the leak
Who could have guessed that youtubers are people too? Not me
Oh noooo not the studio...Been waiting on your video. So crazy to see up close... coming from the US where we have zero where I live. It's hurricanes for us.
I think the little cat would be great to put back together. I believe it's the Japanese(?) art of Kintsugi? Where you put a ceramic or a bowl back together and line the scar with gold, as a reminder to celebrate our wounds and the new person we can become from them, instead of acting like they never happened.   I'm glad you're okay Chris. A studio is more than replaceable. You are not <3
Oh lord. At least it's salvageable. I can't imagine how gutted you must feel though mate. Hopefully you get everything nice and fixed up.
Wow, that’s scary. Seen from over here I’ve always regarded the Japanese as survivors, pulling themselves up by the bootstraps, as the Americans say, clearing up rubble, starting all over again and again and again, and I guess they have to be like that living where they live. Hope you’re fine (and insured), stay safe and come back stronger, Cris!
Glad that you and the gang are alright. It’s heartbreaking to see all the damage, hopefully it won’t take to long to get the studio as good as new.
Glad you are ok
respect  for you bro
The cat statue bit made me feel so sad, if I was there I’d offer my help in trying to glue him together. I’d hate to see him go into a bin (◞‸◟)
glad you're all save!
Well, at least you're alright, as well as your friend's. All of your well-being's is important and it's good to see that you're all alright. It's a shame to see the studio and everything broken, but with time, thing's can be replaced and damages can be repaired. Please remember to take time to rest and clear your mind. I hope everything gets better for you and I hope you stay safe. n_n
Be safe Chris and hope it all gets back to normal soon for you and everyone impacted.
Glad you guys are okay, that's the most important thing! Hope you can get everything that needs fixing fixed quickly.
It is Traumatizing and Scary...  Glad you are safe Chris.
I'm really happy you are safe! It is sad to see the studio being left in terrible shape...I cannot imagine how I would be able to hold up after such an impact.
Sorry about the studio but so glad you guys are ok!! 💜💜 we’re thinking of you!
I am glad that you are well. Sorry about your studio. Was the water damage too bad? Stay safe.
that's so sad, that set was to freakin cool...
Absolutely hate to see the studio so trashed. Really glad you are safe.
The glorious set that Chris poured his money and soul into creation is almost destroyed. He had not enjoyed it even for half a year :( This is so sad.
This if possible would be the perfect chance to have the lucky cat repaired with the golden filagree through the cracks. I dont remember the name of the technique or process but I think that would be amazing.
glad you're safe
Bro, apart from the water it really looks like your studio got through it pretty alright!!!  Glad you guys are all safe.  Love from a Christchurch vet 😉
a bit affable init
just glad you're ok!  studios can be rebuilt, but people can't.
Seeing this did sting quite a bit and made me sad. You just poured your heart and soul into making it. I hope you can fix it swiftly. But I am glad you are all fine and I hope not many people got injured.
Great reason to try out kintsugi!  No wonder its a japanese tradition.
It was insane yesterday. I was playing games with my friend yesterday and he told me that his house started shaking, soon mine did too! Glad you're safe up there!
Hi Chris, glad everyone is safe! I have a suggestion for the cat, you could try to do some type of Kintsugi with it. It will add to the emotional connection you have with that object and will remind you of this episode and how you were able to rebuild. Cheers from Canada!
Don't know if I'm more upset then you guys. I'm crying and everything.
This is exactly why I'm a minimalist. Close to no mess, damage, and anything falling on to me.
Glad to see that you're all ok. But seeing the maneki neko gets me in the feels. Have you considered kintsugi? We have the technology. We can rebuild him.
So glad you are all OK. Hope the water issue isn't too bad for you, but at least you are all unhurt.
such a pro
I would sht myself, no joke
You can fix the cat!!! Don't scrap him
Swear to god this video is about to get picked up by Japanese TV. Are we getting another 'Are you YOUCHUBA'?
We had a 5.5 quake south of West Java on the same day yesterday. I felt it, but others in the same room didn't feel it. It was around II on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale. I thought I was having a vertigo or balance issue.  Stay safe Chris. As someone who also lives on the ring of fire, we should be accustomed to earthquakes by now. Sadly a 7.4 quake would turn Jakarta to rubble seeing how a lot of our buildings aren't up to code.
Glad you're all safe! How terrifying but mad respect on how all of you are handling a rough situation
I feel so sad for him ..... All his hardwork was in ruins 🙂🙂
It might take some work but I wonder if you can make some molds of different plates and bowls and cast them in rubber that way if another earthquake happens nothing will break
Good luck fixing the place mate, the shop will get even better you will see.
Holly sh*t balls. Thats freaking crazy...RIP studio :(
Im sorry for your studio. The good thi g is that you guys are alright! 😁
*Picks up Trash Taste gift* Chris: Everything is better now.  Man finds comedy amidst disaster. 😂 Luckily you're safe.
Is it bad that I heard the attack on titan theme song in my head whilst you showed the footage of the “rumbling” of the quake? 😅
you shit your pants? lol
Might be time to invest in melamine bowls for the ramen shop, huh Chris?  I'm sorry you went through a scary experience like that. "Oh shit, I'm gonna die" moments are just... things that stay with you for a while. Please look after yourself during that time. (Speaking from experience)
Osaka resident calling. I was on edge for days after we were hit by the 2018 Osaka quake, but that seems so trivial in comparison to this one. Lord knows if that were me up there, I'd be looking to escape the Japan life ASAP. I not only feel for you but also the people you hired to create and build this amazing set and of course the hundreds on thousands more people effected by loss of valuables, power cuts and - tragically - loss of lives. I've seen all my close friends and favourite content makers in Kanto and Tohoku happily report as fine, and seeing your perfect health made me feel much better too. Here is hoping that you can sort this out in quick time, but take all the time that is needed. And take care of yourself. <3
I would argue that this is the biggest earthquake in Japan in the last 10 years. The Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016 had an magnitude of 7.3 with an intensity of 7 on the seismic scale. As a consequence, far more casualties were reported compared to this time. Let’s not forget about this tragedy.
Holy shit. Having anything on a shelf in Japan is literally taking a gamble.
The earthquake looks and sounds terrifying ( ive never experienced even a small one)  - Glad You're allright! It's great to see your authentic reaction - it felt very real and mature. I think alot of other Youtubers in your position would make much more of a drama and a scene, so i appreciate the calm and based way you hanlded this.
Glad you didn't die! You're an inspiration and you make me want to learn more japanese and go to Japan!
I'm glad you are all safe and that you had Sharla and Natsuki with you whilst assessing all the damage. I can't imagine how hard it would be doing all that alone when you're still in shock.
The most important thing is safe: You.
I'm glad you're okay! I'm so sorry about your studio too, I know you were so happy with it. Best of luck getting everything back together!
Im glad Sharla and Natsuki could come with you.  Glad you are all ok.
Yeah, it is fairly traumatic to experience an earthquake that strong.
I'm so so glad that you are all safe! Absolutely broken hearted for you and the studeo. We all know how proud you are of it. Material things can be replaced but, precious Chris and team are alive and safe 😭❤️🤬💔💜💝
That green stuff growing at the base of the column sure is happy for the water
Go and give that cat a kintsugi cure. Would be interesting to know how easy/difficult it is to have this in japan.
We will rebuild!
Sorry that you had to go through that chris! I can only imagine how scary it was. Glad to see you are safe!
Im voting for a maneki neko kintsugi video
2011 was 10 years ago !?
😞 so sorry, I’m glad your all safe though. Take care and stay safe. 🙏
The earth is one unpredictable and powerful thing
Hope u don't throw away the cat :(
this really explains why most japanse rather buy new built over older simply cause os saftey. Also convered about power and gas. Glad you're ok.   Also, thinking about the japanese who like to collect stuff. I'd be a minimalist if I lived in japan.
I didn't know about this not one alert popped up....I'm glad the gang is OK. The only alert was more Rain 🌧 for Victoria I'm blessed that's all I got. Take care.
noo... not the ramen shop... :'(  stay safe everyone
I talk about predictions / things I’m picking up on going on around the world. I ‘predicted’ possible tectonic activity and the bullet train derailment about a week ago. Here’s the link for anyone who may be interested in that sort of thing. Regardless, please keep praying for the people in Japan. 🙏🇯🇵 https://youtu.be/ejZFk_GYva0
Glad you guys are alright sorry about the set.
You should make a video on kintsugi and use that as an excuse to fix your manaki neko
No wonder many universities have earthquake engineering as a major. So scary to be in a tall building when everything is shaking like that
I'm glad you're okay, Chris. I hope you and everyone recover soon from this horrible experience. Best whishes and stay safe
I'm so sorry Chris.
so sorry man, luckily you are alright though
sad times. Just glad you're all safe
I was genuinely worried about him lol
I'm so sorry… But I'm glad you're all safe. You can find a lot of earthquake-resistant goods at DIY stores.  Lifehack for living in Japan.
Take care, Chris! I was very sad to see your studio with broken bowls when you've put so much care and effort into it. All the best and keep up the good work! 頑張って！ 🙌🙌
4:18 top left the stickers....
Glad you're safe, this is the first I'm hearing about the quake.
heart-breaking to see the studio like that 💔 I'm sorry you had to go through that and really glad you're safe at least.
That flashing light made it look like a damn nuclear weapon went off!!!
Big Earthquakes are awful.. very glad you and friends are ok!!
Really upsetting to see your poor studio like that, but I'm just glad you're all safe. That must have been really terrifying
Goddamn. :/
stuff is replaceable, you are not. glad you're well. plz, buy a mop
Is there any way I could donate money so you can rebuild?  You, Natsuki, Sharla, Joey and Conner never fail to bring me happiness.  I'd love to be able to give something back if possible.
Yeah was easily the worst one I’ve been in, and narrowly escaped the 50 year old brick apartment building that threw most of my stuff off the shelves last year…. This would’ve been way worse.  Now happily in a tiny house in Yokohama.  Sorry to see all your damage, but hey, it just looks more realistic now! 😅  You’re safe and after a little cleaning and repair, better than ever!
That sharp light , was that explosion? I’m very glad you are doing ok and that no tsunami came in the end. This is absolutely terrifying!
Glad that you and the team are okay, Chris. The damage is not that bad fortunately. All the best!
dude, we are glad that you are at least safe bruv
Omg i'm so sorry for the studio. It's so sad to see it into pieces. Perhaps you can glue the manekineko back together instead of throwing it away. I certainly wouldn't be able to throw away an item i love so much until i'm 100% certain i can't fix it, because im a bit of a hoarder and throwing away things i have an emotional attachment to makes me too sad.
Man that sucks, hope everyone's okay.
Glad your ok, sucks to see your studio didnt fair well. But your safe and that is all that is really important.
Glad you are ok
The stuff in the studio can be replaced mate, you can't, glad you weren't in the studio when this happened.
Few places on Earth are totally free from the threat of natural or man-made disasters.  I live in the state of Colorado, USA.  While it is a geologically stable area of the Rocky Mountains, the western states are having wildfires of unprecedented size and number as well as flash-floods and drought over the past several years.  "Normal" is not normal any more.
I'm glad you're safe Chris; me and my wife genuinely were worried. Material stuff is easy to replace. I hope everything get sorted.
Glad you're okay
Of course we're all glad you're okay, but it really sucks to see your work destroyed overnight like that. All that time, money, dedication--gone. I hope the studio can come back stronger than ever. Take care, Chris!
Happy you are all fine and I think we all owe a *giant thank you to all the civil engineers* in Japan who had to build under very demanding standard to make sure that not much worse happen. I remember 1995, and you don’t want that to repeat ever again.
Dang,good thing you are okl. Things. Can be replaced.
Glad you are okay... Still sorry about all the trashed stuff.. The world really is fucked up currently..  Don't give up...we will Support you as well as we can..  🤗
We will all be here to support you Chris, I'm sure you will be able to recover from this unfortunate time. Stay awesome! From Matt in the UK :)
That's a hardcore earthquake
Shame Chris. Glad u are all okay! So sorry about the studio! But I'm sure all will be well! Sending safe wishes to a you and ur friends! 🙏❤️
Stuff is stuff, I know it cost money but you can't replace yourselves. Super happy that you're all safe and sound. Take care!
Glad that you and everyone is safe. But on the side note, your studio now looks like another Wacky Weekend location. It has finally come full circle.
I'm glad you're ok and that you had friends nearby to come help clean up. I hope the aftershocks quit soon!
Oh no i feel so bad for you chris
I'm just glad that you guys are okay. Hope you can get everything fixed.
Go get the maneki-neko repaired at a kintsugi shop, Chris; make it even more beautiful. :D
Could be a chance to try your hand at Kintsugi...  Glad you're all safe...
omfg i was supposed to go to japan on march 14th until march 30th and because of corona the flight was canceled im so glad that the flight was canceled 😁 sorry for your studio!
Ah man gutted for you loved that place
I feel so sad man seeing this cups, glasses and things are broken I'm still glad you're all safe pray for japan
Glad you're all ok.
wow
Glad you were fine!
this actually makes me sad cause we all love the studio and know how much it means to you as well. Glad you're okay though.
You've always shown such pride and joy for his studio, so my heart genuinely broke for you watching this, but I really believe you can rebuild it back to it's glory.
That earthquake was horrifying, hope you and the boys are doing ok, now that thats over.
Atleast you are okay that's the best part, the studio will bounce back ik it !
Damn Japanese buildings literally built different
Glad you are ok, so sorry about your studio but in the long run that stuff is replaceable, you on the other hand are not.
Glad that you and everyone is safe
Objects are replaceable - you aren't. Glad everyone was safe.
glad the studio is mostly still standing, i know that fear during an earthquake, the set can be rebuilt, keep yourself and those with you safe.  I can understand being on edge after an event like this, after the 7.2 we had here in california a few years ago, i am still on edge, i am still nervous about a similar event far closer than that was.
Hey Chris, Sorry to hear about the studio. That looks terrible. I felt it here in Tokyo and I have to say it was the weirdest earthquake I ever felt in Japan and I was genuinely concerned  when I felt it. Anyway, I am glad you all are safe! I hope the clean up and putting the studio back to the way it was wont be too much a trouble for you.
It's a shame what happend to the studio but thank god you guys are all safe.
Does insurance cover earth quakes?
never felt anything close to an earthquake in my life so i have no idea how this feels, i'm kinda curious and kinda scared at the same time
Hang in there Chris! The pain of losing something only reflects the quality of what you had built in the first place! I'm sure you will build back again!
Time to put some kintsugi skills into practice methinks man! Glad you're all okay, and best wishes all round. I have a friend who was visiting Kobe with his wife, visiting her family, when the quake hit.. scary things. Those opening shots conveyed it quite well enough.
This is absolutely awful. Is there any way we can help?!
Shit fuck. Glad you're okay dude. It's easy to rebuild a Ramen Shop Studio not so easy to rebuild you.
HEY CHRIS WE ALL ARE GLAD THAT YOU ARE OKAY. Don't worry the studio can always be rebuilt, we all are happy that you are safe and sound. Maybe a Journey Across Japan episode to find stuff the for  ramen shop. Stay Safe.
Man glad you all are safe. That looked like a scary earthquake.
Glad you are okay. Wabi Sabi the porcelain kitty cat ☆
jesus christ glad ur safe
Sorry to hear mate I hope it all gets sorted glad your ok that's the main thing you can rebuild things but not lost of life UK loves you.
A small hiccup to a bigger future Chris, don't let it dampen your spirits too much. Best of luck mate, stay safe.
I am so glad you are all okay and I hope everything gets sorted soon!
My heart goes out to you. I feel sad. I am thankful you were not there and you are okay. You can get back on track Chris. Fortunately you have good friends there helping you. I hope you won't experience this for sometime but I know you will be better prepared now. Los Angeles has had its share of Scarry earthquakes. My first big one was very scary indeed. I mainly hope you can figure out the water issue. Take care and my prayers are with you all. Much love✨✨✨💖✨✨✨
I'm so glad you and every one is safe
Glad you guys are ok 😨🖤
I'm glad your are safe
Hey I'm happy you're ok and your home is ok too but I am sorry to see the result of the studio, I empathise with you and it made me sad too seeing it, I've been watching your videos for years now and always loved the content, chin up and looking forward to see some more awesome content from you in the near future and for many more years as long you still enjoy creating them most of all. Another fan from the UK
This is really sad and Im happy your okay. I know how it feels since I also live in a place where seismic activities is common.   silver lining is that chad photo of yours survived
Glad y'all are ok! Stuff can be replaced--lives cannot. <3
Honestly, I heard the news late last night and my heart sank,  I am just really glad to hear that you guys are all safe, hopefully the trash taste gang were also in a safe place when it happened,, you have my full support and I hope nothing but the best for you.
Sorry to see the apartment got pretty messed up. Glad you’re ok!
That is one decent camera tripod. The only thing left standing.
Rip the studio… im happy you’re alright and i wish you and your neighbors the best!! Stay safe yall
praying you can get everything fixed and in working order ASAP Chris. glad everyone's ok
That's so horrifying! I'm glad you and your friends are safe from the earthquake and I know the studio will be up and running soon.
Glad you’re ok.  Stuff can be replaced.  You can’t.
I'm from the northern part of the Philippines and we felt the earthquake too. What happened to your amazing studio is really heartbreaking, but you managed to save it by putting the fat Chris photo on the shelf.
Damn, that sucks. Glad you're safe though.
Lives are important. Things are replaceable
I think you should keep the broken Maneki Neko to display in the ramen shop as kind of a momento to getting through the earthquake and the story of the set.
I'm really glad to see you, Sharla and Natsuki safe. Thankfully it's a partial material loss and not a complete one, so hopefully the studio can be restored back to it's former state with time and some DIY. Stay safe, Chris 👍
We felt the earthquake up north here in Misawa as well. Definitely the strongest I’ve felt & it was a long one. Happy that you guys are safe
Im sorry to see what happened to the studio but I'm glad you are safe
We're all happy you guys are safe. The set looks like it didn't take too much damage, just mainly the little nic-nack stuff broke. Hopefully it won't cost too much to get it back to a usable set.
💔🥺 hope you're feeling better Chris and the studio will come back to life in no time 🤞❤❤
So sad to see all the hard work and pride you had in your studio to be damaged so much.  But chin up and a will look forward to studio 2.0 remodeling!  Glad to see that you are all safe.
I'm sorry about your studio, but I am glad you are all safe!
3:16 I mean, hey, at least it wasn't obliterated. It's still recognizable enough to be a memento of the earthquake itself, if you're into that sort of thing. Although I imagine it's something you'd be willing to forget...
we had a minor earthquake here in hk  not long ago, it was a few sec but it was surprising since we don't get earthquakes here, I felt some earthquakes too back  home in Peru and it will never be not scary, I am glad everyone is ok and that most building s in Japan are build agaisn't natural disasters, sending love.
Oh wow, that outside footage almost seems apocalyptic! Glad you're ok!
My thoughts and prayers, for the families that lost loved ones.  Hopefully the recovery proceeds quickly, stay safe everyone.
Very sad to see all that destruction. Happy to see you safe, though. Godspeed.
Its heartwarming to see Sharla and Natsuki by Your side. Nothing is more important than good relieable friends. ❤️⛩️
Glad that your good Chris that earthquake looks like it's from a movie that was so strong
Hope everything gets sorted out man, geez that’s scary!
At least the Ramen is safe :)
When I heard about earthquake in Japan (just a small note in news, all media are stuffed with war right now), my first thought was hope that all people around this ytb channel are ok. Everything else can be fixed, even the Maneki Neko.  Hold on and take care, guys :-)
So glad you’re safe! It is a shame about the studio but those items are replaceable, you are not! Please be vigilant in the coming week for more. Stay safe and best of wishes to you all ❤️
Glad all 3 of you are uninjured, Chris! That is the number one thing. You guys will bounce back from this. I can't imagine how terrifying that must have been.
Happy that you're all safe! Remember to also check potential damages on pipes and etc. overall on the entire building. One thing can fast lead to another. Take care
Do the kintsugi gold lining ceramic repair for the cat. Could be a cool video too for you to learn about it and do it too, maybe.
Really shocked; but glad you’re alright! Hopefully everything can be restored in due time!
Must be scary do you know if it hit osaka i have a freind in osaka havent been able to talk with her yet
From cyberpunk to postapo  Glad you're ok!
You can rebuild a ramen shop but can’t rebuild you good luck with the repairs
Im glad youre ok
First time I saw your channel it was that HUGE earth quake, and I been gone for some time until you did the video with the Hollywood guy, and the next one is an Earth quake again.  I hope your doing well my friend, really do Japan really is in a bad spot in regards to position, they just have been getting destroyed over the last 50 years by natural problems.
I'm so glad y'all are safe
what are the warning (if any) like in Japan for earth quakes?
Glad you all are safe!
japanese buildings are built pretty damn good aren't they... think if we had this even in cali we'd have more problems... glad everyone seems to be ok in japan. hope everything isn't terribly expensive to fix.
oh no Chris :/
This video cries out for a mobile gimbal.  Stay safe dude!
Too much Earthquako.. Seriously though glad you guys are OK, stay safe out there ❤
Be safe and wish u luck 🙏
Holy crap. That's intense  The damage would give the studio more character? Idk. Well at least you're safe my man.
This pains me to watch at first but I quickly adjust myself knowing this will do nothing but strengthen Chris's already impressive story arsenal. Now all he has to do is to volunteer at the local rebuilding event with a Brit flag on and the Queen will have no choice but to knight him.
Rebuild and make it even better than before Chris!
I'm really glad none of you were hurt and not everything was destroyed I hope none of you have to go through anything like that again ❤️
I'm happy everyone is safe. Take care 🙏
Luckily no one was hurt, glad you guys are all alright
Chris, may I suggest kintsugi on the maneki neko? You can even make a video out of it then!
i hope you‘re doing alright! I‘m sorry to see what happend to the Studio, but at least you‘re able to take it with humor.
Glad you and your friends are ok.  That's the most important thing
I'm glad you are safe ❤
So sorry about the damages Chris, at least none of you were hurt. You can replace broken stuff but not yourself! I am sure you will have it all sorted in no time, best of luck🤞
mental shaking tbh
Very scary sorry to see the damage but glad everyone is ok
Chris, please keep the maneki-neko! It will be a great souvenir from such a terrifying moment. The emotional connection to it, will maybe help you find love for the maneki-neko's new, broken form.
I cried a bit after seeing your studio in shambles, it could always be worse though. Good luck Chris, I'm sure it'l be back better than ever before you know it, actually you'd know it ^^ Stay safe!
Damn. From futuristic 80s theme studio to apocalyptic dystopian in one earthquake.   Jokes aside. glad that all of you are okay and in one piece man.
Its nice to know that the essentials are safe such as the expensive fake ramen bowl that didn't fall off the counter and most importantly the booze. Also, glad you all are safe mate!
You're alive!!!! - with Brad Leone
Bloody hell, glad you're safe, condolences about the damage to the studio!
Oh Chris this is so heartbreaking to see, I'm so so sad this all happened just shortly after you built the whole studio :'( But like everyone else I'm also super glad you're alright and nothing happened to you. I hope we can help you via patreon to fix this all again! Best of luck 🙏🏼
Glad to know all of you are doing well  Stay safe
It wasn't an earthquake Chris, It was actually a anime character powering up
Jesus! That opening sequence was terrifying! Glad you're OK. You should get a Kintsugi master to repair the maneki-neko.
Next song, "Too much Earthquake" as a fund raiser to get you back on your feet! Glad you are all okay and hope you recover soon!
Thats terrifying. Glad you are unharmed and wish you a quick recovery from this!
Keep on keepin on
Damn, all that hard work put into that set and now it's ruined. Glad your ok though.
Please take it easy, Chris. We could see how bleak & shaken up you were and it's completely understandable (I would be too). Get some Comfort Food, put on a few good Movies and take a long Rest, if possible.
My first thought when i heard of the news was "I Hope you guys are Ok"
Glad u and friends are safe, that’s important. Stay safe.
I’m so glad you’re safe, but I’m so sorry you lost all those nic naks, some of those look like pricey and hard to find retro things. I really hope you can rebuild.
I'm glad you're okay, but I'm sorry the youtube algorithm is just messing with you now. The next recommended video is "12 reasons NOT to move to Japan"  😅
Glad you are all ok! Prayers 🙏🏽
I hope you and your friends get to recover from the damages quickly! Indeed looking back the studio was a nightmare for earthquake damages, but you probably weren't thinking about that at all when getting it set up at first. Maybe now will be a good chance to secure down as much as you can :/
NOOOO not the studio ;_;
I'm glad you're ok Chris but I'm sorry the earthquake destroyed most of the shit in your studio hopefully you will be able to replace the most of it.
Man that really sucks, your set was really cool. At least the damage to the structural parts of the set itself don’t look to be too badly damaged, so repairs might be possible… but to Quote Zuko From Avatar The Last Airbender (Respectfully) “That’s Rough Buddy”. I hope you can get things back to normal and I’m glad you’re ok.
Glad you guys are ok. Must’ve been terrifying. The worst thing about earthquakes is you never know if they’re going to escalate when they start…
Holy heck you just got that studio!!! Hopefully things get back to normal soon for you!
Stay safe Chris!
I hope everyone in Japan is alright and I am glad you are doing fine chris
Well, I am relieved to know that you're okay and that the damage isn't too bad, all things considered.
Glad that everyone is ok! Sorry to hear about the studio
Oh my goodness that must have been unsettling to go through. Glad everyone is safe and the studio will be as good as new in no time. And hopefully the water damage is minimal.
OMG hugs to everyone :'(
If you can find the other pieces of the maneki neko, maybe you could do some kintsugi and put him back together. I would hate to see you part with him.
Chris, I am glad you are safe and I hope you can put back togrther everything soon! Thank you for giving us insight in this!
I'm happy you're ok Chris. I'm also happy that Natsuki and Sharla are as well.  I wonder how the Trash Taste boys are. I don't use Twitter, anybody know if they're all OK too?
Anyone know what that bright light was at 0:10?
That is terrifying!!! Glad you are ok.jeep the broken cat!!! It has sentimental value and a story now. Even if it lost a hand
It will be ok Chris! We are all here to support you!
I’m glad you’re OK. I hope the water damage isn’t too much. Of course this happens when you have your nice studio
Glad you and the others are ok.  On the bright side, this gives you more content.
I'm so sorry you are going through this!
So glad you are OK! That must have been so scary! I've felt earthquakes in the 5 range but nothing that strong.
I'd say keep the Maneki Neko and put it on display - as a earthquake souvenir
glad you're all okay, and that, for the most part, it was superficial damage in the studio. hope that water leak isn't something serious with the pipes in the building!
Your studio has been a 80s-noar-neon-Japan-backstreet style before, while now you have the same but post-apocalyptic one.
How many aftershocks did you have? In Kanto, I felt a small earthquake, so I turned on the TV news (about the only time a TV is useful in Japan).  They were saying the epicentre was somewhere near Miyagi, and then there was the "WARNING:  Another one's on the way" announcement, and whamo.  Three and a half minutes of sheer terror, but nothing after that.  EDIT... I feel bad for thinking what I experienced was scary, since it was only a 4.0 here.  That's nothing close to the 7.4 you experienced.
Sorry to see all the damage Chris, but as many have said, what's most important is that you, Sharla & Natsuki are OK. I've got to agree with ThioJoe, get that manekineko framed with the date as a commemoration!
2:25 When Chris was saying "No, no". I thought he was going to follow up with a sarcastic "Oh, how good. This photo survived... Super happy... Yay..."
Hey man, the studio is mostly fine and you're safe. The trinkets and materials can be replaced eventually so everything is fine. I don't know how easy it is to do it, but you can find someone that knows how to do Kintsugi (金継ぎ) to salvage the porcelain pieces you're attached to like the maneki neko.
If Jafar were prime minister... I mean, Sultan, this would've never happened.
Glad your safe. Earthquakes are scary.
I'm so sorry about your studio!  Glad you are ok.
I was worried about you Chris happy to see you safe.
That “earthquake light” was striking. More research should go into that.
Glad to see you all doing okay! Materials can be replaced and studios rebuilt, but there's only one affable Broad!
Glad you are right man, take care of yourself and everything will be fine eventually. Gonna take a long time but you can repair this place dude 😎
What was that bright flash in the distance?
We're just glad you're safe, buddy.
Glad you're alive!
Oh Chris I'm so sorry! I'm glad you are physically okay. It must have been absolutely terrifying, please take care of your mental health in the aftermath!
if ever move to an earthquake zone i would go minimalistic with my decor. Hope that water problem isnt big
Sorry for your troubles. Hope you get your ramen shop back up and running soon.
When he said its the worst earthquake in Japan in 10 years, I was like, what about 311... then I realised...
Is home insurance available in Japan? Do people generally invest in it as they do in the U.K.? I hope you get tidied and repaired very quickly.
damn, hope, you get everything back to normal!
I tried to leave a comment to tell you that I found an exact replacement lucky cat for you on Amazon Japan, but it took down my comment I think. Probably because I linked to the product. If you check your Patreon comments on the latest post, it should still be there. I’d be delighted to send you one as a gift if you DM me a mailing address to send it to.
Wow, looks much stronger than a 7.4, makes me wonder why they would build that way. Heard it was located in Fukushima, definitely Not good. Glad you are OK, and continue to be so. Thank you for letting us get an insiders perspective.
Glad you're safe
Chris: Im really happy with the new studio, it turned out great. *Japan Sinks op starts playing* Chris: Why do I hear boss music?
So happy you guys are safe! I agree with the others to keep some momentos of the Earthquake. Down the line, those will be worth having.
Hope that most of what was damaged can be replaced without to many issues.. The biggest thing is that you are all safe and that most of the set is still there... I was really worried that those glass displays would have been shattered all over the place as well.  Looking forward to more from you, and thanks for this update, I'm sure I'm not the only one that would like to see more of these things as well on here.
Glad you’re all safe.
That must be terrifying in so many levels
Hey man, best wishes from Kobe... Sorry for this shit. You only just got your studio together. Brit to Brit man I know how much work you put into building your studio and your life in Japan so I am just glad you are good.
I found this mildly amusing and maybe you will too. The next video YouTube recommended was your "12 Reasons NOT to Move to Japan."
This is sad such an awsome place and soon after you get it this happens
Chris i hope you and all your friends are safe
Material things can be replaced, You cannot...stay safe mate! Chin up!
Be careful out there, Chris.
All the best Abroad!! Can't wait to see the new studio
Great to see everyone safe. Hopefully the leak will get fixed soon.
pls make another update video
I so sorry about your damages. I wish you and your studio a quick recovery. 🙏🏻
😳😳😳
I don’t feel sorry for people who live in earthquake prone areas. You know it’s bound to happen!
Chile classic 😎
Glad to see, you, Natsuki and Sharla are alright Chris. The damage looks catastrophic, but I believe, that the Abroad in Japan studio can be reborn once again, if anyone can make it happen, it's you, Chris. Stay safe!
Kintsugi the ceramic cat!
Us viewers know how proud you are of that studio, so I'm sure that everything that was broken will not only be fixed but now will also carry a history. Glad to see you're all safe.
holy sh*t 😮😮😮😮
Everybody is safe, that is the most important thing,
Glad you are safe, Chris! I'm pretty sure you can rebuild the studio and make it even more extravagant. :)
I am glad you guys are fine ♥
that's fine that you are safe. It just happened the first day i arrived to japan soo... i was lucky to be in osaka and that it didn't occured overthere
At least the maneki-Neko protected your studio, it sacrificed itself to keep your other revenue source safe.
This looks absolutely terrifying. Glad that you guys, and others like Joey, Connor and Garnt, are safe. My heart goes out to all those affected by the earthquake.
What happened to the studio is truly unfortunate, but what's more important is that you are safe!
RIP
i know this might sound cruel but currently i would rather expierence a earthquake in an "earthquake prepared" country like japan than being in ukraine. Time and time again i am truly suprised how Earthquaka safe Japan is and how they constantly keep learning
How much total damage cost  Of your item?a  And stay safe chrisbroad 😊😊
Wow that studio got fucked up. Glad you’re safe though xxx
Natsuki brings the towels. Everybody should have a friend like Natsuki!
As someone that lives in a very seismic country and has lived through multiple over 7 magnitude earthquakes I suggest all the ceramic pots and breakable things in the studio be placed in encased displays of some sort or even stick down the ones that are only used as props that way you reduce work and can focus on fixing what's important in case a strong aftershock comes or for future earthquakes.
Glad you’re safe Chris!
Best wishes chris, hope you and your loved ones in Japan are holding up ok
Kintsugi fix the Manekineko Cat!! It will be absolutely beautiful!!!
maybe you can do the thing where you put back together the manekineko? i forgot the name of the art, but it has something to do with beauty of imperfection.  i did not expect it to be so bad, i thought it was just another earthquake in japan. Glad you're safe tho
Much love to you and the rest of the folks out there. Its one of those things you never know how to respond. But hopefully natsuki can keep you in  good spirits!
Stuff in the studio can be replaced, but you can't. Stay safe and well Chris.
Good thing everyone is ok.
Gald you're okay man.
Hope you and your friends are okay.. take care bro 😊👍.
So sad to see the new studio in that condition 😢 glad everyone was safe though.
Keep safe guys!
Jesus fuck!  So glad you, Natsuki & Sharla and most of the studio are all okay
Where did all the water come from? Were bottles smashed? Did a pipe burst?
I'm so sorry Chris im glad you're ok though
Items are always able to be replaced, but the life of your friends and yourself cannot! It will all be okay in time! Be well!
ahhh mate, gutted, just built that studio too
Press F to pray your respects for Chris' studio.
So frightening!  I'm glad you and your friends are ok, and I'm so sorry to see the damage to your beloved studio!
So sorry what happened! I saw your update yesterday and then was checking the news. If I was there I'd be trying to super glue everything back together! Glad you're ok though!
I'm actually crying right now
I just saw akis insta looked madd cant imagine how it felt for the people who actual experienced it
I'm sorry your studio "broke" to pieces. The good news is you're okay. 🥰
You can try to fix the ceramic cat with Kintsugi. (Putting the broken pieces back together with a gold coloured glue)
Glad your safe! All those things can be replaced, life can’t. So that’s what’s most important.
Damn that must have been scary! I am glad you, Sharla and Natsuki are alright though and hope there won't be more earthquakes like this for at least another 10 years. I hope the water damage can be repaired soon. Perhaps some water pipes in the ceiling broke?
Lurker fan. Glad you're all safe at least! Most of the damage is in replaceable items, I'm glad the studio is most intact. Hope no other expensive equipment got broken 🙏
Wow. But you know, I think that the fact you, Sharla, and Natsuki are safe is wonderful. Time to pick up the pieces and put them right again.
why not do some kintsugi on that maneki-neko?
Keep the neko like that it has a story now
All I can say is, good luck and happy that you are not there when the earth quake happened and also stay safe. GO HOME EDIT AT HOME
😢💔
The fact that I was able to feel it all the way in Tokyo terrifies me. They’ve been happening stronger more frequently recently
Omg that's terrible😢 but the most important thing is that you, Natsuki and Sharla are safe ❤️
Sorry to see this has happened. hope you get it back up again, as it was.
Holy crap, 7.4!? I've tasted 6.5 and that's bad, I can't even imagine how 7.4 going to be like, best of luck to you Chris and all Japanese people, can't really give you all much other than prayer and positivity but i truly hope that everything would at least be minimally damaged and hope everything recover soon
So sad for the studio 😢 but so happy you guys are ok also your boo slippers are cute ☺️ and i know (because Aki went ham on her and joeys figures on a video) that they sell extra strong tape to tie down the stuff above the bar rack insconspicuously in case you want to try something like that ✌🏻
What was that big flash in the city shot???
Glad you and yours are ok, wish I could come and pitch in to help straighten up and put things right but sadly distance prohibits, so I shall be there along with many many many of us in spirit! Hang in there!
Your the best brother!It will all come back into full circle for you.Stay Positive and keep up the great work 💪
Glad to hear you are okay. I have only experienced one earthquake and it was fairly mild but terrifying.
I'm sorry that happened, Chris. :( You guys worked so hard to get the studio set together and loved using it. Hopefully you/the production company will be able to put it back together, maybe you could do some kintsugi on the maneki neko.   I'm glad everyone was ok and that you had Sharla and Natsuki as moral support and to help you clean up. Most people, myself included, can't imagine feeling/living through an earthquake that strong.
I'm glad you're safe. As for the smashed plates. Maybe this is a good excuse to collect items on your journeys? Rebuild, one kitschy item at a time.
Sorry about the horror and mess. So glad you are safe
I’ve just given you a like, but I’m not sure whether it’s appropriate… Do I like that your effort and beautiful studio have been smashed to pieces? No! Just Happy you are alright and even posting videos at a time like this. Keep up the good work, your videos are truly at a different level. Greetings from Germany
The tremors are shit bro
How terrifying, glad you guys are alright!
You need to find the source of that water mate asap. The earthquake may have opened up a crack that is now letting water in. Likely a cracked water pipe in your apartment or above you
im glad everybody is alright.
We're just all glad you guys are safe there. The studio can be rebuilt, just take of yourselves down there.
Earthquakes are inevitable, it's just a matter of when. Should check the building for structural base damage before entering 👍
Man it's heartbreaking seeing what happened to the studio. Earthquakes are fucking crazy
all that matters is you are safe chris
Let me know if you need anything I can send you stuff from Hokkaido
stay safe Chris! your studio will be back better than before again
I literally went from ecstatic about a new video to 'oh no' when I saw the title. Glad you guys are okay. Hope the rebuilding of the studio goes smoothly
So glad Chris that you are okay. I experienced a 6.7 quake years ago in Taipei and I thought I was having a heart attack as my whole body was shaking and bouncing on the floor.(I was sleeping on a tatami). As you know by now, it's such a totally helpless feeling as your faith in the earth being stable is lost forever. Take care and I hope that you will get your studio back in shape quickly. As long as you and your buddies are not injured, that is all that matters.
Sad Chris content is not my favorite content 😭😭🙏🏽
Glad to hear you're all OK. That's the most important.  I think you can buy most of the dishware pretty easily and not too expensively at Kappabashi-dori in Tokyo or the Sendai equivalent. Manekineko are really common, too.  I'd take a quick look at Daiso for a lot of the dishware first, though. And all I can hear is Mr. Creosote saying, "Better get a bucket."
Glad you're ok Chris.
The mirror Survive
Items can be replaced.  Lives can't.  I'm glad you are alright and love your content.
:( <33
The rumbling has begun
Hope this is the end of it for now. Studios can always be repaired just glad you all are safe. 🙏
The most important thing is that you all are safe! P.S. I hope insurance is better in Japan than it is in the US.
Are u dating Sharla
So glad you and your friends are ok, I was genuinely worried! Stay safe
thats awful Chris! You should open a go-fund-me tbh
That's so scary, so glad you are safe!
Good to see you are all ok...!   You were all in my thoughts ❤️ when the news broke regarding earthquake..!  Xx
I desperately hope that there are no casualties but this world isn't so kind.
Glad you're safe ❤️
Glad you’re doing well, shame for the studio. I wish all well
I hope for the fast recovery from all of this destruction.
I feel sorry for all you guys over there, the footage of that earthquake looked horrifying. On the side note, I'm wondering how Aki and Joey fared, because Aki was adamant on quake proofing their apartment.
Glad you guys are alright!!
That half second smirk of pure sucidal enjoyment kinda broke the tone for the rest of video for me. Still scary as hell, my only earthquake experience wasn't enough to wake me up so I can't even imagine what have You gone through.
sucks getting something awesome and having it broken so quickly, hope your all ok
On a lighter note, at least you’re not an etch-a-sketch artist with a whole gallery of priceless masterpieces!
Glad you are okay. Stay safe
Thankfully nothing was truly lost ,glad everybody is safe.
Glad you're alright mate!
Glad you’re doing ok Chris.
nasky jumped
Thankfully you're safe, Chris! Bowls and porcelain cats are replaceable.  Good luck cleaning up.
Glad you're alright dude
glad you're ok! The studio now looks more authentic will shattered glass and electronics if you were in NYC. so i see this as a positive
You wanted the set to have a lived in, authentic feel didn't you? Clean the place up, save what you can and proudly display the scars; there may be a silver lining to this yet
So so so glad you’re physically okay, sending best wishes for the recovery and moving forward
Someone mentioned the earthquake to me, and I thought about you guys, and worried if you were okay. Glad you all are! Thank you for uploading and showing that you're "fine". So sorry about the studio, but hopefully it's only "minor" damages. All the best!
10 - 12 seconds. There is legit something that falls from the any before the shaking.   Am I the only one to notice this?
This may sound strange, but to me this is a good news Story, as even with people homes and places of work being damaged very few people actually got hurt or Injured.  Its good to see lessons were learned from past earth quakes and so many life's will have been saved as a result, between covid and the Russian invasion is really good to hear about people not losing everything after such a dramatic and scary event.  I am sure you will get things sorted and I will look forward to seeing future videos informative and interesting videos after you have finished cleaning up.
hey man, glad you are safe. if you need financial support, you could share some donation option. stay safe ♥
I think that maneki neko gave itself for the overall safety of your studio.  Thank it, and then get a few buddies to keep that studio intact.
Stuff like this this me glad to live in the UK. Stay safe👍
Stay safe.
Maybe Sharla can work some kintsugi magic on the broken cat?
:,(
This is so heartbreaking. You clearly see from its face, that the kami in the cat is sad as well. Happy to see you're all safe. Good luck to all of you and "Ad meiora"!
I was in that 95 earthquake. We felt it in Zama. I’m glad you’re safe & hope everybody recovers well.
Hope you were safe, studios can be rebuilt!
Glad you alright mate
Absolutely heartbreaking to see your studio in such a state 😥 I hope this can all be fixed and it won't cost too much!! 🤞🍀
If I was able to fly to Japan atm I would come help you clean up the disaster! Get well soon Chris!!!
And now, gods forbid, it's our turn here in Chile to get the big shaky shaky. I hope nothing too big went wrong in your studio. Big kudos, affable man. ;)
So glad you are all ok and that the studio is fixable. Take care John
Glad you're alright.
I hope you recover quickly chris
That's not water, that's alcohol from all those bottles you guys are drinking!  That cat can be glued I think.  Chinp up mate
Man that really sucks, glad you and your friends are ok.
That's way too scary. I'm so glad you are ok, Chris.  I got emotional seeing the studio too ;o; But, I know you will get it all back up! Just happy to see you all safe.
Do you have a fanmail address Chris? I want to send you a small gift to help restart your décor. I am glad you are all ok!
I just ten years??? Oh my god. Horrific, hope you and your friends are alright.
You guys are safe and that's all that really matters. Sorry for your losses though.
Sending prayers to the affected people of Japan🙏
Sorry about the shop Chris. I hope the insurance covers it.
Try to glue everything together to save the cost
I am glad that you are ok chris, also thank god the studio didnt had any spectacular damage when i saw the title immediately thought " oh no the studio"
One thing the earthquake can't touch is the loyalty of your audience, we will always be watching no matter what videos you make or how bad the world tries to stop you from doing so. Best of luck with rebuilding your studio
Well it certainly is a good you weren't in the studio when it all kicked off! When you think that this earthquake was the same power as the Kobe one in 1995 but has nowhere close to the amount of casualties or destruction it really does go to show how prepared Japan now is. Also with all that broken china, perhaps you could get them fixed using the traditional Japanese art of kintsugi, that would make a great video!
I wonder if Connor is okay as well
So sad about the studio you havnt had it long glad your safe though
sorry to see the new studio in such a state, the damage looks fairly minimal and im glad you're all ok at least!
your poor kitty lost its ear :< might be a good idea to try to repair it if the ear is still intact!
4:18 look at that Ray tracing! 😍
SO GLAD YOURE OKAY!!
Please stay safe with the after shocks to come.
Sorry this has happened. Hope you and everyone is okay
Keep the water dripping and water damage, it's more immersive anyway.
Sad to see it like this I really hope you get it sorted out soon Chris.
Me happy that he posted a new video :) Me watchin the video :0
Like someone said Kintsugi the maneki neko. Or go to the cat shrine to replace it. Glad you and Sharks and Natsuki are ok. Do you have a tip jar?
Glad you all are ok. Take care up there!
Earthquakes are absolutely horrifying! I am so thankful that you were okay and the damages are repairable. An Earthquake of such a high magnetude was really unexpected so I earnestly hope that all those affected by this are able recover swiftly! Thank you for keeping us updated and stay safe man!
I just realized that the studio is not a part of your apartment and as heart wrenching as this is I’m glad that your actual apartment is safer that the studio and you and so many others are well.  Everything broken can be replaced, everything lost can be recuperated, there is always the memories and with time the Abroad In Japan Studio will make a comeback!  Take care Chris and be safe!
Ik how terrifying earthquake can be  Back then in 2017 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 hit kurdistan but it didn’t last for a minute if it lasted for more it would be a nightmare Hope everyone remains safe
main thing is your all alright things can get fixed/replaced its a shitter none the less. P.S hope the real chris in the closet is okey xD
Thank God you guys are fine ,, everything else can be fixed .
Holy
I'm glad you're all okay
I was in Chile during the 2010 earthquake and aftershocks. Not having lived there for long, and being a kid, I didn't quite understand how bad it was. When it woke me up I legit just thought someone was shaking my bed. But then I went for a walk later that day and saw how lucky we were to just have had some tipped over furniture and a carton of broken eggs
Sorry about the studio but I'm glad yall are safe
Normal person: “oh no, I hope my office isn’t destroyed” YouTuber: “Hell yea free content”
I'm Glad you're safe Chris
Jesus! Really sad to see the Abroad in Japan studio in this state. However I am glad that you, Sharla and Natsuki are all alright!
Very relieved to see that you’re ok
So glad to see you all are alive and ok. Hope you can all recover quick. All the best
I have a feeling this will lead to Chris being on TV again
We're glad your ok. Prayers to everybody to be ok
This is unfortunate indeed. But on the bright side, you can make videos on Kinstugi! Lots of plates and ceramics to begin with. You can even start with the cat!
I sure hope Chris got an insurance on that studio
I lived through quite a few earthquakes as have you but the M7.1 in 2017 in Mexico City it was fucking terrifying. The houses arn't built to the same standard there and my flat was swaying like a bouncy castle. Strangely it was on the same date 19 September 1985 Mexico City earthquake which destroyed half the city. Good luck with the recovery.
Man, that sucks. Sorry that happened.
It may be too late, depending on where all the pieces ended up, but a part of me wanted to see that broken manekineko be pieced back together in a kintsugi gilded fashion. I think that would make for a better story than buying a new one anyway.
STAY SAFE MR CHRIS
one of the true to life design of Chris studio is, its replicating same kind of environment after an earthquake
Awful to see! Glad to see you, Sharla and Natsuki are fine x
Glad to see you and your friends ok bro ... Treat this as a challenge and come back stronger. Stay safe. Love your contents ....
You can fix the Maneki Neko with gold it will look more beautiful..hope I'm spelling it right
Stay safe everyone
I'm glad you're ok. Stay safe I will pray for you and the earthquakes 🙏
Those after shocks looked scary. Please take care of yourself <3
Absolutely gutted for you Chris. Will increase my Patreon payment this month to throw a little extra cash your way for the clean up. Not surprised your shaken up by it all, it would be weird if you weren't. Take care of yourself.
So heartbreaking to see. And so glad you (and Sharla and everyone) are ok. I'd say keep the broken cat and the broken gatcha machine and maybe some other bits that more or less, but not quite, survived the quake. Because what are we if not the sum of our experiences and I'm sure the same goes for the studio, it might have lost some of it's pristine newness but it stands more proudly in its survival. (Or something less wordy and bullshitty. I'm in a weird mood today).
Thank God you are OK. Remember it´s just stuff, you can always replace things.
Next time glue it to the surface, might be useful
Glad to see you guys are OK best of luck
Everything was rumbling.
0:09 What the hell was that giant flash of light?
Glad to see that you are all safe!!!
authentic 90's japan experience
I'm happy to see that you're physically alright, hopefully the damage to the studio just looks worse than what it is.
Glad you and your ppl are ok buddy
I was relieved to see you were not alone when you entered the studio. I'm glad you were with friends.
0:09 what is that!!!!!
I'm just glad you guys are okay. Ramen shop can always be rebuilt <3
Truly heartbreaking to see. Glad that you, Sharla and Natsuki are okay.
I've never commented on any of your videos but have been watching for quite a few years..glad you are ok!  Earthquakes are terrifying!  I worked at a call center in Seattle during our last big one. I remember the person I was helping with their dial up internet, was thinking I was lying.  Ours was only a 6.5...can't even imagine a 7.3.  Love to all of you!
Comment
I was in the 2019 earthquake in Southern California; it was my first, and I hope it's my last.
Horrifying, such a shame about the studio as well. Everything like that can be replaced, but it’s heartbreaking all the same. Glad to see you’re safe
Wow! Glad you are all safe! ❤️
love you and your content,natsuki is <3
What were the flashes of light in the sky? Exploding transformers? Something natural? Aliens?
The next video suggestion for me was: "Why not to move to Japan!" Well this is definitely one of the reasons. But kidding aside this is heartbreaking to see. Hope you wil recover very quickly! Good luck with rebuilding everything and above all else glad you're okay!
Glad you’re okay.  If you can, why not try to glue the lucky neko cat back together? Makes for a memory item of said event.
Wow! Thanks for the videos at the beginning, to drive home the power of an earthquake! Having lived in California most of my life, I think I know a big earthquake, but those videos…. WOW!  Thanks for sharing, and stay safe!
Time to do some kintsugi on the manyekineko!
Glad you're safe man, as rough as this is everything can be replaced but you cant, So we are very glad you are okay!
Dude I'm pissed off for you.
Nice to see you guys alive and walking🙏
God, that breaks my heart. You JUST finished this thing. I'm glad you're safe, though. Items can be replaced; people can't.
Glad you all are ok!
Glad to hear you're alright and hopefully the studio will be back to normal soon!
I'm glad you weren't hurt.  I live in California and had experienced my share of earthquakes.  Keep safe.
I hope you’re doing well I hope you recover
Happy to see you guys are ok ✌️
Glad that you made it out unharmed. Can't say the same for the studio tho
I'm sorry you lost so many things in that earthquake,  it's rough losing stuff like that. It  hurts to lose treasured items, though I am glad it wasn't you in that studio or anyone else for that matter. Glad to see otherwise you are okay.
During my time studying earthquakes at university, my professor led a study (conducted after the two earthquakes a month after each other in Italy) that concluded that the idea that you don't get earthquakes soon after another due to the tension being released was a myth. Please try to secure things down, and don't rest on the idea that the worst has passed just yet. There could still be a second one, triggered by the first.  I know it's a bit pessimistic, but the last thing you want is to fix everything, and just get it hit again.
Good thing you did as many videos as you could - Including a livestream - In your new studio before it was all torn to pieces by an earthquake!  I think a good idea would be to clear it all up and start a new theme! (To celebrate a new beginning, And so you won't be cursed to another Earthquake!)
glad you and the team are ok :)
I've been living in Japan now (Ohotsk region in Hokkaido) via the JET program for 2.5 years now in part because of channels like yours catching my interest.   We're lucky not to deal with many earthquakes or tsunamis here. Glad you're okay mate
I'm so glad you guys are ok. It would have been really awful for the residents of Tohoku who experienced the 2011 to relive a lot of those old memories. I must admit that this vlog style content probably isn't your bag, but I think it's really cool to see a bit more of this. Especially on the main channel.
glad everyone is ok
I'm so glad you, Sharla (+ Maro), and Natsuki are okay! I hope there won't be too much water damage from whatever's leaking.
The Ramen shop is now more authentic, it’s going to survived an earthquake
Glad you are all safe. Really sorry to hear that the earthquake caused some damages.
You could have that cat fixed with the cracks painted gold?
As heartless as it sounds mate, rather your studio than your life or those around you. I hope there's no fatalities not just with your friends but with everyone effected.
I’m from Alaska so can kinda relate. The aftershocks after the big ones lasting for weeks sucks the most.
Honestly, just pleased you're okay. But I'm so sorry you've got to deal with the impact of it all, especially on the new set.
Oh this looks dreadful, and this studio was just recently built too, I hope Chris won't be too affected 😥
Glad you're fine mr british youtuber man. Maybe you can get the pieces of the cat back and have someone Kintsugi it.
I was actually sleeping when this happened. I woke up from the huge earthquake. I didn't panic though, I was terrified. And it was long. It feels like you're inside a ship or something. It was shaking a lot and I hear my stuff shaking, especially the door of my room. Luckily, we are pretty far from Miyagi so nothing really happened to us. My parents are at work at that time so they called us if we were okay. Surprisingly, I saw my sister still sleeping after that huge earthquake. When I asked her about it, she didn't felt it happened.  I watched the news today. Three people lost their lives and over 100 people were injured. Really scary. I was also in Japan when 3/11 happened. I was also terrified when it happened. I hope this doesn't happen again. I hope people will be safe and okay. Tomorrow is our graduation and I hope things will be okay. Everyone, please be safe and okay. Bless you.
Can you imagine what the 9.1 earthquake in 2011 was like and it lasted 6 minutes!  My experience is that anything longer than 10 seconds is scary.  I think Japan is about the safest country to be in if there are earthquakes.  Good luck!
Oh god you where closer than other blogger I have seen. I was worried, glad you are safe, ♥️ Kate
Glad you're doing well Shoulda been out* drinking with cdawg
Glad the trio are alive and well, makes me a bit emotional seeing Chris see his new studio he worked so hard for be an absolute wreck :( I hope we as fans can push his videos more so he can get it back to how it was!
Glad you are okay. It definatly is shame about all the things that broke but most important thing is that you are ok and your flat is still there. Stay stafe
as sad as it is that everything is broken, its just good that you're ok man
Its really sad that we can't do anything about earthquakes but I'm sure theres hope to get back. Send my prayers it won't happen again 🙏☝️
7.6 earthquake killed over 100,000 people in muzafrabad in 2005.  Japan really did a good job with upgrading the buildings
Man really glad that you are ok
After the work you put into the studio watching this felt like being punched in the gut. But some of best videos have been on how Japan has bounced back after disaster, now we all want to see flow-up videos of you coming back strong!
I feel you man, I almost shifted myself yesterday… even if I’m in Tokyo
Glad you are safe and unhurt.
Glad you and yours are okay, Chris. Take care, bro
You could try Kintsugi the cat back together to commemorate the earthquake?
please  my brother  I need  ur help
Is there some sort of insurance for earthquake damage to your studio?
Rip set
Praying for your safety Chris and friends 🙏😭❤️ everything will be fine!
Oh no! Chris. Be safe my guy.
3:24 Anyone able to find Chris' destroyed cat on Amazon or elsewhere? Let him know!
I’m glad everyone is ok but it was definitely heartbreaking to watch. You’ve worked so hard. I hope everything is fixable quickly.
Glad everyone is safe
This are the videos that I don't know if to leave a like for reporting or dislike for the earthquake happening 🤔
damn man. we made our house like 2 years ago(in the fking Iran) and that would have destroyed every single brick of it. I'm just glad japan is just that good and it's people know what they are doing
Be safe bro
The beckoning cat invites good fortune, so I hope since this is an accident, nothing bad will come out of it breaking. My prayers go with you and to all affected by the earthquake, chris-san 🙏
Seeing the best studio on earth in such condition it really hurts.....Glad y'all are good
Earthquakes are so scary 😩 It is the thing I fear the most after needles.
'Quake Hold' museum putty is fantastic for holding small/medium items in place during quakes!   Glad everyone was ok!
I'm so sorry thos happened but I'm glad you're safe chris. Hope you can get things fixed and up running again
growing up in Iran I know how terrifying eathquakes can be. glad you are ok
this woke me up in Yokosuka. Hopefully you are doing ok
Not the cat
Holy hell. If I was in the middle of that, I'd just curl into a ball and accept my fate. Glad to see your okay.
Glad ya safe dude at least items can be replaced and repaired  Just hope the casualties are low
That sucks man. Good luck!
God bless u greetings from germany :)
Fucking hell, that sucks big time. Glad you're safe though!
Oh man it pains me to see the set in such a ravaged state. It's the pride of the channel and the crown jewel of all sets Hope you're doing alright mate
Jeezum crow! That earthquake really did a number on your shop. The good thing is no one was hurt.
Glad to see everyone is alright. I hope it doesn’t take too much work to get your studio back in working order! Be safe!
So happy that you’re safe
Oh, man, Chris! Sorry to hear this but SO glad you and everyone are ok!! ♥ Sounds like you're picking up the pieces (lmao no pun intended -- well, ok, pun sort of intended :-D ) but you seem to have a great attitude for it. Carry on and be safe!
When I heard about the earthquake, I couldn't help but feel thankful that Japan is more equipped to handle such disasters than a lot of countries. I'm so glad you and your friends are safe! The damage to the studio is sad, but hopefully the stuff is replaceable.
Builds an amazing studio.  Japanese gods be like: Fuck you Chris, lol.  Glad you're okay.
Sending thoughts and prayers to you and the JP bros
Im really glad you're OK, good luck fixing up the studio
dang so much stuff was broken :( this is so awful, sorry it was so bad for u. Love the positive mindset tho even though you lost so much stuff.
Oh god Chris, I’m so sorry to see this but so glad you are all ok. Totally suck, glad you weren’t in the, how scary! Send you a very awkward hug from a fellow English person :)
Most important thing is that you're alright.
Hey Chris, instead of buying new crockery, try that glueing-things-back-with-gold thing that I've forgotten the name of. Glad to see you're safe and can laugh it off in your own way. Keep on keeping on.
I hope everyone is safe now
abroad in a studio kickstarter!
I'm so glad, that you, natsuki and Sharla are alive. Please take care...I hope that Japan will heal soon and become stronger than before.
Glad to see you and friends safe.  That city landscape shot where you can see the buildings shake so far away is jaw-dropping.  Good luck on the studio rebuild!
That was really unlucky, glad you guys were safe and hopefully the restoration wouldn't be too hard.
Oh man. I'm sorry Chris. Very glad you all are safe though
Hope you guys are okay there. Stay safe.
Good luck Chris! Glad you and everyone is safe!
I'm glad everyone is alright.
Take care Kuya
Glad you are okay, Chris! A studio can be replaced; you, not so much!
Wow that's really sad to see. Felt it down in Shizuoka but nothing like what you guys had to deal with.
Gald that you are ok cris, you got this i am sure , stuff can be rebuild.. health not so easy.
Glad you all seem okay. Sorry your studio got messed up but at least it doesn't look like anything that can't be fixed.
I hope insurance will cover most of this. Especially the things you have to get in second hand stores. Again, said in another post but I’ll reiterate, I’m really happy you all are safe.
We should be fighting earthquakes, 'rona and Godzilla, not wars against humans.
Holy shit, good thing you're okay! Everything will be fine eventually, most importantly, you're okay. Take the time needed to recover mentally.
Glad you are ok. What a shame the studio had so much damage hope what was broken can be fixed or replaced. Maybe with the broken cat you can practice a kintsugi style repair and make it more valuable! All the best, xx
Hope everything gets fixed soon and all, glad you guys are safe!
Fall down seven and stand up eight 💪
Wow... Genuinely scary. I don't comment here often, but I just want to say I'm glad you are safe, even though you are British. ;)
I’m glad you’re alright Chris as well as everyone else out there, keep taking care of yourself as well.  Also, anyone know what that light is at 0:10 ?
stay strong chris
So sorry about your studio❤️
That must have been terrifying. I'm so glad you're all safe. So sad about your belongings and studio though x
Im glad your ok Chris, i hope Sharla + Natsuki are to.
Glad you’re all safe!
Terrifying 🥺  glad you’re all ok!
I'm sad to see all those broken bowls. I look forward to the studio returning to any semblance of its former self.
That is terrible, glad you're ok
This sucks man, the best studio being damage breaks my heart
Oh wow Chris!  I'm so sorry about your studio.  Glad you're safe.
Glad you, Sharla and Natsuki are safe.
Take care Chris! Glad you are alright. Gutted about the broken stuff but the important thing is that you along with natsuki and Sharla were fine
1:40 ayo, whats that sticker
I'm genuinely concerned for you and everyone else. I have relatives there too.
Time for some Kintsugi streams.
I'm truly impressed for you keeping your composure, seeing this is truly devastating. I hope you can recover as fast as possible!
The lucky cat!  Did you save the other pieces?  You could repair (or have it repaired) with Kintsugi and that would look really cool.  ❤️🍀 Glad you are all safe!
Well look at the bright side. Chris now has a storm hit ramen shope set
Gosh, I'm so sorry... 🙏
That genuinely sucks, we know how much you've worked towards getting that studio. Hopefully the damages aren't too harsh. Glad you're safe.
Glad you survived the earthquake and for letting us know that you are Okee dokee 👌🏻.
Glad you are safe. I cannot imagine what it’s like for people who have pets.
oh my gosh....
My apartment was shaking so much and I didn't know what to do and I just sat in my room like an idiot 🤣
Happy you are doing ok Chris, we as a community are behind you and the people of Japan.
Can wait for the Trash Taste boys to show ys their perspective of this disaster. Glad you're okay Cris Borad!
Always be safe Sir🙏 here in the Philippines also experience unpredicted earthquake events.
Heartbreaking although glad to see you are OK. Thoughts from S Yorks.
Glad you are alright. Stay safe, stock up fried chicken...I meant to say basics needs
Well time to binge a bunch of Abroad in Japan videos so you get that beautiful ad revenue to rebuild the Raman shop.
stay safe
I'm glad I live in a country that doesn't have to deal with earthquakes or tsunamis. They're both terrifying.
That's horrifying glad you are ok though man so sorry this happened to you man
yeah a 7.4 is no fucking joke, there's only so much you can prepare for.  Good luck!
what a huge shame.. all that work.. i feel very deeply for what youve just lost.. But as they say, next time will be better..  Raman Shop mark 2, The rebirth  :)
Most importantly is you guys are safe!
無事で何よりです☺️ 命があれば再スタートできます🏃‍♂️
Oh man....my heart shattered when you guys walked into the studio.  Glad you are all safe.  Please, let us know if there is anything we can do to help.
Im so glad you guys are safe
My phone was buzzing with notifications about earthquake yesterday.
Damn, terrible to see that. I'm glad you were not there doing a shoot / live show at the same time, would have been extra distressing. Have to say though, looking quite amazing still from the closing couch shot!
I live in Australia right now but I was still in Japan during the 2011 earthquake. It truely is terrifying, so I’m happy that you stayed safe
I am glad you guys are safe
Just glad you're safe man! Is there a way we could donate to fixing the set?
Like a phoenix, i hope your ramen shop is back from the rubble
FU**********K sorry about the studio Chris glad you are ok though I'm hoping you have insurance  to cover the damage so you can focus on you
I can't wait for an anime to be made about it!
petition to buy Chris all the maneki nekos
Heart goes out to you Chris. Hope everything goes well getting it back to a good state.
Hope your doing ok Chris!
That's heartbreaking! :/ but we are glad you are safe! ❤
Glad you're alright physically and do what you can to help yourself mentally. That kind of thing cannot be easy for anyone so please take care of yourself.
Now he has an earthquake themed studio...
I love Chris's attitude here. I know he must be so sad about his studio but he deals with it so well here. Calm and humorous.
Wow thats crazy!! Glad you are safe even if some of your stuff got beat up pretty bad!!
So glad him and many other ppl are okay, but sheeesh if i where chris i would have a small amount of ptsd and just ship my ass back to the U.K. Mate.
I am glad you are Safe Chris!  And hope everyone is safe!
Is there not earthquake insurance in Japan? I hope you can resolve everything soon Chris. Good luck.
I’m really glad you’re all safe!   I admit, I watch a lot of J YouTubers but when this happened my first thought was you and your friends and I hate to admit, I worried about your set up!
Yikes! Glad you all are okay. Given the inside video, I am surprised how well the set held up. It looks salvageable.
Wow. How awful… I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Little tip that may help in future- there’s something called “museum putty” that you can use to stick everything down for just such an occasion. Anything that doesn’t often need moving can be attached to the surface it’s sitting on. I hope the water problem is able to be dealt with without too much fallout. 💕
Glad you are safe
Wow that's intense at least their was no tsunami after the quake
Sorry to see all that damage man. Glad you all are ok though.
So sorry Chris! I know what’s happened is horrible but we’re all glad that you’re okay most of all!
As you were walking down the street, I could sense that you were shaken by the ordeal. I’m glad you’re safe. It’s good to know Sharla and Natsuki were there to help out. Do stay safe all of you. God bless 🙏
Oh nooo I'm so glad that you're OK and I hope some of the studio can be salvaged
Hope everything is fine now! Glad to know that you and everyone is alright
Maybe get the cat repaired Kintsugi style so it ends up with a cool golden 'scar' as a memento of its earthquake misadventure!
I'm sorry this happened Chris. I'm happy to see you, Sharla and Natsuki are safe and that you can be with friends right now, that's very important after going through something like this. I hope things get better soon. Stay safe! 💖
Felt something like this in The Philippines back in 2013.
this looks heartbreaking, i'm glad everybody is safe, hopefully you can get this sorted up without problem, stay safe there
That is so sad .....
Jesus, the moment you mentioned the studio I was terrified for you and then for the first time in a long time, I got actually emotional seeing something you had put so much effort into destroyed. Glad to see that you aren't letting this stop you, It's horrible this happened to you Chris, but it is truly wonderful that you are alright.
The most important thing is that you are okay. As long as you are here, the ramen shop can re-open, as long as you are here Abroad in Japan will exist. ❤️
I'm glad to see you're ok! Good luck with sorting everything out. It sucks but it is ''just stuff'' what matters is you and all your friends are safe. Je t'envoie tout plein d'ondes positives! :)
I am glad you are safe man
Gald you are okay. 🙂🙏 Stay safe
Does your place has insurance?
So does this mean the podcast is delayed? /S
It breaks my heart to see the damage caused to your studio, please be safe.
Oh, my heart breaks for the new studio, but so glad that you all are all right (and weren't there at the time). I hope you can keep your spirits high and rebuild stronger, and that you all continue to be safe.
I will increase my Patreon membership tier, the least thing I could do to support you in times like this 😞
I feel like fundraising would greatly help you with the studio. I know I would give some money to see it being redecorated!! And I'm sure I am not the only one :)
Glad that you are ok. Life and health are the most important and valuable things, and you have both. And about the earthquake, well, these things are beyond anyone's control and there is literally NOTHING anyone can do about it. It stinks... thing just comes unannounced and uninvited. Stay strong man, you and your loved ones around you.
Get some super glue and start gluing
Thanks for sharing, all the energy to get things back in their right way and on the right path again.
Glad you and yours are OK, at least!
Welp time to make the studio more earthquake proof then! Glad you're safe!
I'm so sorry Chris I really love that studio. I'm super happy you're safe.
Glad you're all ok.
I shared this video with my husband. 気をつけてください！
The earthquake sound gave me jitters coz I experienced that in Baguio City Philippines a long time ago... but that brought back super scary memories.. be safe
I hope Chris does a video on his 'casualties' from the earthquake.
take your time dude, glad your ok
Most importantly, everyone is safe. And I do hope you keep the maneki-neko ard, even in it's current form, or even glue it back together if you kept the rest of the pieces
It is terrific, i had never experienced earthquake in my life, but gives me goosebumps just looking at the video. Hope there are no casualties and aftermath.. and wish u and all speed recovery from nightmares..
This is heart breaking... glad you are safe. Things can be rebuilt, but we only have one Chris Broad. Take care!
glad ur fine man
I'm glad you and the gang are okay, I'm terribly sorry about your studio, hopefully things will get better
I experienced magnitude 7.8 quake once and it feels like the end of the world. absolutely terrifying. Stay safe, Chris.
I get terrified when a  3.0 hits but I live in west Texas where earthquakes shouldn’t be a thing… I can only imagine the horror of a 7.6 I’m glad you and your friends are all okay the videos look just terrifying just thank god you are safe and sound things can be replaced a life can’t. It still sucks fucking big time to see your studio wrecked.
Man those kaiju are getting moody.  Glad you're okay Chris,don't fret the material possessions,your well-being is what's important
Too much technical plates!
🙏🏽😭
Man, I'm glad you're safe. It is a real bummer about the new set. I hope you have some sort of insurance on the new set. Stay strong brother.
Did you get an emergency early warning text? Surely Japan has a seismic monitor system
I've been to Japan exactly when an earthquake hit. It was terrifying even out in the open. A 7.4 magnitude quake must be a real scare.
Look on the bright side Chrissy, now youve got the authentic post-earthquake ramen shop look going.
Time to kintsukuroi that maneki neko and make a video about the art of repairing with gold. Stay safe, Chris!
That flash looked like a nuke going off underwater. What normal earthquake doesn't build up and as if it would generate a flash. That's suspicious AF mate.
I'm really glad you're ohk! I'd be crushed if you never got to use the studio to its full potential, after just getting it all together! Stay strong and be safe Chirs!
Hope you have insurance
That’s awful! I hope everything is okay and everyone is safe, and I hope you can fix your studio Chris!
I'm so sorry Chris hope this never happens again :(
Glad that you were unharmed
I’m so glad you’re Ok Chris! I was so sad when I saw your studio, but it can always be rebuilt 💜 That’s definitely an area you want to have insurance and protection for your items/gear. Please earthquake proof your studio AND home. Aki made videos on preparedness, I bet she and Joey can help you out 😊 Have a small helmet in both locations to protect your head, and keep an eye on the news if they’re predicting more tremors or another earthquake possibility. Sometimes after a big one, others follow like a ripple effect.
Honestly terrifying. Glad you're all safe.
Just glad that you´re all okey and that the damage wasn´t worse.
Aww this is so sad , i almost had tears when i saw the studio and all your precious items broken. :( i hope you will be fine after this . this must be heart braking , we all know how much you love your new studio , so much work you put on this. Iam sending you good energy .
Chris, if you assess the value of the damage. Please start a gofundme page and we will all contribute with the restoration of the studio. This was your pride and joy! And we are so incredibly lucky to have a content creator like you around (for free even). I would be more than happy to help, and I bet more people would as well. Anyway, It's great knowing that you, Sharla and Natsuki are alive and well. It's great to see your friends helping out during such difficult times.
Glad everyone is safe. Silver lining is now you can buy plastic/rubber props that are less prone to breaking. Maybe try using plastic gloves when you clean so you lessen the chance of getting electrocuted. I’m also suprised the mirro at the front didn’t tople over.
Damn
Humour is how we brits get through shit like this so I'm glad you still gor your wit even if it may be false. Glad you had your besties with you too. Jokes aside though, if I've learned anything in my shitshow life it's disasters and traumatic experiences really do make us stronger and allow us to prevent further crap from happening to us. Its a long and arduous journey but at the end of the day, you're still here, you're okay and you have a fucking fantastic support circle on and off the internet who will help you out!   I never knew I was terrified of eartquakes until watching the vids on your discord. New thing learned I guess!
next time you are going to super-glue/duct-tape/screw literally everything that can be, down.
Hey Chris, have you considered having Kintsugi done on all those rice bowls?
Does your studio have security camera's? If yes, did they record the earthquake happening, or did the footage get damaged?
Glad you are safe!
Wow you got this up fast.  If I had just had that beautiful studio built and walked in to it looking like that, I would be sobbing.  It's really nice to see you still trying to be positive and chipper but it's totally ok to take a moment and mourn monetary loss.  Everyone was ok, and it will get better, but you have every right to feel upset right now.
Glad you're okay Chris! Devastated about the studio especially since you've only had it for a few months at this point.
Even for me who lives in a country that gets earthquake all the time and sits on the Ring of Fire, that earthquake you guys experienced is truly terrifying.
Wow, Chris. I'm so sorry about your studio.
Goddamn, bro. I'm just glad you and your friends are alright. Hope the rebuilding goes smoothly.
Fok! Glad you're safe... sorry your things got broken
Oh my gosh, I can tell that was an intense earthquake. Great to see the three of you together, safe, though 👍. What a scary evening and night it must have been :-( Sending greetings and all good wishes from Denmark
So glad everyone is ok! New things can be purchased but what matters is you’re all safe!
I'm just glad you guys are ok., the rest will be manageable.
Thank God you’re okay ❤️
glad you are all okay  and hope to see some more of your super  videos soon
Word sliding to shithole right now, but I wish more luck and prosperity
A earthquake is very terrifying, living in a country where is very normal like Japan to have earthquakes every time when happens I just get really scared and anxious, so I was very touched when I saw your video Chris. I hope you are well and even though some things get broken I'm really glad you are safe ✨  I send you lots of love and hopefully everything broken can be replaced because that studio was amazing!
This actually made me so sad knowing how much you cared about the studio😔 at least you are okay
I'm just glad you're all okay and unhurt.  As so many others reiterated, stuff can be replaced but you all can't.
Damn, i know that costed you a fuck tone to create, and with all the time and effort it took too - i’m so sorry man. That’s gotta suck on a new level.
I'm so glad you guys are alright. So sad seing the ramen props are demolished by the earthquake. Fingers crossed for the lights & other things to be fine!
Things like the Cat and Gachpon Machine can be fixed (if it was UK I'd even offer as it's kinda what I do) and messes can be cleared but the main thing is the very things that make the show what it is, you Guys, are all ok so hang in there and good luck with getting things back to normal.
Oh man, this really is horrible Chris. You really have my heartfelt my condolences back home in England. I hope you and everyone else is safe and unharmed.
😥 This is shocking to see but thank goodness you're safe!
Sweet guacamole things doesn't look good in Japan right now. Glad you're safe mate
You are all alive. That's all that matters. It's still difficult.  Stay safe.
It's horrible to see your studio like that, but I'm glad everyone is safe. The earthquake wasn't anything like that in Kanagawa of course, but I still got a bit nervous down here. That was the strongest and longest one I've experienced. I can't imagine what it must feel like to be near the center of one like that.
holy shit, stay safe Chris!
That was generally scary to see Chris, 😰 glad that you and everyone are safe that's the most important thing here.  Rest easy and be safe mate knowing your fans have your back!  Thanks for sharing this with us all.
Come on Chris you need a bucket 🪣
I am glad you are safe.
Happy you're all ok.
As someone affected by the recent flooding in Aus, yes mate, the water is the part there I'd be mostly concerned about. Looks like most of the damage is just... stuff, loose objects that never stood a chance, no matter how bolted down the shelves were. That's fine, not much you can do. But the water, that can soak in and cause damage you can't even see until it's a real problem, so get some air through there as best you can!
Not gonna lie seeing so much stuff destroyed i almost cried myself. Especially when I remember watching the first video where the studio was introduced. I was so amazed then. But as you said you and all friends being well os what matters most.
stay safe and strong chris
You've got to be kidding me... your new studio!! :( I hope you will be able to restore everything - and most important of all, you and your friends did not get hurt!
Thank god you are all safe and well. I feel bad about ur studio but are u sure the building is safe
Glad you are safe, hope the studio is repairable
Glad you're safe, Chris.
I'm so sad about the studio, but all that could be repaired and replaced over time. Thankfully you all are safe!
This is devastating. Chris, let us know how we can help! I'm actually sad about this.
Plottwist: This havoc wasn't caused by the earthquake, that is just what it normally looks like
Wy is everybody ignoring that light on 0:10 some aliens came to enjoy some manga in japan
So sorry Chris. Glad you're alright though
So glad to see that you guys are okay! I’m in Suginami, Tokyo, and even all the way over here the shaking was pretty scary. I can’t even imagine how bad it must have been in Sendai!
pls stay safe and be brave
Glad you're safe. Hoping the clean-up wasn't too painful. And hopefully you won't have to experience something like this, again, for a long time.
I am glad you are fine. Hope everything becomes normal as soon as possible
That's a real bummer, I'm glad you're okay and I hope getting things back together isn't too hard. Sad that a lot of things got wrecked but it is what it is.
I'm glad everyone is alright Chris, sorry about the shop :(
I'm glad you're safe and sound, Chris! It is still incredibly sad that the new and (very expensive) studio got wrecked so soon. Hopefully those Hollywood producers would still want to film there so you can get some cash back lol!
People saying you should have been more prepared are either Scouts or Girl Guides or don't live somewhere there's a constant awareness of potential seismic activity - there is only so much you can do, and other than making sure you know how to get fresh water and food if something happens, there really isn't much you can do against a big earthquake, and it isn't practical to rebuild your house so the cupboards don't open when it shakes or to glue your keepsakes to a shelf. You can only secure the most important things - other people.
Gonna need a lot of molten gold to fix all this.  So glad you're safe, Chris. <3
Glad everyone is ok!!
Alright calm down, Godzilla
:C
You got this up quick
I can hardly wrap my head around seeing everything shaking like that. I come from southwest florida in the US where we experience hurricanes somewhat regularly, but this seems on another level. Such a shame about your studio especially considering how new it is. Hopefully everything gets put back the way you like it soon and you can carry on with the amazing content both in and outside of the ramen shop. Best wishes!
take care chris !
Fucking hell...I'm so glad you're all okay!!! On the brightside, all that water makes the set look more authentic.
Glad your safe
Very glad that you, Sharla, and Natsuki are all okay!!!
Glad you're OK Chris. Moved to Tokyo about a year ago and this was quite jarring to me too.
Things can be repaired or replaced, but at least you're safe.
Glad to know you're all right. The studio will return even better, I'm sure.
Sorry to see your studio damaged. The items are at least  replaceable. But you are not! Very happy to see you are alright and Sharla and Natsuki as well. Friends help to get by tough times. Saw the news report at work yesterday here in Los Angeles. Prayer's 🙏 to you.
It takes a special kind of person to experience something so shocking and while being on the way to see how a lifedream of his survived a catastrophe open up with an educational fact about Japan.  Best of luck rebuilding your studio and in general!
Sad to see your studio in that state 😢 but more important is that you and everyone else is safe!
I'm sitting here wishing I could help you clean up and put things back together. Good luck mate, we're all rooting for you.
Glad you are safe!
I'm glad you're safe!
1:46 noooo not maneki neko! Chris loves cats!!  You will rebuild - don't worry!
I recommend you making a Kintsugi(金継ぎ) video of broken plates and manekineko. You can fix and make them even more beautiful using gold.
Glad you guys are ok. Sorry about the studio Chris.
It feels hard to hit "like" on a video like this, because it's heartbreaking to see the studio in pieces >_< Hopefully the water issue can be solved though D: Sending you a lot of love and strength. ♥
I'd put the ceramic cat in a framed box or something with a label of the date, could be a cool thing to display even if broken, as a sort of earthquake souvenir
So glad you were all alright!
Really hope your able to get everything sorted and feeling normal again as soon as possible. Best wishes
Glad you were not in the studio when it happened... Stay safe Chris!
I am glad that you are okay! I hope that everything recovers quickly for you!
Feel very bad when nature hits nations that truly care for them.
Whoa! I hope everyone is okay. I'd be in shock and scared too!! Wishing everyone well.
Glad y’all are ok. I hope you didn’t loose anything extra precious.
Really sorry about the damage but I'm very glad you guys are alright!
😭
This is truly upsetting. This channel has been one of the few channels I use to escape when I've had a rough day or when I just feel like I need a laugh. I hope that there is a way we can help you out as much as you have us over the years.
I'm sorry this happened! Glad you're okay. I took a screen cap of the luck cat and reverse image searched it. I found they are hand painted and won't ever be exactly the same. Wayfair sells them under the name "Allbright Japanese Luck and Fortune Charm Beckoning Cat Maneki Neko Money Bank Ceramic Figurine" If it isn't too painful, your existing luck charm may be left out to represent the good fortune it had brought you in the end. Thank you, charm cat. Thank you. 😽
Sooo glad you are okay Stay safe there God bless  Prayers from here
Oh no Chris!!! Your beautiful set! I am sooo sorry but I am glad you are safe and sound!
Stay safe and stay strong. I’m rooting for you.
Glad you guys are ok!
That studio was so dope may it rest in peace 🙏
So sad to see man.
Stay safe man. Hopefully the set gets fixed completely in no time!
Glad you guys are okay.  Prayers out to you!
I just experienced my first earthquake last year, they're pretty rare here in Australia.  Where I was the shaking wasn't too strong but it was strong enough to send me running for a doorway haha
On that note, how about a video on earthquake preparedness?? You know, Dos and Don'ts and what goes into an emergency bag.
it's a bit unfortunate for the studio but really glad you're doing fine Chris! Hope everything will be ok!
Hopefully , there won't be no tsunami after even if earthquake are prevalent in Japan. Time for an earthquake proof RAMEN Shop.
Glad to see you're safe and alright! Hope you and everyone else affected make a speedy recovery 🙏
Absolutely terrifying to see, I cannot imagine experiencing that in real time. I felt and heard a small quake on Vancouver island once it was so scary. Hope everyone is ok.
Glad that you are well. Speedy studio recover and all the best
So heartwarming to see friends come together to help with the studio in any capacity...after a shared terrifying experience.
least you guys are safe though Chris that's the most part... you can replace stuff and renovate and fix things, but health is more important mate! Fucking insane i saw some of the videos of the quakes, bloody rediculas like...
Glad you're doing well, man! Thanks for keeping us updated on your situation.
Glad you are all OK!
Hope its all okay ❤️
Stay safe Chris! Your ramen shop will be up and running again soon 🙏✨. Stay safe in the aftershock Japan ❤️
4:20 that is an interesting sticker you have there.. LMAO
Fuck i realy hope ewhreting is god stay safe 😍😇
Genuinely sorry for you Chris, leave the cat as a symbol.
I hope everyone is okay!!
Glad you're alright. It's devastating to see how severe this earthquake was and what a mess your studio is currently. Good luck and I hope that everything gets better for you
That fault has a nasty habit of generating huge shocks right around the anniversary of the 3/11 quake. I hope you stay safe from the aftershocks and bounce back quickly from the damage and trauma caused by this event. The studio can be replaced, you can't.
Good to see at least you're safe Chris, and aside from the water the studio didn't suffer any structural damage. Sad to see a lot of the decorations and stuff broke but it could have been much worse.
Even in Tokyo this earthquake was very scary. Cannot imagine how it was like at your place Chris...
Geez that was massive!!!!
I'm so sorry Chris that sucks, I will say I was extremely surprised that vertical mirror was still standing of all things I would have thought that thing would hit the ground first
Glad you are letting us know you are doing OK considering the chaos. I wonder how your friends are doing?
I hope you didn't throw that manekineko away yet. You can fix that with kintsugi (金継ぎ). That japanese ceramic fixing hobby. Could ba a nice video.
Absolutely gutted for you, thankfully it wasnt the entirety of the studio. It sucks to see it all smashed up, knowing how proud and happy you were of it. I hope it's not too expensive to replace and repair, thinking of you!
That must have been absolutely terrifying. Im so sorry about the studio  Chris but im glad that everyone is okay. Sending love from Costa Rica.
I'm glad that you guys are ok (don't know anyone in Tohoku, so the three of you and Ryotaro are the first to come to mind when there's something in that area). This one was scary.
Glad to hear Chris is good, hopefully the Trash Taste crew faired just as well... Oh god they have a lot of expensive figures on those studio shelves. 0_0
It's sad but hey, so long you're safe, you can build it again. Best wishes!
I mean, do you need help cleaning up lmao? I've been through worse in Japan and would be glad to help?
Hope your doing fine and there is no damage to your building 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Glad to hear that you are alright! I hope that everything goes well. Water leaks are something that needs to check. Maybe you can do document or do repair video where studio is fixed little by little and reconstruction is shown.
At least you have friends that would come help you
hope you can go back up from the rubble man literally
😮
It is good to know that you all are safe. Honestly, when it happened last night and Sendai area was reported near epi-centre, the first thing that crossed my mind was you and your channel. I am in Tokyo but it was still horrifying for me. I can only imagine what people in Miyagi experienced.
This sucks but I'm *so* thankful you weren't in there during the earthquake.
I heard about the earthquake, but didn't know how strong it was.. dayum.. that's fcked up :(
Glad your ok, and weren’t there when the earthquake was happening. Hopefully everything will be ok 👍🏻
I can definitely see how this could have gone so much worse and I'm really glad it didn't.. Nature really do be out to get us these days 😰
With some clean up and checking for faults and then tiding up a bit you should more or less be back on track again. And to be fair, the studio already has a vibe of having been through an earthquake or two before, so having it go through an actual one might just add character to it.  Though, doesn't stop it from being a massive inconvenience.
I can relate since I lived in Indonesia, earthquake life
Glad you and everyone are safe. Sorry to see what it did to your amazing studio. Hopefully you can get it fixed up soon.
Glad your ok chris your studio just looked  like one of your mad parties  lol
I`m so glad you weren`t in the studio when it happened Chris and that you`re all safe. Stay sharp though, they said there might be another big one within the next week.
It's good to see you're alright. And the damage to your studio not being catastrophic. We had a bit of a jolt down here in Ueno as well, with a little bit of lights flickering just before the quake. And friend of mine over in Osaka even felt a slight rumble. For a "mere" 7.3 magnitude this was quite severe.
in a much more lighter note, maybe its time for a studio redesign? make the most out of the situation?  I know it costed like a LOAD of money but it could be an opportunity, Chris. Retain a bunch and put in some new ones (maybe make a video off it too).
Stay safe Chris and looking forward for the rebuilding of the studio
Glad to see you are okay Chris, Sharla and Natsuki too, Such a shame about the studio getting thrown around so much but like you said, It was definately a good thing nobody was in there with all the glass and the wall that fell, Hopefully there isn't any damage to the electronics and the set itself from the water, Hopefully the team that built the set will be able to find replacements for the broken pots and stuff, The best I can say is that the things that didn't get damaged will hold the story that they made it through the biggest earthquake in a long while I hope everyone else is safe and well that lives in Japan, Hopefully Natsuki didn't have any damage in the shop and Sharla at home and the studio Stay safe out there wherever you are, be aware of places to take shelter and take care of falling objects just in case I hope everyone is well and your week gets better, Be safe and Take care out there wherever you are (^=W=^)
I wonder how China will survive with their tofu buildings if they and an earthquake
It’s a scary event but I’m surprised you were traumatized when the you simply told a nuclear weapon from North Korea heading towards you to Fuck off a few years back.
Glad you and your friends are alright.. praying that there won't be anymore big aftershocks🙏🏻
Glad to see everyone is doing alright 🙏
I'm so sorry this happened to your new studio Chris! I'm so so sorry, I love your studio and it's such a shame this happened. I'm glad you're ok and can get everything replaced and back to normal soon!
now he has new set it called after disaster ramen shop
Thanks captain hindsight
Sad to see the studio being damaged, but very glad you are all safe!!
heard the news 30mins when it happened, contacted my friends there. its scary when u hear this from the other side of the world.
Although this breaks my heart since the set was so new and authentic looking and artistic, I know this can be repaired. I'm glad that the damage isn't more than it is. And of course, thankfully no one was hurt. 💖
I'm glad you are okay 😊 I hope lights work 😌
Need a mop and broom mate
Omg, so sorry this happened. But glad you're fine. Keen to hear about the studio rebuild process when everything has settled down.
glad you guys are okay. hopefully its all easy enough to fix and replace
It just breaks my heart to see the brand new studio trashed like this :( At the end of the day tho, the most important thing is that you're all doing well. Items are just items, they can be replaced, but you guys can't
I'm so sorry Chris! This is awful! I think your audience knew and felt how much you were really proud of the studio. Maybe you should start a fundraiser, I would gladly contribute and help in any way possible. But we are so glad you're safe, please take care! ♥
Good to know you made it through...Hope you figured out the water leak.  Grew up in Alaska, so I had to deal with Earthquakes a lot.  They aren't fun.
Wow, you guys got hit hard down there. We got shook up pretty good in Aomori too, but it was nothing like this. I'm glad you guys are safe at least. Best of luck on the cleanup, and hopefully we don't get another one like this any time soon
fuck me, the state of the studio pains me to see... all the best luck getting everything back together and most importantly stay safe
This wasn't easy to watch The studio had some many memories attached to it , was so beautiful and now look at it scattered, destroyed. Hope the studio would be back lively so that we can enjoy more livestreams.
0:10 What was that flash?
I’m so sorry. I’m glad your all ok….. which is most important.
Glad to see that the damage on the studio was fairly limited, although I still feel sorry for the maneki neko, all the crookery in the ramen shop and the gatchapon machine. Hope the water damage was easy to repair as well.  You must have felt absolutely nerve wracked before opening the studio door! Does Japanese insurance cover earthquake damages?
i would cry if i came back to my place looking like this, super glad you guys are all ok! i'm sure you will be on your feet in no time
really glad you're safe!! Okinawa had a 6.0 a few weeks ago and scared the crap out of me
I was watching a Live stream from Japan when it happened. Looked really crazy, all i could think was hope all my fav Japan youtubers are okay.
That mess seems like absolute hell to deal with, glad you're safe Chris.
Hello Chris. Glad to know that your okay. About ur set I remember seeing the set designers using a lot of wood to construct it. The water could be a big problem if the wood isnt waterproofed or treated for fungal growth so itd be a good idea to get it checked asap before it decays. Hope it all turns out well! Theres no bad without good! #yinyang
That has to be one of the most terrifying things to go through… So glad that you are alright.  ❤️
Seeing what happened to the studio is heartbreaking, but the important thing is you're all safe! Repairs are probably not gonna be cheap but I hope the set recovers soon.
Ahhhh stay saaafe! Upping the comments so you can pay for the damage quicker
Ya it was nuts life goes on.  18 1/2 years here.  Nothing new.  But my apartment barley felt in. Was in shinjuku.
That's a shame. Your studio was great. Hopefully your insurance will cover it. At least you're safe.
Oh this is so upsetting to see all that work destroyed . 😓 glad to hear everyone is ok that’s the main thing ❤️
I'm just happy you are safe.
Glad to see you safe, Chris!
I would faint and die bruh
Oh dear that is very heartbroken and thank goodness you are alright 😢😱
I figured your office was connected to an apartment and you were living there. A 7.4 is a powerful quake. It could have been much worse. I’m glad you’re all right. Too bad about the loss of many decorative items, but at least the studio is still intact. Prayers and the best of wishes.
Note: take everything off the wall every day and box it up. It's a pain but better than this.
Aw,Im really sorry. Thats horrible!
❤️
Was worried about all of you! Glad you are OK!!!!!!!!!!
glad your okay and for a bit of a laugh I'm glad the trash taste picture is okay too.
Holy shit man. Best of the luck mate
Best wishes from the US! Keep safe and take care
With all that water throughout the studio, perhaps it's time to branch out into Afloat in Japan? :P  Glad you're OK.  Who else should I get my fake ramen shop interior from, if you weren't?!  :'(  Also, I am not convinced those last 10 seconds were an aftershock. I think you were just channeling your inner anime protagonist, over the death of your beloved kitty cat. :D  Seriously though, glad you're safe. I only just heard about the earthquake through your video, and I have never had to experience one for myself before.
Damn
I really hope the expenses from the damages aren't too high.I also hope production wouldn't be halted for too long.Thank god you're fine.
Glad you’re okay!
Dammit. This was hard to watch. I hope you guys are able to find joy any way you came despite this
glad to hear you and the others are ok chris
You and your studio were the first thing I thought about when I heard about the earthquake. Most of all I'm relieved to see that you're okay but what a shame about the studio damage, the little details really make it but at least the main components came through intact. I suppose if there is any bright side to the damage you have the opportunity to buy your own decorations and do it however you want.
A shakey start but you recovered in the end
What was that light at 00:10?
Glad to see you're all safe, and that's what the thumbs up is for! I will join the Patreon for a little while, hoping the money will help replace the broken items in your lovely studio <3
holy heck :( hope all of you are okay! sorry to hear about your maneki neko, hopefully you can find another that you like just as much and good luck replacing everything, hopefully insurance might help!
Hope its a going to go well with the cleanup and best wishes
I'm glad you are okay man!  Hope everyone else that publish to YouTube are as good too!
And then there was Connor singing karaoke without a care in the world 😂
DEAR GOD 🙏
I hope one of those bowls become a kintsugi project!
I'm so sorry to see this Chris. Is this stuff insured? How does it work when some big damage like this happens?  Hope you can get around this soon and glad you were not there when it happened.
You already posted a video? Wtheck the grind doesn't stop... Glad you're okay mate
Time to learn kintsugi
kintsugi being Japanese is no coincidence 😔
Shit dude.   Just glad you are all OK
holy shit.   Glad everyone is safe
Just glad you're okay chris!
stay Safe mate
Glad u all are safe. Good luck getting back up and running.
Damn, that sounds terrifying. Glad everyone was okay and the damage was and the damage was not too bad!
glad that you're safe
I hope everything is okay man. I hope everything get back to normal.
Chris is the Cinderella we didn't know we needed. :-) Really glad everyone is OK. I remember you mentioning months ago how this building wouldn't be very euh... good experience during an earthquake. So really glad you are safe.  From what I heard Conner was screaming (well 'singing' at Karaoke).
I hope everything becomes well
So sorry about your studio, Chris. But at least you are safe and sound. Please take care x
Huge sad. Huge sad.
I'm glad you are ok Chris! Although cleaning up the studio must be a pain in the ass, you will get everything back to normal in no time!
you're slowly starting to look like carlo ancelotti mate
I really hope this doesn't effect business in your ramen shop lol but in all seriousness I do hope you're able to get things looking as nice as it was originally maybe now you could look at trying to find the most out of place items in gift shops across japan for your studio and slowly make up for the broken items you've lost in this earthquake.
Thankfully it's just little objects and you also have a lot of footage of the studio so you can replicate it to how it was originally if you want. Most importantly though, I'm glad you're okay physically. Must've been terrifying at the moment.
Well I can say is that I am glad that you and your friends are all alright.
you can glue the cat easy
As unfortunate as the damage is to the studio, glad that you're alright!   On the bright side, all the more reason to do some outdoor videos! Best of luck
Glad you're all safe ❤️
That sucks your studio got wrecked but I’m happy you, Sharla & Natsuki are unharmed.  Stay safe Dave, we love y’all.
Stay Strong Chris!
It’s sad but you can now kintusgi a lot of the things in the studio and give them a history. As the French people say, courage
not again XD DX
Oh dear. Your poor Ramen shop! I'm sure your production company would be willing to point you in the right direction for replacement items. At least nothing irreplaceable was lost.
that earthquake is strong good thing tsunami didnt happen living with in the pacific ring of fire is dangerous especially in our country we also have earthquake
Glad you're alright. Stay safe out there
Absolutely terrifying! Glad to see you and everyone are safe and sound!
Thank you for sharing your experience. I really hope everyone try to live in Japan prepare natural disaster.
so scary. so glad you’re okay though, and that the studio is mostly intact!
Holy Fuuuuuu.....  I live in California and have experienced a few shakes like that coming from a town built dead center on the san Andreas fault line and I feel for you.  Of all natural disasters I think earthquakes are the most terrifying.  They come out of nowhere and just destroy everything.
Glad you all are safe, and best of luck on getting everything situated and the water leak repaired!
I live in the Kansai region.... didn't feel a THING.  BUT HOPE YOU RECOVER QUICK CHRIS!  #NobodyLikesEarthquake
Holy shit Chris, am so glad your ok! Aww your new studio... 😔. Am sure it you will get it back to normal in no time! ❤️🇯🇵
From one Chris in Japan from the UK to another Chris in Japan from the UK, I'm glad you're okay. I'm sure the studio will look as good as new soon. 👍
Damn.. Out of all the YouTubers that I have seen, watched their content, or even been a fan of, Chris Broad always seemed like a genuinely  good dude. A lot of his stuff always has a very positive message and the overall vibe that I get from watching this channel for a good while now is that he isn't just in it for the likes. He has made more than a few videos now that gave me a real feeling like if I put my mind to anything, regardless of how impossible it may seem, that I could achieve any goal. I'm sure that Chris will weather this storm. but my heart truly goes out to you man.
as bad as it looks, your studio actually looks a lot more like an alley lol.  glad youre safe tho
Keep Your Head up Chris, I'm sorry to see your studio messed up, I know how much effort and work you put into making it the Kreative space that it is. You will rebuild it better :)... Stay Safe and have some 🐔
About the 12 second mark when you go to the scene of the airport you can see something come down from the sky right before the explosion that is really interesting.
Glad your doing good Chris! Happy Paddy's Day from Ireland 🍀btw...   I know it's not much, but at least everyone is safe pal... Things can be rebuilt 💪...   Looking forward to more great content pal
I’m glad you’re all safe.. Take care!
Glue!
This is so heartbreaking Chris. Glad you're alright. Keep fighting my man.
Thought of you guys as soon as I found out about the earthquake. I'm very thankful you guys are safe. We're with you. Stay safe.
Hope you stay safe
Ouch. So sorry, glad you're safe. I was in one in southern Rwanda in 2008. It was only an aftershock, but it brought down the roof of the hotel opposite. I remember waking at 4 a.m. to a dog barking, then being shaken like a rag doll. We get earthquakes here because we are near Nyiragongo Volcano (seriously, that is too much volcano), but it has always been gentle before. This was extreme, and there was no way for me to leave the building safely. I was lying there wondering if I should get in the doorway, get under the bed... eventually, I just thought F* it and lay there hoping for the best. Even today, and even in the UK where I know I'm perfectly safe, if a lorry rumbles past, I'm like a meerkat. I don't think you ever lose that. But glad it's only replaceable  things that are broken.
I am very glad that you are ok. I hope everyone there is ok 🙏
Chris is safe, his friends and colleagues are safe and the damage was, all things considered, minimal. Here’s hoping the rest of the year will be kinder to Japan. Last thing they (or anyone) needs is more costs in a frágil economy following two years of Covid-19 and now a war....  Thank you for the update Chris. Stay safe. ❤️  PS: How did Natsuki’s hair sallon do?
Glad you and everyone is ok!
Will you keep the smashed manekineko?
Glad you’re okay!
Thankfully you guys are all right but truly sometime we forget what nature is capable of also the studio set was doing good for a earthquake like that it's show's the quality of the craft!!
Luckily the maneki neko still has its head quite intact :)
Glad that you guys are ok. Hope you can solve the water problems soon and everything go back to normal. Be safe!
Really sad to see what happened to the studio you worked so hard on, but on the bright side no one was hurt and you can always rebuild it. Glad to see you safe mate, hope everyone else is doing okay.
Don't worry, a little bit of repair will bring your studio back to life. I'm glad that you're okay.
Aww so sorry about the studio, how sad 😥 glad sharla and natsuki there to help you out, what fabulous friends  x
Awesome job bro
Glad you're okay dawg, and sorry stuff got messed up.  :(
0:04 not the anime figures
I'm so sorry, Chris.  I'm glad you and yours are safe, and I wish you luck in your rebuilding.
Glad you're alright Chris. Stay safe
Sad for the studio, But Glad that you are OK!
Hey Chris, glad you're okay! I live in the chūbu region, we weren't really affected luckily.
I'm so sorry, Chris. Very glad you, Sharla and Natsuki are okay. You can get through this! 💪
The best thing is that you’re still ok. Although a pain in the arse, the things in your studio can be fixed and replaced! Glad you’re ok.
As a Chilean who lives this kind of experience more than i would like its scary as hell. Everytime. Glad you are ok!
That's awful Chris mate. Obviously relieved no injuries sustained, but your poor studio...I hope all Japanese viewers are safe and well 🙏
So sorry about the damage but so relieved you guys are ok.
I almost shed a tear, hope you the best
Damn! Truly sorry to see the state of your headquarters.
Sorry that happened to you studio! Yes be careful of aftershocks! Hope you can fix everything and make it sturdier for next time.
Damn, glad you are alright
Oh so that's the green screen where you shot your Mt Fuji thing
I'm glad that you and everyone else are okay though Chris. Wishing you the best, and remember you've still got us to back you up.
The main thing is everyone is safe and sound and luckily the damage doesn’t look too devastating. On the bright side, the earthquake did give you this video idea!
You're going to receive so many maneki neko. 😂 Genuinely glad you're alright. Earthquakes are a special kind of terrifying and I can't imagine being in one of that magnitude.
Glad you guys are alright up there!!
I am glad everyone is safe. Stuff can be replaced at least, however painful.
Hope everything okay. Bless you
Have my big fat F
You're going to receive so many maneki neko. 😂 Genuinely glad you're alright. Earthquakes are a special kind of terrifying and I can't imagine being in one of that magnitude.
The most important thing is your safeti, im realy glas your fine, the studio can ve rebuild and much better ❤️❤️
An indestructible version of china should be called Nipon...
Is Japan one of the worse places for earthquakes?
Thank you for posting an update Chris, glad you and the team are ok.
I went through Hurricane Ida recently (Louisiana), and I know exactly what you mean by "I've never experienced one that bad". That's a terrifying feeling. Sure the most important thing is that y'all are all ok, but it's still traumatic and heart breaking to see so much broken, especially when it's your own things. I'm glad you're ok, though.  ❤️
Abroad in a mess :(
I'm glad you're safe! I hope the set gets sorted soon! Keep your chin up :)
This made me so sad... But I'm REALLY glad you are safe! Sucks that things are broken, but at least a thing you can replace <3 Hope the damages are not too much
Studio will be as good as it was before but Chris Broad isn't replaceable. Really glad you were alright Chris earthquakes are really scary but it's really great you are fine.
Those videos in the beginning are terrifying. You must feel so helpless during an earthquake of that magnitude. I'm beyond relieved to see all of my favorite Japantubers are okay, despite the damage your "ramen shop" took. Best wishes Chris, stay safe and be cautious!  Time to earthquake proof the studio!
Im so sorry for the damages. I hope insurance can cover the damages.
Glad you're alright. Wishing you a speedy return to normal. You're great at what you do and I wish nothing but good fortune to come after this terrible day.
Glad that you're fine mate! You can always replace the broken stuff.
would have been cool to see some "before" pictures
I lived in l.a. for 12 years had plenty of earthquakes that didn't really bother me and was a bit of a novelty, but then we had a 6.7 and that really scared the crap out of me, was  really violent shaking of a kind I never felt before so I kind of know how you feel, but I'm sure 7.3 was even more frightening.
0:10  Almost looks like something fell out of the sky and hit the earth. Crazy
Glad you are okay physically, maybe time to brush up on that wabi -sabi inspiration from your teaching interview and piece together the Maneki Neko as a memento of the day the abroadinjapan studio survived an earthquake?
it's quite crazy that in Indonesia also had a 5.5 Richter earthquake at 10 a.m GMT+7 (about 12.00 Japan time... quite surprised myself as i was working), and about 9 hours later Japan hit by 7.3 Richter earthquake. Mother Earth is a bit pissed off these days, isn't she?
You had several pots and you use plasticpack ::::)
Glad you're safe Chris! Heartbroken to see the damage to the studio, knowing this was your baby.
When I saw the title the first thing I thought was, is the set alright.  So sad about it. Hope things get better for you chris.
Man i really feel like we've been playing Jumanji since 2012.
So sorry to see the damage to such a beautiful studio but also thankful that everyone is safe and alright. Best wishes for a speedy rebuild and repair <3
Glad all your friends are ok, hopefully. Maybe you can glue the cat sculpture back together as it means so much?
Hugs Chris, glad you had Sharla and Natsuki with you for support.
Glad you ok chris
It's sad to see the amazing studio being destroyed like that but the most important part is that you are all safe.
Holy shit, that footage of the event was no joke, that is damn scary.
I pressed "like" for the video, but I dislike that happened. Glad you are safe, Chris!
Most important thing is that you're safe. Property can be rebuilt, but lives are one-off.
Nothing irreparable or to expensive to repair hopefully. 7s are no joke. The jump from a 6 to a 7 is pretty surprising to the point I wonder if the Richter scale is broken. Coming from California I’ve experienced more than a few 5+ strength earthquakes but that damage is something else.
seeing all that broken ceramic broke my heart a little
Glad to hear that you're all good Chris.  Plates and cups can be replaced.  Abroad in Japan can't.
This makes me so sad! I really hope that you can be up and running again soon. Did you get the water shut off?
There's a lot of broken stuff. I'm worried about your feetsies in those flimsy spippers T^T
Material damage can be repaired or bought new. Most important is that nobody was harmed and that you are all well. My thoughts go to all people who lost someone loved in fukushima or elsewhere in Japan.
My condolences, I'm surprised the building of your studio is still standing, because I vividly remember that you've mentioned the building is pretty old I hope you are doing okay!
Oh fuck
like every1 Glad your oke Chris.
I wish you good health and great insurance Chris!
Take Care to all the Abroad in Japan family.  I'm glad you are all safe!
what happened to the office sucks a lot man but glad you're all safe !
Glad your alright, and wishing you well with the studio refurbishment!
:(
I'm glad you're all right, Chris. Stay safe!
It's good that you all are safe.
Glad you're ok Chris!
My god glad your ok Chris
Glad you are safe.
It’s crazy how on your last video you was talking about the last earthquake and then this happened
Man, I'm just glad you're okay. Best of luck rebuilding the studio, I'm sure it will be back to all of its glory.
How 'bout some Wabisabi for the cat figuere?
I'm thankful to you see you are alright Chris I was keeping myself updated with Natsuki's Instagram stories and Ryotaro's and Your tweets but I'm sorry to see what happened to the studio I'm sending prayers your way!
Happy to see that you are all safe. It's a bummer for the decoration, but they can be bought. How can I donate?
You have some tidying to do
I'm just glad all of you are well. That manekineko can remain as a memento of all of this.
So happy you're okay
Glad you are okay Chris!!
0:11 Chris powering up when he's told there's now more fried chicken
Good to see ur alright there chris, stay safe and be extra careful
I think it's a testament to those carpenters who built the set that there wasn't more drastic structural damage. Other than the knick-knacks and loose items, it seems most of the actual main structures remained relatively unscathed. Glad you're all okay~
Glad you're safe! I will buy you a new good luck cat 😺
Stay safe.
I'm so glad you were safe! I hope that you can get the shop back up and running. Lots of love from Canada.
Glad you guys are okay despite all that
ah fu*k :(
At least there wasn't the devastating tsunami like in 2011.
I’m ok with going back to the old school Chris in his apartment vlog while the studio gets fixed.
Ho. Ly. Shit. Hope you and your friends, and everyone else affected by this attack of nature bounce back in quick time.
My prayer goes to all of you out there in Japan, The last part of the video was scary. To know that you all are safe and sound brings me ease.
I was thinking of all of you guys… glad you’re all safe.
Just stay safe... You and your friends and family... ❤️
first of, thank goodness that you are safe!  is there any insurance that is gonna cover up the damage that's been made through the earthquake? much love and pray from switzerland!
First the demon rock splits, then a 7.4 quake....... have the Oni started attacking again? ... Glad you and all the crew are safe
667th comment
Cliffhanger from hell. I’m so glad you’re all alright. I didn’t even realize it had happened till I noticed sharlas tweets today. Hope the water was a simple fix 🥺
That must be scary.  My city had an earthquake of... 3.8... last week.  Didn't wake me up.  7.4 must be truly scary.  Hopefully the studio will be back up and running very soon!
Nooo! Not the Cup Ramen steamer!!!  ...in a much more serious note though. Glad to see You, Sharla and Natsuki are safe! Here's to you bouncing back soon! All the best Chris!
Good to know you're ok!
Omfg
Glad your Safe Chris,  Glad that you are already calling someone Babe 💪🍻
This is so sad. I'm watching this at work and my manager recently started following you and hadn't saw this video yet. I'm glad you're safe, all the stuff can be replaced, but you and the team cannot.
I thought Japan's eartquakes were like Chile's. But if you said on the last 10 years there was only one above 7.4, thats way less than we had. Chile got five earthquakes 7,4+ on the last 10 years, two of those above 8.0
Everything materialistic will eventually come back Chris. I'm just very glad that YOU are fine together with Sharla and Natsuki. As your viewers we can at least give you more views and likes in your videos to support you in rebuilding.
I am really glad your safe, I'm sure you can build the studio back and I hope everything gets fixed up alright. Always a supporter and fan!😀⛩
Soo good to see you're alright Chris! It's a bit sad what happened with the studio, but what's most important is that you and your friends are okay! Also I don't remember what it's called but you should send some of the porcelain stuff away to somewhere where they piece it back together with that golden glue stuff so you can keep it as memorabilia of having survived a 7.4 magnitude earthquake! :) Stay safe and keep up the good work! :D
It breaks my heart to see the condition of the studio.
as soon as i saw it, i was wondering how you are. stay safe
I am so sorry. What a mess. But, messes can be fixed. You are safe, which is all that matters.
We had a small earthquake yesterday and I live on a huge fault line, so watching this is scary as hell. I’m so glad you’re safe. I’m so sorry the studio took such a hit, it was sad seeing your stuff all smashed and flooded.
All the best Chris. I'm really happy you showed this to us, it gives a bit of a bigger picture. It's good taht your friends are with you! Also, wth was that on the end of the video?!
Hindsight is always 20/20, Chris.  Don't dwell on things you didn't think of before the quake. Just think positive and think of moving forward.
So glad you're safe and well Chris, that's the main thing. Things like this can put things into perspective - its a crazy world and anything can happen at any moment so I just want to thank you for the creative inspiration you gave me before going to Japan. I was visiting places I had seen in your videos and thinking "thank god for Abroad in Japan" the whole time because I felt I had a connection to the places before I even got there. My photography was much better for it so I appreciate your videos a lot for helping me there and in general creating a really strong love of Japan. Sendai is definitely on my list to visit soon. Stay safe legend - an Aussie fan
Chris, you're one of my favorite content creators. I've been following you for years. Do you plan on setting up any sort of GoFundMe?
All things considered, I'm glad this earthquake didn't make more casualties than it did. Sorry for your studio, man - I'm sure it had a special place in your heart but I'm happy you are all okay. Take care.
I hate this for you Chris. Much love to you! I'm sure your ramen shop will be in tip-top shape once again.
So scary! Glad you guys are OK. Sorry about the damage!
Please keep the broken Neko in the shop somewhere. Reminder of mortality and what you have and all that.
"Always enjoy the little moments in life and dont let the negative things impact you the most;)"  My whole life in a nutshell: 2:27
damn eren did this..
Fortunately you guys didn't get hurt. Everything will be ok with time!
Honestly when i saw on youtube that you had a massive earthquake i never expected it to be that scary, i'm glad you're ok and hopefully the studio will be back into good shape soon
Wow - I didn't realize it was that bad!  I was in Tokyo years ago for one that woke me up in the middle of the night.  I think it was the New Otani, so an older building.  I didn't know what to do other than just ride it out.  This looks MUCH stronger - I would not have been very happy about that at all.  The Metro ran on time the next morning.  :)
That sucks.  I hope the insurance pays up without too much hassle.
I have experience a 7.9 earthquake, it's really feel different, like the ground gonna crack or something
Thankfully you're alright and your studio is still somewhat intact.
I've experienced two earthquakes where I live here in the Philippines and they weren't as strong as that one. I'd be so scared because buildings aren't up to code here.
I hope the casualties in the hit area are minimum
Hi Chris So sorry to see your studio like that after all the hard work you have put in to it, Important thing is you and your friends are safe and well. All the best take care
Happy you and everyone are safe Chris!
OMG Chris! Wow that's so scary. Thank God you weren't in the studio at the time and that you're OK. Bit of a clean-up ahead, but it could have been much worse. Glad you're safe! ❤
Damn. You can replace what was broken but, you cant replace you.
That aftershock is honestly terrifying :(
Glad you hear that you're safe and the studio wasn't completely destroyed. That would have been so scary to experience. Fingers crossed the aftershocks calm down soon and clean up goes alright.
Really glad you guys are okay!
Damn, that looks so scary
It really brought tears to my eyes to see your studio in such a state but I'm glad that you and your friends are safe and well.  Things can be replaced and I'm sure the studio will be back in order soon.  Stay safe!
Take care Chris
Hi, I am glad that you are all okay.
Glad to see you guys are OK.
hope everyone are okay! stay safe Chris, that was really scary
at 0:09 what is that big flash of light in the background???
Wow. I didn't even know this happened until you posted this video with all the stuff going on about Ukraine! Thanks for sharing this with us! <3
I hope you're all doing okay, and you can get the studio back up and running soon! 🙏
I have only witnessed a small earthquake in Sweden. So I can't imagine what it felt like. Hope you get on your feet soon. All the love to you Chris and your friends.
I’m glad you are safe! Knowing your tenacity and motivation you will be up and running making great vids again in your awesome ramen shop in no time. Keep keeping on and being you.
今回の地震は本当に怖かったですね…。 物が落ちたり壊れたりはしていますが無事そうで良かったです。
The airport footage is most probably the scariest for me. Also your community post was concerning too. Glad your safe Chris.
Aaaw man, if here in Tokyo was scary I can't imagine what you went through. I'm glad that you are safe tho.
I'm so glad you are all alright! So sad about the studio. Mucho ánimo.
Really glad you are OK, hopefully no other earthquakes of this intensity happen any time soon!
Lets move your studio to a safer building! Start a kickstarter!
AYO WTF?!
昨日のはかなり大きくて怖かった。 地震に慣れてる日本人でもさすがにビビる。
Glad you're alright dude!
Hope you're ok Chris I've experienced a magnitude 7 earthquake before I know how terrifying it could be stay safe.
sorry man, but you and everyone are ok and thats what matters, everything else can be fixed or replaced
Oh man. DX That must’ve been a harrowing experience. I’m glad to see you’re no worse for wear at least.
That sucks man, Glad you and others have made it through relatively okay. Maybe you could have the cat repaired in the Kintsugi style? a studio phase one memento?
I really hope you have a good insurance for this or how it works in japan
Ánimo!
I feel so fucking bad for him . He must have spent atleast 10k for building that studio and all of his hardwork and money is now in drain. But atleast he is safe .
sorry to see this happen. I hope you will not be to badly disrupted
Man... I can't even begin to imagine what people there just went through. I have experienced a few earthquakes in my life time but nothing even remotely comparable to this one and those I've experienced already scared the crap out of me.
Zem! Good Luck Homie!
I slept through it, so ha ha.
Chris, any way to donate to rebuild what was lost in the studio? It breaks me seeing it like this, after everything! You're an inspiration to me (believe it or not!)
That quake was bad here in Yokohama (at least in my older apartment building), and I can't even imagine how terrifying it must have been up there. Glad you're okay, and I wish you luck in the studio cleanup/repairs!
What matters is that nearly everyone is fine, the news talk about 4 casualties and several injured people. I saw there were several rather strong aftershocks after the big one. Must have been bad.  I don't know whether this is any kind of consolation but a 7.3 earthquake here in Italy would essentially raze whole cities to the ground and kill thousands.  In Japan you have to clean up the mess and call a plumber. Not funny by any means but still better in my book.
Glad you are okay and safe, chris
Thank you for the update. Glad everyone is OK.
Glad you are okay, Chris, and happy to see y'all together.  Hopefully you will find a new maneki-neko to your restored studio.
stay safe M8 and i hope Connor is safe to
BE SAFE CHRIS
Sorry to see the damage, but good to see no one injured.
even my friend who stay in Chiba said its one of the worse earthquake he felt during his 3+ years stay in japan(although quite far from the epicenter of the quakes)... his area got blackout but no one was injured/ serious injured as far i as i know,  hopefully no more this kind of quakes in future
Wow. Really shows the power of these quakes. I'm glad you and the friends are safe. Stuff can be replaced but we can replace the people in our lives.
It could be worse u could live in Hull
For the cat statue, maybe try finding the pieces of it and getting a traditional Japanese crafter to fix it with kintsugi?
So glad you guys are OK! Hopefully everything can be repaired or replaced. Your studio was just finished, too!
Wow... I genuinely feel terrible, a lot of hard work went poof... But the important thing is that all of you are well! Hoping for the best.
News of the earthquake quickly flashed across the world. That is one big shake, and I'm glad to hear everybody is a-okay. Good to see the studio survive even if a lot of bits and pieces didn't make it. I have that exact same maneki-neko, so it must be a mass production indeed. Best wishes, be safe.
Stay safe Chris and all associated with AbroadinJapan. Buildings can be rebuilt but lives can't be brought back. Your safety is the main thing bud, take care.
Glad you're safe boss
You get to pay the workers for the refurbishment….again (I bet they missed that project!)
Thanks for sharing this with us. I hope you will have the studio up and running great again!!! With even more fantastic new features. If you feel like, please do live show and many of us would be glad to help you. This studio is becoming a big part of the Abroad Videos, that will not go away so easily. We Build Back Better!
Couldn't imagine if you're in the studio when it happen. Stay safe
So, new series where you go around looking for interesting items to fill your set with?  Glad you're okay Chris!
Glad you weren't there at that moment, that wouldn't have been a safe place to be AT ALL. Hope the water did not damage anything beyond repair.
So glad you're okay! That is some scary shit man, D:
glad you're okay hope everything goes back to normal
Thank you for spending the time to update. At least you created a set that can handle more grunge. I'm so glad you are physically safe.
So glad you guys are okay!
Shame about the damage but I’m glad you’re ok! ❤️
That shot of the city shows something clearly hitting the ground and making a huge flash of light seen in both shots... What's the deal with that?  Luckily the people are safe.
Wow the clips at the beginning -- that's absolutely terrifying. I'm glad you're okay, Chris. Stay well!
Sorry about the studio Chris! Glad you're alright.
I'm just glad and happy that everyone is save. Stay strong all of you and best wishes from Germany
Glad you’re safe.
that is realy sad
Jesus Christ the footage of the quake is insane. It must feel like a proper end of days kind of thing.
I have experienced one scary quake in Southern California. But while stuff moved and swayed inside, I have never seen a whole city visibly move like that. I'm glad you guys are okay. The studio lives, and it will thrive with all the little knickknacks you will add to it!
So glad you are ok! But very sorry for the damage to your awesome studio
？？？？？？？？
Glad you an the crew are safe.
I hope the studio can go back to its former glory the way you loved it!
You just had to say it in the podcast a few weeks ago. "I don't get out of bed for anything less than a 7.2." I'm sorry to see the studio in such a bad state. Hope you're doing well.
I hope you can fix everything quickly!! 🥺 Stay safe!! 🙏💖
I'm so sorry you had to go through this terrifying experience Chris and also with what happened at the apartment. At the end of day, the important thing is that you are safe and you have friends who are always there to support you. Take care of yourself!
😭😭😘
You might call me crazy but earthquakes are one of the things I want to experience in Japan, but I'm really happy your OK
I’m so sorry this happened to you. The main thing is you’re ok. I was worried about You, Sharla and the gang. Hope things get better soon!
I'm so glad you're alright...  What a scary situation.  Been through my share of earthquakes, but nothing this bad yet.  Always a terrifying experience.  Hoping that everything gets better soon!  ❤️
Main thing is everyone's ok, everything else can be rebuilt.
We're glad that you are ok. Also Sharla and Natsuki. We send you our love and best wishes.
Y’all be safe and praying
I'm so glad you are all OK, I know the destruction if your studio must be attrocious given how much effort went into it but at least you can rebuild.  And I'm actually kind of curious about the rebuilding process, any chance for a video on that?
And just after going through everything to have such a great set.  Well glad you were not hurt and I hope you take all the time you need to get everything sorted out and back on order.  We can wait for entertainment Chris.
Free Massage? Glad you're ok. Glad people are ok. And I hope Connors' JoJo figurines made it through. Also.  It's so nice to see you have such great friends.
Glad you're all okay. Hope the studio is fixable! Take care of yourself, Chris.
I'm so so glad to see you're all safe OMG
Hi Chris, glad you are ok. I know you will rebuild and make everything 10 times better. Just really happy it wasn't worse.
It's so sad to see what happened to the studio, but you're right, it's good that you weren't there during the earthquake. I'm glad you're okay and you have such close friends to go with you to investigate. I'm up in Aomori and it scared the shit out of me last night, so I can't imagine what it was like there.
It was really big earthquake yesterday even the bullet train stop in the middle of railway🚅Take care!!
Glad you're ok!
0:09 Did anyone catch a light coming from above?
I am just glad that you are alive and safe. Every thing else can be rebuilt. Still its a bit sad to that studio in this state. I wish that you can repair the damages soon.
Glad you are okay!
Oh f#$@!!! Sending healing love.
I really admire the Japanese peoples ability to repair and rebuild, sadly needing to be put into practice too often.
so scary! glad you’re safe!!
Such a shame to see all the damage the earthquake has cause and honestly can't imagine the fear of being around while the earthquake was going on too.
At the end of the day, its just stuff. Stuff can be replaced.
I immediately thought of you when I heard the news 😅
Be safe.
We're glad that you're safe Chris!
It's crazy how many relatively big earthquakes happen in Japan. Meanwhile here in California were sitting atop a fault line and we're still waiting for the "big one".
That was really terrifying earthquake. Very sad to see the damage to the studio. But we're glad to see you safe, Chris
The one thing I am dreading when I eventually do move to Japan is the Earthquakes.  The only thing scary that comes from Wales is Mr. Connor.  ;)
I’m glad you are okay but this makes me sick to my stomach to see your studio like that. It was so beautiful. You will rebuild and it will be better than ever.
Most importantly - so glad you’re safe Chris, but it’s quite upsetting to see the beautiful studio in such a state 😭
That is extremely scary. Stay strong Chris. I'm glad you guys are okay. Stay safe
tiimu?
Hang in their Chris we have got your back
on the bright side, studio 2.0 gonna be just as cool.
Takes a lot for a stoic unfeeling British man to admit he was scared. Hope the water damage isn't too bad.
So sorry about your studio :'(
That sight is heartbreaking. Its great to see you guys healthy and good but the sight of your dream being this badly situated after seeing it rise up, it hurts. Best of wishes for the damages to be minimal in the whole studio
Glad to know you guys are doing well. Be safe.
Good that the food in your ramen shop wasn't real
Sad about the damage but grateful you all are safe. Hugs to you! 😘
Nature for content
fuck, this is heartbreaking to watch   when you knew it was Chris’s lifetime dream to own a studio.   but glad to see everyone was okay
Glad you're safe mate. I can't imagine living in England how terrifying that could be. I'm just glad nobody was killed. As for the damage with the studio, it could have been worse. Just needs a bit of a cleaning and replacing some things for the ramen shop.
The old well that's not good, but taken as a whole it's not that bad. Glad you are all safe.
Love to see and hear more on how they’ve protected buildings and infrastructure in buildings and outside - when you are in the mood to do a very serious report … harken back to the earthquake video of old
Glad you are all safe.  Hope insurance will cover some of the repairs, but in the end remember that it's just 'stuff' and it can be replaced.  I hope there wasn't too many people hurt during the whole thing.
Didn't even know there was an earthquake over there. 😔  Seeing the studio in shambles was heartbreaking.
0:09 Uh does anyone know what that was?
the most important thing was safe,  the pod cast picture. but any glad you're safe Chris, sad about the studio thats going to be costly unless you have insurance
all the best Chris
Hope everyone is okay over in Japan right know. Our thoughts are with you ❤
noooooooooooooooo.. rip anime figures.
I’m so glad you’re ok. I am sad that your set suffered, but I’m happy you were not there when it happened. Stay safe!
Glad you’re alright tho Chris. 💪🏼✌🏼
Chris, use Kintsugi to save the Neko figurine.. a piece to remember 🐱🐾  "Kintsugi, also known as kintsukuroi, is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum; the method is similar to the maki-e technique."
A big bucket of gold glue, what's it called, kintsuguni, have that cat waving in no time. 👍
Glad you are ok . . Hope the water issue gets fixed soon !! 🙏
Oh god that's terrifying. Stay safe Chris!
good to see you are already starting to bounce back from this. if i had studio like yours, and had to bare witness to all that work and effort be thrashed, i'd prolly feel incredibly defeated.
Scary shit mate, as soon as I heard I checked your social media! Glad you guys are all ok.
Glad you're all healthy and safe.
Glad you're okay!! <3
Keeping you and everyone in our prayers tonight.
I am glad you are all okay
Hope everything will be up and running soon this is one of the few channels(and Chris abroad ofc) I really looking forward to watch when it comes to Japan.
Hope everyone is safe
Glad you're alright, honestly this is one of those things that one just cannot count with. Hopefully everything will be back on track soon
Is there any type of insurance in Japan for this kind of things?
I'm glad you are okay man! You will get everything back on track in no time!
Glad you're alright Chris
Man i hope you got insurance if not that sucks but It doesnt look that bad, Hope it didnt hit your spirit
I hope you stay safe chris at least you all right 🙏
Glad ur ok Chris things can be remade and bought but ur irreplaceable
I'm glad you guys are safe, things can be glued together.
I am glade everyone is safe & will pray for the rest of those affected by this earthquake..
I'm glad you're alright. It's sad that it happened so soon after you just got the studio, but at least in Japan even if the building is older they are quite sturdy. - Imagine if this happend in another place less prepared. Building safety laws haven't just been updatet after Kobe but after every major earthquake (1923, 1984, 1971, 1981,...). I hope you find some calm in that.
All the best, Chris! Sorry about this situation...
i hope all the repairs are quick and affordable and any new upgrades to protect the set, hopefully this will not have a lasting impact on your mental health
my condolences man. stay safe.
Well, at least you got some content out of this...
So glad you're all okay, but this is genuinely devastating.. we all know how much this studio means to you and how hard you worked to get it. I'm so sorry ❤
Heartbreaking your dope studio D': irreplaceable things
Cheers from California! We get earthquakes like this too once every about 10 years.
Bruh, I didn't realise the severity of those earthquakes!!
So sorry to see the studio like that. Hope you feel better soon!
What a great cleaning team!  Sharla and Natsuki will get the place shipshape in no time. :D
Keep strong in there Chris!
Make sure to take care
So glad you and all associated with Abroad in Japan are safe. I pray that all in Japan that were effected are as fortunate, and can also get back to normalcy soon. Thanks for sharing a glimpse into the event.
I’m glad every creator I follow there is safe but I would be lying if I wasn’t concerned
So sorry to hear Chris, hope all will be well soon!!! Defo take your time to get everything settled. Take care and best wishes!!!
Insurance job👺
Glad you’re okay.
Plot twist: Chris just had a wild party with Natsuki and thought up: "I think we can blame the earthquake for this..."  Glad you're alright and also the studio wasn't too badly damaged (here's hoping that water damage wasn't too bad).
As much as what happened totally sucks, everything in the studio can be replaced. Your health and friends are the most important. Take it slow & safe.
I'm glad you all are okay. I hope things can still be fixed for your homes and the studio.
Glad  you are all ok but so sorry about the damage in the studio. It can probably all get fixed but it's still sad to see it.
Glad you're safe! I hope that water didn't destroy any of the neon lights in the studio.
Absolutely horryfing... Such a shame about the studio, especially with how new everything was, but most importantly - glad you're alright!
It looks horrifiying!! I am so glad, that you and your friends are alright. I wish you all the best and that you can get through this mentally as well. Sounds very traumatizing.. 😢💕
😧
I am in Tokyo and it was rather strong, It looked even worse for you.
I think it's awesome how through all of this, Chris is still cracking jokes and staying positive!!! 🙂Luv ya Chris!!!!♥Best of Luck!!!!
Please take care Chris, and so glad you're all right.
That ramen shop destruction was heartbreaking, something that you always wanted for years and you get that few months later broken. Hope for a better future
Those images in the beginning are so insane :O It's sad to see the set got hit bad, but glad that you guys are fine!
My mother got hit on the head with a furniture glass when it happened, thankfully it's just a minor injury, I was scared when it happened, I hope everyone is safe !
Glad you are ok, and that the studio is (almost) undamaged. I'm sure it will be even better now, that it has got some "patina".  ;-)
If you keep the pieces of the waving cat there's likely artisans and such who could glue it back together. Even if you don't fix it, it'd be nice to keep it as a sort of souvenir, to show abroad in Japan survived the biggest earthquake since 3.11.
I'm sure you need a mop here :')  Hope everything is doing alright!! <3
I am glad you are safe and sound
anyone know what that massive light was in the distance?
Chris I don’t think you are destined to die in an earthquake .... a daft eating challenge, maybe, but not an earthquake.  Stay safe and try sticking more things down .. Velcro perhaps?
So glad everyone is ok!!! I can't imagine feeling one like that. I've only felt 3 tiny ones but the feeling of the entire ground/house moving stays with you for a long time.
Glad you are safe
i clicked like on this video not cause I liked it but in hopes it supports you. Glad you're safe
Omg! That hurts seeing all that.
Glad to see you're alright, material things can always be replaced and hopefully you can get everything back to normal quickly
Glad to see you received no bodily harm.  I almost, almost, wish I was there now to help you clean up...
Glad Chris and everyone else are okay, I hope clean up duty won’t be entirely painful.
So where did the water come from?
glad everyone is ok!
Oh man this is just horrible man hopefully everything will be sorted out but no matter what we can always expect that Abroad swagger and charm
wish you well Chris
Stay safe Chris!! Everything else will pass, and can be fixed.
I'm happy that you are OK, I'm sorry about the studio. Looks horrific, I can only guess how your heart is aching after you walked in. I hope that one on the end wasn't to strong 😕 keep yourself safe!
Dam, glad to hear you are all ok.
Glad you’re safe!!
damn the start looks scary af
I was just reading it on Twitter and on google :')
Is there insurance for something like that? Or did you had to pay everything yourself to get it back to normal?
Thankfully you guys are safe, but that smashed studio :C Stay safe from the aftershock and go have a nice chicky meal to lift your spirits.
Glad to see everything is alright, I hope the water situation is sorted by now. Stay safe!
Glad you're ok Chris.  I've never experienced an earthquake and, after this vid, I hope I never do.
So sad! My wife and I thought this studio was so amazing. I hope that everything can be fixed or replaced easily.
Please take care,  Cris.
I'm so sad to see the studio roughed up. I'm glad you're okay though. Please stay safe.
Glad that you all are safe. That's that most important thing.
Hate to see that damage, so glad it wasn't worse! Hope everything goes well getting it all patched back up! Much love
Glad you're all ok. Like a Bond, shaken not stirred! A bunch of us were watching Emma in Tokyo and that's some kms away.
Sending prayers and hugs for Japan
I’m glad you’re OK. I was wandering, since you’ve said your studio is in an old building. Sorry to see all the damage. I hope it’s repairable..
I call bs.  Why turn tragedy into views😾
That's scary as heck.  I hope the clean up goes smoothly
It is super scary to go through this.
Glad you're safe chris🙏🏻🙏🏻
Genuinely sad this happened but good thing none of yall are hurt
Is everyone in your circle okay?
Main thing you all are safe. Objects can always be replaced but lives cannot. Take care. Thank you all for sharing your lives with us.
Try to collect the parts of the neko and glue it back together. At least that´s what I´d do.
Glad you’re all safe, take care. Thoughts and prayers are with you.
I was really sad when I saw your Studio in shambles on Twitter, and whilst I did somewhat care for it, it was moreso because I knew getting that studio was something you were quite attached to. But at the end of the day, it's good enough that you're safe!
Why not try Kintsugi with the Maneki Neko Chris? that'd be a really nice image?
I am just glad you are safe. It's sad that the studio went through so much damage but it can be fixed; Same cannot be said about life, unfortunately. Stay safe Chris. To us, your life is more important than the studio.
Glad you guys are okay.
simply terrifying. Glad that you, Natsuki and Sharla are okay though!
I'm in Ibaraki. Everything up to this was not even worth getting up for. This one though? I was actually worried. Power was out for an hour though, so not terrible.
I'm so glad you are all ok. I will say a little prayer for no more aftershocks.  Sorry bout the ramen shop😿
Glad to see you and people around you weren't hurt. Too bad for apartment and studio, but that's something you can fix. All the best you guys!
Feel for you Chris, glad you are okay.
A yeah I was hoping you’d make a video about this.
We are thankful that you and your friends are ok.
As you said you not being there was actually better.  Grateful that you are fine Chris as long as one has the strength anything can be rebuilt.
Take care Chris! I'm glad you guys are fine despite the stuff that broke in your studio. I hope you can get it back up soon!
Really sorry to hear about all the damage that your ramen shop suffered.  Good thing you’re ok.
Best of luck Chris and co. I am so sorry that this happened. My heart honestly goes out to all the people in Japan that have been affected by this.
Holy Shit, i am so glad it went well!
Keep strong
Fucking hell, even the Philippines doesn't have those kinds of earthquakes, Can't imagine how I could've faired had I been in that kind of situation.
I’m so sorry to see the studio sustained damage. Best wishes for a quick recovery to you and everyone there.
So glad you are okay!
Keep safe man, sad to see the studio the way it is but your safety matters more!
Pain in the ass to clean that studio :'(
Damn Chris, hope everything goes well. All the best of luck man. Stay safe.
Damn that looked violent. At least everyone seems safe - items can be replaced!
glad you’re ok
Everything will sort out, the important thing is you are alright.
Glad to see that you're all safe man
Really painful to see all this. Happy to see that you are safe. Hopefully, you can get the studio sorted out. Stay safe.
Take care Chris! Hope all becomes better soon
aww thats so upsetting, im sorry chris i hope you recover the studio alright
At least Big Mouth survived the earthquake
oooooof Terrible  dude
Did the cultured pictures near the telephone got knocked down as well?
Thank goodness you've survived unhurt!
So sad to hear and see that this happened! Looks like lots of things got broken but hopefully they can easily be replaced! every knows how much you love the studio! Could you imagine if we had our interview a few days later than we did... god...
Glad you are alright 👍🏼
That sucks but I am glad you're all safe.
This was so crushing to see. The excitement around this new studio was so genuine! I know whatever you have in store next will be fantastic. Much love, Chris!
Seeing the broken cat you said you like, would that or anything else be good for Kintsugi repairs? maybe keep something in the studio as a memento from the earthquake. Take care!
So glad you’re ok 🙏🏻
this was not an affable day :(
The water can be mopped up and the raman shop can be rebuilt. Very glad to see that everyone is doing alright.
Oh god, the studio looks completely FUCKED. rip little cat dude.
Losing the stuff that’s broken is really horrible but I’m glad we haven’t lost you Chris. Keep keeping on champ and stay safe ❤️
Not the Hat Rack … lol
I'm glad to hear you're OK hopefully your studio will get back together soon
Glad to see you're alright dude! I would probably die from a panic attack in that situation lol
I'm sorry that happened. Good thing you're British. You got the whole stiff upper lip thing working for ya.
Sorry to hear about the studio and very glad everyone seems to be safe. But i am most impressed that the large mirror at 1:32 never fell over and smashed
So sorry to see this. Hope you're recovering from your experience.  Hope you can salvage it.
Just liked the video, not because I'm happy about seeing the damages to the studio but because I'm glad to see that you are all ok! Good luck with the cleaning and hope that the material damages weren't too bad! Stay safe!
Being quite a large amount of force released, geologically there "shouldn't" be another one that is as big or worse for almost another 50 years.  Glad the you all and the studio faired quite well tho.
Glue the important broken stuff. It will be more important to you later on in life.
Very sorry to see this Chris :( good to hear it's just a casualty of material possessions. I'm sure studio 2.0 will be even cooler & even more expensive.
Most importantly you are ok. The studio will be fixed. I‘m sure of it.  You should keep the broken lucky neko. It is a reminder of a terrifying story.
sorry matey glad you're all good though !!!
I hope this earthquake was the grand finale and there isn’t a stronger one in the works. I’m glad Chris, Sharla, and Natsuki are okay. Always good to see friends coming together in a time of need 💜
stay safe Chris and friends I cant imagine being in the midst of a earthquake
Life is more important. You will rebuild again. Stay safe 🙏
Im very glad that you are safe may god be with you 🙏
Glad you are all okay. I've experienced one (fairly mild) earthquake and it was two too many. I hope that the cleanup goes well and that maybe the damage isn't as bad as it looks.
"Oh fuck", yeah, exactly my thoughts... Glad nothing worse happened though.
i hope insurance helps
We are gonna watch the hell out of this video so that you can recoup some money to repair your place
Glad you're ok . That must've been absolutely terrifying 🥺
Wow that video footage really shows it all! So sorry that happened! Scary! Does Japan have earthquake insurance to be able to get some items back or is an earthquake considered "an act of God" and not able to get any reimbursement for damages?
Holy crap!! Glad you are well!!
Good luck  🙏
Can't imagine how hard it is seeing something so magnificent you created destroyed like this, stay strong mate so glad you're alright ♥️
Glad you are all safe Chris! I can’t tell if you were happy that your trash taste award was intact or not!
I´m happy to see you alive and not injured. Is there a place I can send you money for repairing your flat? I´m already on patreon but I wanna send extra cash.
I'm sorry you went through this traumatizing experience and I hope you are able to recover as best you can. I live somewhere with pretty much no natural disasters ever so it seems super surreal and awful to suddenly be subject to something so scary.
So glad you're safe
Be save man. Glad you Natsuki and Sharla are ok. Material damage is just that
time to learn kintsugi
Just glad you're ok Chris, if you need some money to help repair the set I'm sure everybody here would be more than happy to chip in!!
Although I'm glad you're safe, I hope you're doing alright Chris. It is such a shocking experience to go through any earthquake especially one of that size. Sending you my best wishes!
Glad you're ok Chris, must have been terrifying at the time
Its usually great to wake up to your videos but this is just sad, I really loved that studio. I hope to see you all doing videos they're again soon and please stay safe.
0:09 what was that????
You might need to consider starting bolting stuff down, Chris...Glad you survived this unscathed! Try to have a good rest! 😀
Pray for a good recovery for the studio, man! I'm glad you guys are all safe.
I saw this all over Japan news! I hope all you guys are safe! It looks so scary! This would affect me a lot especially with my anxiety. Pray everything it’s alright.  P.s the studio ☹️😭 omg noooo…. I hope you can recover a lot of the items that’s broke
Good luck Chris, hope you can get everything sorted soon x
DUDEEEE
Happy to hear you're okay, Chris! Sorry about the studio, hope the water damage isn't too bad 🤞
Stay safe Japan! Wishing you the best from India!
I’ll get you some super glue for your birthday so this doesn’t happen again😬
🙏🏼
Wait, this channel has a production crew? Since when and how big?
Blimey!   That’s a big light for your moniker !
At least you and your friends are ok. I can understand the feeling, I'm from Chile and here earthquakes are common. A lot of support and good vibes Chris. Take care!
So sorry, hope you put all together <3
Damn, that's scary! Glad you're alright, man.
Sorry to see all the damage in your studio. Hope you can get things sorted soon.
Perfect for a Kintsugi episode
Just watching such intense earthquake video made me feel terrified,experiencing it firsthand would be beyond the realm of terrifying,I'm glad you're safe.Hope everyone there in Sendai as well as other regions are safe
クリスさんは、頑張ってください！
Plot twist: the portrait at 2:26 falling off the shelf is what caused the earthquake.
Happy you're okay and safe! Everything will get better
Oh man, that really sucks as it was quite a recent build of the studio, very unlucky.
glad you guys are okay!
An earthquake happening on my birthday, what a world we live in. Hope you're alright
You could let someone repair the maneki neko with Kintsugi, that would look pretty cool.
Sorry to see your studio this way, hopefully repairs aren't too costly or time consuming. Maybe a few thousand adhesive velcro strips might be a good investment..!
Aw man, sorry about the ramen-shop. But Im glad you are ok.
I'm very glad that it is just stuff that was damaged!! Take care buddy!
As someone who's from the Netherlands where we never ever get natural earthquakes, I feel so priveged to live where I do :( this must be terrifying. I'm glad there weren't many deaths, but this is all heartbreaking to see. I hope recovery goes well for you and everyone else affected ♡
All the new bumps and scratches just add extra character to the set
Thank goodness you’re okay Chris. Thankfully the damage in the studio is not as bad as I thought. Maybe you could do a craft with the magneki neko (like kintsugi or some sort of traditional Japanese art technique). It looks very intact so there’s a lot you can do with it!
Still cracking jokes after such a horrendous event, that's the spirit. Sorry to see the studio in such a mess but maybe this is the worlds way of telling you there's still stuff left to see in japan? At least while the studio is getting repaired anyway!
all that stuff is replaceable....you, and your friends, are not....I am so glad you're all safe.....please stay that way
Glad big mouth okay 😅
Now earthquakes? Clearly Chris has run out of ideas….. too soon? Glad to see you are okay  and hope for the best for you as well!
That is scary there.  I hope everyone there is safe.
GLAD YOU ALIVE CHRIS. IS CONNOR OKAY TO? I NEVER SEE JAPAN 🇯🇵  GOT THE WORST EARTHQUAKE. AND WAVES
The set was brand new as well...
Holy moly sir! So glad everyone is ok. So sorry for the damage. Sending all the positive vibes that no other major waves come thru.
They say most damage doesn't come from the earthquake itself it's  the aftershocks... 🙏
so glad that none of you were hurt! A shame about the studio, but at least it seems structurally sound still
Holy moly! Stay safe Chris!! Hoping for a quick and easy clean up for you, family and friends!
there is allot of stuff to earthquake proof stuff in Japan. maybe talk to aki and joey to get pointed in the right direction if you don't know where to find it? because aki did do a video on it.
The first thing he pick up is his 'round' picture with the boys, that shows how much he love that picture
Glad big mouth okay 😅
Hey Chris! From one earthquake nation to another, please take it easy, take your time, sometimes these things take a while to process. Just try to laugh where you can and it’s the people that can help the most, they will help you and if you help them it makes you feel all that much better. Thanks for still making my day, Mathew from New Zealand
I would love 2 leave a like but i dont know. It doesnt feel right.
I'm gutted for you mate, i know that is your dream studio must be hard to see so much damage. I'm glad you're well though, and what was built can be rebuilt I hope.
I‘m glad that you're all okay.. I was so concerned about the studio.. I'm sure this was a terrible experience..
It's really sad to see all this passion and planning and love get shaken and smashed overnight.   I know it's rough, but at least you're all safe and can  replace some of those things.
I guess im signing back up for patreon. And Legit had to back up three times to 3:57 and still can't tell what that pink thing is...I know what it looks like 😂
Glad you and the guys are ok, RIP ramen shop though. Any plans on what youre going to replace the broken objects with?
Heartbreaking about your ramen shop Chris, but I'm really glad you were safe! Hopefully you can go on many more adventures in the future to replace the things that were broken.
That looks terrifying. Glad your okay
As long as you guys are fine its all good.. items are replaceable <3
I hope you recover from it soon, man. You’re a great content producer 👊🏻
Oh dear  :(
I’m so glad you are all safe 💛
fucking congrats chris the earth didn’t want you to die that much
I´m glad you are alright chris, hope for the best take care ! and if I could I would help you clean it up !
The slippers looks familiar, I bet that's Sharla's slippers! I saw it in one of her videos hehe!
What the heck... those footage were scary . Godspeed y'all and wish y'all the best
Glad that everyone is okay.
Glad you guys are safe and hope you can get things cleaned up soon. Good luck
Damn. Sorry man. But at least U guys are ok.
Courage my friend
I’m gutted for you my man. I’m so sorry to see this happen to you.
That’s terrifying, and the damage looks absolutely awful, but I am real glad your alright Chris! Same goes for Sharla and Natsuki and everyone else ! ❤️
Glad you’re okay. Hope everyone there is recovering okay. Pretty scary.
Stay safe stay strong Chris! Take care
It's so heartbreaking to see. All the hard work went in vain :( I am glad you guys are safe tho
Glad you’re ok Chris! So sad to see the studio like that but material things can be replaced.
Damn this is a tragedy, sorry to hear about your studio Chris. Hopefully you can get that sorted out soon and back to making "ramen" and playing Pacman!
Stay safe Big boi Chris.
Superglue will fix the gachapon machine lid, hope everyone is ok
devo dude. glad everyone is fine
We are happy that you are safe Chris
Lots of love stay safe. If it wasn't for delays with student visa I would have been in Japan during the earthquake , guess it's lucky huh
Please tell me the delicious polycarbonate ramen is ok?
Thank god big mouth is unharmed 🙏🏻 Also, you should use kintsukuroi to fix the cat
Best of the luck with the repairs Chris!
I'm glad that nobody was in the studio and everyone is safe
Damn man. Seeing the aftermath in the studio really saddened me. Crazy how things can go haywire in natural disasters. Makes me want to eat a Pizza Sand to return things to normal.
This is so disheartening to see.
Just get yujiro to stop it
When I experience or watch earthquake videos, I always search the documentary "The big one". Imagine an earthquake with 8 +,9 or 10 magnitude. It's so scary.
Hope everyone is doing alright! Stuff like this is really scary and was bound to happen when you've lived in Japan for so long but glad you were fine. My heart goes out to all those who lost their lives.
Hope you're safe Chris, much love ❤❤
Glad you guys are safe, good luck on repairing everything! It’s much easier to fix and clean up a mess than to deal with injury or death, so glad you guys are all right
Sorry to see the brand new studio been damaged like that. But glad that no one was hurt. Stay safe guys. Hope that the studio could return to tip top shape soon.
Oh no I’m glad you are safe Chris, I hope you can get back up again with the studio Chris
Things can be replaced. I'm glad you are safe!
So sorry about the studio. But glad you guys are ok!
Oh no!!! The new studios, i haven't got a chance to be a guest yet 😕 😞 😢
Putting the picture frames back in place being the first thing he did is just so wholesome
I’m glad your ok and I hope no one was harmed in this tragedy
Glad your okay chris! Stay safe bro
Stay safe guys!
I live in Chiba and felt it. Very intense and long, definitely the biggest one since I moved here as well, i can't even imagine what it felt like in Sendai.  What matters is that you and everyone were unhurt. Good luck on fixing the studio!
The highest my dad faced was 9.2 he has been living in japan for 14-15 years
Glad to know you're okay & at lease the set can be repaired.
glad you guys are all okay!
Oh no.... :( hang in there 🙏🏼
Noooooooo not the brand new studio! Glad you’re okay though Chris!
Much love, hope you're all okay, and you can sort the studio out asap :)
I'm glad to see the 3 of you are ok. It's sad to see the state of the studio
Oh no :( So sorry for you… Hope fixing it all will not be that bad in the end.
I’m glad you’re alright Chris
glad you safe Chris
So terrifying…I’ve heard as well from my friends in Japan. Glad you’re safe and well Chris. So sad to see the damage to the studio…that’s devastating…poor maneki neko and ramen shop props…
I'm glade that your safe. My girlfriend felt it up in Hokkaido. I was talking to her when it happened.
Poor Chris. I hope you have insurance to rebuild your studio.
In the Same day my town got greatest earthquake since 1980~ of 3.5 which is “small” but
What a bummer you just got that 😕
Wow I heard this on the radio this morning, seeing footage is truly scary!
Oh no!! Your beautiful studio 😭 this is awful.. but I'm so glad you weren't there when it happened, that could have been really dangerous. I hope you can have it fixed soon ❤️
So happy you are alright I was worried
There goes the studio. In all seriousness, i hope all of you are safe out there.
I will donate right away, you entertained me for long it's time to pay back
Glad to see that you are alright!
2:28 everything is better
Earthquakes are fucking terrifying. So glad you are safe and that any damage is as minimal as possible.
Glad you are alright, Chris. You will rebuild. You will conquer your obstacles and hardships. Thank you for the update and if you decide to start a GoFundMe, I will donate.
Glad you're okay Chris! I was really worried about the creators I watch who are in Japan when I heard the news.

All hail to Japanese engineering, there a wasn't any severe casualties except only some powercuts.
I hope you're safe! It must have been so scary!
I'm happy that you are not hurt
I couldn't even imagine experiencing that, honestly makes me wanna reconsider where I'm asking for as part of my JET application.  Wishing you the best through this, clean up must suck.

Stay safe Chris!
Yes
Chris you’re affable, I hope you’re doing well now! Hope the studio stay good and ok
First! Are you alright? Update us on the situation if possible. Stay safe.
Omg
🙏 A huge thanks for all the kind words guys! As much as I love Sendai, unfortunately it's one of the most seismically active regions in Japan. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't on edge still a day later, given it was such a shocking and intense earthquake. Most earthquakes start as a faint rumble and then get worse and worse. This one felt like a bomb had gone off a few floors below and catapulted the entire floor upwards in a very sudden and unpleasant manner. Since then we've had quite a few aftershocks, such as the one recorded at the end of the video. But I think above all it's important to be grateful that despite the huge earthquake casualties were pretty low and damage fairly minimal, with power and water outages fixed incredibly fast. It's a testament to Japan's astonishing engineering and emergency services.  As for me, it's time to get back to work scrubbing up the studio! ⭐ For more updates I recommend following Abroad in Japan on Twitter.
