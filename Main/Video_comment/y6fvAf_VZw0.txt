Chrswht is weird af, nobody likes people like that. It’s not cool. It’s corny
Chris the biggest baby !! He plays Street ball and crying about all that sissy !!! Wish Nick won
everyone in the comments hating on chris knowing he’s tuff🤣😭
29:46 Haha this foo saying he took his leg out and he will never be back here to play. I know he feel hella dumb when he watched the replay 😂😂
Two of the biggest liars when it comes to fouls 😂
Chris is a big baby bully
EPIC battle of mid
gay
29:49 didn’t even come close to taking his leg out this my last time being here ya this is ur last time being here u need to remeber where u came from u were. A nobody untill u got picked up to play 5v5s by a YouTuber now u think ur all that. Ur dying outta breath with ur sloppy body but talking crap saying he can’t breathe he’s outta breathe u been outta breath since the ur 3rd possession game one idk if he wins or looses but u forgot where u came from and ur not that good
This video is really making me not like crs white he’s being. Baby doing exactly what he’s crying about
Bro complaining over & over but doesnt even guard up😂😂 playing lazy defense from the free throw line
So much crying Chris. Stop complaining dog come on. Wow such a patiance Nick!
Chris is the biggest pussy complaining like that
get in shape boys....
Chris is his own worst enemy.  He just whines and whines to the point where I don't even care if he's right or not anymore.
Creativity level from either of them 0/10.
señora gorda y llorona
Boring…..
Nick has an open midi almost every damn time. If he shot and made even half of em he wouldve won 2 games easy
CRS is a hoe for doing that much whining when most of the calls came from you crying 😂
fat guy play football and it`s boring
CRSWHT plays with his mouth and belly :)
They should of just had a 3 point contest
Charlie zelenoff plays bball
Blocked by Chris !!!!!!
bro 18:05 had me dying 😭nicks reaction
crswht rewatching this knowing every time he complained wasn't even a foul
Letting the cokeheads battle it out
I just recently discovered Chris and I love watching you play with your big man style. But I got to say you do way too much complaining or you at least did in this match it gets too much and you don't need to do it
Chris White is trash
Thought i was watching julian newman for a second
Called  he k after you missed is wild lol
Idky chris think hes black its just so funny lol
Why is it that all big guys like this cry wen they lose but wen they win they ur best friend definition of a punk i dont get it even wen they fight they start tearing up it's crazy gotta be a parent thing when they were kid must not have got there ass whooped enough cry an get there way all the time then they grow up an act like this very shocking
Damn I slowed down the fouls he complained about and like 80 percent were not fouls😂😂😂
2:48 Bruh is Respectfully TRASH and I don’t even know who won yet but im pretty sure he did needs to loose weight
Honestly i comment as am watching the video haven’t even been completely all im hearing is chris complaining trash ass videos i do like his game a little!
16:32 he only missed it because he hit his arm, 🙄 chris you had let that go before nick even touched you 😂😂😂
chris keeps complaining about running in or out bruh its basketball the fact that your complaining about that blows my mind.
This dude is so annoying. Lame ass stiff moves and just whines all the time. Always with the excuses. Oh and a big insecure bully. I can watch his fake ass for like 2 minutes
Christopher, you were wrong and youre a big softy
Here we go with these goddamn fking ads
Nick is so trash 😂😂😂😂
Chris white saying he has no bag is hilarious, all he does is a weak cross & Chuck a 3, or back down
They both suck
why u keep crying while u call nick as a baby?
13:43 Is such a scum basket Nick consistently wants a double check and then pulls up after a single when Chris isn’t there
Just keep it 4 dribbles
Some of the worst basketball I've ever seen haha
When he said "we outside" he was foreshadowing to game 3 when he goes to the parking lot.Wild move like how they do that in WWE
All lot of attention in this game
bro theyre both garbage lmao wtf
No disrespect but basketball is about odds and evens. If ur fat and slow it’s running u around and mid to lay ups all day
just 2waterheads.
Big boy can't hoop he's lucky he has size. Cried about nothing the entire time.
That actually is a call everywhere. You throw any kind of elbow intentionally or not it’s getting called.
What are they playing for? The worst fall off of the year?
Never seen “men” complain so much, especially the fat guy.
lol zero bag is crazy work when you do nothing but back down with your fat
This was trash. Two of the most annoying players out there.
I think the reason  Chris complains a lot about fouls to be entertaining
Chris a whole crybaby! Never seen so much complaining in a 1v1 .
And here I thought Julian was a cry baby sissy. Nigga u 300+ lbs and cry about a petty slap on the arm. Nigga, to be ur size and cry the way u do is SINISTER... Then u wanna tell somebody else how to play their game.. Get this nigga a bib  and a pacifier....
This man takes 4 lines before play
Le falta creatividad a Nick
35:40 We did review the tape. It was 10000% offensive foul.
How is it allowed that the big dude keeps screaming and barking at the other guy when he takes a shot? Not only super unsportsmanlike but usually a technical foul
Refs will call offensive foul on that play 90% of the time. But on a street court i just call that a body! That being said chris needs to man up n play through instead of acting like a biatch😂
Bro sounds like angry Seth Rogan
" He took my leg out!"   What a wuss.
Dude needs to stop complaining and get in shape.
29:45 he didn’t take your leg out.
Take a shot every time nick adjust his Jersey
Game 2 was hilarious
crswht cant play ball, hes hella buns he cant even shoot 😹😹😹💔💔🙏
A 40 year old man crying. Is the biggest man there and cries the most!! Straight trash
Wow that is a lot of complaining about fouls in a street ball game.  Not saying there were not missed calls but you gotta stop complaining.
Big dude cries so much hate playing with dudes like that
20:48 imagine throwing up this horrible air-ball and then crying about something that clearly didn’t happen. 🤦
Of course when Chris wins look how he's all appreciative! What a fucking goof! Literally the biggest cry baby ever! You can tell an idiot like that isn't smart enough to get a high school education!
" he took my leg out in the air"😂
Whyyyttttttt been on that seefood diet
Worst 1v1 I’ve ever seen
No mid range jumpers from either guy... might be something to work on
No mid range jumpers from either guy... might be something to work on
Get that W CRS!
Both of these guys are garbage
crswht this video proves that YOUR A BABY lmao loss all respect points hahah im un subscribing to ur channel all i heard is WAHHHH super unprofessional
crswht im a huge fan of u bro but dude ur literally 100 pounds heavier then homie and u either shoot a 3 or back him down but then get upset cuz he runniing around? you need to get in better shape you need stamina brother....dont talk about "his bag" when the first game u hit 5 3s lmao lets just be transparent homie all love
This Cris WhT guy is insufferable. Classic douche wigger that thinks he’s the man. Thanks for heavy breathing in the mic all game also bud
Chris has an excuse after every Missed shot LoL now that's hella funny sounds like somebody in the back of a police car 🤷😂
Good thing the format is not constant play.  Dude can barely breathe between possessions.  What a joke 😂😂
crswht is the biggest cry baby and whiner ive ever seen
Nick Bricks
Dude complaining about “running around” in BASKETBALL!? As if he ain’t lucky that chris has natural size on him so he can post up when ever he needs a point. That’s corny to me. So Work on your stanima if u can’t ya know, RUN while playing BASKETBALL. I don’t even like nick briz and I kinda wanted him to win just based alone on the bitching and complaining of Chris.
Never forget that Nick briz is the only reason for Chris’s success. And Chris proceeds to talk all the sh*t. I know I’m late to the party but d*mn this is embarrassing for Chris. Nick wasn’t being disrespectful at all during this contest and Chris is acting like a straight up baby. Big boy needs to humble up…
23:20 cool story bro dawg Chris is funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bbby 😂
The professor would smoke both these wankers
Why does Nick shoot like he’s always at half court?
Nick is trash and Chris a big ass baby. How tall is Chris?
Olay to your strength nick. Drive right at him. He wants you to stand there and shoot. Got to make him move. Listen to how hard man is breathing
The dude chris thinks hes so hard , hes a complete dumbass 😂😂😂
“Running bullshit” 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
These guys suck.
Karen Wht needs to stop his crying 😭
I swear leftys are divas
WOW this is like Shaq playing Spud Mckenzie and you barely beat him & cry and whine most of the time... next time someone bring some tissues & a diaper
It was a foul! and he's lucky they didn't call him for one every other play!
How can you try and bulldoze your way to the hoop and then complain about anything .  Ref needs to call offensive foul
Chris is such an ahole.  Just a cry baby bully
Dude u can't just lower ur shoulder and pushed ppl out the way and it be a foul  on them .....
That guys embarrassing 😅
SO MANY YT TEARS IN ONE VIDEO SMH LOL
I'VE NEVER SEEN A YT WANT TO BE OTHER THAN A YT IN MY LIFE... AND HE WILD SOFT SMH LOL
Whyte is soooo sofftttttt!!
These guys mid fr
Crswht kinda a soreloser
All I hear is Chris breathing heavy
These guys are white!!!
Nick shot 100 jumpers and made 5 but just kept shooting 🤣
Nick the only person to wear no show socks in this era.
Bro Nick Briz moves are so ugly
That boy nick can’t shot to save his life
Crs does a lot of crying
Perez George Anderson Scott Lopez Lisa
Bruh Said We Outside 😂😂😂😂 No Yall In an Indoor Gym
"Dribbles around the court like a trashcan "  Sir there's no other way to get around the court in 1v1
The guy wearing the pantyhoes really complained about everything the entire time
Clark Anna Lopez David Wilson Jason
Dude is so out of shape complain about everything. He only good at one thing baiting the other guy into shooting. And  dude in red instead of playing his game he letting buddy play in his head. They both sucks
Nick could have won this. He’s far more athletic and faster than Chris could ever hope to be. He relied way too much on his outside shooting which, from the looks of it, needs a lot of work. If he had a consistent jumpshot, he would have won this. His true strength is being able to attack the basket and finish at the rim which he didn’t do enough of. Yeah Chris has the size advantage and obviously outweighs Nick by at least 50 lbs, but he’s far slower and can only back people down in the post to score points when he knows he has a size advantage over them. Chris doesn’t have a bag. Nick actually has a bag and he has played far better than what he showed here, but he’s just too inconsistent and that’s why he lost.
Johnson Kenneth Jackson Sharon Walker Daniel
Sad thing is if CW just manned up he would have won easily.
Lewis Daniel Rodriguez Patricia White Michelle
Lmao ik what nick meant but “gimme that kawhi Leanord bounce” is crazy😂
imagine dealing with a kid throwing a tantrum then giving him candy afterwards crazy work
Wowwwwwwww!!!! 🤣 1st off that shot at 25:00 from Nick gotta be the greatest shot in Creator League history! 😂 And Chris, got some serious problems up stairs that gotta be worked on (4real) , that was definitely offensive foul at the end by you, yall were both stopped up an you charged him out the way then acted tough like you was gone stand on it, walked off said you was done, and came back like a dude who swore he gone break it off wit his chick but back in love lol this was wild
Hernandez Jeffrey Taylor Thomas Taylor Ronald
Nick has no bag
@crswht read the comments lmao no one likes you 😂😂
Crs wants to black so bad 😂😂😂
Crs blames everything and everyone but himself when he misses a shot 😂.
Nick briz is fucking ass bro
Bro 14:01 Chris really complaining about nick playing HIS game and using his own abilities to his advantage. Meanwhile him playing with all of his bodyweight isn’t corny lmaooo
Clearly offensive foul
Chris sucks
Idk but still riding with Chris 😅
Throwing those elbows. Can't elbows and body shot his way bigger. Hard stop him give everything stop him
Complaining about posting up a point guard and yet you chose to go against him. Stop complaining
Briz is kind of garbage honestly lol. At least chris has moves and a nice shot, post up
Nick can't make a shot to save his life.
The biggest white guy who acts like a black guy ive ever seen. lol Does he know he looks pathetic?
"He took my leg out" Really bro??
Yea, that's not a foul. That's a mouse in the house or who little brother is this
That cocaines definitely getting to his head thinking he can talk to Chris like that 😭
Music is so fitting for this game but disrespect lol
Biggest baby ever!!!!!  Listen to those excuses!
Chris has NOTHING except his size.
CRRWST DESERVE W. GG. BRO
Most ridiculous match up - totally unfair , fw both of em but never seen so much complaining from someone who calls everyone else big babies on the court and only way nick had a real chance is if he hit all his 3 point attempts or ran him around to tire him - which was also heavily complained about
Someone needs to humble this dumb nigga Chris bro he’s so fucking annoying fr
Big boy is a crybaby for real
Chris said the ball slipped out of his hand prolly 9 times.. Stop making excuses for being so trash.
why cant nick wear socks? always no socks. Must be slippery in that thang
They both are trash cans 🤦
😂😂😂 not a good look for Chris…ran off like a baby from Nick
15:40
Bro got a tech in a pickup game 😂
29.95 he’s taking my leg out 😂😂 no contact
Cry baby.  All he do is cry cry cry
Chris is a fake bully and cries about everything too big and grown enough to be with the b*******🤔
Man took a whole 15 min intermission between the end of the game
Chris complained about every single thing in the game against a player a fraction of his size lol
Like even when theres not an excuse he can think of, like he literally comes up with anything. He missed a 3 and then blamed his bracelet. Like bro ur 40 years old crying like a baby.
Chris has an excuse for everything if it doesnt go his way. He is like a 5 year old built in a fat tall old guy pushing 30.
Chris is definition of white and has braids. Wannabe black, you suck bro.
Fatboy is a crybaby  bit fr
“baby food”?? bro is the biggest baby i’ve seen.
"I play street ball" what a joke. Who leaves a gym so dramatically and then returns. What a troll. If I was 60 lbs heavier than my opponent I wouldn't be saying a word
Slick nick Can't shoot
“He took my leg out!!!” As he was literally already back on the ground but just had one leg up in the air. The shot was already coming off the backboard, bro already landed, and he’s screaming “but he took my leg out”
Don't invite this guy ever again (Chris) doesn't deserve anymore attention.
Nick is THE Biggest fg in the YouTube bb arena
Nick’s shot is so horrible. I’m yelling at the screen stop shooting
Chris has zero left hand.
Ref can call a T for slamming ball but cant call game for dude walking off n quiting...ok
Boggles my mind that Chris has never got himself into good shape. He would be a lot better if he lost some fat and put on more muscle. He’s got the genetics to be a unit.
It's crazy how people don't call travel on Nick, bro be jumping a inch in the air when he dribbles
This big ninja Chris complains so damn much got damn! Bruh and he's big AF 🤣 😭
Nick needs to just take it in stop shooting
Chris is biggest complainer he ain’t even hoopin as much as complaining
Bro I watched both wide open layups he missed and he should've made them both. The first he had zero legs to jump and the second if he had a left hand he would have put it up left, but he doesn't so the angle was off and that's why he missed it. He just makes up excuses for everything and cries when he's not in control of the game.
Bro this game lit big boy the goat lol
You cry alot man
Both of them some babies
Wtf Nick why did you just spit on the gym floor .
And they’re friends again lol
How does any of these ppl tolerate this dude Chris?
Dude cries about the dude exploiting him being outta shape but litterally just bully’s dude with his weight
cant believe how many moron in the comments actula side with Nick Briz lol. The guy is a straight up fkn phony. I real BAN
If I was nick I would keep having Chris chase me all over the court just to wear him out and hear him complaining 😂
Chris threw a mad elbow on that play.  Then he acted like he didn't 😂
Chris needed that crybaby intermission he pulled at the end. Had to go outside for some tissues and oxygen. 🤧😂
They’re both so lame and annoying, why I stopped watching pickup Basketball it got so repetitive and the creators became so dramatic.
They both need to put the ball down.  The worst 1v1 I've ever seen.  Can't shoot. More bricks and air balls then points.  I've watched a lot of 1v1 and this was funny.  Building house with all those bricks.  Crs is a baby 👶🤧. Wtf you talking about.  Im a baby
C.W. Stand for crybaby wimp
I work on Brooklyn Bridge and would love to see him play. Would love to see him crybaby through a whole game and get his ass whooped.
CRS is a crybaby mofo
i've never seen someone complain so much...
I don’t trust you if you don’t wear socks
Definitely an offensive foul. Glad you finished the game like a man and got the win though.
I dont understand why they don't invite people like Jlaw or Devin since they invite Marcel anyway. Maybe Aj as well?
These dudes corny asf. Neither can hoop LMAO
Had to watch in mute because crswht wouldn't stfu and just hoop
Too many wanna be harden or curry shots trying to hard wer ur jump shots inside game
Went took a fatttt ass line in the car he was fienen
i thought chris was a big idiot the whole time but nick actually does play dirty...
Why dont ppl like nick? What did i miss. Mind u havent kept up since chris stopped messin with him i fell off with the scene completely.
😭😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought the dude in red had a foreign accent for the first 25mins of this video
lowest iq ballers ive ever seen
How is this guy still so out of shape ??😂
If Chris would just get in shape he would be a beast. He has no stamina
why does nick's shooting form look like hes heaving a halfcourt shot at the end of the half
Definitely an elbow
like everyone watching know both theses guys are trash right?
Damn nick how could u miss this much?
If Nick had any basketball IQ he would’ve won. Big mans 2 Big Macs from a hospital bed and he keeps hoisting up bricks like hes rebuilding NYC.
This guy is the complete opposite of the term stoic
That’s like getting the trophy for being the recess player of the year!
force chris left and hes screwed
You play street ball!!! Lmao! You crying about fouls! Just play through it!!!
Big man crying like a fat little hungry toddler!!! 😂 basketball is about dribbling, crossing your opponent! Taking him to the hole every chance you get! But big man is fat and tired from the start of game 1! He couldn’t breathe! Nick dribbles a lot because he playing ball, so now play some D fat man!!!
Too fat lol
Nick briz is a bum
This is definitely not good content. Crs NEEDS TO STOP CRYINGGGG!!!
Nick can finally shut up now that he got beat lmao …trash player crying about an elbow when he in there throwing his whole body around 😢😂🤡🤣
big dude needs to work on his stamina. dude was done after the first 5 mins.
Pobre corazón de ese tremendo chancho weon
Who woulda thought a big lump of stank mash potatoe woulda just bullied everyone down to win. Lol
Nick has been playing hoop for years and still can’t shoot for 💩
Chris a big crybaby 😅
I’m not a creator, but is there anyway I can set up a 1 on 1 with Chris? 😂 easy money/content
Hahaha.  This guy is like a Saturday Night Live character…A cheese ball
I’ve seen more composer from my 4 year old nephew
No cap he was throwing his body into him .
The world is full of DELUSIONAL PEOPLE
Damn Chris still crying an lying he took my leg out really Chris he didn’t even touch u
If nick had a Trevor Dunbar bag he woulda scooped Chris but GGz 😂
I can’t stand this crybaby punkass grow tf up you B
Toxica
So driving to the basket is zero bag according to chris white
Phata$$ CRS did all that just so he Could rest😂😂
Brahhhhh I wish I could have these 30 plus minutes of my life back!! I waisted watching Chris big self cry!!
Chris is the biggest crybaby on YouTube period
grown man smh
This can’t be basketball
These two back in love or what
Cris is the biggest b!tch I've ever seen. Bro you almost took his fucking head off with that elbow!
U’d be stumbling drunk 😜
Boy I don’t know Chris, for someone that calls out “fuckin babies” you sure did a lot of crying in that game lol but unfair to begin with with nick being a point guard and you being a post, nick should have gased you in the first game
Biggest fucking crybaby there is but acts like a bully on the court.  You have that big a size advantage just stfu and play.
I said it before and I'll say it again i can't watch crswht play, he cries for everything
They literally have refs 😅 you cant blame Nick for that
He's always complaining about cry baby's and he quits ha ha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is u white tryna be black?😂 or is you black tryna be white? can't really tell with the hair and the fatt belly don't know who u tyrna be???? Not haten just wondering?
they're both dogshit at ball, shits a disgrace
This is garbage . Nic can't shoot
Both out of shape. And
Chris is a baby. If you’re not gonna respect the call of the officials you hired, don’t play. Simple as that.
😂 Nick just know how to push buttons.
This Chris dude is an embarrassment.
Damn bro give chris his milk back he's maaad big baby lol
29:45 he was nowhere near you bruh 😂
Bunch of cry babies I’d whoop all they asses on the court!💯💯💯🤫
Ik Julian happy to see this😹😹
Both of yall is 🗑️
Nick getting a T sent me bro 🤣🤣🤣
BS CALLLLLL WTFFFF
Complainer leauge
I don't know any of these guys but CRSWHT seems like a real douche. Yelling out whenever the opponent shoots, whines on every possession. Loser.
Nick should’ve been fouled out 😂 Chris did good no doubt and that elbow was clean nbs‼️
Both just ass 😂😂
noooo josh....his boyfriend trying help him calm down @35:42
The culture vulture is the perfect example of "Im taking my ball and going home dude"
I made a choice over a year ago if Chris is not the video do not watch after watching this today I’m so glad I made that decision what a lame frfr
CHRIS HE DID NOT TOUCH YOUR LEG
*lucky shot goes in* REACTION: .....STOP STOP STOP STOP!!!!!!!
Who cares if your opponent is complaining about your play style lol. It is a positive for you if he doesn't like how you are playing. He is complaining because he is having trouble guarding it. Chris wants every opponent to be smaller than him but also play like him.
"You got me f'ed up" is possibly the most annoying yet hilarious phrase when it is used because of why it is used lol. People say it while trying to sound tough but it admits weakness. Another man's actions triggered and controlled his emotions - that action being that he called a foul on him.
Does nick have a condition that makes him move his body like he is talking to someone? His good at basketball no doubt but fr question
Nick is 🚮
This is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen
yall a buncha bums. no wonder its a creator league yall aint got 1 real hooper there beside nelson and cam in the back. buncha clowns lmao
I hate Nick but cris had me rooting for Nick
36:36 man nick so trash be talking trash like he good or something lol
34:55 man dude so soft flopping and being over dramatic 🤣😂 man play basketball stop being so soft
Yeah bro you elbowed him lmao
chris jus needed a water break, nick needed 4 possessions to win game just play he had the game.
This looks better here than on MAX 😂
chris an L
Unpopular but true point. Nick fouled Chris before Chris fouled him on the last play
😢😢😢
nick does not know how to play fkn defense.
big white baby.....
Never in my life did I think I would root for Nick…. I rooted for Nick
Chris with the Veteran move. Got all that stamina back 😂
Chris white is soft! Damn newborn non stop crying
Respect to both athletes
29:46 was a disgrace. Good defense Nic.
Fat boy is SO out of shape, he does this complaining BS to catch his breath!!!!!
Get rid of this chris dude. I enjoy these videos. I even watch this on HBO MAX. But this complaining dude. Is ridiculous and makes me want to change the channel.
Say what you want about Chris but he do got a bag . People rooting for nick need to remember he the reason everything fell apart
creator league collaborated with Maury/Springer and got cameras following guest to the parking lot and back 😆
Crswht is a 12 year old girl in a 40 year old man’s body crying after every play
Why aren’t these guys in the NBA or at least the NBDL
U know that screaming Hoo in ur opponents face is a technical.
Crswht is the biggest bxxxx in that stadium... Damn. Wanna be black so bad.
They’re both a**holes.. I don’t know who I want to win here.
I thought a little kid was coming out to congratulate nick then realized it was Julian lol
Play street all but whine the entire fucking game, crazy
He’s throwing his body lol you have a 100 lbs on him 😂
Chris so out of shape it’s actually bad
1 v 1 is literally a 3 point competition I mean wtf was this!
The amount of fear nick plays with should be investigated … someone teach this man how to defend himself… only reason he loses now
How does one cry about dribbling and running too much? That’s the most core fundamental of the game of basketball.
That was a good call lmaoo, it was clear as day
These matchups need to be determined off weight this big dude crying like he not 230+ playing against 150+ pounders man then claiming he plays street ball but crying Chris your horrible man any other basketball setting you’d get dusted
Offensive foul. Go Nick. Chris biggest cry baby 👶
These guys are just a bunch of primidone babies that think they can ball. So tired of YouTube making people seem like they are good at something. It's getting crazy
fat guy gassed out after the first 3 pointer.
Yo Chris, that jump shot is just getting smoother and smoother. Just stop leaving and causing a scene when the whistle doesn’t go your way. You a big dude, you gonna have to overcome that adversity and not let bball get you too hyped. Cause i know how it be, adrenaline flowing so you just going with whatever 😂
Chris a CRYBABY 😢 LOL get outta here lol  no wonder people always try to fight him in street ball this guy a sucka 😏
They’re both trash lowkey ☠️☠️☠️
play D tight , not like he’s going to blow by you 😂
I was rooting for Nick this time. Damn gg 😂
Nick Briz is a white 6 foot Giannis dude really doesn't have a bag he just hopes he can beat you with that first step.
Chris is so bad he has no handle he complains about everything only was he can score us backing down smaller people   And nik is no better he literally has no moves and a weird jump shot why are these two idiots playing one on one on you tube where people can watch I guess I’m watching it because it’s hilarious
They are both so bad at basketball it’s actually funny to watch
Battle of the Crybaby Complainers😩😫😭😭🤣🤣💯💁🏽‍♂️
Where is this court located?
big ass baby
this grown ass man legit said “i wake up fucking your girlfriend” as an insult 💀
30:00 he kicks his leg out talking bout he took my leg out. 😂😂
Dude too big to complain so much!!🤦🏾‍♂️
If I was Nick I would have did a lay up every single time and tire him out. Crs it’s called basketball not shoot a 2 ball. Such a cry baby. Change your name to crybabywht.
chris is trash. he is only big but the rest of his game is trash!
No elbows big fella. Offensive foul all day
Good win Nick. Don’t even need to get to the end to see and don’t care if you won truthfully. But good win.
If they were half decent at anything they'd do 3 dribbles only😮‍💨
Man is like 30 acting like a kid
Bro is the biggest baby ever😂😂 wants all the calls while posting up ppl that was half his size
bunch of crybabies
dont like nick, but lowkey had me rooting for him. cris is insufferable. what a b$tch
Fat boy..killed some time to catch his breath..u aint slick
Whatever happen to getting ur own rebound ya taking breaks , playing lil to no defense
Big baby!!  Laughable
Chris travelled on the last play before he left
Chris I like you bro but you post him up stop crying
Chris got that c pap type of breathing
Is that chriswhitttte....or spice Adam's with the jab step??
At the end when Chris was saying he took his leg out😭😭 that on was crazy
Crs is the biggest baby out of all the creators. Stop crying pusss
"good take, running bullshit LOL"
Nick been hitting the gym.
Man, I could not believe how much Chris was bitching and complaining. He really is a giant man child lmao. He was making me want Nick to beat him so badly (even though I figured Nick wouldn’t) 😂 I also hated how much of an asshole he is/was being. Like, when Nick tried to apologize for scratching him and Chris didn’t accept it, and even tried to say Nick did it on purpose. That kind of pissed me off tbh. Chris clearly still has issues with Nick (and probably vice versa) but I thought they got passed that stuff. Even to the point where they’d start running together again. Guess maybe that was short lived. Or maybe they are cool but are both still competitive with big egos and are trying to win lol. Both guys got issues but Nick came off as the bigger/better person here lol. Like, Chris usually complains a lot but I think he did it moreso this time because he really wanted to beat Nick specifically. At least this wasn’t clickbait, because it really was toxic lol
Big crybaby asz...big as he is and crying every call....wanna be a thug but crying like a girl...big out of shape asz😂😂😂...sorry as hail
Only reason pussy bitchass crs wins in pick up (which is where he should stay hooping) is because he calls everything a foul and intimidates people to give him all his calls. He’s not good at basketball at all.
Chris is actually garbage at hoops
Dude sounds like he needs a breathing machine and it’s not even half way through the first game lol.
Hes mad about running. buddy backing down.
Chris walked away because he needed a breather. Let’s be honest. 😂
The more I watch crswht lately the less I’m starting to fw him
chris saying tech after very plays is pure comedy bro
Chris is lame af. Guy is a huge baby.
At one point Chris was blowing up.  Then his own ego took himself right out.  Shoulda never stabbed Nck in the back in the beginning of it all
Nick got those Brisk Iced Tea training tights underneath….
4:18 did dude complain about RUNNING in basketball? Lol
Chris wouldn’t last in TNC
chris is a big baby
Chris’ leg doesn’t even move “HE TOOK MY LEG OUT”
Bro nick has no bag at all
Briz has the ugliest pull up jumper I've seen in 40 years but some how effective
Chris #1 hater
Grown ass man crying like a child😂
Nick is terrible
29:48- HE TOOK MY LEG OUT LMAOOOO SO WEAK
My mans needed to catch his breath 😂 he knew he was gone keep playing
This is the worse basketball I’ve ever watched 😂
What tf this some emotionally driven clout chasing dropout broke boy basketball frfr. Wow depressing stuff
These are to soft ass cry babies  no cap! It’s embarrassing
Chris is too big to be acting like a toddler
bruh, you cant kick your leg out and then complain when it gets hit haha weaakkkkkk
So happy nick lost
He threw his shoulder in him
The white jersey is the biggest/phattest baby I’ve seen
josh built like a roblox character
yall forgot where chris dominated game 1 without complaining at all. i dont like the whining either but they all do it he just made nick look like he doesnt but he def does. "0 bag alert" had me rolling tho. 😂
As somebody who is new to the community and don't know any of these dudes, I was definition rooting for Nick. Chris was acting like my 3 year old cousin with a temper tantrum every play.
3 dribbles and 7 seconds to shoot from check in
I used to be a fan of Chris but not after me seeing how much he cries!!! Big baby ass… n he a fake ass thug 😂😂
So bro is an overweight and out of shape "hooligan" who uses his size as a clear advantage in the post when his 3s arent hitting....fair play....and Nick uses his athleticism and creates space so essentially do the same thing in the post to create the same opportunity. Chris is a fool and a crybaby and i was rooting for Nick the entire time. What a loser
Why would anyone wanna see this matchup. Mismatch?
🔥That's quality entertainment right there🔥 They were in each other's head from start to finish!
Why does nick think he's some elite shooter?
Gets well rested and hydrated, alright check up the ball.
Nic is trash stop shooting yo¡🚮
Crswht is such a cry baby dude lmao cries when nick used his advantage but went to his advantage every time.  All while crying about every single play that happens that doesn't go his way.
This dude Chris is choking on his neck fat all game long bro lmfao
Can’t stand that dirty as fool in the white
Dude gets tired after the third possession ☠️😂 work on cardio big man geez
LMFAO @ "He took my leg out!"🤣🤣🤣
Chris white is trash, Briz didn’t play him smart, the smaller much more athletic Briz should have moved a lot and I mean a lot more around the arc and wore Chris big butt down. The only reason he’s doing all this complaining and walking off is he’s tired. Keep him on the court , press him with a lot of lateral movement get him tired.
At 34:20 before the controversial offensive foul, Chris traveled lol
29:50 Chris definitely just smoked the layup, he didn’t expect to be that open lol
Chris left.. went to his car and grabbed water.. complained the whole way there that he's leaving.. came back in.. sat down.. argued some more.. the continued to play 6-3 (Game point)
Man did all that just to get rest in lmao
Can not stand Chris. This league be grabbing up dregs for real
Stop inviting this man back its not even fun to watch it is so trash some 30 something year old man who weighs 100 pounds more than everyone is foot taller just backs everyone down and cries non stop as soon as something doesnt go his way its pathetic
Crs was gassed
I’m confident the way to beat Chris everytime drive hard get him running. Pull back to three point line. Shoot a couple 3’s. He’s jumping the rest of the game off that one sequence mans isn’t conditioned enough to play a long game. I could be wrong.
These two on their own are annoying and somehow Chris makes Nick look good here lol
What is it with this nick dude wanting to shoot 3s when he has a broke ass shot lmao real reason he lost against this fat dude lol
Crwh took it to Nick, I'm glad he beat him
Bro cris gotta be the the worst creator league
Chris can hoop for his build but end of the day he is just a big fat crybaby 😢 🍔 🍟
crswht too damnn big ta be cryin like dis 😂😂😂😂
Nahhhh NGL... That elbow was crazy though big hoolie
Man I wish there was a prizepicks for content creator games...
Grande malo y llorón jajajaj
Should’ve been 3 dribbles
Stop putting crs against guards.
Big fella ant got no gas tank cuh 😂
Chris “BigBaby” White … his new name, the most annoying fu**ing player on YT, literally a damn kid
that call was BS he was litterally jumping into you lmao but you complain to much about his stragety LMAO so I felt it was deserved LMAO
Imagine complaining about running around and dribbling in basketball? Lmfao😂😂 clown💀🤡
LMAO @crswht don't blame @nickbrizfull for using his stragety to run around your big ass, you are stronger and heavier than him. You use your advantage of backing him down and yet you are the only one complaining LMAO. You can't have your cake and eat it too, besides if I was playing you that would be my stragety to make sure I wear you down like that. Only problem is I might wear myself down first LOL #crswht #nickbrizfull
9:15 wth was that call, he was backing up and Nick was flying all over the court no foul lol
Chris sucks just big no cap
Big fella out of breath so fast just take him to the hole every time
Chris is actually such a baby, man that sucked to watch
Bro didn’t even touch your leg 😂😂😂😂
Why you bitchin just because other players don’t play like you??
1000 I’ll bust they ass they trash
29:42 det was a smart move he a big man crying over every shot he miss he didnt even touch him
Someone need to advice crswhtto start fighting wrestling 😂😂
"I only missed because he hit my arm"😢😢😢😂😂
This fat dudes shamgods and stepbacks are always so slow and hilarious 😂
28:17 “ he just runs and starts zero bag “ after getting blown by with a crossover
He’s just fat lmao
These dudes are kinda bad at ball 😂
Where did Chris carry on that point at all lol he started to lose control of the ball gathered it and went up for the layup lol.
As much as I don’t like Chris and his crying, he played real ball
Bro that spot where he said "he took my leg out" bro didn't even touch him at all😂😂
Plz kick him out d league. Yo attitude is wats disgusting
Dis man to old to b doing all dat.  Omg.
Grown man that size complaining this much is a real issue 🤢
Leave then drama queen
Lol the fact he so mad about him running and using the court
How does Chris hoop so much and is still that fat?
Lol he said running bullshit 😂 what do you think is required in a game of basketball big dude a baby 🍼
You could literally just dribble to the rim and back to the 3 point line like 3 times and then just score super easy after that cuz Chris can’t breathe
Nice air balls Chris, you’re trash
Chris is a dirty player but complains about everything… make it make sense.
The battle of the assholes
Nick complaining even though Chris pounded him to the ground twice first games on layups, lol. Both NIck and Chris are entertaining to watch, but sometimes Chris's whining can get to ya, Nick was chill.  Chris bro you gotta get to working out bro, ya worry me out there with the heavy breathing.. Entertaining!!  : )
Man I used to be a fan of Chris but after seeing him be such a big baby about nothing and about getting his leg kicked ECT man this just embarrassing for him he put him self in a really really bad cry baby light everything he bitched about was never even a fail or contact or anything he looks worse them lebron complaining
Imagine if Chris played football. He would have been a heck of an offensive tackle because of the way he moves
This is sad, props to Nick for actually being a better person recently, Chris needs to grow tf up
Bro nick flopped like crazy. Y’all tripping
Chris out there breathing like Tony Soprano
I don’t love how either of these dudes carry themselves on the court. And how does Nick not go by that dude settling for step back pull-ups with a weak jumper over a big dude.
How is bro not embarrassed he threw a full temper tantrum just to come back and play
I’d cook the both of you an I ain’t got no ACL in my left knee
EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS. Stop bitching and play.
Nick Bria is ass Chris if funny and better
Imagine how better and dominant Chrisp would be if he dropped all that extra weight. That hard breathing isn't healthy brother.
Chris makes it hard to be a fan fr
Chris plays like a pussy boy ngl😂
Chris a bum fr hate his complaining ass
Just started this vid n this is the matchup I’ve wanted to see for a long time.  Speed and quickness against size and strength
“We’re back outside”  You’re inside.
Look how big you are 😂
No es tan bueno como el and 1 pero de algo a  ver series jaja 😂
Theres a reason bitchen rhymes with kitchen, Chris anit himself when hes hungry😂😂😂
Chris so trash 😂
Chris man stop the crying man why all your wins have to have controversy? Talk your stuff and win but all that I am not playing stuff bro come on
Nick Briz I respect
There's a reason he's referred to as Nick BRICK
He knew he needed a break. Typical cry baby stuff
Why doesn't fat boy get into shape if this is what he does?
Nick is athletic fo sho, but his bball iq is non exisistent
That's a bucket not a foul on Chris game time
Nick fouling fasure, but you gotta play through it when your bigger you not gonna get the same treatment unfortunately
I really hate both of these dudes but I actually wanted nick briz to win just because Chris complains about EVERYTHING
He the bully that’s only a bully cause he’s bigger than everyone else punk mf
there should be a dribble limit in these
Nicks the only winner here, overall Chris, the league, and especially the viewers lost on this one, way too infuriating to watch in the future
Not a fan of either of them but the nick dude refused to play into his own strengths and then jacked up 3s like he was shooting from half court he jumps so far foward into each shot and missed back rim bc of it every time dude can't stop going forward
These guys suuuuuukkkk
And these guys suck, big boys unstoppable down low because of his size
If you arent complaining, crying, blaming the refs, and claiming conspiracy theories every play are you even playing basketball? Chris was definitely playing today.
Chris is so wack man 😂 mad af because nick is in shape and wearing him down meanwhile going straight to post game on a smaller player.
Fat white boys who ball always 😭 crybabies
🚮
This was insanely cringe for 2 mediocre wanna be iso players lol.
Bro if you can’t shoot stay off the line work the middy briz basketball iq is me in elementary
It’s just something about briz that when he talks I get angered 😂
Y’all hating on Chris for crying and I mean I get it but you can’t deny he’s a bucket.
"U got me f'd up"lol dude sound like a black women
Chris is trash 🗑️ complaining about nicks style, complaining because he’s outta breath and can’t guard the run dribble… Leave Chris outta these tourney plays, “he’s a baby!”…
Nick briz or nick bricks … dayum
You gotta respect, Chris White, stepping up and taking responsibility for that missed layup… In a one on one game.
I love this, because it lets every kid in the world feel like they can be famous for basketball too! I think that’s an amazing gift.
Crs does cry to much
crswht makes me cringe.
Can’t belive this dudes play for money man crazy u can really be anything u wanna be
Imma be honest I’ve been watching nick for a long while. Ever since his first jump tutorials.. bros looking washed in all seriousness.
Good leave!!  Chris always thinks they are out to get him!!! He is corny!!!!
Yea he’s 100 lb heavier but also just better than Nick briz and kinda beat him everywhere…not saying Im a fan of dude, he’s bitching and complaining but in bball when you can move and dribble and shoot like that at his size that makes him eons better than Nick who just tries to break past him zero set up moves besides backing up to get momentum then an ugly 3 at about 10-15% accuracy if it doesn’t work which he only got a lay up on him 4 or 5 times in 2 games. I think he took 1 mid range the whole time.  Not very many ways to beat a guy 1 on 1.
Chris sayin he took his leg out in the air is crazy he can’t even lift up his leg
Two warlocks going at each other 😂😂
Nick is so trash he literally does the same move every single time 😂😂😂
I miss the days when we actually called cringe content CRINGE 😐
That was a bs call
Every hooper know that u can complain as much as u want, but once u keep holding the ball and wasting time u getting smacked
Nick is so cringe every single play holy f* why does he walk like that and say the corny things he does
7:44 so cringe. He knew exactly where it was and tried to play it off until Chris said “heads” so he would grab the ball 😂
How you always scream “He’s a BABY” while acting like a baby the whole game! 😭😭😭
Could you imagine losing the best of 3 to Chris the Tooligan? He's literally breathing like he's about to die at 4-0. 😂😂 Nick's hop, skip, and a jump shot wasn't falling.
These 2 crybabies make that lil dwarf Julian seem like a non complainer. The refs don't get paid enough to listen to all this whining for 3 games.
Wait a minute.. so this Crybaby just won the whole tournament 🤦🏿‍♂️😂
Chris makes you not like him even when you might want to
Chris a fuckin baby fr
It’s so hard to watch Chris cuz he cry sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much
No disrespect chris but u drop 25lbs to 35lb you will be so much faster but still big enough to bang low....  still lov ya my guy, destroy nic jizz
Chris is embarrassing af
big dude has like over 80lbs on the the other guy and crying like a bi*ch every time there's contact🤣
Chris is trash 🗑️
chris white did that whole tantrum to catch his breathe and to make sure that nick briz starts cramping up because he knows thats how nicks body works, the minute chris walked out that building it should have been a forfeit, the refs were even siding with Chris most of the game, he was clearly throwing elbows and carrying the ball, nick should have won this game and chris is the biggest baby i have ever seen in my life, he can not be 560 pounds and missing layups on point guards, enough said.
I really cant stand people who dish it out and cant take it! Why I stopped watching Chris, is a thug and injures people but cries about everything towards him!
Chris a big Ass goofy
Nick with the beard is trash 🏀😂
I’m not even gonna lie, that was not an offensive foul at the end. All these comments hating on Chris… y’all pssy. That was not a foul.
Bro Chris is hilarious 😂😂
Nick really got no bag 😂. Bro got two dribble moves
chris definitely fouled him on that game winner lay up. Bro dead smacked his whole arm before the gathered the ball
He did lift his legs and he didn’t let him land
Bro in the white definitely more skilled
Wtf kinda of ball is this?? 😂😂 no D no Hustle they’re just chucking shots and complaining. 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
His name is Josh not Chris 😂
Nahhh I would pay to see what would have happened if Chris lost game 3 😭
This might be the weakest comp ive seen for a you tube basketball tournament
My man tries to jump scare the shooter like this is middle school.
Why did Nick spit on the court at the beginning
Chris is a Baby!😆
Apparently there needs to be oxygen tanks on standby.
Chris is up 6-3 and about to quit, but what he is really up to is catching his breath trying to get that wind. 🍿😂
“He took my leg out.” 🍿😂
Bro needs to take a hint. Can’t shoot 3s but keep trying until you’re 5 from 50
They both so trash
#3 should be banned from this league, geesh he’s big and soft asf. SMH not watching this ish no more
Fat boy mad he can’t play defense lmaoooo
great tournament well battled by everyone
why do we watch a whole bunch of dudes that cant hoop?  yall know we have the wnba already right
Bruh nick is f trashhhhh 😂
He’s in my feet😂😂😂
All i hear is complaining so lame get some real ballers in here
Nick is actually bagless lol
Chris White is annoying. Never misses a shot that didn’t “slip” and his breathing needs to get mixed out of the audio. He sounds like Bane.
"I play streetball" this isn't streetball ball dickhead💀Biggest bum on YT
“he really fouled me on the reach” was a bold face lie
Go head Chris you did what you had to  good stuff getting the W a win is win 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾
nick would of beaten him,  chris is not that good. just a big guy
For Chris to be 260 he soft as charmin
I don't like chris white and his dumb hoolies crap, and I was rooting for nick but man....nick was really throwing and running his body into chris when chris backed him down... and it just wasn't 1, 2, 3, or 4 times... it was a lot. nick had his chance to do this thing by running around arc to get a running 3pointer but didn't hit his shots.
Chris Wright is such a Diva. BYE BYE BYE as he's walking back inside. STFU and check the ball
I forgot they came up together
Wht should be embarrassed
Savage squad is what got me into watching YouTube hoopers
Is crs is a content creator tho
Nick might be the dumbest hooper 😂 look how big Chris is and you shooting 4500 threes. No bag, no shot, no grace around the rim 😂 Idek how he got this far fr
imagine gettin mad cuz you have to play defense 🤣
Lmaooo how do I never see this again
Can’t believe they actually have an award to a person who “quit” midgame, drank some water, took a seat. And then came back into the game.
Make him think you were going to shoot them go for the lay
Doesn’t matter how annoying Chris is, watching nicks 5% 3-point shooting is worse
Chris you were being a pussy in this ngl
Crswht think he slick..he pulled that “quitting” stunt to get a breather 😂😂😂
I’m actually a fan of both these guys but this was frustrating to watch
Chris wht is a b@#ch a@$ cry baby.... all that size and crying because he tapping you he wired.
That was the most blatant elbow I’ve ever seen
If your a real shooter somebody jumping at you shouldn’t mess up your shot
Chris really took a break and camed back 😂
Above all else, Chris knows how to get his REST lol
Imagine being that big and being the biggest crybaby in all of sports
Both of them is trash fr
@crswht you good and all but GOLLY, complaining every play on offense AND defense? Maaane just play ball and toughen up. If you don't get the foul call quit tryna change the refs mind, it's not going to work lmfao
It never makes sense to me  how guys who have handles equal to middle schoolers r “YouTube ballers”
do people actually watch chris? that was fkn painful   he's fat and out of shape  he complains that his opponent is running around, and dribbling, and throwing his body... when he is pretty much only backing him down and throwing his body and if he gets the slightest touch he cries like a baby for a foul...i don't know how i watched this whole video...  biggest baby ive seen
when he left, Nick should have won by default. Wtf is this video?
Chris WHT so cringe, never seen someone complain so hard smh he's ahhh baaabyyy
Did chris get a t like nick did when slammed the ball??? Holy dude left building crying like a new born
The biggest baby in the game
This big ass baby..same as backing him down..stfu
I can’t lie Chris is nice dude just cry to much I wanna see him against ball life or friga guys
Bro chris..stfu and play
This big ass baby makes excuses for everything😂😂😂
Chris said running bs..same as backing down small dudes
1.Crswht can take him in the paint all day 2 nick that was a flop
as someone whos 6'3 230 we never get calls just cause we are big shits lame it is what it is happens in the nba too bias calls based on size
CRSWHT is absolute cry baby trash!
Nick has no bag, wow
Nick scared
If Chris wasn’t the size of an Ogre, playing that sorry post move every time…he would zero game.
That nonsense that Chris pulled at the end was only done so Chris could take a break. Honestly, I’ve never seen a grown man cry so much and manipulate a 1v1 so hard. Game 3 should’ve been scratched after Chris and his nonsense and game 3 should start over. What a sad way to hoop.
the beef between these two is crazy 😭 idek if it’s beef but these two got hella tension
That first game Chris was ballin….only went to the rack twice….do ya homework
Chris is a cry baby and complains about everything in his favor
Battle of the mental issues.
lol let’s just do a celebrity boxing match
Nick and Chris to busy tryna be the toughest but I like bitg them jits game tho
He walked out and did all that cus his ahh was tired lmao goofy boy
Bro was throwing tantrum every time where’s his tech man y’all need to hire new refs
Whyte new sponsor is Kotex
Good complain artist badge
This is the cringiest crap I’ve seen. Amazes me how a d grade player like Nick can be getting paid when his got 0 iq basketball 🤣 and then u got this fatso Chris who just complains like a man child. Walks out and then comes back. Cheaters don’t last long in anything… just saying facts no toxicity. This generation is so cringe man wtf…
Chris did the Kenny chow 😂
Bro is a grown man crying
This man complained every game..please don’t bring him back
That running around that Chris is complaining about is because it is exploiting his weakness and that is his conditioning. They are playing on a "basketball" court and Nick can use any part of it he so chooses. Nick should have been doing that every play because it made Chris tired and made Nicks baskets easy. I would have just drove in without shooting and returned to the 3 point line several times every possesion until all Chris could do is rest his hands on his knees.
This is what you call low level basketball. This should not be put on youtube.
Crs was tired after he scored his first 5 points 😂😂😂😂 all you gotta do is tire him out and make his big ass chase you lmaoooo
I’m so confused they’re playing 1 on 1 half court. No rebounding and clearing the ball?  This is pure garbage and athleticism at its lowest
Obviously these games are trash but it’s funny to watch ppl who don’t play real ball get mad when there are refs
24:46 where’s the foul?! 🤣🤣🤣
Chris needs to work on his stamina
Can we get friga back on here to shut them both up please
Why yall dont show Mk no love ? 1v1's !
How long are nicks fucking nails 😅😅
Crswht eats corn 🌽  the long way
Elbowed the crap outta him
I probably wont watch creator league again man, too many people with just hot air up their asses, like man play ball, y'all aren't in the nba
He so out of shape he left for a breather
They should have deleted the whole last game ….
"A little blood never hurt nobody." -Suge Knight
I just wanna know where he took ya leg out chris ? I rewind it 3 times my dude you’re the biggest cry baby in the world of basketball you a grown ass man ! All you have is excuses & nick is trash but you can barely beat him
HIM
Chris is the biggest one here but acts the most dramatic
I'm finna unsubscribe cause Chris is da biggest baby ever! Anytime I c Chris face on a video I will not watch! He cries about everything an nun! Simply pathetic! 😂
Unlimited dribbles is awful to watch…should be 3 max
Should be disqualified for taking time to get breathers that gave him advantage and he didnt get a tech this league a joke
Bro I wanted nick to win so bad to shut Chris up cuz he’s low key like such a child
Nick shoulda went in his mouth after the girlfriend comment that ain’t basketball
Nick shoulda attacked him in the beginning big was gassed
Definitely not HIM 😂😂😂 cried every possession. Back down only move Chris had saying Nick don't got a bag 😂😂😂
This bout worse then Kenny completely giving up his game against MK a year ago
No man oversized with handles and elite post scorer ability should ever complain this much. Mad annoying. U cant do much but hope the person miss when you’re undersized guarding a post scorer. Chris gotta stop the complaining and deal with it
Nick is the biggest complainer. Such a baby.
Bruh..
Never thought I would root for Nick Briz
Crswht was being nice. He could have destroyed Nick if he really wanted to.
chris threw that bs tantrum to catch his breath
29:44 this nigga Chris is crazy dude is the basketball “bully” n cryin cuz HE stretched his legs out he thought nick was gon take that second bump n got embarrassed offa open lay😂😂😂
Idgaf how mad Chris get if I was nick I would’ve kept runnin round bru n get his ass the Gatorade logo
25:00 Chris said nick steal attempt was a foul BALL DONT LIE DOE the Khawi bounce
Chris screaming every 3pter nick takes is so annoying
Crs only bag is back down in the paint lmao
Crs has me wanting nick to win bruh just stop complaining and just fcking play ball!!
I’ll cook both they sorry asses and I don’t even play anymore all they do is whine
It slipped out my hands… says wide open Chris
That travel on Chris wasn’t a travel lmao
Lowkey Chris got in nicks head. There’s no rule or nothing that stops Nick from running around and just rim running just like Chris being able to post up too. this is textbook trash talk getting in a guys head
That tantrum he threw let him get a quick 10 min breath he should of made em keep playin
Chris fat ass backs down everyone including Julian Newman who's small AF and bitches when someone goes in for a straight layup because he can't keep up 😂😂😂. But respect to Chris and everyone out there because they competitive AF and that mad respectable.
chris crying cmon your a grown man just  hoop
I love Chris’ content, but he’s something else in 1v1s lol  Complains about Nick running around but literally only backs up for a layup? Like, bruh.
Crs”that’s a foul”Wht
Please don’t invite Chris back
Lmao he fr left
Respect to Nick for thr way he handles himself this entire tournament, I was skeptical when they brought him in but everyone deserves a 2nd chance and he didn’t disappoint. Hope y’all bring him back
Hate this video Chris made it bad tbh
Chris never stops complaining even when he is winning bro just play ball shut up
Throwing your body isn't a foul. Dropping your shoulder is tough.
Chris seriously needs to work on his post work.
Looks like we won’t see Chris White anymore after this creator league matchup 😂😂
chris is so annoying to the point where nick had everyone on his side😂😂
I've been saying for a couple years Chris needs to grow up. Still hasn't happened.
You know the league sucks when these 2 are the "finals".   Does Crs cry bby wht realize we aren't outside?!
Y’all mad he just better 🥱🥱
Nick needs to get a decent cross-over. He's all forward and back. That was his problem here. Maybe throw in a nice spin while he's at it. He can beat CW, but he needs to get more skilled.
Chris, why are you out of breath already, bro? 😂
Chris says Nick is trash because he can run and he isn’t a fat out of breathe slob like him
Big Chris is tired
He cried to get that air back lol he knew what he was doing
Got the same hair as a little girl and acts like one too, so cute. Sad to watch man. Everybody hates playing with people like that
You can’t call fouls wen your 100 Lbs heavier than somebody lol of course there will be contact
How he tries to use his weight. I was the opponent with no shot clock make him run around a little ! Use it to your advantage
Chris white is a “BIG BABY” with a complaint for every play. Creator league gotta grow some balls if a dude leaves the game don’t beg him to come back that should have been a forfeit. You can’t just leave talk non sense about your organization and allow him to come back. Creator league you guys gotta do a better job on match ups there’s no way we saw a whole video a 400lb 6’3 posting up a 135lb 5’5 NOT FUN TO WATCH
Chris clearly lifts his pivot and travels and says nick did it lmao dude can never just play without crying and blaming everyone else for his game but himself
Getting cooked by a paint beast is crazy
Nick Brizz needs to wrap it up!!!
This was the worst creator league edition/season/whatever you want to call it. Invite some real hoopers out next time so we can see some good basketball.  Just one guy’s opinion here, but that was terrible. I just had to fast forward to the end after game one to see who won.
crswht definitely made this cover😂he is not a beast
Hoolies!!!!
Big baby crying
Crs was obviously gonna win this 😂
Baby ass boy walked out the whole place and came back lmaoo
Worst video I’ve ever seen in my life. Never watching another video with this big ass baby
CHRIS ACTED WORSE THEN JULIAN
Bro you travelled, they didnt call that😅
Hes a BABY😂😂😂😂
DAMN CRYING AFTER EVERY SHOT FROM BOTH OF EM
@DFriga  invite this bot to one of your runs to get embarrassed by real hoopers 🙏
If Chris got in real shape he would be a even bigger threat
I don’t want to see this cry baby again frfr
Never have Chris again he sucks
Chris just a cry baby lol fr don’t care 😂
Coke dealer who takes from his supply vs Big Child is what this looks like. CRS threw that last tantrum so he could take and extended timeout he was gassed and wouldve lost
biggest crybaby of all time most unenjoyable person to watch on youtube hands down
CRSWHT bounced said bye then came back in the gym 😂
Can we not have cris anymore lol
Man cris is really the softest person I’ve seen. “He took my leg out” BARELY touched his leg😂
Nick is trash n has no jumper lmfao
Like when big brother plays little brother 😅 GRUDGE MATCH
I’m sorry but that part where Chris walking out the court & showed him walking through a parking lot has to be his most funniest moments ever this year 😂 😂 😂
Lost what lil respect had for cris CRYING LIKE A BIG ASS BABY EVERY PLAY HOW EMBARRASSING HE SHOUPD HAVE QUIT LOL
Chris is terrible !!!!
( . Y . ) just needed a timeout was getting too tired.
Y they edit it so much
Just like rdv lol
Bro if u ignore the basketball, this a mental warfare that Chris won. Chris challenged nick’s “I don’t care what people think bout me “ and disliked and complaints about everything and he been livin in his head rent free.
Nah im ngl his big ass shifty asffff😂😂😂😂and got a strap
Shoutout to Rage for talkin to Chris to get back into the game. He was ready to pack it up no cap😂😂😂
Change the league name to the Complainer League
crs wht needa stfu all he do is big body he has no moves whatsoever
The fat white guy always has excuses for everything. Him smoking layups, blames it on something else. The biggest baby you’ll ever see play ball. It’s so hard to root for him and easy to root for the competition
chris complain abt every single play bro😂😂, it’s embarrassing to watch at his big age .
Chris a corny crybaby smh
Chris should have been disqualified, you can’t just quit for a short period of time after a call doesn’t go your way taking a break and changing the rhythm of the game. Shame on Creator League for not doing anything…
chris is bratty ass baby og😂
Big ass baby lmfao complaining the whole fucking video smh
Chris could of killed that mf with that elbow I don’t know what bro was yapping about
I fw chris but he so unprofessional
I play street ball 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
Chris not even getting fouled honestly💀💀💀
This might be one of the stupidest things I’ve ever watched…
30:30 he aint touch u bro
Bro Chris complaining about nick dribbling while his 400 pound ass is back him down almost every position
Why chris acting so tuff
Bro, chris acts like nick shouldnt try to guard him in the paint, he always wants beef with anyone he faces, he’s a baby, every play he complains, that was tough to watch
They need a shot clock
Buddy complains to to much
I can’t stand that dude! He embarrassed himself
Correct call ngl
Chris is so sorry
Man never seen someone cry as much as Chris. Nearly every miss he has an excuse like "oh I lost the ball"; Nearly every point Nick makes is a complaint "like oh he can only run" Like Chris wasn't using his size to back him down plenty. And every brief contact despite Chris being bigger is a foul on Nick smh.
Lmao "hes a baby" but cris is the main one crying about every call. And hes bigger
They both are terrible at basketball no iq and hardly any skill at all
This year’s creator League was so ass😭
This one was pretty good
Ngl gone I fw chris😂
This was hard to watch. They both played awful 😂
Chris doesn't deserve a platform, to all his supporters... this is who y'all like? dudes an absolute joke, that whole "I quit" and walking out should be an automatic DQ.
Chris the biggest softes dude ever, cant stand watching ths bullshit. On top of that it made me cheer for Nick and his ass got zero bag. I'm done with this bullshit dont post these no more
How he gonna say “he play street ball” but he’s looking for some of the weakest fouls ever😂
But I can say Chris complains toooooooo much to be the biggest person outhere
Chris could just put everyone in post and win y’all really not giving him no credit but he’s not doing that just give em credit for shooting jumpers to
Chris just doesn’t like nick at all he didn’t even say his name in the introduction he called him this guy😭😂😂😂😂
Chris did all that theatrics for a 5 minute breather lmfaon
Bro Chris is him! My boi! Support from San Antonio Texas baby! Come ball up with Wemby lol
Chris not getting any techs is crazy especially when nick got one for basically nothing
It was definitely an offensive foul
If I was nick i would have been trying to wear down his gas tank as much as possible, Chris backs him down repeatedly so I don’t understand why he thinks nick shouldn’t be moving around. That’s his advantage so use it
Drama Queen Chris
Chris is a cry baby😭
Dudes are both trash
How you that big.  And still cry like a kid??
Boohoo baller
chris is not from new york. New york dont claim him
Tbh Chris is not really good
Nobody complains more then Chris lmfao. Like it’s every game every play
Unsubscribed after this 😂 I’m a go watch some nba highlights
Chris to damn big to complain all the time
Nick should have ran everytime. Chris was making shots but his biggest advantage is he bigger than everyone else nicks advantage is he faster should of played more to his strength but the again he'd got to hear Chris cry even more. 😂
he is right though that a crazy call
People should just keep making dribble moves and driving the lane to make Chris tired
I used to be a big fan of Chris. But he turned into a fuckin cry baby
No one  can lift ur legs lol
This is so cringe get some guys that ain’t gonna cry the whole time
Nick really has no bag at all he scary
Chris complain about the body shot  at him but yet he can go arm first at nick every play
This game is so frustrating to watch simply because of the amount of 3s Nick took, if he just drove 90% of the time CRS would have been too gassed to do anything lol
Heavy ass breathin from big boy loln
Christ is so uncoordinated that he trips over his own foot . The biggest cry baby on youtube .
STILL SAVAGE  GANG
This was just hilarious 😂 we needed this
Bro said I’m leaving I’m out I don’t care as he’s walking back in lmao
ya pls dont bring chris back, unless you bring some other fatties to body him
They lost to a guy who could barely breathe
Chriswhite is a big BABY SOFT AS SHT
Nick shouldn’t even be here tbh he’s trash
Was like a grizzlie bear vs a kangaroo😂. Chris is good but no stamina and no vertical. Briz is good but no off the dribble moves
Chris breathing like a dragon 🐉
Worst 1v1 ever
Chris a clown
I just don’t understand how u can go in the post and literally throw yo big ass body into somebody consistently until they damn near out of bounds but when u throw your body back it’s a defensive foul please someone explain that to me
Aren’t they bothers ?😂
Nick is a pussy for letting Chris say he fucking his girl 😂
@crswht did you check the comments? for the hoolies to back you up? cause I don't see them anywhere....you might be the biggest baby to play street ball ever
I play street ball and he the biggest pussy on the court 😂
Chris was good the whole tournament. Refs did him dirty on that offensive foul. Nick just bring out the worst in him. Refs were def on Nick's side though. I wonder if HoH tells them to call more fouls to make the game longer 🤔
Everybody hating on Chris but yall know that wasn’t a foul. Nick was slingshotting himself at Chris and they didn’t call it.
that was a weak offensive foul call
this Crswht dude acts like he's 13
Chris says he plays street ball but complains about everything 🤡
Thought they had beef guess they squashed it
Everytime nick made a shot,  chris shouts. That's freaking annoying.
Chris was the only entertaining part of this “league”
HOOLIES!!!!!!
80% of the audio is just crswht complaining 😭
Honestly speaking even if Chris keeps on complaining like a baby but he is right. Nick keeps on fouling him. Even if you are 100 pounds lighter or 100 pounds bigger a foul is s foul.
Aye @creatorleague  don’t do ts again. This was the dumbest tournament by far. You invite someone who’s 100 pounds heavier than everyone else, some 13 year old….., like this just wasn’t it. And that ending was crazy. A grown man throwing a tantrum and yall trying to calm him down is disgusting behavior nobody trynna watch that. Yall did good with slim and Amilly but other than that this was hot garbage.
Don’t bring this mf crs out again, it’s not entertaining. TNC is gonna be the death of HOH creator league
Chris crying about Nick running around the court but he bodies every single player to the rim… Damn can Crswht just stfu
he’s a cry baby i wish nick took the W
Big hooli
Crs stfu and stop complaining every single game like a lil B
Chris cries every play 🤦🏾‍♂️
No way yall edited the intro lol
Chris too old to be complaining like 🤣 he irritating afff
The big guy is TRASH cry’s whole game throwing his weight around and complaining about somebody landing into his leg when he PURPOSELY kicks it out what a BUM 👎🏾👎🏾😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nick win good job
Like for how many times Chris cried in this video
Idk why mfs don't just dribble near the net make him chase u and get him tired. It's part of the game. He can't complain about having to do cardio in a basketball game. He uses his strength. Attack his weaknesses
15:05 Chris actin hard over a literal scratch is comedy 😂😂😂 then proceeds to complain and cry all game 😂😂
These are two of the lamest people I have ever seen, the internet has really been taken over by a huge collective of squares 😂 we live in a simulation forreal
I wish Chris would try me in the paint
I used to be a crswht fan
Street ball Dillon Brooks😂😂
As much as chris complains he has his shot on.
Chris went to i hop before this match up
He complains alot that was a elbow
People always have to hate but you need to give Chris the respect he deserves it’s not like he complains. But they are some rules in basketball that you need to follow that game was competitive but much respect to Chris and Nick.
Finally people are noticing Chris is the big ass baby
Chris Mad Cause He Had A Strategy To Run Yo Bigg Ass Around To Tired You Out ? Dude Weird
Chris a damn crybaby, too big to be crying after every damn play
Chris big baby white
Chris needs to yell he's a baby to himself. Throwing a fit over those calls. Baby in a grown man's body
These mfs are hilarious
This man is always crying bro play ball
29:40 he took my leg out shutup lying crybaby.
Chris is the most toxic person I've ever seen that's not just bball
Chris just doing too much, respectfully
Slim in the back😂😂😂
I can't take this dudes crying all the time.
Nick has absolutely 0 bag man
I like how Nick started playing with him walking around the court. It’s true all Chris can do is backdown a point guard for points is any of these other players was his size he wouldn’t have made it this far💯
That was awful shooting
Your allowed to run around the court lol it’s called creating space from your cry baby ass Chris
Dude complains about every little thing bros 400lbs and backs down every play talking about a bag if he wasn’t literally so fat he would suck
Bruh if yall know anything about competition yall would know Chris was doing all that “complaining” on purpose bro 😂 the man is smart, he was stalling while he would catch his breath, he even walked off to go catch a breath bro lol pay attention, the first game when he didn’t complain as much, he was GASSED. After that, the complaints started coming out and he was just fine with gas lol
They call fouls for Chris even tho he’s basically constantly charging backing people down . And they don’t call no fouls for anyone he’s playing it’s bs .
Please STOP BRINGING HIS BIG CRY BABY ASS TO THESE EVENTS…. He can ball yes! He can.. but it’s unbearable to watch.. anytime things don’t go his way he cry’s theeee whooooolleeeeee time!!! Please stop bringing him 2 these event!!!
Ngl i stopped watching chris because he complains about everything where is cashnasty when u need him
2:04 Nick’s reaction here, was my reaction here 24:47 😂 foh!
Bro needs to lose some LBs. Breathing hard after every play.
They are both garbage, hopefully they watch this over and realize something to improve not only themselves but their game🤦🏽‍♂️
Uncle Skoob would've beat Chris easily!
nick brizz bots in the chat
the creator league edit is sawft af
The crazy thing is we clicked on this video not to see them play basketball but to see how much trash talking and complaining they will do
Dude too big to be doin all that crying, let the calls go and check up
Stop inviting this complaining 🤡 to these events.
Cry baby. Idk why nobody plays this man left to right he has no movement sideways like running straight at him is what he wants. Trash can
It’s getting hard to watch crswht anymore.  You’re way too big to be crying every play every game smh
29:47 nick didn't even touch him on the layup😂😂😂
So, Chris gets to take a 5 minute break on game point because he got mad at a call?  Nah, Chris lame for that. Nick the winner in my book.
Nick shoulda won tbh Chris don’t deserve it y’all should let him leave
Chris was crying when Julian Newman foul him. lol imagine you playing your two old son and calling foul. That’s Mr. white for ya 😅💀
Crswht a mf cry baby
Hey Chris, you know that layup in the second game for the win that you smoked? And that lucky shot Nick made for the win?  That’s karma for all the whining you did throughout THE ENTIRE GAME!!
Nick my boy need to work on that handle like he use to work on his hops because he ball handle is sorry asf
Started the game hoping Chris would win. Middle of the second game switched to Nick.  I can’t stand people why literally cry after every single possession.
They agreed to a double check in the beginning, but why is Nick the only one doing it?
i get emotional af to when i ball so i cant say much.... but you just beat a lil due
Im never watching creator league again if Chris is in it
creator league : “watching a ham post up guys that are half his size upto 11”
he fouled me lol he fouled me bruh anit no where near him..... biggest cry baby i ever seen
OMG CANT STAND THIS DUDE SO BIG AND SUCH A BABY P@SSY
Chris got the hof complain badge
big dude is like a big baby .... like stfu you think he cant run around the court and your twice his size?!?!? come on now!
chris does a couple cross overs then instantly starts backing down and calls it a bag 😭😭😭 how you gon complain to nick for “not having a bag” when you are literally backing down every play you both use your strengths stop crying like a baby☠️🤦‍♂️
34:20 Chris traveled
Nick's shooting form looks horrible
Everything is an excuse when it comes to chris i would hate playing against him cry too much!!!
My 1 yr old cries less than this fatboy
Chris definitely elbowed him at the end. Was embarrassing to watch a 40 year old man cry so much.
Nick after getting Td “got me f**ked up”  Ref “yessir”   😂
Fat bully
Why do nick walk like that bro switch his head like girls switch they hips 😂😂😂
Two crybabies playing each others 😂😂😂
Bro bitches about every possession he a clown
Bring back Mk and kshowtime
Someone tell Chris he makes too much money to be wearing tights with holes in them
To think nick put Chris on and Chris poppin now
Why Chris gotta make all those Bruce Lee sounds when he dribble
From now on he’s CRYWHT
Terrible basketball player…. All he has is 200+ pounds
Those REFs are HORRIBLE!!!
Chris cried the whole time but to be fair, that last "offensive foul" was some bs lol
I have things to say about this League, it really changed in a bad way : First of all the dribble illimited i don't think it's a good idea they should do at least 4 dribbles, 2nd of all they should do something about calls and stop making the players crying for every touch or every play ...
Casper had a serious grudge on Chris. He kept fouling him
nick got robbed
Man i used to like crswht and actually never really liked nick. Both are big dudes who cry over every little thing. But for crs to get mad that Nick was using his speak while he was using his body the entire time just shows that personality. He is a hypocrite and terrible sportsman
Who is ever falling for Chris hesi
Damn. Whitey out here looking bad. 😢
How does Chris as a bigman have better handles than Nick 😂
29:48 i will neveeer see a pussy ass call like that
Love Chris bro but it not entertaining watching a 300 pound dude just back down a 160 dude 1v1 lol gotta do a guard tourney n bigs one if we doing this lol
Chris already loooking like a beast he could be even more of one when he losses weight. But maybe cut down a bit on the smack
I like Chris but damn you too damn big to be cryin like that….
Chris went ufc on him with the twist of the hips and finished the elbow into nick 🧱 but he didn’t foul him…Yeah Chris would never foul in the paint no way not possible 😂
Damn Chris is the biggest crybaby I have ever seen
Please do not bring Chris back into any of these tournaments
Can somebody explain to me what’s yourrage is doing there exactly?.. buddy is just posted in the corner every game.
Crswht always said he beat him in basketball he showed the YouTube world he actually did beat him we can't say lying no more 🤣
Someone needs to tell Chris you only get one pivot foot. And we know he plays “street ball” but he’s playing with refs so what’s the excuse there? Come on now.
It’s comedy they fight and argue like five year old lil brothers.
Chris white is one funny dude. You like 6-7 300lb playing dude 5-11 and under complaining about them fouling you when you back them down. Haha 🤡 ass you *itch for real for this.
Chris ruined this how you that big and and complaining
Nick is a better baller
All Chris do is cry lmao big puss and that was definitely a call on that 6-3 bucket it was a TRAVEL lol I would smoke his ass
I enjoy watching Chris play, but acting the way he did is embarrassing.
Don’t bring him back, unless this is the type of content y’all trying to push out. I was hyped to watch before the video started. But, the last 2 mins was lame on Cris part. Trash talking all part of the game.   Another thing, you guys have to tweak the rules a little bit. There’s no point of having refs if you aren’t calling everything. A dribble limit will solve all of that. 🤷🏽‍♂️
That’s clearly offensive foul, Chris white complains way too much. Crying about nick running around, bro that’s a game strategy to tire out an opponent that’s easy 200 pounds bigger than nick. Nick you should’ve keep going to the basket since your 3s wasn’t going in, Chris would’ve been irritated and fouling you after cause he would’ve been tired trying to keep up with your speed then you could’ve been shooting free throws. Thats alright nick keep your head up bro you ain’t trash.
Chris getting mad about someone finding a way to compete. Watch him play big guys get the three. Smaller opponents get back all the way down.  When he gets tired is raining bricks smh
Creator league your so fucking lame bro istg show them arguing fuckkkkking lame ash
Nick was fouling him the whole time if you don’t see that you don’t know ball simple
CRAZYYYYY FINAAAAAL BLESSES FROM SPAINNNN
When u come to pa I’m pulling up I want my one on one
Way to stall at the end and get a break. That was smart. 😂
😂 big fella complain more than Lebron and Luka. Call him Luka James.
Shorty in the cargos low key heat. Good game tho.
😂nahhh that was good d chris definitely fouled
he just does everything for content man it’s so annoying
8:03 that looked to be all arm not ball.
i’ve NEVER seen someone complain about a no foul call for multiple possessions… when it wasn’t even a foul (complained about taking his leg out)
i’ve never EVER wanted nick to win so badly
Crs really made this unenjoyable to watch
He has to watch this tape and be embarrassed with himself. I don’t think there was single possession in 3 games that he didn’t have an excuse for his miss or Nicks make. House of Highlights had to be embarrassed to have to air this
There should be a shot clock
Can’t blame crswht, if his opponents on take 3’s!
Nick doesn’t have any BAG at all… how does he have the following 💀
Lmao!!! Good job being a street ball player! Being a bigger guy than everyone else! You suck bro!! Have a good time being sh!!!!!!
“Dam bro”😂😂😂
This was hilarious. And there was some decent basketball too.  But these two are just funny together even though they're not trying to be funny at all.  And i have some respect for both dudes.
Toughest thing to watch on god. Nice three point contest. Tf was this
Let’s go nick get this fat baby
I miss Friga in creator league :/
HOOLIGANISM!!!!
Bro trys to play bully ball back down and blows easy ones then has a cry every time thats hilarious. Mr tuff plays like a baby. Hate nick briz but even he shut his mouth and played more. Lol
Your own weight took your leg out 400lbs mf 😂😂😂
Chris is the only person that could make me root for nick. Dude is straight clown complaining with his fatness
You are not hard
Chris is obese
Chris is fat
Wow these dudes are too cool for school huh
This the first time I wanted Chris to win can’t stand nick, he really doesn’t have a bag he has to get a running start against Chris just goes to show how one demential he is
All that bitching just to come back?? 😂😂😂😂😂 that boy needed a break 😂
mannnnnn y’all let him take that long ass break Chris kno what he b doing
Worst Creator league ever...respect for Nick
crswht Really is a Baby 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You are obese Chris just stop complaining….
Big ass cry baby
Chris is so gay “he took my leg out”😂😂 mf your leg is sticking out like dirk
Bro wasn’t even touching him 😂
please actually never invite chris back to these type of events again, he’s the biggest crybaby i’ve actually ever witnessed he lies and cries about everything, makes these 10x less enjoyable to watch
These boys so ass, unlimited dribbles and no bag. JV players at best
Idk how nick has fans
Bro got a whole 30 min break wtf lol
Crywht. hoooolies~
Don’t invite Chris again
Fkkn bum Fr Chris is ass idc if he won cries all the time straight bum
Still happy nick lost
This isn’t the 1v1 I grew up playing but whatever
If its possible to have less than 0 respect for a content creator, than thats what I got for Chris White. Would rather see 2018 Logan Paul in this tourney.
@cashnasty
Chris is the biggest bich in this whole thing bruh what a cry baby
chris is the softest 300lb+ 6ft+ guy there is😂
CRSWHT you complain way to much it’s on every play
You think Nick wanted the Kawhi Leonard bounce, or no?
It’s crazy how many people saying Chris is a crybaby when y’all played street ball bet y’all was crying and throwing tantrums 😂. Come on now it’s basketball you always gonna have people crying when it’s something doesn’t goes there way..
Crawht doesn't deserve this dub, he cried with all the shots he took 😂
This is cringe haha. The very end he says I play street ball but has been crying about ticky tack fouls all game. I agree nick kept bumping him but you could tell Chris got frustrated and threw a mean elbow
I’m just here for the comments 😂😂
Chris is hilarious...nick was fouling...yall all geeks
Get these dudes some mental help. Both of them.
Yeah this is the last time I give anymore of my time of day to this dude. It's just annoying to watch at this point. A "big" who cries on EVERY contact while it's okay for him to make ALL the contact. A tough guy who is as soft as a pillow when the physicality is returned. Grow up.
What a cornball
34:23 how is that not a basket lol Nick is throwing is body at Chris when Chris was making his move 😂😂😂
Bro was gassed after the first bucket lol
Yawn. Creator league of creators that nobody wants to work with. Shocker
No way this dude just made me root for Nick Briz and wtf is he talking about? “He took my leg out”he kicked his leg out. What a lame 😂
33:17 nick that works against you you the lighter faster one 😂😂😂🥲don’t cry about that
I had to turn it off hearing a grown man cry like this is crazy. Getting mad that nick is running around using his advantage but Chris keeps backing down using his advantage every play is crazy. He’s so cringe
The fat kid is kinda nimble
Chris was about to pass out after taking one shot.  Mix in a salad, bro.
I swear y’all clowns commenting about him crying about fouls and non fouls not knowing that’s just who is is lol are you clowns new to crswht
Why Nick Briz walk like a real-life bobblehead?
Chris a bum Fr and briz has no bag both these clowns wack asf🤡🤡🗑️
Crs a better complainer than he is hooper.
L game
Yeaa ngl i fw Chris but he too big to be complaining that much , if you say you a dog then be a dog yk
I was rooting for Chris going into this. I was hoping he lost towards the end tho
Chris hit a few shots and turned into Steph curry….well at least in his head lmao😂. I thought he was going to dominate nick because nick isn’t a shooter. Chris should’ve just won it in the post. no idea why he shot that many 3s or tried to dribble like he’s Jamal Crawford
Who would’ve seen the day that we’re all siding with Nick and not Chris 🫠
Dawg lmao I don’t even know how y’all give this guy views. He’s easier to hate than Nick. The guy literally cries after EVERY play if he doesn’t make the shot. SHUT TF UP & plaayyyy is what I would start telling him if I was the ref.
Bruh cris got no stamina and won’t play defense and mad that nick is playing basketball wtf
Crswht you suck.
I bet the hoolies liked that one @crswht 😂😂😂 looks like YoUr ThE bAbY
This nigga cry too much holy
This is trash. Too much complaining from a person that’s been twice as big as everyone and taller than almost all of them. And the smaller dude iq is low he’s playing against a player who has zero stamina and very little skill he should’ve been killing
Chris needs to be banned, and for the future there needs to be a shot clock
yall siding with a bad person over someone calling fouls tf r yall talkin about
there's no way you niggas crying in the comments cuz Chris is complaining. Just say your mad your fav creator got dropped off and go about your day
Nick slams ball - gets tech. Chris LEAVES game - play on.
"Just dribbles around the court" I'm lost isn't this basketball? Dude complains about anything he made Briz seem more trollerable 😂
Crswht trash af can’t hoop big body and naw you ain’t got no bag lose some weight maybe you can play better
Body bag would skunk cris or Chris any day any score congratulations on. Eating people under 5’9 and bitching about a shooting guard playing basketball dribbling and then you back them down such a hypocrite grow tf up
cris be on his knees too much🤣
This is like deontay wilder vs gervonta Davis why tf is he bragging like he beat someone his size all he gotta do is back them down that’s all the buckets he got HE MEANING YOU CHRIS WHIT go play body bag and people will respect you
Nick don’t do any talking when it comes to Chris lol
This is pathetic. Chris is softer than cotton
How you call that. I play street ball man… Crs Wht. Every time he shoots, THATS A FOUL CHECK UP
Nick does meth
Let Chris play against people his size so he stops bitching he’s backing down fucking Julian Newman and everyone he’s a power forward/ center based on his skills and then cries about a point guard/ shooting guard dribbling around him such a hypocrite a crybaby let him play body bag or Ty let’s see what’s good he’s probably gonna be complaining about everything too bro you’re 32 grow tf up then you act like you know the game of basketball like a fucking 50 year coach of the NBA he’s wrong about all his damn foul calls
Bro Chris is a crying girl all u do is back down big for nothing cry baby
CHRIS WHITE A WHOLE ASS BI*** N a HALF… look like a giant oversized real life cry baby the whole game bro. Man tf up
chris honestly dosen't want nick to "run around" cause he'll get tired. Good strategy and its the obvious and only strategy. Also, if game 3 is only to 7 points then all buckets should be counted as 1 point.
CRS CRY BABY WHT. The loudest one in the room...he blind af too
Even tho he is way bigger 😂 crs bag is way bigger then nicks , his handle better , shot better , post game better all nick got is speed . So im glad the better man won GGs tho
LOL this why Chris isn’t playing in Frigmas where the real hoopers are at, these are the content guys
How tf did they make it to the finals
Put Chris vs Bodybag pleaseeeeeeeee
I forgot Chris and him got problems now huh?😭
Chris complains a whole lot!!! But that last call was ridiculous that’s a strong move to the cup! That’s a terrible call! But it’s hard to watch Chris play 1’s lmao he always complaining that’s my guy though
Chris biggest winer ever
No dribble limit is crazy
all his games too
y he cry so much wow
Everyone acting like nik was not complaining either 😂
Chris lowkey did all that to catch his breath
Chris u sounded like a REAL b*tch this game.....crying more than Julian!!
Just get the and one chris stop complaining about fouls and play through it
He cry way took much .. good playing but too much dramas comes with him
The biggest ones cry the most . Him and Big E blow me
I cant believe he missed that layup😂😂
Nick: running around and dribbling the ball actually using his bag   Chris: “You have no bag” proceeds to bag down the guy he has 200 pounds and like 4 inches on every 5 seconds
29:46 bro you should have made that😂😂a leg had nothing to do with that shot😂he is so funny
chris a walking complaint.
2 of the most annoying players in basketball spaces there like the same people just 2 different size both talk too much no skill just try to intimidate who ever there playing and if u noticed the competition they were playing was bad I guess they ask who was playing and said we not entering this creator league this year lol
NGL nick was fouling every time in the paint but what else could he do lol Chris just dominated all game
Nick really doesn’t have a bag tbh
Yo Crswht is the most annoying talented biggest baby with mad skills
24:48 oh now it’s a foul and you didn’t even scream and 1 cause you should have made that😂Chris is so cringe man! He is literally the biggest cry baby
Get rid of this fooooking guy
“I’m leaving bye” as he’s walking back in the building
Nick should have just kept running side to side.
big fat ah throwin a fit
Chris is the biggest baby in the whole tournament. Man cries about everything. 80% of what he calls is bs. I think everyone cheered when he said he wasn’t playing anymore.
Chris is a baby
22:00 how does he get the ball on amiss lol
Nick seemed kinda intimidated from the the beginning
This CRS WHT guy is so trash. You're the biggest guy on the court looking for every call and just bitching the whole time. I would love that 1 on 1
20:46 so Chris pushes him and shoots a horrible shot but now it’s cause you ALMOST landed on him😂
Someone needs to make a edit of all the times Chris complained this whole competition
I don’t understand how you’re not gonna have a 3 second rule and call the weakest calls when Chris is like 100+ pounds heavier than anyone else in the tournament lmao
Got me actually rooting for nick and I hate nick 😂😂
Chris just cries and cries but he’s playing people smaller than him 😂😂 you a grown ass man
16:32 bro you already released the ball before he touched you😂 Chris literally cries so dam much
14:09 Chris cries so much I’m with nick on this one. I would be running around tiring him out also. Especially if Chris is just gonna back down from the 3line lol
Chris getting mad he faster then him and ran by him😂😂
the most unskilled 1v1 finals in the history of youtube basketball 😂 certainly entertaining tho
Biggest dude on the court and still manages to cry the most 😂
Lol 😂bro that was an offensive foul though
Chris is  a crying punk deserved to have the loss that was a straight up forfeit 100% he should not be walking away winner of the finals.
😂😂😂 am here for the violence !!
Briz needs to hire Lethal Shooter! 🏀 This was a horrible 3rd game of yanking up 3s. He was probably 2 for 10.
Chrs threw a tantrum just to get rest at the end😂
I thought they kissed and made up. They look like they hate eachother again
Chris was right though
I fucking hate Chris white he complains after every shot
chris has officially lost the right to the phrase "hes a baby"💀
Chris the biggest baby in basketball history only got famous playing with nic  Cry’s about everything please don’t bring him back next time ya do this
This is why you play 3-4 dribble limit
I’m cool on seeming Chris again all he did was back people down see I have no problem with this but when he’s getting his ass busted he wanna complain about his own cardio that was the sorriest win I’ve ever seen
Y'all sum bums bc if y'all wasn't getting calls y'all would complain too!!!
Props to nick (my first time ever saying that) dude wasn’t egotistical, wasn’t starting anything, and when Chris pissed him off THEN he said “stfu”. Chris is like 35 yrs old yellin over a 1v1 basketball game
Y’all still gave him da win 😂
Holy crap.. This guy crswht is the most annoying player to watch.. Stop inviting him back
Chris is a female dog
Baby
Chris we like u but stop whining
They need to have a dribble limit this is bad basketball at least 5 dribble limit or a shot clock 🤦🏽‍♂️
😂 refs so bad they givin out techs in 1v1s
Chris was all out of breath quickly and he does complain,, yet you know what's REALLY sad???? What's really said is all these folks talking shi- on Mommy's computer from a distance and not one of them will get on the court with him. Not one will talk all that smack to his face, and for the dummy whom mention the size differences, obviously they signed up for it...duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... For people who can actually play ball like Mugsy Webb, Iverson, etc they do not CRY ,whine nor make a big deal about the obvious.That is what should be embarrassing to any man to be such a gossipy, fake azz keyboard warrior. Go to Chris directly and say what you have to or better yet get in the League and beat him.....
Nick Bricks is his name fk they talking bout?! White!
Nick would have won if he went left like every other possession lol
Chris play ball everyday and still don’t lose weight 😂😂
Chris constantly talking bout getting money but playing with some old ass compression pants with ripped knees 😂😂😂
They ain’t got no bag next chapter better this is sad smh
this was hard to watch smh..
Chris is bad for the creature league honestly … I’ll come and go one on one with Chris and shut him down
Is that Efron from two hype ?
Chris big ass need to stop with all that non shiftiness and just post up , I PROMISE HES NOT THAT GUY ! He’s a fucking big man
please dont bring chris back, clear offensive foul with the elbow. BIG ASS BABY LITERALLY!
Chris is the biggest crybaby I ever seen smh just play ball wit yo big ass
Friga would smash Chris..
WWWWWWWWWWWW
24:45 describes Chris to a T. Misses open layup alone and calls foul
U trash CRSWHT u the one with no bag
the worst 1v1 I have ever watched . These guys are fuckin trash
How about this? Even though he won still don't bother bringing him back. This was a joke. How are you gonna cry about someone dribbling all over the court when all you do is post up?
Bro Chris is legit a big ass baby
Chris a b!txh
Man’s even worse after watching the full video. Grow up. Shouldn’t of let his ass continue, Kim K+ Paris Hilton with the attitude of a 5 year old single child is how Chris acts. Embarrassing
Crs shows his true colors when things don’t go his way. Guy might be older than everyone but he has a lot of growing up to do.
Chris is a big baby lol but he's got a bag for sure
Chris a master at being tired and getting his stamina back 😂 bruh left the whole building and came back
*CHRIS STARTING TO LOSE AT LEAST 10,000 SUBS EVERY VIDEO HE PUTS OUT PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF HEARING HIS CRYING ASS* 💯
I ride with the big hoolie all day, but i do wish he would just let his play do the talking at times.   That said, look at those long ass scratches going down his shoulder. Nick was hacking and body bumping like crazy.
I like how they gave Nick a Technical for slamming the ball but Chris can leave the whole gym and get no Technical 💀😂. Complains the whole game and gets gifted a win. It should've been a forfeit at that point.
Chris you cant be mad at him using his strengths against you just like you do the same bro do what you need to win bag or no bag play what comes at you
If I was creator league I would NEVER invite crswht back it’s literally embarrassing and brings the Channel down to even promote this 🤡
Ngl crswht is a whole crybaby for no reason this man will complain about anything💀
Nick need to jab em one good time I promise all that tough talk would be out the window😂
That was Offensive foul all day
Crs just a whiny little girl, man complains but half his points he backs down guys who are half his size then acts like he’s doin somethin amazin
This man Chris crying about nick running to score but can post up and do whatever he want 😂 why he so angry all the time
Nick did throw his body into Chris to stop him from driving early on on that last possession. Refs should have let them play from that point, Chris should have won. You can’t not call that foul but call Chris for the elbow. Nick threw his abdomen and hips into Chris.
Hoolies! Y’all know why he there !
Chris ran out of the building like Maury just told him that Nick is not the father.
What happens to the 5 sec back down rules
dem niggas having a breakup again?
the ending is prolly riggedI  don’t like these guys horrible for bball and the YouTube community
A little blood never hurt anybody......HIV much
Crswht you could have won easy just back him down east W
I hope y’all take this as a sign to never bring this clown back. I’m just waiting till a acl get torn or someone actually whoops his a** only reason I’m here
This some bad basketball man…lol. Entertaining but bad. Get the bag though… never hating on that 💰 💰 💰
Nick did not play smart at all tho,  was rushing his shot , had a lot of space to shoot, had so much more stamina but made Chris shoot while he should of made him put the ball down to drain his stamina. No mames
Crswht is the guy on you are embarrassed to have on your team. “He’s a baby”
Chris white is a bozo and a crybaby
Naaaah he doesn’t respect the league this is hard to watch.   NO RESPECT AT ALL MAN, he dint even care when they pass the 🏆
“he’s in my feet i gotta…
Chris, with the stamina reset cheese 😂😂😂
Damn. I had to skip a lot. lol
Good thing there isn’t 3 seconds in the lane for Chris…. Id like to see a tournament for people his size and how he does. Nicks bag is basic though lol
I cannot watch Chris anymore, he is the most hypocritical sorry ass crying baby in the YouTube basketball scene. Not 1 play can go bye without him crying about some bs. Would love to play him and bully him, such a baby. Also, you need to be able to jump, and actually have both feet off the ground for someone to “take your legs out” and stop bitching about the fouls, how about you just stfu and make a layup, sorry ass.
Never thought I'd say this before but Nick deserved that. Chris's game there's nothing but arguments and crying Nick could have pulled that off. Never rooted for Nick b4 but was hoping he took this one home. Good job Nick!!
This game fucking sucked
I agree with Chris... That was a BS call. Ref ignored the clear foul by Nick but called the questionable one by Chris.
Wahhhhh wahhhh
Huge shoutout to everyone that played and competed. All the complaining and and constant arguing just shows how much these dudes care to compete, is it a bit excessive? YES, but it is what it is. Having Chris on Creator League isnt a bad thing, they just need to get more creative and bring more big men, or do a 2v2 tournament where each team has a big man to make ALL the teams even. Good job Creator League for putting more basketball content on the platform.
Bro talks about zero bag but backs someone down and uses his size
Daaaamn it’s my eyes are bleeding
I was jacced to see this Chris I pussy now u not hard just big and cry every play
This is the most u organized basketball I ever seen they let this mam walk out and come back just so he can catch his breath.The next chapter,house of hoops would never sign this fool.
Chris complains so much for his size. It’s crazy
Chris white is getting morbidly obese. He was literally huffing and puffing after the first bucket. He also wears the same leggings every single video he is in
Crista White suffices from here on out
They're so cute😂😂 fun game🎉
He took my leg out 😂 I’m still trying figure that one out
Chris bitched the WHOLE TIME
Chs white fell of a long time ago
That's like to Villans tryin to kill eachother Bane VS The Joker👿😈
You gotta stop having that music before the game winning shot, it spoils that they already made it
This was absolutely staged imo. Especially when Chris smoked the layup on game 2 when it was 9-9.
WHITE
Chris low key finessed at the end he just needed to get a quick breather in 😂
Nick Briz really needs to work on squaring up to the hoop before he shoots
He can't breathe. Help!
I vouch to never watch another CRS video again. He gotta be the most sour YouTube hooper ever. Every single miss there was an excuse.
There needs to be weight and height classes lol.
Dude literally said he scooped him 😂😂😂he’s a child hoh don’t need white man
It’s basketball boys not real beef cut that stuff out and play ball Good Game yall both got strengths and weaknesses both of yall used them it just a game at the end I understand yall don’t like to lose but it’s a game
it’s not complaining when it’s true them was fouls and i like nick too bruh
Chris is a hoe.... attention seeking like hes playong high-school ball
Nick won fr
Will there be another 3v3 tournament? I rather that than the 1v1s
No cap it was a foul when nick bump into him when chris was gonna leave. Nick soft no cap😂😂
Chris makes this ish so bad... and worthless to watch i had hopes itd be better. Dont know why i watched to the end...
You know why I'm here 😂😂😂😂
Pls don’t invite him back
Thanks to both Nick and Chris for the Drama… but dont do cry baby plot no more..
Worst basketball to watch.
aint this ironic
The fact the fat dude arm’s are too small for his gut etc bother me for some reason
Big body we do that. It was a foul on crswht no doubt
What a cry baby so big and having a weight advantage 😢
Like if you don’t want to see Chris play again👍
I knew this was personal when Chris said I was fucking your girlfriend last night lmao 😂
that tween stepback is unmatched
No shot clock with unlimited dribbles😂 Is the Creator League living in 2000?
This is the dumbest comp. Big vs small. Backing everyone smaller than him down. there's no comparison between this and TNC. outdated influencer bball style content
I’m mad at myself for getting invested into this tournament lol
Unlimited dribbles is insane
Stop bringing Chris back, he sucks, he complains, and he’s just big. Only let him play if there’s a 3 dribble limit.
Crswht calling 24:50 a foul and the reason he missed is crazy 🤣 you just sorry
Drivvles around the court like a trash can? Lol whaat kind of insult is that?! Lol
Game2: I'm absolutely SURE nick payed Chris to sell that last layup.......... if not Chris sold him a lucky ass shot.
HOOOLIESSSS
L NICK BRIZ
Crs is 350lbs and thinks he has a bag cuz he backs down people half his size 😂😂😂
I wish nick would fix his jumpshot lol as a lefty he should take more advantage of the slower chris 😂 ggs
I’ll give yall a suggestion to this video play it on mute this is ridiculous crs the biggest kid on YouTube
the usual, Chris Whine
Mr. Imleavingbutnotleaving
I hate nick briz
I really appreciate YourRage contributing nothing to this Creator League
I fw Chris but damn, you can't call a foul every time u miss a shot. I know some of them were fouls, but there were several where Nick didn't even touch him. Just play basketball!
We got it all wrong . CrsWht  is the baby .
I hope we get a better creator league next year with actually hoopers trying to show their bag instead and if crswht last time being here let it be, mf is the biggest pansy
chris saying all this “oh i cant do anything” “cool story bro” like bro play fln basketball you sound like a lil b* js cs u dont get a call or js cs you miss your own shitty shot, grow tf up big boi you look itchy, show it, tf
I’m glad I play hockey. Never heard anywhere near this much whining on the rink.
Should been like three Tecs on white 😂 I was going for him but Damm my dude can’t get mad somebody running around u back dudes down ( pause ) 😂 Nick said it’s just be like sometimes when he miss had me dying 😂
Nobody wanted Chris to win💀
can this channel mute every time that taller player speaks? oh, also his breathing sound too
Who remembers when Chris used to say "im from Brooklyn, we dont call fouls." Maybe he should start saying "im from Brooklyn, we call fouls every play"
CRYS wht  Cries about every fn play.  Can't stand that bs  Miss a shot and he either got fouled or the ball slipped.  Homeboy must have the greasiest fingers in the business.  He is slimy so it makes sense. Congrats on the W big baby!
Is it just me or is Nick dribbling around to piss Chris off funny af😂😂Chris is literally an attention seeker, like how tf u gon walk out the building yelling then go back claiming u ain’t gon check it up then u still end up checking it up😂😂🤡
When Chris hits those jumpers, he's dangerous.. Also, I'd like to say that as a smaller hooper, we definitely tryna get the big guys tired.
Chris a whole baby
good game cant complain!
I'm not going to lie Nick needs a bag 😂 a purse or suitcase something lmao
Why can’t people just run around Crswht? He got not cardio, easy lay to the rim and he can’t stop you listen to his huffing and puffing dude is outta shape
Miss the opportunity to makw this final to a live stream
I understand Chris getting mad like that at the end and it's understandable because they both fouling each other when he goes in the post and that's the first call makes no sense 😂
This dude cries so much and he wants to call everyone else a baby? GTFO im your biggest fan but love to hate on a scrub
He just needed a break that’s why he left and came back lol
I thought I used to hate nick...yeah chris is worse...it seems from recent games, nick has changed a little
No blood aint never hurt nobody but a little running around the court kills him lol
Chswht made hurt every play! Biggest sook man biggest on the court 😅 man needs to play rugby says he plays street ball 🧐🤣
Why does Chris White complain about everything at all times
every 1v1 is toxic💀shi not even intertaining fr, some play lazy, and seem like they don’t even wanna be there. it used to be good at the parks tho
Crying cause someone is using all of the court is hilariousss 😂😂😂 How you mad cause yo big unconditioned ass can’t run lmaooo literally hit a treadmill Chris…. Like how mad cause you gotta MOVE your body ? 🤣
they should never invite chris back, bro COMPLAINS AND CRIES 24/7
Chrswhyte is garage literally has no bag at all and cry’s about everything thing but apparently he plays in the streets 💀
damn Chris. I f*ck with ya but painful to watch the complaints cuz it's supposed to be street. take it and give it back unless it's blatant rape the way chris is talking is mad childish and should be embarrassing for the supposed thuglife
This was the worst creator series ever. Whoever was behind this needs to be fired. A bunch of trash matchups, bad basketball, bunch of fuckin complaining 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Everyone hates Chris yet he still won and he’s probably better than most of his haters lol
We want Carlos
Chris tells nick he has no move but 90% of points came from him backing down 😂😂😂😂
Bruh only wins cause he bigger than everybody. Get a athlete 6’5 vs white it’s a wrap
I lost some respect of Chris White dude calls every little thing a foul it’s ridiculous.
This dude threw a whole tantrum and left the court and still didn't get a tech like seriously?!
Crs Ik you see this stop ducking me
NAW PLAY THAT THAT N SLOW MO...NOPE...THEY CHEATED CHRIS...
Damn near 40 minutes for a few 1s to 11 is whats really got me 😂. Telling...
Chrswht is fucking baby omgggg
Nick also talking about how Chris posting up the whole game in game 2 but I think Chris hit more 3s then nick did 😂
In his defense they did take like 8 baskets from him from foul calls lol some of his crying was bs but some I could see
im only 3 seconds in and I already cant stand listening to his sorry AZZ
Chris a cry baby if u feel like they not calling fouls play through it they didn’t call nun off the carries he did backing Nick down he won but I can’t stand when the big guy playing bully ball then complain 🤦🏽‍♂️💯
AHAHa CLOWN.
Chris a big fucking crybaby, Nick won in my opinion
Offensive foul is hilarious
“I play street ball” and complaining for a foul every time nasty work
Embarrassing. Get some real talent out there!!
It just blows my mind that people will hire an old black person to do any job. The overwhelming majority of them are extremely illiterate and uneducated which is just a fact. What makes you think they'll be any better in their old age? That's why my entire team black people included with cringe every time we would see an old black referee at one of our games
chris saying nick has no big is hilarious. this man does dribble moves while STAYING IN THE SAME PLACE he doesn’t go anywhere into either a pull up or back down lol that’s it
ong i think chris called a foul every play
Chris is such a cry baby. He was gassing and he threw a temper tantrum so he could sit down and take a break.
@Crswht the calls were weird the whole game. You had a little moment but still came back and closed out the game to win the game Respect x 💯
This entire season was mismatched. There truly needs to be better set- up.  Chris was crying entirely to much this game. He can't drop his shoulder every play then when he gets tested back he cries about it.  Don't drive the shoulder if you can't handle it!
Chris mad he running around the court but he's fine with backing down everyone he plays every play.
Cristina cries more than Kenny Chao, this 1v1 was ass where was Friga, MK, Cash? He couldn’t do this in Tmac’s tournament with real hoopers lol
Wahhhh. White you a baby. Im not checking up, im done. Check ball this is dumb. Ahhhh i won but i already quit so im still a loser
The guy in white was correct. Dude in red was fouling every time on the back-down.
Chris is a cry baby no respect what so ever
What in the plastic was that trophy!>!>!>!????
when i played nick is the type of guy i hate the most, jumps weird runs weird always makes excuses throws weird too and im almost sure its the classic mr elbows for rebounds
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop 😂
Traveled 4 times on the 10th point 😂
I pulled it outta Chris whites moms butt them put it in her mouth then she put the load in her puss and Chris was born 9 months later
Bro a cry baby
He took that long break so he could catch his breath. 🤣🤣🤣
My guy needs 42 feet to set up a drive for a layup on someone who guards by yelling
Nick you do nunthing but foul Nd you a silent hater I would buss yo ass Nd I don’t even hoop consistency no more you trash really hating becuase a nigga you was cool with got on
Talk about no bag… Crs can just shoot and back down guards that’s it… then complain about a foul every time he smokes a layup
Honestly nick won Chris should of been dq he quit so nick wins
Nick is annoying in so many little ways but Chris is a crybabyyyyyy. He too damn big to be crying that much. Lol
Oh man imagine your favourite saying being “hes a baby!” and crying on almost every posession. Then complaining that Nick is only doing “running bullshit” while every other play is him backing Nick down. Hate to see it
As much complaining and whining and coming at y'all Cris do and nick gets a tech for bouncing the ball lol
1v1 with unlimited dribbles is a clown show and is always going to favor the big dude cuz he can take 800’dribbles in the paint and score. 0 skill
Too big to be doing all that, elbow was insane lol couldn’t be me
Can you imagine Chris playing anyone from TNC with 4 dribbles? He'd get bodied
That was just awful basketball
Imagine if your defense was yelling 😂
this is a dream match since they been on same team for every video
the best the of content creators is playing now? a fat wheezing biscuit extra jelly easily exposed with a handling bag downhill vs a zero bag cornball easily exposed perimeter or via downhill (especially with a 70lb advantage). this was painful to watch from an IQ and skillset perspective. yet entertaining while doing laundry.  if biscuit extra jelly dont want zero bag running around then dee up step up with conditioning. a bagger would have that biscuit on the floor with  less than three dribbles and the refs would have to help him up with a hoist. if biscuit was nice, less than four dribbles to the hole with footwork, end of discussion. both ah dem are average at best and really need to stfu.
Explaining rules to a ref 😂
1v1 me for 1 mill
The posted up travel was crazy
This man Chris sucks
This dude is the biggest cry baby on earth 🌍 fax
crswht posting up for 75% of his points, “NO BAG”
Bro Crs to damn big to be complaining about every little call bruh and he gets annoyed when Nick dribbles but that’s his game but then he doesn’t have a problem when he backs Nick down
Never seen this many unsuccessful fakes in one game
Wait the comments say he’s the champion ? 😂 of what ?
My algorithm is ruined forever
What a disgrace. Your league is void. Your champion is an overweight 40 yo infant. Watched almost every game. I will never do that again. ✌🏽✌🏽
He plays bully ball but cries “he threw his whole body at me” walks back “I’m gonna truck stick him” like it’s football lol dude is weird
15:40 Nick was gettin MIXED!!!   N then the tech lmao
Dude believes there’s only layups and 3 pointers 🤦‍♂️
Chris a crybaby 😂😂😂
I like Chris as a hooper but he complains way to much. Usually I'm not a Nick fan but he showed up in the tournament. Chris whining saying Nick has one move meanwhile half of Chris buckets off backing his big ass up. Whines over half of calls. Just play. That complaining was crazy today
L League for editing out the good stuff
Bruh.
What is this ? 😂
I wanna see Chris vs Rob. Can you imagine how humbled Chris would be lol
I’m cooking both of them easy
None of these guys have a mid range shot?? Like all they do is either drive or shoot the 3 lmao no game at all!!! 😂
Nick is sorry settling for 3s when you can easily drive past his sorry ass
Chris is definition of a big baby. I used to like his content but so sick of watching a sore loser making the same excuses and crying foul every damn time.  at the end he was clearly gassed and used his tantrum to get a rest.
Idk how anybody watches Chris fr. Dude is impossible to like or tolerate. Even the little guy creators that pretend to tolerate him you can just tell behind his back they’re all 🙄 and talking about the guy lol
I play street ball maaaan this hullshit. Bro cried every single goddamn play beggin for ticky tack fouls lol tf
Mood swings!!!!
So good to see Briz get humbled 😂😂
Chris is a cry babay
6:07 Chris hella hungry
"I play street ball": Proceed to cry to the ref 'couse Briz looked him strongly. Chris was crying all the time for evertthing, it's really anoying to see.  It's a gdm 1000 pounds rhino backing up and fouling in the post every time and then cry for everything.
Smokin that nick pack 😂 (just a joke don’t get butt hurt)
This dude Chris is trash 🗑️
38 mins of complaining nice
Both are bums!  Crswht complains about everything and Briz has no bag!  Everyone on Friga Fam and Next Chapter smoke these chumps!
40 year old braid head kept complaining
Big sloppy calling someone else corny and wack is CRAZY. Buddy missed a wide open layup and claimed Nick 3 feet away tripped him😂😂
Nick Briz is top tier cringe
I’d hope so you’re overweight compared to the competition! Lucky your fat Nick better than you
Ngl he cant hoop😂
Bruh why do yall let CrsWhte play? Is it bc his career is over if you don’t?
Bro friga would of swept this tournament nick owns chris bro beat him every 1v1 except for this one
12:08 cris calling check whens rhwres clealy refs. Cris is certified baby stuck in a giants body
Not sure if the guy in white should be playing while pregnant
This was so fucking entertaining 😂😂😂😂
Nick slams ball on floor gets tec crswht leaves the gym no tec lol😂
Chris trash that’s why nobody invites him in the basketball community he don’t play with none of the elites cuz he’s trash
He sucks TRAAAAASH
Cry baby hella big bully point guards
Pls don’t bring chswht back not even good content or if y’all do bring someone to match his size he’s mad Nick used his speed but all wht dose is back down smaller guys
I mean he’s right, Briz hot garbage
“are you being serious ?” Im dead serious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
yh Chris is just a big baby
thank youuu chris BIG NY sh*t , f*ck is n*ggas talkin bout 😈
W Creator league. Loved every minute
CRSWHT BIGGEST BABY IN THE GYM
Why ya keep inviting annoying ass crybaby crswht to these things?
Why do you need to dribble fancy if your first step quick and you play better in motion
29:48 Crs Wht- "He took my leg out" 😂😂😂😂 Bro where
You had two villians and the worst case scenario happened. These street ballers all lost to a big fat dude. Ain’t no nba player doing that, no more arguments about these guys being pro level.
Please don’t call Chris back Hoh he cries about every single play it’s annoying fr
Like I’m dead ass I’ll send in some ball clips
That last call wasn't a foul. That wasn't a full elbow throw.
Can I play lol
Chris is the worst hooper on YouTube😭
These "players" are not even close to amateur foreals...I don't understand why can't they just drive in hard or how about some floaters ? Smh weak asses
Honestly nick is just athletic other than that he is dogwater
Chris is truly a total prick!! What a Narcissist weirdo.
nick is a fuckin weirdo
chris annoying af now
Following him to the parking lot had me dead 😂😂
Take a shot everytime Nick puts up a missed 3
That CRS guy is so annoying, holyyyyy
Chris is such a crybaby. I used to find entertaining but now it's just so annoying. I hope he gains some maturity
Chris gets to walk out ? Makes sense
Crwht got some ugly ahh tats no cap
W CRSWHT
Nick should just take the charge and flop across the gym
I play streetball but complains more then anyone
Crswyt complains his opponent just run around and say zero bag.. while he just post everyone up cuz he the biggest 1 lol
For a big guy Chris do complain a lot
We all know damn well Chris did all that just to get a breather 🤣
cry baby chris white
Deadass creator league should host a wrestling/wwe tournament
Nick the only person I seen stand up to Crs Fr 😂😂😂 they treat that boy like he the boogeyman lol
I feel like u shoulda did a full interview after the games, hoolie woulda went nutz here
HE TOOK MY LEG OUT. No legs were injured in the making of the film.
Chris I really like you bro but that one play he did not try and take your legs out man. Look at the footage, he literally even backed off of you in the post.
Nick should of ran the whole game, crswht was gassed.  All crswht really had to his advantage was no 3 in the key.  Lame
Wtf is a briz
No lie when hoolie miss the layup it wasn’t a foul and the offensive at the end it was a foul on nick first GG tho
Ngl they both looked bad here. Chris looked bad for all the complaints and briz just literally looked trash no bag at all
Chris you can’t complain the whole time then at the end when you elbow Nick in the face say “oh I play street ball”. If it was up to me, no fouls would be called and just let y’all duke it out.
Crswht the biggest cry baby lmao
Crswht pisses me off bro
the most annoying game i ever watched all chris was doing is crying i’m prob never watching another one of his games in here
Why do people give this guy views, he’s every big man that went to college and thought he could shoot and then got cut cuz he has no inside moves against people his size. Just bad ball
Crswht Mr 3 in the key. Can't win without 3 in the key
Drive the damn ball Chris quit shooting
Incoming nick bot. pages 🤣🤣he so mad he lost
top 5 worst 1v1 i’ve watched
Crazy how ChrisWht has been hooping in the scene a lot less, but already has a bigger bag than Nick 😂. I swear Nick has NEVER gotten better or worked on his game. He’s literally got no bag lmfao. I used to not really like Chris but I respect he made his game better
First time I've watched Chris in a long time when did this dude get this good he was always a beast In the post but this brother done got a handle and shooting wow
I think I’ve switched my opinions on both of these guys, I’ve lost respect for Chris and gain respect for Nick. All this man Chris does is complain, and to be honest nick honestly didn’t complain at all throughout the tournament
this was the best finals match up we could ask for
Draymond White
Can’t stand to watch Chris such a cry baby every single play. Give him a tec
Crs is so bad
Chris actually had me rooting for nick 💀
Chris always throwing a tantrum bruh, I had chris winning the game aswell but he got a little bit to roudy.
Crazy how no one like chris🤣
Wah 👶🏻 @chris
Yo he really gotta play people his size
Nobody like chris
Lol the footage of Crs in the parking lot still saying bye sent me 😂
LFG CRSWHT
Chris is so lucky to be that size he has the perfect size he’s quick he can easily back down his opponents to the paint he can shoot 3s this man is lucky
It was a faul
How is Crswht the biggest crybaby, the biggest in the room, and still manages to struggle against ppl half his size. The man literally acts like he’s Kobe after he scores a bucket. This is why he always failed in the real hooper scene. Which is why he is better off being a content guy
Chris has to be the biggest trash player in the community always making excuses
chris cries too much...whack ending ngl
I love the toxicity 😂
Not gonna lie it was a rip through elbow was pointing down and his body pivoted
HOOOOOLIESSSSS
Crswht is so annoying complains like a baby to every time he steps foot on a court
CRS owes the refs an apology…
Chris dribble the ball. If everyone just watches he carries the ball😂
“Tell me you’re giving him game 2 without telling me you’re giving him game 2.”  Misses the easiest layup in the history of layups.
Why isn’t the bottom ref getting the ball after a shot lol
Never seen anyone complain like this fat dude smh
dont invite him back then nobody wants to see him there lmao
Every game cris is in “he scooped me that’s a foul”  This game “I scooped him how is that a foul”
White complaining about his slippery fingers and nick can't quit tugging on his shorts and sleeves
Chris is so overweight and out of shape. Cant run. Doesnt know how to play with his body.  Nick B is super athletic, runs fast but awkward, doesnt know how to play with his body.
“I play streetball.” But thens complains about contact every possession. Many of the calls he argued were good calls.
i have never heard sm complaining in my life
Yall tweaking if yall don’t think that last call was bs
Good call Chris is the biggest crybaby
That elbow was ridiculous! Clear offense foul. The only guy that complains more than Julian Newman. Never thought I say that.
Just realize. Nick literally has no dribble game. Literally just run to the basket or shoot threes.
Chris will miss a wide open layup and say that it's a foul smh.
If nick ran around him every time easy lay up. And why is WHITE pulling 3s? Body him down and you win. Play your strengths boys. Should be a 10 min video but they wanna keep brickin
If Nick wasn't being nice bro he can fly past Chris Every time 😂
Why does he complain about every shot? 😂 such a joke
Wanted this match for such a long time
Crswht vs pantos from friga fam, does the game even start?
*IF YOU THINK ALL THE FOULS NICK DID ON CRS ARENT FOULS.. YOU OBVIOUSLY DONT KNOW BASKETBALL* 💯😂
Baby bully chris
Wide body Benz in the house
Bad look for Chris , stop bringing him on . He just don’t know how to market himself or carry himself . He won now but he just looked like a baby the whole video
Not gon lie, crs was locked in that first game, scored on all 3 levels🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
idk what's worse hearing him cry or wheezing for breath the whole time
Yo ass a cry baby crs
forfeit
Dude is a PUSS😂
I wish Nick won this. Chris is just a pain.
Havent technicals is wild
The biggest baby I ever soon hoop
They’re both trash. There was no real competition in this series.
this game makes me like chris even less smh and mind you i dont like nick either.
Yall need a dribble limit.
Chris white a big ass crybaby...airballed of the snatch and said he almost rolled his ankle lol..ion like either one of em lol
I've never seen someone cry that much in a basketball game. how do you consistently yell "he's a baby" and yet cry every possession
Chris a loudmouth 😂
How do you complain about someone dribbling and being fast in a game of basketball but then use your big ass body on a smaller person🤦🏻‍♂️😂 Creator league needs to do better matchups with weight class cause if all we gonna hear is complaints from the players cause they to fast or to big it’s so 💩
stop putting Chris in these..his channel is dead for a reason no one wants to watch him
THAT WAS SO TOXIC AND FUNNY AT THE SAME TIME
@29:45 CRSWHT does the Reggie Miller leg kick move to draw the foul and he cries not getting the call. lol
He did not touch crswht leg on god
This man Cris is a Postscorer going against guards
Bruh Chris was pissing me off the whole video mf just play damn!😡
Almost had to stop watching this one from the cringe of seeing a grown man whine and cry after every single play in a pick up basketball game, all respect to Nick for continuing to play his game and not let his emotions get the best of him while having to deal with the man child in front of him
can bro stop yapping
White out 😂😂
Chris (I complain at every call) White
HOOLIES
Chris complains like a woman ur a giant and backing into them like a truck with no rear view mirror
chris leaving to catch his breath funny asl
Bro Chris complained every possession 😂
I never wanna see Chris play, he is such a cry baby, like bro only cuz u out of shape, get tired super fast and can't handle the hustle in the game from your opponent and ref calls don't mean sh*t. Don't play back then,  so immature.
Chris cries so much it’s hard to watch
Chris has to be the biggest pussy to ever play this game... jeez bro just shut your mouth and get your conditioning up. Fatty
Bro think this the nba and the ref rigg the game 😂😂😂 bro they don’t care you foul you foul
Say a lil blood never hurt nobody to magic 😂
My kids ever ask me what internet gangster looks like , this the video I’m showing em , these two were talking about shooting each other bout 1 or 2 years ago and here they are playing 1’s 😂😂😂, and Chris how u gon be 500 pounds 6’7 and cry about non existing fouls . Change em diapers u hippo
Nick you need to develop a bag and find more open shots js Brody 💯🤷🏽and Chris my guy you there is no way you play more than me and still haven’t got that cardio together you gotta cut down my man 💯🤷🏽
Sheesh the way this went had me rooting for Nick lmao
Sh*t-talking when you’re good is one thing, but these wannabe street ballers just drag on with this.  Also, Ive never before hear someone complain someone is one dimensional, while being one dimensional.
What a drag bruh
Way to go chris!!!! Show em how it's done!
This had to be scripted…
Worst 1v1 I ever saw, both cried, both bitched, both soft, both have zero toughness. Take my ball and I'm going home mentality. Good content I guess but man it was tough to watch this. They don't make real ballers anymore
Chris is certified ass and annoying lmfaoo
That elbow at the end would be a foul in the UFC. Nick did foul him just before though, in my opinion
Biggest guy in the league wins it🙄
Wanted nick to win so bad,crswht such a Manbaby even against Cam all he does is whine
Did all that for a break, should have let him walk
Finessed me a smooth ten min break at the end 😂🤣🤣 they so mad and triggered y’all lol bots are like 👱🏼‍♀️s 🤣🤣
People talking about Chris negatively is hilarious. He beat Nick playing a small mans game in the first game and when he posted, Nick was dry humping him. Size doesnt matter, fouls are fouls.
this was shittiest game ever honestly, you had two niggas with no bag for real tbh, chris throwing his body and nick running round like a lil kid, an then they both complain about foul this foul that, bro both of them suck ass, creator league channel is dried out now, The Next Chapter does better content then this bullshit.
Never seen someone as big as homie that cries like that! What’s his name? CryBaby Chris
Chris is a cry baby.  I'm done watching this cry baby throw his weight around and crying about fouls.  Anymore title or thumb nails with him playing I'm not watching.
Bro I have never seen 2 grown men complain and cry so much in my entire life. I damn near had to mute it
Dude said he play street ball 😂😂man you cry to damm much to play street ball don’t even jump high enough off the ground for someone to take his legs out
This dude is so corny 😭😭😭
Bro can't tell julian he's a crybaby
Chris is a clown! In athletic and only gets baskets because he’s a giant who bodies in the paint lol
Yo nick it’s getting cook buy white lol
#Crswht 🐃🐃🐃🏀🔥🏆 (Undefeated)
Chris whines like a girl. Nick keeps his cool most of time.
Chris would call a foul if someone breathed on him😂
That was a soft ass offensive foul call by the refs. That was not a offensive foul by Chris. That was a flop
This dude big asf crying when a guard size player use his body 💀
This whack, I’m going to watch Frigmas.
And this idiot gives tips on how to hoop ⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️
This mfer chris was huffing and puffing after the first 3 jump shots🤣🤣🤣 Bro has been on the zion diet without the basketball practice💀
Nick got no bag at all lol
Foul lol
Stop inviting Chris white. Dude complains constantly when no one is even around him. Unethical hooper
21:50 wasn’t even a foul
I I don't know if I should call CRWHT's game basketball.
how are you 725 lbs complaining like a 2 year old 😂
Nick crying Chris backing him down but Chris hit more shots than lay ups and he is a big. Nick got no bag he just dribbles in circles. If his shot isn't falling he is dead in the water vs anyone his size or bigger.
Why you calling foul evedytime nick got the ball SMH
So if he lost he wouldn’t play here no more , but because he won everything is ok now ?? I was a Chris fan idk no mo 🤷🏽‍♂️
There ain’t no way Crswht can be serious, he has to be trolling at this point ….. he complains about being fouled, he complains about not fouling, he complains about Briz playstyle, the ball keeps slipping out of his hand when he misses jumpers, he rage quits like a 400 pound baby and says he is never playing in the Creator League again …… Just disgusting and embarrassing, but you know how the masses just love toxicity!!!
Can’t lie… without Nick Briz, Chris would be nobody lmao
Bro stop inviting Chris... He's straight ass. And bitches more then anybody on YouTube .. grown ass man complaining over everything. Then talks lame all game to give himself the out of he loses.. real ones can see it
Chris literally took a 5 min break then comes back and continues the 1v1 hello?
pusssy would walk off
Bro said I'm leaving  then walked right back in 😂
the reffs did really bad throughout this whole thing dont have any if they aren't going to call the right calls they are just standing there blowing the whistle at wat they feel like calling a foul when it's clear as day there's hella fouls and dirty plays that could of lead to career injuries from how many fouls everyone in this tourney got away with...the matchups were cool and all I'm not hating the content is there but the reffs need to do a better job I'm sure every one with a brain can agree with me here...🤔
CRS a fukin cry baby..thats all i got outta this smh
Should have handed Chris a trophy at the end that said CRY BABY on it, I’d pay 5 grand to make that happen… I’m dead ass serious too 😂😂
Notice how nick isn’t saying “omg he’s so good “ or “he can shoot” like he did for everyone else lmao
The red one ia sucks...
crswht is not from brooklyn he was born and raised in buffalo upstate ny then moved to a safe white are of brooklyn when he was 14, hes a poser
Chris did hit him with an elbow… AFTER Nick bodied him, twice. The foul should have been in Nick before the elbow even happened.
I can already see cashnasty “I likes this” 😈😈
yesssirrr chris
Congrats and everything Chris. But you are INCREDIBLY unlikeable. Go learn some sportsmanship and keep your mouth shut a little more and you might develop a very real following.
Nick is so chill anymore and laid back it’s crazy Chris just cries and cries
I mean chris up by 4 just score again
Crswht has improved a lot but it’s ok to just miss a shot. Every miss it was “he fouled me” or the “ball slipped”. No one is gonna shoot 100%. He made a lot of tough shots but game 3, game point, it was a clear out. Nick might have been throwing his body into him but he was backing down, throwing his body into Nick as well, until he elbowed Nick to the ground.
This game between these two was personal😂❤
CRY BABY Chris white…. What a pathetic performance
CRY BABY Chris white…. What a pathetic performance
CRS made us actually like Nick…
Ngl, nicks attitude has really calmed down. Happy for him fr
Better refs. No commentators is a great call. Needs to be live though....
Wow! This is embarrassing. Chris look at this video and see how you’re a cry baby for no reason. What a big tantrum this man just show in this tournament lol. U sad
i swear it aint no way Chris really from NY lmao. I never seen a person cry so much in life
HOOLIES 👹👹👹👹👹👹👹 MOBBY ! WHITE ‼️
Bruh this man  Chris is entering hezi god level of crying. Like wtf
He’s a big baby
They both complaining but they both had 500 attempts to score 😂
Crwht was crying too much
kawhi leonard bounce didnt bounce correctly but im not playing anymore csme out wit the dub Nick Briz u suck and got no bag, cris what ur my daddy
Chris uses his fat ass to bulldoze through smaller guards and has the nerve to complain about contact. This series was awful
Stop bitching  Chris u soft
You complain every call. 29:45 was not a foul. He jumped behind you. You just missed the layup.
Goofy ass boys
I play street but calling every foul on nick is crazy lmaoo
ME ENCANTAN ESTOS DOS CHICOS
Nah I wake up fucking your girlfriend
Nick brizzzz is sooooo trash man wtf
The only few things CRSWHT is missing is Speed and explosiveness footwork he really does always post up in game
Bro nick looks so locked in 😂
Lol man if they actually played real basketball instead of possession one shot Christ would be on the floor with a heart attack I swear. Talking about no bag. He’d be dead 😂
Damn Chris a big baby
nick acts like he is holding back on being aggressive
Chris keeps crying
Not gonna lie; Chris calls fouls way too much for someone that plays street ball lmao…everything favors him, man is 6’3 250 and backs everyone down half the time. If I were Nick, I would've kept running around nonstop until Chris gassed out 😂
Nick Briz should be Nick Brick. Dude is trash 😂
Stop complaining for fucks sake there not fouls
Plz stop doing these honest to god horrible content
well that was boring
Softest fucing big ive ever seen. Shi was horrible to watch
“I play street ball bro” continues to cry more than a newborn baby
CRS is actually the biggest crybaby on Yt. Bro is damn near 400 pounds and 4 plus inches taller and still finds ways to complain damn near every play. Nick can’t run around but his big ass can back him down every play 😂🤦‍♂️
Honestly Chris is just annoying to watch at this point.
whenever chris does the twinkle fingers thing his opponent makes the shot every time... i stg go thru the clips
Chris always walking out on games from so called "bad reffing". Annoying af, next time he does it again it should just be a forfeit.
Mr Nick B miss lots of important shots. Not being a basketball nerd here but Mr C took those shots better
Imagine not changing it 2 years balling?  Whining, whining and more.... ?
Didn't know pigs could cry 😂
I know that any of the guys can eat me alive but most of this creator league is bad basketball. It makes you realize just how much these guys edit their YouTube videos.
He’s actually crying for running around the court? Is this dude actually serious. LMAOOO
I’m just over it
Chris wanna talk abt 0 bag when he literally backs down ppl 8 ft shorter then him 😭
He won 3v3 with Friga and YPK Raye, now he's won the 1v1!
Crswht is now officially: A 2-TIME CREATOR LEAGUE CHAMPION!!!
I would put down 10 bands on Chris knowing I’m getting my money back and some. Just keeping it real
If Chris was in shape he would be a lot better than he already is.
CrsWht finishes the season Undefeated!!! 5-0!!! But come on, almost everyone knew Chris was winning this, right?
I'm leaving. I'm leaving. - CRSWHT. HAHAHAHAHAHA 💀💀
Once again CHRIS CRYING HIS ASS OFF BEING THAT BIG AND STILL CRYING OVER EVERY SINGLE PLAY HOLY CRAP I can’t stand this dude personality. He’s the worst.
Chris is the biggest cry baby I ever seen. Big for nothing ass
Good win Chris, made some tough shots  Also why cut out all the arguments that's the best part😂
We knew who won before the vid even started smh iykyk
Chris is so toxic that most people are siding with nick
This whole league was designed for the big fat dude whatever his name is to back his way into the paint and put it in. Pathetic. TNC and Friga is what this space is about. Not this BS
chris has to be one of the biggest and most annoying crybabies i've ever seen on a basketball court. 6'6 300+ pound man crying about getting touched on his arm after backing down nick every possession
"I play street ball" proceeds to complain about fouls every play 😂
Don't bring Chris back. It ruins the league.
Chris throwing a tantrum like a child was embarrassing to watch.
🔥🔥
Chris white is NOT a legit hooper. He a baby and complains evey 5 seconds
Like Crs, wish he didnt complain so much in this game.  He beats Nick routinely 1v1 though.  They go to the same gym.
Ironic he won off a layup
Rage sitting in the corner like the Queen... WTF?!?!!
Rigged ahh game bro can’t just quit then come back Just like the NBA
GG!
Hoolies🔛🔝
Both these guys are pretty trash tbh nick athletic but he can’t shoot
The did all the games in one day?
BIG HOOOLIES SH!t 🔥🔥🔥
Crs has gotta be the biggest cry baby in the space, don't invite him to nothing he such a diva
Four points in and Chris is out of breath 😂😂
Nick briz really is trash lol
Unlimited dribbles is such a bullshit rule
They both corny asf
But he got a bag for big man..
I loved the jarring edit at the beginning where you took out what Crs introduced Nick as...
Pull the chair on him every time 💀
Big Hoolie win! Haters be complaining 😂.  🔥🔥🔥
Bowser vs Luigi
Mugs is lucky I grew up in a small place cause that whole tournament would've been bbq chicken
What did I just watch
Good game
Love how they edit the intro a bit🤣🤣
Chris' prize should be a jersey that fits him and hides those man t*ties he's got going on.
I don’t think there’s any YouTuber who complains/ makes as many excuses as Chris 😂 especially a tired Chris 😂 like just play bro such a bad look. Talks ish for nick using his stamina advantage but will back down all day #hypocrite
They cut a lot out 😂
lmao this is the opposite of friga, but then again friga only lost last tourney cuz he didn't call fouls so i really won't fault chris for crying 😂
Chris is a big baby
And chris wonders why everyone has beef with him he's the most toxic youtuber ever
you can’t put a 6’3 370 pound o linemen up against a bunch of 6’1 and below guards… he should’ve played a bunch of other centers. he wouldn’t have won a game against actual comp😂
*Crs kicks his own leg out* "BRUH HE TRIED TO TAKE MY LEG OUT IN THE AIR!!!" stfu 😂😂😂
When you’re so out of shape you fake wanting to quit just to catch a breath 🤣🤣
I hate that I watched this....
You can't play bully ball and expect every foul to be called.
I definitely expected this ending tho😂 alotta complaints backdown and a bunch of other shi lmao look at rage lil ah walking 😂
Why does Yourrage sit right behind the court… bloke is trying too hard to be noticed.
I rock with Crs. Nigga just cry to much.
It’s crazy how after everything these two make it to the finals and face off, it’s a game we wanna witness fr🔥💯
Chris is a crybaby 😢
Chris yelling, he took my leg out. 29:45 is the epitome of his game. Chris cries foul every time, literally when nobody is around him. Go eat a cheesecake.
Crs is nearly 40. He has every right to tear up after every call. Hes dedicated half a lifetime to basketball
Nah we don't want chris playing anyway, boring watching him go to the low post over and over again, make the games 3 dribbles if chris playing
Nick getting to the finals with 0 basketball skills speaks to the competition of this tournament lmao
all he does is post up his not good
unwatchable with the giant crybaby, stop inviting that clown
On God this n*gga mad big and the most baby youtuber out there and he claims hes from the hood 🤦🏻‍♂️. Damnn i like you chris but its time to man up bro
Ref is terrible
Chris is lowkey trash
Chris White makes it impossible to like him😂
15:40-15:43 was not a foul. Like bro it was a steal
350 likes 👍 run it up 👍👍✅✅
Chris is the biggest crybaby I’ve ever seen 💀
brick city matchup
This man one the biggest babies ik , crying & walking out the gym cause of a call
😂
Chris one of the biggest babies ever, complains after every shot. Every play, complains if Nick runs 😂 when he backed him down half the plays
Nick spamming the dribble and trolling is the funniest thing i’ve seen in a while. That for sure is the pg version of the center back down
Dawg he to big to be crying like that man , y’all should also balance it out big man camping the paint and don’t wanna play defense this terrible
Overall I think not having the matches live kinda took the excitement out. I think having them live was way better. But not too bad👍
Surely he can’t scream and bark when he shoots
How are yall fans of CrsWht… he’s such a big bih 🫠
I see why he never made it to the NBA or anything. He acting like he’s playing for a spot in the BiG 3 or something haha 😅 now I don’t have to hear about him again. Stop playing guys you know you can just back down haha he definitely can’t play any full court.
Tf is a Briz
LETS GO!
LETS GO HOOLIES
At 29:45 Chris says he took his nick too his leg out when he nock literally jumped back out the way 😂and Chris stays complaining about how people play when he does the same thing too.He complained that cam was shooting top of the key and he complaines when nick does a lot of moving around to get open for a shot like come on nobody is criticizing him the whole time 💀
Chris always crying like a baby 😂😂😂
CRSWHT complaining about someone running in  basketball is crazy 😅 🤡
Enhorabuena crish
