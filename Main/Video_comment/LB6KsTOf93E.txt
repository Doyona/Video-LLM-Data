What happen🤪😂😂😂 nope not the second best...bra🤜🤛👊👎
Eubank working in the call centre now?
Slid into my DMs  😴😴😴😴.   Shame his hubris can't translate into obtaining a world title.
Why does he keep saying about his dad retiring at 32 like hes trying to say hes better than his dad he wouldn’t last past the 3rd with his old man
All these people getting bent out of shape for for people saying chris will win. Chris isnt great but he will batter Liam Smith. It plain and simple. No basic Gallagher fighter who is okay at everything but good at nothing will beat chris. Again chris is no world beater but he batters liam. Liam might of won a wbo belt bit it was vacant. Atleast chris has beat former world champs which is more than Liam however shot Degale and Abraham were they were world champs. That aside the smaller man whos slower and has a more basic style is getting battered its that simple and it will 100 percent happen. Ps I know Vargas was a champ but at 140! the guys Eubankd beat were champs at 168 let that sink in
This fella needs to wake up quick.Liam is going to show him experience period. Kirkdale proud.
It's funny how he wants an old ggg, but he doesn't mention canelo? 😂
Rahh he’s got two different shape eyes
His father was a legend he is a thug in comparison
Eubank probably wins by stoppage here but that’s only because in my view smith is in the pocket close range pretty much the whole time and will walk on to too many shots from round one and will take its toll mid rounds. Only way I see smith winning is he might catch him early with something that Eubank feels  and make Eubanks try to box on the back foot and win rounds by being the aggressor as Eubank isn’t very good at controlling fights he will give rounds away like that but if eubank feels he can stand and exchange and take the odd shot he will finish the fight within 8 rounds. I want smith to win he has been a great fighter and always comes to fight
In his prime 😂 who’s he beaten? A past it Degale? 🤦🏻‍♂️
I can’t wait to see his face when beefy beats him
He's fought canelo it's not Gona be the toughest fight he's been in Chris
No we’re and tere but his left eyes hanging down his face 🤣🤣
All you sad little worms criticising Eubank are so sad it's hard to imagine what kind of existence you people actually live😄
Think he gets battered
5:54 if you're looking for it bois
His father retired at 32 years old because he'd been involved in so many brutal wars in the ring he was done at that point, Chris Jrn has had any sort of career like his old man, not at all.
Eubank is gonna batter Smith. I want Smith to win really badly but his style is made for Jr. I tell you now Smith has no hope whatsoever. None
Mr Smooth vs Mr Rough
From a south end scouser let's keep it facts, im not even from the north end but Liam Smith is not or never has been no walk over. No gimmicks, no hype, no wwe persona to keep up with, just a talented fighter with a big heart. His achievements don't stack up admittedly he should have a lot more. Hopefully you make this one count! 🦾
I just find it a bit sad he went as low as grey hair
SERIOUS THESE TV STATIONS SITLL HAVE A DELAY WHEN SPEAKING WHAT THE ACTUALY F!! LITERALLY RING HIM PUT ON AN EARPOD AND SPEAK NO DELAY!!! someone needs to be fired WORLDWIDE for having a delay in conversations.
This guy is calling for ggg in 2028
You talk to much Chris you  have never won a proper  belt u not that good Mr you never be like your dad never
Since when did Eubank Jr work in a call centre must be a part time job. Haven't seen him fight in a while.
I've never known anyone to have so much hate, then 6 months later so much love, Chris Eubank Jr is one funny man. I'm just a guy in a KFC jacket, trying to make a living.
Eubank jr average smith will do him
This is gonna be a good fight no that 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
World cham v World chump
You are not at your peak Chris. Ur still learning .Roy Jones. Each trainer you will learn new skills 👌.I'm not criticising. In a negative way .you learn different techniques from different trainers n people etc etc .u are hitting better and having more k owledge n experiences .that's how 🤔 u learn n become better
Although, if anyone can design a game plan to victory then it's Roy Jones Jr for sure
Man's got a real pointy head
Eubank will come unstuck against Liam 🥊
Liam gone within 8 rounds
You can buy an IBO belt in Poundland mate, at best an average domestic
GGG vs Eubank Next pls???
His little brother whooped the guy who dominated you Christopher, Smith comfortable UD.
I really like eubank jr
C’mon Chris smash him to bits buh. 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
Chris working from the office today
roy jones jr not the master when he met joe calzaghe
Hopefully a great fight ahead x
Come on Liam, knock him out
Eubank talks like he is a world class fighter! He has lost anytime he has faced half decent fighters.
I remember looking up old vids of Chris eubank in 2014, discovered he had a son fighting, been checking since.. I like Chris is learning to broaden his fight skills but I do miss the uppercuts.
Eubank is the biggest w!@#@ ever honest to god hes a joke of a man
Eubank Jr just knows how to wind everyone up not just his opponent 😂 look at some of the comments and you just see he gets so many people rattled😂😂 great fight with 2 brilliant fighters
Imagine your trainer RJJ and your dad is Eubank.
You've never beat a class boxer and Liam's gonna school ya son
At 4:20 he says"you can't buy the energy,experience and the sexiness etc that Roy Jones brings to my team". Does that mean Roy's doing it for free?? It's very kind of him!!
He is domestic level eubank
huge night, yeah right.
I love how calm an collected he is
Come on Liam Smith!! Teach him a lesson!!
Chris 'call centre' eubank jnr💯
Guys been at his peak since he started 🤣won  nothing of note except the British title, and still thinks Canelo and GGG know who he even is, why the hell would either of them fight him what would they gain, he is know in Britain because of his dad's name end of story, he isn't a house hold name outside of Britain, at least Smith had a world title when he fought Canelo, this guy craves the celebrity side of boxing so much, I hope Smith wins by points and this kid sails off in too the night and straight into the big brother house or the Jungle we all know thats what he really wants to be and thats a celebrity
Smith is the better boxer but he's been in some wars. I just think Eubank is fresher and has the engine. Difficult to call, Smith could outbox him but equally could get old on the night. Definitely one I will be watching
*Be Safe 🍷👍*
Tyrone Booth slid in to ya sisters dm’s  Told her to come here and *Be Safe🍷👍*
hair transplant eddie
Chris eubank is a good man... Lets stop the hate gentleman and act more maturely... Being hateful will only make you age like liam smith 🤣😜
You ain't fit to lace GGGs boots ,delusions of grandeur
60 percent?  Why Jones then
His dad retired cos he fought dogs. Can't compare the two. . Banana skin for jnr
What's happened to Eubank KFC jacket
Smiths fought Canelo. But yer he’s rattled by little eubank
50% aye ..why you got jones training u..
Eubank Jnr still banging on about a GGG fight that he's already ducked for years zzzzzz
I thInk Eubank will be too big. I expect a high work rate fight with Eubank pulling away down the stretch. Late stoppage possible.
Slid into your DM's? Sounds like Smith wanted a picture of you and what you were wearing at that moment in time.
Canelo Álvarez and Gennadiy 'GGG' Golovkin I think thats a bit of a streatch for Eubank. He's been already beaten by Groves and Sunders, so, even he dosn't beat Canelo or GGG you cannot knock his ambition.
Battle off the fake teeth .
FLAT EARTHERs next thing you will be saying is that the sun is a corn flake
Looks like Eubanks live ….from the job centre 😂
How have we got to the point where this is PPV?
How many years has he been “just coming into his prime”
he’s sponsored by KFC and manages to say zingers in this interview haha quality
Not a Eubanks fan but he will destroy smith
Kidding no one Chris. You're about to lose. Albeit on points and not a KO like I would like to see but still, you'll be retired after this.
Needs to be a world champion to be great
Yes Chris your levels above a world champion and youve achieved loads in the sport like Smith. 🤣 Keep them coming
Roid Jones Jr
It’s like listening to a sink full of dishwater
This man has had GGG at the top of his list since 2014 zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
If Liam tries to stand and trade he gets knocked out
Is he being interviewed on his break at a call center :D
Hope he edged that ratty beard up when he was drunk...loving the two piece tash too haha.
You can't buy that sort of sauce, spice, talent??? Your paying him for training you ya sausage!! Smith will batter you!
‘Slid’ into dms… ur talking about another male not some girl on insta, bit sus
‘Slid’ into dms… ur talking about another male not some girl on insta, bit sus
"chasing" the GGG fight for years is that why kell brook fought him , ducker
Trainings going good. He’s put in ten% this week.
He's so unlikeable.
Should be a good fight this one. Looking forward to it i'm going the undercard is looking good to.
Tbh belts are becoming a bit pointless as there are so many organisations now and categories. Perhaps Chris needs one in his career but money talks, and a domestic dust up is a good way of doing it. GGG won’t fight Chris as he wasted his time before, he would be better going for another champion who is a lesser name.
Probably chopped n changed who wins this more than any other, should be a great fight
I think Junior beats Smith within 6
Chris has grown up to be a tru man.. He's grown on a lot of people in the last 2 years..
Whether you like Eubanks or not, you know he will win this fight, he's a better calibre of fighter than smith. Smith has been champion but that win was no match for a fight with Eubank. Situation favoured Smith and he won an easy title. Eubanks power and versatility will win through I'm sure .
BOX OFFICE!! ROBBING BARSTARDS!!! BUNCH OF SCAM ARTISTS!!!
Roy adds nothing because you don't have to skill or brain to carry roys style out 🤣🤣
Eubanks definitely knows how to play the game he knows this is he’s toughest fight since Saunders and Groves and we all know what happened in those two fights 🥊🥊
Using a Dior jacket as a sweatsuit. Finally rate something you’ve done Chris
If golovkin had gotten him when he lost his pen his career may have been over at top level
this man is well raised, his father is a legend, and hopfully eubank jr can be remembered as a legend too
How's Ronnie Davies doing hope he gets on we with Roy
Eubank couldn't rattle smith.
Yes your father retired at 32, but he’d actually done something in the sport
He acts like hes a world champion🤣,smith has been there done it all
Actually, you can buy that level of experience and knowledge, chris. I mean, he is not working in your camp for nothing. Lol gonna be a great fight.
The build up to fights these days  "He's been in my DMs" I've got not excitement for this fight, Connor Benn is a knob for robbing us of that fight. I wanted Connor to win that, I don't care who wins this. Still waiting for him to fight Golovkin, juniors style is to wait until the fighter past their prime before he'll even consider get in the ring with them and Golovkins still winning but looking like it's getting tougher for the old fella.
i wish a reporter would ask this fella who he's best win is ? why he turned down GGG in the past & why he is he waiting til GGG is nearly retired to look to fight him?
Eubank sparks smith
That's cause you ain't fought anyone with bad intensions
50/50 but I fancy ubank theses styles should jel smiths comes forward who can take the shots 👊👊
Eubank wins it won’t be easy could be points or a KO he’s just to strong,big and he’s work rate is to much we know smith can be stopped 💪🏼💪🏼
Jr always trying to fight people 10 minutes from retirement!
Smith fans excuse for when he loses = ah beefy was coming up in weight  Eubank fans excuse for when he loses = Jr had to lose so much weight because of Benn he wasn't the same
Smith overwhelms Eubank Jr for most of the fight. Eubank will run out of options, because he can't adapt in these situations
Is this fight a 50 / 50 ?.......yes or no ...what you saying ? ...... me personally no bs my heart says ls my head unfortunately is swaying towards junior.
People commenting on why are sky constantly speaking to eubank.  Perhaps smith isn't making himself available, or perhaps it's just because he's fairly dull to listen  to.  Eubank is the guy who's selling this fight
Shout out to mr 60%
I think if Chris decides to fight for the whole 12 rounds he can really win this, more often than not he decides not to though 🤔
Eubanks going to smoke him 💨
Eubanks gna walk through him and take him out, be over in 8-9 rounds. I actually prefer Smith as a person but  if they both come in at their best, Eubank will be too big, too fit and too tough for Smith.
Battle of the teeth..
it could go either way defo but ill be rooting for chris eubank his cockiness gets under fighters skin and its funny to watch
Why they all interviewing Chris. How about smith. Seen jnr on talk sport and everywhere else but not smith. Is this intentional ?
Wants to fight a 41 yr old Golovkin 😂😂😂😂
Going with Cwith Jr. a decent to watch cardio monster.
I respect Liam, but Eubank is a different beast🥊🥊🥊🥊   This will be a good fight🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
The man who's been definitely fighting Golovkin next year for the last 8 years
Chris will beat him nothing william has can bother chris it be good fight but chris has to much for him
U can't buy that sort of energy or experience but isn't Roy Jones Jr being paid for his services as a trainer???
Jnrs right Smith isn't on his level. Jnrs fringe world level and Smith is world level 🤣🤣
He'll be going for that golovkin fight when ggg is 50, maybe 😂
Notice everything Chris says is a contradiction
Smith was a legitimate world champ Eubanks as never been a wbc wba ibf or wbo he was a ibo champ and he's talking about levels 😂
I'll watch this fight 🥊
This much of confidence will make hard to get back up after defeat. Total disregard for opponent like Liam Smith is not good sign.
Man Eubank Jr is cringe but boy he does it good!
Eubank easy win.👊
SKY presenter.. tatty dress style...ooops
Did he say he’s a goat ????????? Don’t know if I’ve misheard that.. did the presenter say Chris is a goat ??? 38-39 seconds in ?? Please tell me I’m mishearing this
Smith points win. Eubank will sell rematch on ring rust being a year out blar blar. Thanks for the money coral
Never been more confident than in a smith. Loving the bookies odds donuts go with Eubank every time. Bookies had him favourite vs groves 😂 thanks for the money boys
Listen to ibo world champion🤣🤣🤣
But Chris money did buy Roy's energy
Wales for Smith 🥳🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Wow moves like rrj on d pads  Don't worry he's no RRJ lol
What is it that eubank thinks he has achieved?
If eubank loses this fight he's gonna feel like a Kentucky fried idiot, rocky 2 🥊
He's looking Slow 🐌 🦥 🐌 🦥 🤔
Liam Smith has achieved more in boxing than Eubank Jr….
Eubanks never won a world title,smashed by groves,lost to Billy Joe
Could go either way tbh
A minute in and all he has done is name dropped he will never be an elite level fighter and will only win title if he cherry picks and gets lucky that being said I think he will win next week
