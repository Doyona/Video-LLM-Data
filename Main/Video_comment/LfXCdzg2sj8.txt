busy busy busy busy busy busy 😅
That hair on Arms, gorgeous (Corkish gorgeous!) ❤
😂
These are spot on. I would like to know how the lad's name is spelled. CC says Oishin, but to me being  from America it sounds like ocean or it may be O'Shawn. 😊 help. Thanks. In Joy
😂😂😂😂😂
Последний смех был лишним
Thats very very funny
Thank you for helping to coach us parents on how to parent our adult children well enough while they are maybe always discussing which set of parents) are the best for them.
I never knew Oisín had a middle name. Robert.
☘️
Arms looks like the younger version of Keane's Tom Chaplin here 😅
I love this mum caracter.
Conor is so hot!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
How does Hog even do it?....
Oh my god I always had a crush on Arms but his hair in the outro is fantastic.
I haveonly ever had one partner. As he had some girls from his class call and dump me I remember dad just sitting there, hugging me<3 miss dad, he was amazing:)
😂😂😂😂😂
"I'll take you to the garden centre and let you pick out a plant for yourself."😂😂😂😂
How does Robert become Osin for a nickname?
Arms hair at the end is so pretty.
"Oisin Robert Flannigan!"  Watch out when the full name comes out! 😂 Got the cheerful background music with him depressed. Perfect.
I love how they make the sets so realistic… whilst doing it all themselves… it’s not easy. They must be magicians.   Also, Anne is totally the person you need when you’ve been dumped… sympathetic, realistic… and slightly bitter 😅😂
Oishin needs a girl quickly. She could save him from his mother!😅
Foil is such an amazing actor, every character he’s done is done with perfection and his range is immeasurable. They’re all great but he’s probably the best
Like a young prince William 😂😂
I just can't get enough of this two!!! They are a hoot -- even after I've rewatched their sketches. Anndddd... The Oscar goes to Hog!
"We are a small island nation." 🤣
So, it’s two years later, but can we PLEASE get a sequel, “Parents When You Get Dumped (Again)?  I think Oisin and Barry squeaked by on their A-Levels and are now at uni.  Oisin was sure this one was “The One” But she dumped him for a rugby player doing the sports management course.  Oisin and Barry  could be eating magnums to drown Oisin’s sorrows when Anne enters and the whole “Single Looking to Mingle/Get Out of this House” exchange happens.  They are both still living at home and attending the local university.   Anne got Oisin a  Part-time job at the garden centre, And Barry was working at an ice cream shop but he got fired for eating too much of the product.
Maybe late to the party. But i spilled my water when i heard " Oisín Robert Flanagan" kkk
No I see why Barry wants so badly to be involved! He just missed the very beginning of the whole mum sketches thing 😢
2:30 That laugh feels so evil...
I love it that Oisin always wears business attire in those casual videos with his mom, regardless of situations 😂
I am a mom and I already knew what the mom would say before the video started.😂
Is that the same Breeda Moynaghan from the video "When Parents Drag You Places"? 😲
I just adore the mum!
We’re a small island nation…
So funny - coz true- typical mum useless dating advice  - I could add more!
"more trout in the Shannon" xD "we are a small island nation" so many gold lines
She’s a good mum
Anne and Oisin are the best characters, I watch them with my son, gives us a right laugh everytime!
My grandma has probably shipped me with my cousins before 🤣 southwest North Dakota is the equivalent of a small, isolated island nation
I love you Connor!
While rewatching it I have, finally, noticed the music in the background ... it made me think about Ludwig van Beethoven from Beethoven and Barry on student exchange with Oisin and Anne 🤣
You guys are so funny 😁 😂
Oisin Robert Flanningan!!!!
I was in bits already after “there are plenty more trout in the Shannon”
Small island nation - brilliant!
The Absolute Iconic Mother, brilliant! You're such a Great Team!
😆😆😆
I was just about to search a Foil, Arms and Hog video and then YouTube recommends me this at the top of the homepage! 😁
‘There are plenty more trout in the Shannon’ 😂 classic
Mums reaction was brilliant though. She cares and has some brilliant ideas. Especially the part about prince William. Lol. I think I’ve heard something similar myself.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤣
My goodness the mother is just like mine.
Haha lol
It s very comic. I ve like particuliary when the mother speak about dating with the cousin.
Mums are same world over.😄
Omg you guys are Killing me 😂
Laughing and crying at the same time 😂😢
Sit Down young man🤣🤣🤣
So relatable. Went through a really tough break up once years  ago. My mom tried to offer me all the rationalizations, including that he didn't have a real job lined up yet, so I was better off this way... She was pretty good about handling the situation, but that particular line did *not* help.
Oh dear, I look at Oisin's mom and I see myself. I know, I know.....🤣🤣🤣
Why are parents so clueless about dating? They act as if everything went perfectly smooth for them and they were never the victim of any games. Well, I guess the victims are clueless . . . Have to learn how to protect yourself by watching YouTube videos.
“It’s an exam year” - KILLED me, so spot on 😂😂
I knew EXACTLY what the mother was going to say.  😋
Am I the only one disturbed about Oisin not having a father?? D:
The “well that always cheers me up” is one of the sweetest moments between the characters. This series is just so good on so many levels!
What if Anne made Oisin’s girlfriend dump him because she wants him to study more or doesn’t want him to have a girlfriend?
Oisin’s face @0:43 😂
Anne is right, Oisin is certainly a catch.
This is a horrible thing to say.. but I just can't stop laughing whenever Foil is crying.. 🤣🤣
these characters are my faves. really brilliant.
You need to be careful Oh no we not talking about that
This just gave me more anxiety about my crush
How I love these guys…they’re hilarious!
Busy,busy,busy
"...in a few years time, they would be knocking down my door, queuing up outside. Beating them off with sticks "🤣😂🤣
The way Anne say crfl (careful) cracks me up.  Brilliant sketch.
the secret of a good sex ed talk with your kids is to make them more uncomfortable than you are.
As an American, I am fascinated by the word "queue"
This family is pure self reflection...
Third cousin. We are small island 😂😂😂😂 dying 😂
The chemistry between Foil and Arms at the end 💕
Ingenious sketch😀
"There are plenty more trout in the Shannon." Best. Quote. Ever.
Oisin Robert Flanagan. Every.Irish.Mother.Ever.
MY MOM HAS SAID ALL OF THE EXACT SAME THINGS TO ME AAAAAAAA
One time I had an Irish ex and I ended up having to break up with him and I’m laughing because I bet this was his conversation with his mom.
the way you portray the mother comes so close to my own abusive mother... never understanding, always stupendously pragmatic... are you guys sure this is the way you want to portray "parents"?
My goodness! How can anyone be so cute and talented? I just can't get enough of you, guys! It's one good thing to come out of 2020 for me - I found FAH 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Do a flannagen family movie. Love the family.
How long before we get an Oisinn and Darren crossover
Missed this one. Brilliant!
Love it!!
Perfect! A typical mother and son conversation, I love them.
when my x broke up(he had some female classmates of his call me up and tell me) dad just sat there, holding me and listening as I cried and let me say what I needed.
A few sketches of the mother trying to do a bit of sex ed to Oisin would be great.
“We are small island nation”...i want to visit Ireland and explore the island right now!
Sorry I hadn't finished say "" There's plenty more trout in the Shannon "" I be usi g that saying. Thank you again guys for bring so much laughter to us xo
I just love Anne ,she is just so real  .No matter what country you come from ,you can  identify with Anne as a mum. I just love her saying "" there's plenty more trout
Third cousin. ....
the most unrealistic part about this video is giving your parents inside on your life
Third cousin! 😳
"...in a few years time they'll be knocking down my door." Are they? 😁😂
Anne is a wondrous creation.  So like real mums!!
lol. goodness God, you silly guys hogs wrapped in foil arms. lol. just kidding. i know you are from ireland. now.
this is more talk then my mother xD   me: mom i got dumped mom:...... me:starts crying mom: here my boy have som vodka "pets my hair"
the iconic death glare of a teenager to their mother and the oh shit look of the parent is a time honored tradition
I love Oisins mum... She gives me such ptsd but I know she and mine mean well
When you get the full 3 names you know your mother means business 😂😂
Tjis is sooo funny. Obviously we are not only having all the same mother, I fear we also are becoming all the same mother ourselves 😂
“What if I never find anyone as good again?”  Get a cat or dog… take it out with you, and teach it to fetch you potential mates. I did that with my sister’s dog, but I forgot how to flirt -.-
I actually liked this mum! Cute vid
Plenty more fish in the sea 😉
Whenever I start to procrastinate, I hear Anne's voice in my head saying "Busy busy busy busy busybusy busybusybusybusy busy". I'm telling ya it's more effective than any 3 or 5 seconds rule :)
Lol
Soo good
2:01 Well hm! What you go say for me? I from Trinidad, so like I go have to marry my brother?
Oisin Robert Flanighan (if your mother calls you by full name), fasten your seatbelt the conversation can last for a million age..
Pleaseee show the bloopers as well
"3rd cousin" love it!!! Can't wait for you guys to come back to the States!
“They will be knocking down my door.” Me. I’m they who will be knocking down the door 🤣 oh my gosh these sketches always make me laugh
Sheer wonderfulness. Greetings and  hugs from Argentina
"sit down there young man"
Down to the garden centre with me..lol
this was so cute. one time when Osin's mom was nice to Osin
You know you are in trouble when mammy calls you by your full name 😅
I totally wish my mother was like this.
“She’s my cousin!”   I just about spewed my tea~~~!
When Anne says: busy busy busy, I want to hug and kiss Her!!! Hog, you are incredible!!!!
I GOT DOMPT!!!
So happy I found this channel!! Could use the laughs!! Love from NC
I love how Anne said "busy busy busy busy busy..." the hand gestures are perfect too. Died laughing when Anne threw some shade at the girl she knew from college...
Foil behaving like a teen being over 30 wearing a full office outfit. We aint complaining
Oisinn doesn't want plants? what kind of Gen Z is he? I'm tellin you bro, a trip to the bog hunting sundews with the gang always makes me feel better.
It's so true I'm 51 and starting to talk like the mum the speech / philosopher etc
- you have to be careful - no, mum, nooo - yes, because under the Irish law if she gets pregnant, she'd be refused an abortion or even adequate medical help if she decides to carry, but something goes wrong, so she may be left disabled for the rest of her life or even dead.
I have missed Anne Flanagan
“Third-cousin” And “we’re a small island nation” 😂😂
"Just leave me alone" if i spoke to my mum like that she'd  have my head🤣
She's actually quite a wonderful mother
I love the guy playing mum❤️
Just sitting here, feeling a little heartbroken myself, letting Mum cheer me up. Thanks, lads.
I have binged 10 years of content in a month (with alot of repeats) and I think there aren't enough Anne and oisin sketches. What am I going to do now ☹
Ann and Oisin sketches are brilliant. I can see why Arm is jealous not being in that sketch
Honestly staying busy helped me get through a break up. Still not over the dude but I’m ok since I keep working lol
Aww arms don’t feel bad! You are a talented and essential part of the FAH team ❤️ 🤗
This is so accurate to how teenage boy and his mom act!!! Reminds me of my mom and brother
The funny part is when we get older we realise out moms were right. Teenage hormones, now that's a battlefield.
I was expecting Ann to say “What do you mean by dumped? In the trash!?”
I noticed I'm getting old when I got excited about picking out a plant at the garden centre.
i have a friend at my school called oisin
I like how the translated title for sloven then translates back to 'parents when you get a basket'
Anne and Oisín having "the talk"is my new favourite thing hahahhaha 🤣🤣
When Barry's gonna have a gf?
What is it with Mum and Gardens!!!! Anyt wrong.. Come to the garden...!!...????
I had to laugh so hard, when I saw this, my kids looked at me all weirded out! Anne saying ALL THE THINGS that go through a mom’s head in this situation. The accuracy is eerie....I wonder: does one of Foil Arms and Hog’s moms help writing the Anne/Oisìn sketches?
Ahhh this has cheered me up so much :'D thanks lads!
The heart in the "that always makes me feel better" plus the "we're a small island nation" hit all the right notes. Loved this one guys!
Plenty of trouts in the Shannon 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oooh - “the only way to get over sadness is distraction! Busy busy busy!” Is this some subtle insight into Anne’s own heartache? 🤔 #overanalysis
She's my cousin  .....  3rd cousin
I really love the complexity and nuances of these characters. ❤️
The garden centre!!!! Yes!! That’s something my mummy would invite me to do when I’m down!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
why would the mum laugh at her son when he's out? that's mean
Garden centre ffs😂😂😂 and then trying to set u up with some1😂😂
I am not irish but this is my mother.
We're a small island nation *dead*
Eeerrr dum daaaaaaaaaaaa😁
Men playing the parts of women?  Uh oh, get ready for outrage from cancel culture!!!
Inaccurate.  "I got dumped." - "What did you do?"
as someone going through  a breakup i feel this video
You guys should do a skit with these two with the mammy trying to explain someone whose died via like 100 degrees of separation proper Irish mammy style! Example from my mammy: did you hear about .....A... you know.... A? No? Of course you do... !! What about B? NO??!!? Ah sure you're BOUND to know C or D? (This carries on for another 6-10 people)... Then I say "oh yeah! I know Q.... Mammy: WELL... You know Q's neighbour P, whose Uncle O is married to N and.... (Links all the way back to A)... "Well guess what.... They're DEAD!" 😆😆😆😆🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Small snecdote: When my mam was younger her sister had been dumped and spent the next few days crying alone in her room. My grandad remarked on the whole thing asking "Why's she still in there? It's a bit dramatic" "Daddy she's heartbroken" "Heh?" "Heartbroken"  "It's been two days!"  "Daddy have you ever been heartbroken before?" And while absolutely beaming he said "No pet. I always ended it first". My grandad was ruthless.
Hilarious! Can you please make more of Oisin and his Mum? My daughter, Lucéa, and I are big fans!
“She’s my cousin” Lmao
"in a few years time they will be knocking down ̶y̶̶o̶̶u̶̶r̶  my door!" 😂
There will always be that girl you went out with years ago that no other girl will measure up to lol
Beating them off with sticks
this was really funny and relatable!
The Irish accents make it even better!
“we are small island nation” good excuse
I haven't seen you guys for ages (on YouTube, that is :-) You made my day. Thanks!!
3rd cousin 😂
If the middle name comes out, the talk is getting serious
I've been waiting for this mum and son combo for a long time, thank you guys!
You should do an oisin and mum skit  "when parents friend you on Facebook"
class
Vous nous faites toujours rire 🤣 👋! Bravo à vous tous !👍👏
Hog is way to good at being a mother
He genuinely does look like a ‘young Prince William!’ 😂😂 Spot on!
fun fact: there is an Oisin x Barry fanfic on AO3
Well, as the irish saying goes. Flat 7up cures everything ;)
Honestly I loved the very end of the video the most 😁 Never go on holidays!
Aaah you see this is where Irish mums and Indian mums differ. Indian mums will whoop ass and tell us to get back to our studies. No girlfriends till we're 45
Ehhh...My mum will gonna throw me out of da house if she came to know I am dating a girl...
Anne Flanagan, the one-woman cheerleading team and relationship therapist.
Currful!
More from Barry in these sketcheeees please
I’m a Scottish Mammy to a teenage boy (and an 11 year old girl) I had to laugh as this is definitely the kind of thing I would say to my son. Although I would never suggest the garden centre 😂.
Amy relation to General Custer?  Uncanny resemblance
I'd feel so called out, but Oisin's mom is so great I feel good about myself.
Arms, don't regret going on holiday. Because of Anne Flanagan, I don't get in trouble anymore when cooking. Thank you Anne for reminding us to always "clean as you go".
I know i've seen Hog play this character a million times before but he makes such a convincing Irish mum.
Poor lad. You know, when you go for boyfriends instead, you don't have to be 'CAREFUL'. Mother is right about one thing though: it IS her loss.
She should invite Bride over for some tea.. Hhahahah..
😂😂😂😂 too accurate!
3:19 Never go on holidays? But how am I supposed to see you live? Is there an exception? 🥺
I love how that whole "You probably weren't in love with her" - "I waaas!" Is just the truth. As a teenager everything is so much and looking back in ten years he'll probably not even remember her name or at least deny being so dramatic about it.  Arms is going for that full "Im in a band now" look with his quarantine hair 😁👍
Was always expected him to in the end say "mum,  I'm think gay"....
Epic!
"...third cousin" perfect haha
Arms hair is so long ! I love it ! You look beautiful sir !
Has Oisín's mom always had that mole?
Could you please do a father ted skit
crying Oisín makes me uncomfortable...
Hair looking good, Arms!
Me all day 🤣😭
"Where a small island nation"  I died.
Oisín: She's my cousin! Anne: Well...third cousin. We're a small island nation!
Jesus imagine being set up on a date with your third cousin
Please include the dad next time!
That laugh at the end! 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
I also go and buy myself a plant whenever I need cheering up. I've got about 25 plants now...
Never go on holiday? Funny.
YOU CAN’T UPLOAD A VIDEO ABOUT BEING DUMPED ON THE EXACT DAY I GET DUMPED!! For fucks sake😂
Wait.... if oisin doesn't want a plant I'll take it
Never go on holidays.
We are a small island nation.
My grandma always says that the best way to get over a man is to get under a new one... She's like thrice divorced, but those are words I live by.
you guys are awesome
I’ll get you a plant is the sweetest thing ever.
I'll pick out a plant for myself there so, thank you. Don't be ungrateful, Oisin xD
i love Oisin messing and picking with things it looks so natural, like a distressed teenager
Badly timed lads haha, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
That snap and the look on the face after the comment "she had the boys..like that" got me good hahaha. reminds me of mum hahahah
im surprised that barry didnt show up
Can we swap Mrs Browns Boys for a full sitcom about Mrs Flanagan?
You robbed us of "the Conversation" at the end. Please do it, I would die 😂
Love these Oisín sketches. But what is Mum all about.  Irish people say Mam - don't we??💚
Where is Barry, when Oisin needs him? Oh...God bless Anne, she's the best..I would like to be like her one day..
Plenty of trout in the shannon 🤣
Pick out a plant sounds great
Pretty sure his dad would have taken him for a pint instead.
My absolute favourites!
You are great! ha ha ha
oh the prince willliam comment hit hard
Best way to get over a girl is to get over another. Helps the perspective.
Is mum’s mole bigger? Maybe she should go have that checked!
Don’t worry there’s plenty of more pints in the pubs to help the wash it away
Re Mrs O'Toole's daughter: historically, I believe it was the case that the Catholic Church in Ireland didn't let you marry anyone as closely related as a third cousin. So Oisín is quite right to reject her as a girlfriend.
So that's how the mum character was born!!!
She's my cousin... We are small island nation... That was hilarious
we all know he's technically married to barry anyway
Brilliant. Now I know what I'll say to my teenage son. Thanks, Anne!
Third cousin!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
My grandma was Irish & always said "what's for you won't go by you." It was even one of the last things she ssid to me.  My cousin & I were at her bedside in the hospital, I was engaged at the time & she had been on one date with a fella none of us knew about. So when she apologised that she wouldn't see my cousin's wedding but was glad she'd found a good man, then told me what's for you won't go by you.  We thought she'd mixed us up. Nope.  My now ex showed his true colours days later & started to be abusive until 8 police took him away. My cousin introduced the new man to us that Christmas & went on to  marry him. Unlike my ex he is a good man.   My now husband is the brother of a friend,  I met in our teens when she came to live with her dad. He visited her once while she lived here, but I didn't meet him then. When I went to visit her at her mum's, (2hrs away from where I lived)  he'd just left. At their dad's wedding I met him, but neither of us were single (remember that abusive ex? Yeah, I was with him pre-abuse. Hubby's ex wasn't so great either.) My friend now SIL got married, by which point hubby was single, but I was now engaged to ex & 2 months from the abuse starting. Then she sent her hubby to fix my PC after me & ex split & we've been together ever since. Despite his being in the Army & us never living closer that 3 hours apart until we were married. Grandma was right, life kept having us meet until we took the hint, that we were for each other. Seriously, 2020 proved beyond a doubt we were meant to be.  I imagine everyone who was in a prolonged lockdown found out if theor relationship was unbreakable or a mistake. I pity all the people in lockdown with the wrong person for them...
3:10 - I was thinking the same thing.
Best mum
Best mum ever 😄
Oh hey a video on April's fool day and it was fine.   You guys are the best
I was waiting for Barry to walk in!!
This was surprisingly heartwarming!
Can't wait for all this sh*t to be over and get to see you live again
I've made my sons hear about being careful. But especially about consent. Oh my, they didn't like it.
Love how the mammy says curfell 😂
Thank you once again internet for being my surrogate parents.
curfl
I know I’m old because I like the idea of going to the garden centre with my mum to choose a plant.
you're trending in the uk!
Cousin? 🤮 I switched the video off right there. Incest is not funny.
"There are plenty more trout in the Shannon!" - My new motto in life
Oisin, if she dumped you I'm single!
Is this what kids do these days.pathetic little boys
Oisin and his mom are my two favourite characters!!!! PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THEM ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ Love from Cape Town, South Africa
I mean seriously tho who in their right frame of mind would dump Oisin/Foil?
I will get you to pick out a plant for yourself 😂
E
She's my cousin.  Well, third cousin.  I've spent a lot of time with my cousins.  Now, what about third cousins 3 times removed?  You know.  Your 6th cousin.  I find it hard to be related.  We're an island where the percentage of population of green eyes is 10 times that of the population of the world.    The answers no.  Unless she's your only hope.-Obi Wan O'Shea
What is Oisín’s mothers name?
Now, Pet, you weren't in love. Yes I was! OK.😄♥️
You are the best comedy team on Earth at the moment.
Foils really trying to hold back the laughs at 1:17
"We are a small island nation" 🤣🤣 Love this, now who are these people who don't like this video...beats me!
“You gotta love yourself first”
R That was me 2 hours ago 🤣🤣☘️
My gran might be absolutely lovely to any girlfriends of her children and grandkids but if they break up they all get referred to as a wee hussy who she never liked anyway
good job as always :)
Big subscriber from Jamaica 🇯🇲
Becoming more handsome by the week you three!
Oh lads... brilliant 🙈😂😂😂.. definitely had this conversation before... 🤣.. my poor teenage heart ❤️😂
You guys are brilliant! Keep up the good work and I hope to see you live soon.
"Mrs. O'Tool's daughter"  "Mum, she's my cousin."  "Is she?  Look we're a small island nation"
I've missed them. Love this!
“We’re a small island nation” killing me with laughter and then ‘there are plenty of trout in the Shannon” ♥️
I have a mate at work called Oisin. If he ever breaks up with his Mrs I'm showing him this. 🤣 Is Oisin a pretty common name in Ireland? I've never been and until this video only encountered the name twice.
Never dumped, so not sure this is true. But never got a relationship :(
“We’re foil arms and hog” yet neither if the two angles of scenes shot in this one. Was that Arms’ stroppy face at 3:03? Did yanno that in aussieland legally you can marry your first place cousin, but not your stepsister or brother, who ARENT your blood, go figure!
TRENDING!!!
But Breda Moynihan have Oisín €50, she sounds great?
You know, you guys would kill here in Canada. You should take a trip across the Atlantic!
1:07 Busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy👐
This is exactly how I act as a mother of a teen son.
he does look a bit like a young prince william
Another classic lads
I love her fashion sense!
Lol “we’re a small island nation” to rationalize incest 😂😂
I was expecting Barry to make a surprise appearance. Hilarious as always, though!
😂 😂 🤣🤣🤣 It's an exam year
I like how right at the end of the sketch, Oisin (oishin, oishean) 's mother goes from woman to man when he smiles
I would love to see the bloopers on this one 🤣🤣
Ann's voice gets very deep and manly when she's angry, doesn't it!!
I related very heavily to the being careful take. Hopefully the rest of the video doesn’t happen to me
♥
I was super excited for this one. I’ve been binging your videos again this whole past week. Though Mary isn’t wrong about the “few years time, girls will be queueing up” comment. Any given video there’s dozens of comments gushing over all three of you! I figured I’d ask, do those comments ever make any of you uncomfortable? I know I’m guilty of making them myself (you’re talented, good-looking dudes, what else am I supposed to do? have some self-respect?) but I also understand that it’s probably more than a little weird to have fans like that.
Mom is not a character. It’s a universal law. They are the same everywhere. Love from India. 🇮🇳
Ahahahhahahaha😂 Loves and greetings from Ankara
If Anne didn't know about the girlfriend, what else doesn't she know about? 🤔
"Twice divorced, a son that won't talk to her..." I thought the reply was going to be "Stop talking about Barry's mum like that!"
On the risk of coming across as creepy (even though it's really not intended that way): Arm's hair is indeed amazing in this video and deserves any compliment it can get :) Though the wig has a very special place in our hearts~
Hi guys, we are still laughing on your Channel ! LOL ! Salut les gars, on est toujours mort de rire sur votre chaîne ! MDR ! 🤣 😜
It's her loss!
So so true
2:03 I really wish mom had looked directly to camera
A mother like this is a treasure.
Poor Arms ❤
'There are plenty more trout in the Shannon' 🤣🤣🤣
Love the Garden Centre, yep I was taken to the Garden centre when I had a break up.  Fish in the sea comment, Yep, can so relate to this.
Didn't Anne only visit breda
I could swear they broke character at the shopping for plants bit and that just makes it so much better😂
Happy April Fools’ Day
Broke up with my bf in January and I miss him a lot so this is weird to see 😂 a trip to the garden centre sounds like a lovely idea though ❤️
Absolutely brilliant one lads
"But she is my cousin" Habsburgs : "Thats the point Sergeant"
*based on real events*
Poor Oisin.
Well, we can't really go on holidays now, can we? 😆
I have got to see her actually giving him "the talk"
These skits are my favorite, Osheen and his mom
3rd cousin tbf
i see the barry lore's being fleshed out in the comments
This is class.
What a treat to have a new episode of Mrs Flannagan’s lesson😍
This is too real! Mum's always know... 🤣
Ok, where is Barry? He needs to be in these sketches!!
I just stopped the video because mom wanted to talk, but when I looked back down, O was greeted but this lovely picture. 3:22
One of the best...great talent lads xxxxx
I always forget they're not really the characters they're playing until they break character. That was amazing
Missed Arms, thankfully got a glimpse in the postscriptum ^_^ 🖖
The outro is beautifully chaotic. I love it
Anne: "...you need to be... careful." Me: "OMG Oisin, run! RUN!" He must have been in a truly terrible state that he didn't see that train barreling towards him.
wholesome content <3
I love Oisin; I feel for him; I cry for him.
Third cousin🤣
If it weren't for u awesome lads I'd never know when its Thursday 😂👏
Please make these characters what you base your sitcom on, including Barry - please, pretty please, pretty, pretty please
there are plenty more trout in the shannon 😭😅
We're a small island nation 😂😂
I never got the talk, dad just gave me a book and didn't say anything
Me mum took me down to the garden centre to cheer me up after getting dumped.   I’m still single, lo these many years later.  I’ve got thousands of plants though.
.....far faaaar to close to what my mam would say
mammy would tell you get get the head stuck into to books to distract yourself
“You never told me you had a girlfriend” “YEAH WELL I DON’T NOW, DO I?!?!” “Ah well that’s probably for the best since it’s an exam year”
When she said "knocking down my door" I expected Barry to appear 😆
Its at this point that Barry needs to come in and comment that he just saw Ochin's old girlfriend  dating one of their classmates😳😭
Barry has gone gray in some spots and Osin needs a shave.
Irishmums don't carry chanclas? The "you never told me you had a girlfriend" would have gone very differently
This is probably my favourite sketch from the last year. This had me in stitches.
Aww, Anne was so sweet ❤️ Brilliant sketch as always, lads! Also: glad to see Arms is indeed fine!
These videos are so relatable. My mom is a huge punk rock fan and we're German. You'd think she and Anne couldn't be more different but 95% of the dialogue in these sketches feel like reenactments of conversations I've had with my mom. And yes, Arms, your hair is beautiful.
The "Parents" episodes are my favourite
Barry could HV come in & said Guess who he has a date with tonight !  I was expecting it ! lol
How did they get a camera into my living room????
Looks like we are never going on holiday again anyway 🤷
Pulling out the middle names! ROBERT! Omg I cracked.
Plenty more trout in the Shannon 😂😂😂  A true Irish woman
The first 20 seconds of this triggered me so much. Flashbacks to when my mum would say all of those phrases to me
Plenty of fish in the sea .  But clearly there is also plenty of plastic in it nowadays too
Thanks for your videos guys
New camera?
She said all the things my mum said to me when I couldn't find a boyfriend or got rejected 😂😂😂.   I think the words: "Well, his/ her loss!" are the first thing all good mothers do say to their children. 😂  Poor Oisin. But to tell him that he did not love her, was a bit rude.  Also: I beg your pardon but Oisin looks waaaaaay more handsome than Prince William ever did. 😁🤗
If I had told my mum that I was in a relationship, the conversation would have been stuck right there forever, where I would hear multiple dramatic versions of "You are in a relationship ?"
ahahhahahha
Notice how he dodged the question until she went in with the full name.
Suddenly intrigued with mom’s beads!   “Get a plant to help you” 😂
Oh, her reaction was actually very nice! I'm sure if I ever got dumped _my_ mom would be the first to blame me...
Of course, a good cuppa. Fixes everything--almost.
XD  every time!
At least she tried her best
Plenty of more trout in the Shannon 😂😂😂
Trout in the Shannon 😂
This is everything my dad tells me after I get dumped. I feel lied to.
As a mother and as a former teen, I approve everything about this message.
"third cousin! We're a small island nation" lmao 🤣 too good! 😂😂😂
His facial expressions are perfect I really do believe he’s a teenager lol Awesome video again guys ♥️👍
Ahhh it must be Thursday.
Oisín and the eternal exam year 😱
I love you...... LOVE LOVE LOVE
I got *DOOMED*  Love y'all guys. Wishing to see you in person one day.
How many broken hearts has Anne had to heal with the purchase of plants...
When Hog loses it at the end 😂😂😂
One, I love how Anne went full on supportive Mama Bear. That was lovely. Two, that ending may be the best way to take your child's mind off their heart ache, at least for a bit.
"You look like a young Prince William"-lady, your son didn't do anything to deserve that!!
#snArkms #sArmscasm #Armsnark ... take your pic, I could watch outros like this on a loop all day every day 🤣🥰🤩🤗😈  please keep Arms out of frame and in the director's seat more often 😜
That moment when his mum is trying not to be mad about not knowing he had a GF in the first place
"Trout in the shannon!" lol!
Great to see yis back lads! Keep it up
This was such a sweet episode!! ☺️😂💚
Oisin Robert Flanagan
Haha, always used to get the Prince William line from my mother! Thankfully, 20 years later I have kept all of my hair!!
The trout in the shannon one got me, never in my life have I heard an Irish variant of it
I went on holiday and forgot today was Thursday, but I was smart and hit the notification bell a long time ago 😁
Hello my favorite Comedy Trio!  Arms, the “poor Barry wasn’t part of the original character creation” bit has got to go!  Anne and Oisin are superb and your Barry is the perfect complement to those characters.  I humbly suggest to your Comedy writers (I know it is you guys) a Crossover of Newsreader Tiernan O’Callaghan interviewing Anne Flanagan for her civic achievements or her begonias for that matter or interviewing Oisin, the courageous lad who just saved Evil Granny’s cat from the tree in the Home’s garden.  Well, that is better left to the judgement of the Writers, but the Crossover of your most resonating characters would just blow your fans’ minds and catapult you to stardom!  Make it a Musical, and oh my heart just could not take it.....uh, uh....just an idea I thought to share.  Cheers, lads!  🥸
I'm a simple girl: I see Anne and Oisín on the thumbnail, I immediately drop everything else and click!
Comedy brilliant acting needs improvement
Well done Lads! It’s ok Arms, you have loads of great characters!
Is Anne twice divorced? Lol
I don’t know which was better, the sketch or the conversation after. Gah, both were brilliant this week. 😂
Wow, this comes at the right time! I kinda have friend-relationship problems right now and I can relate :D Thanks guys!
That awkward moment when Oisin’s misery gives me in hysterical laughter and brightens up my Thursday morning tenfold. 😂
We’re a small island nation😂😂
I thought it was Barry who dumped him at first 😂
Finally Oisin Gets a Girlfriend
Have I told you lately that I love you? Have I told you there’s no one else above you. You fill my heart with gladness, take away my sadness. Ease my troubles, that’s what you do.🤓🥰 I’ve started song writing recently. To quote Oscar Wilde...”Sometimes I think I’m a genius... other times I KNOW it.” Thanks lads.
"Oisin Robert Flanagan" That's the moment when you know that you are f*cked. She said it, guys. She said his middle name! XD
1:20 "well that always cheers me up" 😂 i feel sorry for the mom
'Shes my cousin'
When she said “they will be knocking down my door” I was expecting Barry to show up
Hog’s face at 0:42 is priceless 😂😂😂
This is hilarious. The Prince William line killed me because my mother tells me I look like Princess Diana when I’m feeling insecure. I look nothing like Diana 😂😂
"look at me, I'm in loads of sketches" that made me laugh
Oisin my pet. You icecream and your xbox. They won't let you down 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Plenty more trout in the Shannon"? That's hilarious!
Im glad that Arms went on holidays if that lead to creation of Oisín and his lovely dear mother, Anne.
My girlfriend and I split up in 2009 and I still haven't found anyone since - so much for 'plenty more fish in the sea'! (Mind you, it didn't exactly help that every time I thought that a girl might be the one it turned out that she already had a boyfriend!)
I'm having nightmares about Barry being Oisin's dad 😱
Arms your hair just gets sexier! NOT THE WIG....
Yay Anne and Oisin! Made my day! My week!
This cracked me up! Thank you for making my day! You both were super convincing😂
Did mom do oisín’s home hair cut?
Random but I really appreciate the fadas in the subtitles 😂😁
Parents in the title ...jut the Mammie featured (!!)  ...guys!!!!!!
Plenty of salmon in the Boyne
I love your mom videos...plz plz add more of them.... I  shw thm to my mom to tell her how I feel whn she ds same thngs
Happy Thursday! Could have written this about my mum 😂 except to add her phrase of 'do you think he's crying over you, why should you cry over him?!' (meant as tough love)
These parent vids are the best !
Anne is surprisingly chill with this
Mrs. O’Toole’s daughter sounds tempting. 😂 Some from West Virginal would agree
I'm curious...what do you mean by .."Never go on holidays...NEVER "?....
"You should come down to the garden centre with me and I'll get you to pick out a plant for yourself" genuinely perked me up, and I've not even been dumped. I think Anne and I are of similar minds 😂
Is it just me or there are more people who start to enjoy the post-video talk even more then videos? :P
Perfectly summed up haha
Oh to have had this when my gf broke up with me  But then, Im a girl and I aint telling my parents about that thing any time soon. *john mulaney voice* but I figured I would tell all of you
Nice job :) I could feel my mum through this XD
I wonder if the Flanagans live next door to the Squatters. Guess we'll never know
Nice
I'm writing a dissertation about comforting people and I guess I could just show the board this video and leave them with it :-D Great job!
I don't know how you make these ideas and you still make them so good
Looking forward to Anne giving Oisin The Talk (a video that def should be in the making). ;)
Plenty more trout in the shannon... I can actually see my Mum saying that.
I'm in my late twenties, had a breakup over a year ago and my mother STILL says all the same things, almost word for word.
The way Arms put off the wig... did Hog scold at him ?
Couldn’t stop laughing throughout!! Great sketch guys! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The 6 people who disliked it must have done so by mistake.
Oisin got dumped and then got THE talk right after, poor lad. Brilliant video guys!
I wish my mammy was as clued in as Anne.
Havent laughed so hard in a bit! Brilliant, lads! Happy April Fool's!  (I did lmao, tho!) Cheers! 😺❤
At least going to the garden center is a better suggestion than going over the verb être again to distract him😂 Amazing video as always! Thanks a lot for doing this.
Plenty more trout in the Shannon 😅
2160p??!! Oh my. Alas i'm watching this from my phone lol.
O'isin Robert Flanagan!!!!! O'isin has a second name!!!!
Can't get dumped if you never had a girlfriend in the first place 😎😎😎
There's a lot going on here, but we now know that Oisin's middle name is Robert. Never would have guessed it!
Brilliant short
The two most relatable characters in Youtube history! Love you guys!
I’m surprised Mrs Flanagan knows what ‘being careful’ means! I assumed she’d be a ‘no sex before marriage’ Irish Mammy! 😝 Brilliant sketch!
The nerve of that boy! Getting girlfriends in the middle of a pandemic! I’ll tell ya he’ll be doing well not to get grounded for the summer!
Mum's or older siblings are a nightmare they all repeat recent history and never learn 🙄 from it
Brilliant sketch!!!! Love the long lockdown hair :-)
Where was Barry
Brilliant! Well done lads! "Third cousin" loved it!
No Barry this week??!!
he nails the mom character 🔥
There's plenty more trout in the shannon
That’s what he gets for not waiting until after the exams and till he’s 21, 36, 52. When will we see the conversation with Barry where Oisin told him about it before anyone else
This is pretty mild. My mam tried to comfort me by saying "ah now what are you crying about he never even loved you in the first place"
"We are a small island nation"... Ehm, if you think you have a problem, try coming over here to Iceland 😅
"Mrs O'Toole's daughter always had a soft spot for you." <= I obviously loved this line! 😄
Clever way of adding (and subtracting) a girlfriend during a pandemic! I was both laughing and sad for Oisin😥 At least there's the cousin so he's not without options...
Man, Oisín has to be one of the most important characters in FA&H. Also another fantastic video, as always
This is so true haha
Video idea: Counties of Ireland have a party
Shade! XD
a phrase starting 'when I was your age...' is missing imo
God I cringe at how relatable this is when I was 17
Third cousin
Absolutely bloody love this woman!!! 🥇
OMG love the mother & son skits! Heaps of love from Texas.
I remember when my mum wanted to give me The Talk when I started HS... but was legit pissed because she forgot I've already done that with dad years prior when I was double-checking facts with him as a rapidly maturing, knowledge hungry kid
Arms reminds me of Chandler Bing!
So was that Hogg corpsing at the end or does Anne just have a really wicked sense of humour?
"Oisín Robert Flanagan!!" No not the full name!
ooh Oisín!
Is there a way to make a one off contribution to the lads without the patrion craic?
That was some A grade acting.
I mean third cousin is technically alright  The blood is so diluted by then  it wouldn't be incest   I'm not from Alabama
I think the funniest reaction from me mum finding out I got dumped I can remember was "Sure, she was to fat for you anyway, and that thing she never stopped doing with her face. Drove me up the walls. You're better off rid of her"  The girl was actually more on the skinny/lanky side and the thing she did with her face was talk.
2:00 *she’s my COUSIN* I love these guys so much, they’re too hilarious😂
I love these sketches, but I love seeing Arms too: the trouble is real !
Really missed the chance to have a banger of a line like: "Plenty more Salmon in the Shannon"
At least Anne tried! When the first guy I dated left me, all my parents did was give me a small bar of chocolate and fell asleep while we watched a film together.
This is why I always avoided telling my parents about my relationships!
Loved this! Definitely brought a smile to my face 😂
no berry? :(
doese the parents in every country give the same consolation after a breakup?😂😂🤣🤣
🌻🌻😉
"Its an exam year", that sounds familiar!
“Never go on holydays” pretty easy right now we simply can’t :(
We are a small island nation 😂
Oisin dated someone? Oh my i didn't see that coming
We ran out of time on the shoot, but here is the scene we wanted to do with Barry...  BARRY: Hey ANNE: Barry, come on in, Oisinn's just had a bit of heartache OISINN: I'm fine! ANNE: Now I hope Barry, you aren’t having this trouble with women BARRY: No, single ANNE: Good man Barry BARRY: Looking to mingle *Winks at Anne ANNE: Barry get OUT OF THIS HOUSE
Who is she who dumped Oisin? ))
Oisin and his Mum will always be my favourite characters of FAH. They always make my day ❤️
"well, you probably weren't in love with her, pet" "i was!" "Ok"  If this isn't me, a cynical forever old maid, trying to console my friends after their breakups then I don't know what is... This hits too close to home, guys.
Oisin's mum is my favorite character ever
So when do we get the one when Oisin's mum figures out he's got a boyfriend now
We're a small island nation!
"There are plenty more trout in the Shannon." Best line! xD I'm going to steal that to cheer up friends, who've been dumped. Thanks! ;-P
I wish there was a skit where he brought the girlfriend home to meet his mom.
Did you guys have an argument after that sketch??
The shade thrown at Arms for going on holidays and leaving the equipment in his house will never cease :D
Oisin: not a hand full but a land full. A Dutch expression to cheer you up. land means country And I totally agree with Anne, it’s her miss. You’re a handsome young men. Better matches will come up. Now here is a blanket and some hot tea with a lot of sugar. Sugar is for the shock.
I wish I could see the reactions of your actual mums when they see these Anne/Oisin videos. That would be hilariously interesting.
it's hard to relate with this when there are no tears, overreaction, super dramatic words from mum along with always coming back to blaming the gadgets for every misery in my life! *sigh*
Down at the Garden Centre surrounded by Roses, Daisys, Heathers,.Irisis, Lilys, Poppys, Violets, Hollys, Ivys, Jasmines, Rosemarys, Ericas etc. ... that'll totally take his mind off girls 😁
The mum looks so much like young Michael Palin
Noo I'm an hour late :(
Epic as always.... should bring in Granny's opinion to the mix as well
I saw the notification that it was on you tube and I ran to get my mom and we watched I love theese their great
Prince William?🤔 I would say Oisin looks more like a younger Ryan Gosling. The girl who dumped him is an absolute idiot. Brilliant sketch as always lads! You've made Thursday my favourite day of the week :)
Surprised Anne didn't rag him for bad dating habits. "Dat's what happens when ye take her to McDonald's, Christ."
Great
She's right about being busy so you distract yourself, Oisin.
The video quality looks so crisp now 👌🏻 New camera, or is it just me?
As a mother to two teenagers and having once upon a time  been a teenager myself, I can relate 🤣🤣.
This is grand lads really grand
Reason why the dad doesn’t shows, it’s because the sad truth is the dad is out of the picture...probably that beautiful college girl prob Mrs. Flannagan...make the Oisin robert flannagan cannon!!!
Sooo I forgot how Youtube comments work...  my comments probably won't make sense hehe! What DOES make sense is joining their Patreon! Everything is pure gold!! Go on, give it a go! You won't regret it :)
Omg this just reminds me of my nan who has never forgot the fact i had a crush on my cousin twice removed when i was 6 ahahahah
And I thought there was to be no girlfriends until after the exams...until he's 21...36...52! 😉 Brilliant and completely accurate lads. Loved the bit about the trout, especially as Oisin hates fish!
The joy you bring me is out of this world. I look forward to Thursday morning. I am a mother of a son, that says it all. Bless you all, even Barry. xx
Oh no, she's giving him "the talk"... Could you imagine that after being being dumped.  That's cold. 😂
Ahahaha a young Prince William 😂😭 so good
That pick up a plant line is from Arms mum after his driving test isn't it?
my male relatives offered to beat him for me if it would've cheered me up(1 time event). But more scary is if the female relatives decide to avenge as they would be relentless(nonstop destruction til total ruin!).
😂
Since he won't listen to Anne, I hope school will teach Oisín why he needs. To be. Crrfwwwlll.
HOW DID WE MISS OISÍN HAVING A GIRLFRIEND?
Where is Barry when his friend gets dumped and needs him? 😄 Another brilliant vid from FAH!
Also, judging from her many plants in and around the house, Anne probably must've had many heartbreaks she needed cheering up from.  I'd love to hear some anecdotes from her love life some time 😊
My Dad told me ' beware the flattering tongue'. I had no clue what he was talking about!
Been there and it's 100% accurate
Where did they find this necklace??
Anne Flanagan’s guide to risk management: For God’s Sake Be Careful!
The only way to get over from sadness is distraction ; so I'm watching Foil Arms & Hog marathon,  I'm Busy Busy Busy Busy Busy Busy Busy Busy.
ENGAGEMENT

HERE
JUST
I'M
Honestly, to be able to easily talk to your mom about _feelings_ when you're a teenager, that's a miracle for me. Oisín's mom is even more incredible person than I ever thought.
it is eight o'clock in the morning oisín, what are you doing releasing youtube videos
Maybe it's just me, but looking like a young Prince William doesn't necessarily bode well for one's looks in the future... 😬
Great sketch, love it. The quarantine romance has replaced the holiday romance, it was never going to last. We still never got to see the girlfriend either, clever!
Are her glasses on a string or not?
A So these sketch's are also a punishment for arms going on holiday
I was hoping for a slight reveal of a personal heartbreak the moment Mrs. Flanagan started to talk about the beautiful, beautiful girl 😉
Ah yes, once again, Anne proves to be the perfect mother: perfectly unhelpful and out of touch. <3
Poor Oisin
"Barrys is with a 45 year old woman who looks like anne"  "Barrys girlfriend is 15 years older than him and buys him lots of penguins"  From this, we can only conclude one thing:  Barry is 30 years old.
Yes More hidden camera eps
Love him running off shouting "no, no, no!" at the prospect of hearing *that* talk from her!! Another great one! And lesson learned I bet about going on holiday hahaha!
2:58 Tut, tut, tut, Arms? And that Foil at 3:08! It stuck, didn't it?
You missed the “Well, I still love you” 😬  Thanks Dad, but not quite the same
We’re a small island nation... made me do a spit take!!!
I think this is the 1st time I can't relate to a FAH sketch! Oh don't get me wrong I'm not bragging, I've just never had a boyfriend. I'm a lonely old woman 😭💔 See this is why I feel so unloved!!
"plenty more trout in the shannon" 😂😅
Oh he got full named!
Perfection throughout! I'd love to know if there were bloopers to this. I would have thought the "exam year" line would have the actors in splits. 😂
as a person who has been single his whole life, i can't relate to this...*sob*...
MY FAVORITES! ...Should I be worried I basically own Anne's necklace?   Also "She's my cousin."  "Third cousin" killed me.
No fear lads, when you’re allowed to, go on holidays! 😃  It’s a win win: you might lead to create characters like Mrs Flanagan & Oisín (plus Barry 😉) while enjoying being somewhere else.  Don’t wait for pandemics to keep you home, life’s short! (Feeling a bit like Anne now 🤭)
Miss these Oisin and mom. Now do the dump talk between Oisin and his dad 😆
It kinda lacks the blatant misogyny some Irish moms have 👀
Aw bless Anne, trying so hard to say the right thing.  Anne and Oisìn are always my favourites, brilliant as ever lads ❤
Wahey
Sometimes I just forget Hog is a man. For real he is that good
Oisin robert Flanagan. I've seen it all now
gosh its sooo hard because you have so many videos but im still trying to go through the channel and like them all :)
"there are plenty more trout in the Shannon" is a wonderfull saying xD
She couldn't hold her laugh at the end xD
Never go on holidays. - Foil 2021 😂
Don't worry Oisin I would have date you  👉👈 such a cutie... That was an amazing video again! I really love those two characters!! They make me laugh so much every time! It's so great to have your video to watch every Thursday! You are the best of YouTube!!! 🤟
You didn't include the usual "We have a new video every Thursday" in the outro because some people don't like April's Fools, right? - Also wonderful sketch, I'm heartbroken about Oisín being heartbroken now.
Arms ever the supportive friend 👍
So Arms is alive 😂   "There are plenty more trout in the Shannon" - love this 😂
Did y’all catch that?:  all those girls will be knocking down HER door to get to Oisin!  She envisions him living there still - for how long? 😳😁😫
My mum used some of these exact lines with me, i know she was trying to cheer me up but it just didnt work 🤣🤣
Oisin Robert Flanagan.. lets see how long that second name sticks until it changes for *artistic purposes*
oh god.. not The Talk
The best endings to sketches are when you dissolve into giggles! Love how sweet Anne really is!
Didn't expect Oisín to have girl trouble! Barry on the other hand... 😅
Painful flashback to "You'll find someone better" but from my ex, not my mom.
Trout in the shanon briljant 😂😂😂
you need to be krful
Busy Busy Busy..come down to The Garden Centre with me! 😂😂
Aww Anne, she's only trying to help ☺️😔 Anne: Mrs O'Tooles daughter She's my cousin Anne: Third Cousin *Disgusted face* Always brighten my day, you lot do ❤️
Busted! I actually suggested that a pissed off family member buy a plant. Jesus 😂
There are plenty more trout in the Shannon, haha, brilliant
I’m surprised Barry didn’t make an appearance. He would’ve been loads of help!  😜 oh, according to the comments, she dumped him for Barry. But seriously, that is simply not possible. The only one who’s game is worse than Oisin’s is Barry’s!
Anne, can you please take me to the garden centre?! I would love to pick out a plant <3 <3 <3
Poor Oisin
Ma Hog is never wrong! Hahaha, good show
I love that the solution to any problem for an Irish mammy is to do more jobs around the house 😂😂
As usual, Ann is right. Listen to your mother, Osin.  Ps. Foil Arms, Hog - I don’t know who I love the most!  Just amazing.
I honestly can’t tell if Oishin is 13 or 18 or 20 something at this point and I don’t care.
The SHADE on Bríde Moynihan hahaha but I do recall she gave dear Oisín some sweet moolah when they last visited her, so she can't be doing too terribly :)
Awww Oisin! I have so many emotions! 😂 I live for sassy Arms 😆
Arms has such pretty hair
For the love of.. Can we PLEASE get to see all three of you lads at the same time?! It doesn't feel quite right until you're all there together 🥺
I might have a crush on Arms.
This was genius😂
i thought oisin was secretly seeing barry
Every teen’s worst nightmare...’’the talk’’ and their mother tryin to get them to go plant shopping. Haha. This made my morning (stayed up till 3am again just to watch)
what about arpil fool
You are brilliant!!!!! 😂😂
perfection...
This sketch can be perfectly crossed with the Break ups: Worst Advice Ever sketch and then we can discuss whose advice are worse.
honestly, going to the garden centre and getting to pick out a plant would be exactly the right thing to cheer me up.. but then again i'm really boring
It's funny a friend of mine, who happens to be a girl, recently moved in with me after my mum (and everyone else) repeatedly said that she is my girlfriend. That did not help to stop the mockery.
Arms, when you're editing, maybe change the place of the animation of the notification bell etc. It's now hidden exactly behind the subtitles
well, who wouldn't looove to be cheered up by Ann :D
"We're a small island." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
it's thursday again.. balance is restored
Last we saw Breeda Moynihan she was played by Arms, maybe not a nice thing to say that she looks dreadful?
Hahaha the look of terror on Mrs Flanagan's face after the exam year phrase when Oisín turns around to her 😂 This is such a wonderful sketch - and perfectly portrayed!  (Also that teacup is beautiful, Anne has fantastic taste)
"There are plenty more trout in The Shannon" 🤣🤣🤣 had me laughing
Hilarious as always! 😁  Also, I finished watching all of your videos..yaay!!! Keep up the good work, lads.
Never thought id be this early
This was hilarious!! I was half expecting Anne to turn it back on Oisin ("if you wore deodorant, pet, this wouldn't happen") but she was 100% maternal love. BEAUTIFUL.
My God this is so accurate in an Irish way! :)
It’s good to see your face Arms!
Now imagine Anne as a doctor. In an operation theater  “OISIN. Did you wash your hands?” “Oh quit whining it’s just a bullet” “I haven’t sat down all day”
Anne grinding out "You need to be careful" and Oisín's horrified realisation of what she was on about 😂😂🤣 Perfect!
Please come to Stockholm for a show 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Haha, the Prince William comparison! xD The way he turned out Oisin should be quick to get a girlfriend before his late twenties... Sorry! Buuuut.... judging by his mum's hair he probably has better genes. ;) What does Mr 'I studied genetics' say to that?
Can't tell how accurate this is, but I can tell how entertaining it is. And the answer is, it's very entertaining.
Wheeee! My favourite couple. Cheer up, Oisin, you're gonna be a heart killer in a few years. But be careful! CAREFUL. 👌 Thank you! Hugs! P. S. Arms, don't listen to Foil. If you need a holiday, you get a holiday. They won't be able to replace you
My first ex is on her second child with no father in sight. My Mum, in a rare moment of clarity, went "That never would have happened if she'd stuck by you!"
Christ, this is so relateable on so many levels. Both as a teenager and a parent. I'm still laughing.
"I did love her!" "Oookkaayyy..."  I think my mum might've had a similar conversation with my little brother a few months back! 😂🙁
This is why Mrs. Flanagan said that they're should be no girlfriend until after the exams, he should've waited until he was 32!
I think FAH expected us to hear plenty more fish in the sea and changed it to Plenty more trout in the Shannon. See that DnD? THAT'S how you subvert expectations.
Another banger
Be careful now 🤣 Can’t wait to see Anne have ‘the talk’ with Oisin. Better to be safe than sorry. At least he wasn’t ghosted
Lack of contact from Oisín and moping  around with a face like, as my mum would say, “slapped like a slapped arse” I definitely feel sorry for him!
I'm definately triggered by a few of these 😂 poor Oisin. I really feel for men with how akward and uncomfortable THAT talk would be. I cringe thinking about it. Excellent sketch guys.
For me with my parents it would more be like: "You have a boyfriend? GET BANISHED INTO THE SHADOW REALM!"
Not one line there that isn't accurate 😂
Aww when he said at the beginning that he'd been dumped I wanted to give him a hug!  I loved Anne trying to give him 'The Talk'. I can't really remember when my mum did this to me but I do remember a very awkward and quick conversation about body changes in the car park of a supermarket!  Thanks for making Thursdays one of the best days of the week!
Oh no, 'the talk', no wonder Oisin finally had enough and left, good on Anne for being so supportive though. Great stuff again guys.
That's brilliant!  "We need to talk about being ------- careful."   So excited to see you guys next year!
It's gonna be okay Oisin, you were meant to be with Barry ❤❤ Also the fact that Anne makes him a cup of tea 😭 always makes things better!! Great sketch guys well done ❤
Poor Oisín...🥺
brilliant as usual lads!
How do they keep their faces so straight during the doomdah, it's scary
Being middle named, you know it's about to get serious!  Nothing more Irish than the beating them off with sticks 😂
Anne trying to awkwardly talk about sex to Oisin is the best! 😂
You just want to hug him, poor boy. We've all been there. On a side note when my uncle was called up for national service my gran said the famous "be careful" line. He started teasing her and ask how exactly? Gran became very coy all of a sudden and ultimately settled on "so you won't get run over by a tram". For decades after, when gran said to be careful (i.e. driving home after visiting her) she wld be teased with 'you mean so I won't get run over by a tram'? It wound her up no end.
Ah, you know its a serious conversation when your mam says your full name! 😳
I love Anne ❣3rd cousin hehehe everyone in Ireland must be related alright. Great starting the day with a smile 😉
But Oisín... The plants....
Another fantastic video (loved the outro too) !  Really felt bad for Oisin...hoped Barry could have appeared...but then again, maybe he can’t be relied upon for words of encouragement.
Oisín! You need to learn about the birds and the bees! 🐝🐦
Ann 😍😍😍
Plot twist: Oisín and Barry get together
please give oisín a hug for me a ghost hug cause quarantine
if i told my mum i got dumped she'd be like "now you go study and get the best grades to make him jealous"  ಥ_ಥ
You guys make such a nice mother-son duo. I loved the look on Ann's face when she realised that she didn't know he had a girlfriend. I was hoping to see Barry and say that he was with the said girl now.
Wait so does that mean osin is 52?  Damn he looks young
Awwh poor Oisin, I hope he gets a nice plant. 😂😂 and loved the talk reference, every convo a child avoids   Really cheered me up this week!
Are we all going to ignore that Osisins mug is upside down?🤫😂
Hog is the perfect person to play Anne
Thanks for the good morning laugh
I loooooooove Oisin's mom. Biiiiiig hug to Mrs.  Ann Flanagan
Where was Barry to cheer him up eh? Or at least to just eat em outta house and home whilst Oisin has his lil break up crisis🤣
Oi, Oisin, lad, roll some pints and ya'll be fine!
You can pick out a plant! 🤣🤣🤣
Girlfriend?! Dreams crushed... 🤣
😂😂😂
Anne’s facial expressions do make me laugh!  This proper transported me back to when I was 17 and my parents tried to cheer me up after a break up, ended up just taking me to the pub!
Oh, I feel so bad for Oisín. Who in their right mind would dump him?!
The prince William bit killed me! Whats the word for a compliment that ends up being an absolute burn?
Never go on holiday Arms!
I was expecting the mum to be more shocked about Oisín dating.. She took it pretty well!
That third cousin line was so unexpected 😂
Moral of the video: is it something about relationships? No. "Never go on holidays. NEVER" 😆
When foil says nothing it's the most irish I think I've ever heard him
"We're a small island nation"
Yesss Anne and Oisin ftw! Have a happy Easter lads!
3rd cousin... We're a small island nation. 😂😂
PLEASE don’t tell me she dumped him for Barry. I couldn’t handle it
Yes, i love these skits and i just like how osin looks when hes dumped he looks   exactly the same as me whwn i dont have food
Frohe Ostern Arms!  Hast du auch ein langes Wochenende, so wie ich? 🤩
Oh my gosh. This is so perfect.
Haha jesus. When Anne got angry at the end there, that triggered something
The never go on holiday and you will be more included - a sad life story
A young Prince William. Jesus yes I so see it now Foil 😂
"You need to be cAoUreFuL"
"Never go on holidays" well, covid's helping a great deal with that...
Woke up to the notification of this video and I regret nothing
When you learn oisín's middle name
Pefect way to slide into Easter! Hope you all have a good long weekend, y’hear?
I love Anne's offended face when Oisín snaps at her 😂😂 And the dreaded "you need to be careful" talk
What'cha think the dad would have to say?
"There are plenty more Trout in the Shannon" 👌😂  I'm learning more each day😆
How could anyone dump Foil???
Never gonna happen to me hah! (because I'm ace and my mom probably won't believe me when I tell her that so I'm never going to 🙃 but at least there's no heartbreak involved)
Poor Oisín, she dumped him for Barry...
“Plenty more trout in the Shannon”
Comedy gold! Literally like me mum
Yay, I actually get to watch this as it premiers... and why... because I'm on holiday!
Perfect
Arms is alive!!
Hmm so Arms is alive?
I love how relatable this is , my parents do this all the time 🤣
Can't wait for next week when I have time to watch all of it before school
THAT'S MEEEEE!!!!! How do you know??? I adore Mrs. Flanagan... she is my mentor! 😜
Happy April Fools
Heyyyyyyy! Wasn't oisin supposed to be getting a girlfriend after he graduated from college?
Ah it's one hour earlier than normal!! Thank you for this treat. Not sure if I'm allowed to laugh this much on Maundy Thursday though. Hope you guys have a great day :D
More trout in the Shannon. 😂😂 that's brilliant.
On time yet again! Another great sketch, thank you boys!

Is Anne my mom? That’s scarily accurate 😂😂😂
That's probably for the best considering it's an exam year pet
