Shout out to Cristian Von koenigsegg for giving use the car
Koenigsegg är min och jag kommer att ha flera såna bilar nu snart!
The most advanced hypermarket I ever seen😮😮😮😮😮
Im coming for my gemera ill see you in 5 years
So perfect and so smart, hear about your technologies is like cold air in the desert. Jesus loves you.
The main camera was almost never in focus haha
Engineering marvel. And an Orgasmic exhaust sound finish...true innovation 💡
This is power o koenigsegg
Family car🥺😊
sexy
It is a brand that I really respect as a hypercar brand that has made a lot of progress and has broken through the limits of technology in 20 years.  I hope that you will continue to be a Konixeg that shows that there is no limit to technology as it is now.
Love how the gemera looks
if the car can be lifted (factory suspension airbags) for normal "pot-holed road" driving (~200kmph) in the "higher suspension" setting, it'd be the PERFECT car! As is, it is pretty close to one, for me!  1 car to rule them all! (on-road) 👌 👍
Makes a Tesla look like a model t, sorry Elon 😊
Hearing Christian explain the gemera is smile enduceing,  he is either the world's greatest mechanical magician or this is technology from reverse engineering an alien craft that exceeds any that area 51 could possibly have. Beautiful car, exceptional drivetrain. Love it, all I need now is the money to buy it . The man is a genius
No
another very important thing about this CEO- he really knows his stuff
Still not on the streets 😢 nobody have them 😢
Hope Omid will buy one
He dreams it and makes it a reality, LEGEND 🥶
Bien😊
Bien😊
Fuel tank capacity 100 litre is crazy 💀
My choice gemera is armored body with EMP-Proof. And Wingall OASI 540i with Gemera Engine should be identical Super RV in the world. There is no doubt!
I see an SUV loading next...amazing technology!!
Dream car, the only one I want. hehe some day she will be mine 🍃💚🤍
Absolutely bonkers 😂😂😂
👏👏👏
Imagine driving at 400km and your kids behind you are fighting for the iPad 😂
Does anyone know the song from tho first 01:05 of the video?
Where is gemera R? 😂😁
👍❤️👍🇸🇪
Wooo wooo wooo slow down man we still in 2025 not 2070 yet😂,,, 2300hp for a family car? That's sick,,  makes me wonder how ur head process this like those
Didn't forget to mention the cup holders.....
what this company does is just beyond ANYTHING any other car manufacturer even TALKS about. the talent in this team is just remarkable
😮
Nice
i still cant wrap my head around how everything fits in this car

i love koenigsegg
4 koltuk + 4 çekiş + Aşırı güçlü Elektrikli + aşırı güçlü benzinli motor + 100litre üstü benzin deposu + 4 valiz alabilen bagaj ve 2000 küsür beygir ve 2 ton altı ağırlık... Mucize gibi bir şey. Teknoloji bu!
❤
Konenigsegg have no competition with other car brands.This brand have it's own league.Four seater fastest hybrid hypercar car with enormous range and massive boot space is unreal.This car is from future.The world is not ready for this car.
Bom de mais
Impresionante...
If he wanted to colonize mars I'm confident he could do it, but he's a little too humble
Potência máxima.
❤❤❤
A New type of mega car
Musk gay lord look learn
Now this is a car to have
Lindo.
❤
Still contributing to pollution but lovely car otherwise I would get one
What this company is doing is almost things that shouldnt be possible at least in like 10 years to come. And they are so passionate and genuine about it. Impressive
This is badass or we can say the best.
Maravilhoso
Make an SUV out of it
Im link
If it's possible,I'd like to have it with EMP-Proof and Armored Body!
Fast and furious
Patience Mission
Beleza!
Esplêndido !
RIDE TOGETHER  DIE TOGETHER 😅
How is this even possible.......why isnt everyone lese doing it.
Carrão bonito
Good
Please put a gear lever that offers manual and automatic transmission and put physical buttons as well on the centre console not just one big screen. Just a single big tablet screen  it is boring and tasteless. Please make this possible 🙏
Well done Koenigsegg 🎉
Second dream car
WOW
Google 😄
3:08 buggati launched their new car with that name 💀🤣
Koenigsegg the greatest car company ever made. Thank You.
I never thought it was pronounced "jemera"
This car will never not be insane
The V8 sproty versions it's brutal,i mean both are brutal do not rember how its 0-200kmh but it's Crazy....   My only concern is drivability, aside the super centerline and all the technology, which i dont know the specs,but i assume maintain this car  on the Road Whit such accelerations, torque and all will be hard in both low and high speed...  But yeah any the few that can buy this absolutely beautiful beasts will put it in a garage and let sat there among his/their collection
This is the best car ever f##ing made and it isnt even made yet😂
1 question, how?
2.300 hp family car is crazy💀💀
how can they eat their cake and have it too this is insane what a visionary
If i ever win the powerball.. I'll give you a call.
so a faster family car yaaa i can see to trade my sienna for this family car
Now all the other companies are gonna follow Koenigsegg’s footsteps and begin to release their own 4 seater hypercar in a few years because this is the most revolutionary shit i have seen in years ❤
This man is not aware of what he is achieving… this is sci-fi developed for humans 😅
Koenigsegg had Turbillon before Bugatti made theirs 😉
Koenigsegg inspired Elon and all new electric designs😅
1:08 what's the name of the song? Goes really good with the gemera fr
Sinceramente el mejor auto que he visto hasta el día de hoy. Bugatti está pasado de moda, esto es lo más.
i wish they would make a sister company that made cars for normal people. like better bmw. super tunable, reliable and overbuilt
Imagine bringing your Jesko Absolut in the Philippines
Hey @koenigsegg can i buy the Dark matter and TFG for 2 motorbikes im building?
Unglaublich geiles Ding.
he is  Fanthomas   ( old french movie )  and  put litle  ghost on his  cars ....  amazing  constructor #1
Tud menni forgalomba vagy csak egyhelyben állásra képes? Ahhoz elég drága játékszer. Csak azért mert eddig nem láttam olyan videót ahol tesztelték volna hogy milyen vezetni 😂
IMPRESSED!
I love you too 💝💝💝
And what about the 3 cylinder???
I’ll get one, one of these days; the V8 version. I’m ok with the color too. Green is fine. Actually, Christian, if you’re reading this, I’ll let you pick the color in honor of you and your team. Even better, your team and you can pick the color.
What about the maintenance on these vehicles? Say I purchase this car and want to drive it all the time. How is the maintenance carried out?
Do i wish it was a v12 for the f1 sounds😅
yes please
I'm finishing my schooling this year. I'm lost, I don't know what I want to do in life, I don't know what I'm going to do for a living. But I know I'll be back here when I buy KOENIGSEGG. Good luck to everyone ❤
Such a pleasure to be able to see such a extraordinary person like Mr.Koenigsegg living in a same era.Its pitty nobody can  challenge him, everyone else looks like amateurs next to his visionary destiny of a mega cars master of ONE.
Only hypercar i dream of owning just a regular guy for now !
Me: "Is there anything else you haven't done?" Koenigsegg: "Yes. The World's fastest family car" Me: 🗿🗿🗿
A car I'll never be able to experience but I'm sure glad to see such a feat of engineering exists!! My GoD 🔥
Koeningsegg is like Samsung deep down everybody knows that they're the best.  Bugatti is like Apple, people just buy the "elegant name" now
I wonder how many mountains of data cars as sophisticated as this collect about their owners
Nice having a family arguement at 400 Kmh 😃
I swear, every time Koenigsegg produces a new car, they keep rewriting the rule book of what is possible.
This car is great for a family!
I love the idea of a four seater megacar
Very few people even understand what a Koenigsegg truly is❤
Outside of Germany, where else can you use this kind of performance on public roads?
Volvo
may god help me buy a jesko attack
Respect ❤
Swedish Vikings machine❤️🇸🇪
I am going to need one in my beatiful mansion. Thanks
Too bad not many are going to enjoy it ^^'
why did no other company think of full grown 4 seater with 4 large luggage capacity car .ofc sports
Koenigsegg et le plus grand constructeur de hyper car
Pretty sure this is the biggest "hold my beer" moment in automotive history
This Car Itself is A Whole New Level & A New Segment On It's Own.🤩🥳🥳💖💖 It Has Everything in It A Man Would Ever Want From His Car😍 With Top Notch Quality - Most Powerful Production Car, Has Most Powerful Combustion Engine, Most Powerful Electric Engine, 100+ Litre Fuel Tank, Can Fit 4 Full Grown Ups, With 4 Full Size Suitcases Etcs Etcs. Just Wow Wow Wow😘🤩😍🤩😍
Why can’t they made hot and cold cup holder together like BMW and Mercedes? Looks odd with 4 holders back and front.
My favourite car in the world since the first time I saw it ❤❤❤
On top of everything else he causally drops at the end that’s it’s got a fkn twenty six gallon fuel tank.  That is insane.
Extraordinary! What roads are worthy of this car?
This car is an absolute masterpiece. The greatest production car that's ever been built.
This is Dream ❤
Is name and colour inspired from "Gamora" from Guardian of Galaxy?😅😅😂😂
GEMERA, RIMAC BATERY.
God I love this company.
Love that Koenigsegg are still pushing the boundaries with fresh, original thinking. Meanwhile big players like VAG use same old boring design iterations and trade on legacy brand names and marketing gimmicks.
This company was always on the very top category always since it producing. But THIS IS LEGENDLY MIND-BLOWING CREATURE and it is screaming from every fuckin view that "Born to be the lonely Champion" . Doesn't exist any car or car company who can race with this passion and precious professional level of creating like this company. Gratulation guys!!
the best company that exists
I always think abou it, why hypercar companies didnt make 4 seater hypercar?
The fact that Koenigsegg has made a four door supercar like this is truly amazing!
when an extremely innovative and extremely humble Christian von Koenigsegg says: "It's just mind boggling" about his own new car, you know it's more than mind boggling.
guys this is a family car
This guy is Steve Jobs version in automotive world
Damn!
Well done ❤
With 1700hp, this car has the ability to send the family to heaven in just 1.9second 😅
koenigsegg are fancy cars and not fast, just speculation. I've never seen a gemera accelerating. koenisegsegg accelerated with plaid tesla and lost. This type of car is not worth the cost. Only a fool buys this slow junk.
I have eaten hen's egg,what is that Koenig's egg=Koenigsegg.
from the country of Ferrari,Lamborghini,Maserati,Pagani,Bugatti ect ect: GEMERA is  from another planet! WOW!
Koenigsegg is the goat of car industry. I hope one day I would be able afford any of those hyper beasts 😕
I love the fact that christian himself is doing the dramatic voiceover
oh yeah,  2khp family car
Koenigsegg is like hashirama,  in a class of its own, and gemera will be one of my family car in upcoming future and I pray to almighty that the people with respect,  passion and ambition for growth,  prosperity and vision may have such beauties in their garages.
V8 is always cool but i3 in a hypercar will be special
i see lots of video of a car sitting still, with its doors open, people sitting in it, but when youre claiming its super powerful, its all hot air (no pun intended) until you SHOW it driving, performing. i could claim i have a 2400HP car, but if i dont show you it, its all just talk
I feel like Christian is that uncle you are just looking forward to see at family gatherings. He just got a nice vibe
Koenigsegg is mad
The amazing innovations are just mind blowing. I think they could really change things in a bigger sense, but will we ever see any of this technology move from ultra exclusive and crazy expensive hypercars to something normal humans can afford?  How about a detuned dark matter crate motor for a reasonable price!  I wish.
Koenigsegg is amazing. It’s the best sports car brand ever. I want one right now!
Bye bye! Rimac nevera,Tesla s plaid 😂😂
Koenigsegg had better make an appearance in Gran Turismo 8 if not in the next update of GT7 😮
Why remove the carbon fiber wheels rims ultra light ?
Super car.  Do not forget that the V8 engine has roots in Italy.  Good combination to bring out the absolute car.  Bravo Sweden and bravo Italy.
This man is Musk pro Max
Cyberpunk really hammered the nail on the head in terms of hypercars in the future. I think this is awesome. I think that price is insane, and I don’t have a problem with that because if that’s what it took for this to be produced, than I’m glad no corners were cut
I hope koenigsegg will available in my home 😊
Well. If were ever going to build a real spaceship i reckon Koenigsegg would have something to do with it lol…. Wait SpaceX Nasa and Koenigsegg theres a thought 🤣
One of the coolest cars I’ve seen built. Incredible
Goosebumps just watching this. This guy will go down in history
Helt sjuk Christian von Koenigsegg du imponerar gång på gång på gång. This is the sickest car ever made 🥶🥶🇸🇪
When Bugatti released the Veyron all the way back in 2005 I believed I'd never again feel this feeling of marvel at a car that reconceptualizes what is possible. But here we are.  I know Christian is aware comparisons are being drawn, because Koenigsegg is finally pushing the envelope just the way Bugatti did all the way back then.  The Gemera is a car, but at its core it's an exploration of passion, a dive down into the rabbit hole of inspiration is at its heart. The electrifying feeling of discovering how more and more pieces interlock and harmonize. Thank you to Koenigsegg for providing an outlet for the genius of its engineers.
koenigsegg gemera🔥
What about safety ? Did not mentioned ...
One arrived in Brazil, including shipping, fees and taxes, price US$4 million.
Very innovative company but there styling should be out sourced to a Italian design studio.  All there cars lack something in the style department.
How is this not considered off planet technology?
the design looks like porches
why not just put a dark matter on every wheel ? xD
Still not really attractive...
Christian von Koenigsegg presents the Gemera with a humble, compelling, excitement. There is no pretence, just pure innovation with a vision that leaves the rest of the industry gasping. They seem to be having so much fun. Awesome.
This man is a real inspiration.
Rubbish car , big mouth only , horrible design
New class: Ultra GT
Four, fully grown, small people. Lol
Top auto 1 jej wordt wakker givmie
What the fu*k is going one in this world😂😂
Ehhh. Try fixing the world economy. Then I'll be impressed!
Manifesting that I get to own one of these one day
Oh yes, finally the perfect family car
im aplauding for the passion and succes
They accomplished what Ferrari couldn't
Nice car but not in this color.Wonderful model
Łysol pierdzieli zamiast pokazać jak to jeździ.

brzydki
insane
100l fuel tank , 4 seater , huge trunk space i mean were is all this fitted😳😳
The name may sound like a sexually transmitted disease. But I love it. 4 seaters hypercar? pffftt....awesome.
These beast can surely compete bugatti now.
Man i don't know how he kept his excitement and didn't just leap unto the car during the preview😂😂
If aliens exist, they work at koenigsegg
East or west  koenigsegg is the best😊
Christian Von Koenigsegg WILL go down in history as the greatest car builder and innovator of the 21st century.  He’s always doing something that none of the other car manufacturers are doing or willing to do.  Just the same with Enzo Ferrari in the 20th century.  It’s never about how many cars you sell, it’s what those cars stand for.
Imagine picking up all of your friends and them jumping on the freeway and going 200mph 😂
Basically…. Family hypercar😂
I don’t understand it. It’s seems over engineered and lacking in styling. What happens in 10 years when it needs a minor part like a window regulator and the company no longer exists? 3d printing? 😅
Genius.
Hi also please make a car that doesn’t cost 1billion dollars like make a affordable car it doesn’t need to be a f**king tank of a car just a super car that cost like a Lamborghini avantador in price
If it is to big he makes he’s own like look att the regera he just said what the f**k are gears like this man this guy never fails to impress me he just does something new every time just how like what the hell he is to smart for this earth if he’s bored he just makes a car that goes 600 km/h with a jet engine and somehow makes it street legal
Dear Koenigsegg please sell to the world freevalve upgrade kits for all the world's popular petrol and diesel engines so we can enjoy them for decades to come and tell the combustion engine haters to eat our dust.                          -Sincerely car enthusiasts around the globe
I could never afford a Koenigsegg. But I really really need one of these. I'mma phone you guys up in like 50 years when i'm too old do drive anyway.
game changer ..  I need to be a part of it.
Thats Not a step Up. Its a whole staircase up
Mr. Koennigsegg now make a V12 twin turbo version
hi im the son of sonide so I LOVE KOEINGSEGG I WILL BE INGINER TO CREAT KOEINGSEGG K 2025
I cant wait to hear the performance specs for this thing I've been so hyped for this car, the dark matter motor alone is a massive improvement in the automotive industry I cant wait to see what he's going to do next he is simply put a genius
What a beauty of a car. Nice color
Koenigseg squadron ora an Kickkek. God of neutural surfed meat Lecce get. Бог стройки ставит всем двойки.

Damn, it's about time they increased that boot size. Amazing what free thinking engineering can do.

Bro just changed the whole Supercar world and pretended like he did nothing serious. Bro so chill, he has ice coursing through his veins😎
please i need this car for my brother
I build chassis to get bans or it isn't successful

Best family car
you call it a family car?
An electric motor named 'Dark Matter' is the most rad thing I've ever heard.
Bugatti take notes 📝
Seems more realistic to see it on the road, any road.
It's just alien tech.
Almost hard to believe this is real, hard to wrap my head around, insane! Wow, woah 🙏
2000cc   triple cyrinder?
Been waiting to see this one for a while.
IT WAS supercars , hypercars , that is first GIGACAR
Fast car ever
👌
Its amazing how "easy" he makes it all sound all while your mind is being  🤯
We all can agree this is the fastest family car
2300hp family car 💀💀💀💀
Bla bla bla. I want to see this car on the street. Oh it´s so fast, oh it´s a technical wonder. Fuck you. Show me what this car can offer or shut your mouth. Oh what this Mercedes can do, oh what this Koenigsegg can do, oh what this Audi can do, and at the end, ui the Rimac is fucking us all. Deliver or be quiet.
W vehicle
the ultimate hybrid
Christian is  the 21st century version of Ferdinand Porsche, would be nice if they focus on making affordable cars for the poor fellas like me , and i think they would do a great job .
Gemera crash video in 5 4 3....
Let's go 😤  2,300 combined hp 🤯 The next coupe will probably be insane with this compact tech 🚀  Hot & cold cupholders 👌✨ nice touch  World's largest fuel tank 😱 💯 liters  Netflix in the back 🤣
i came
Money Money Money ..must be funny.. in the rich mans world !!!!!    Build super cheap electric vehicles with high power for the masses  and not only super expensive cars for the richest people ! That should be your main task !
I still can't believe this car exists. Mr. Koenigsegg is the biggest innovator in the car industry. A genius.
how many crash tests do you do?
best hypercar brand
Bonkers
We need Clarkson, Hammond and May back to drive this thing!
oh wow. Congratulations on making the best car ever made.
The fact that this brand is so new compared to other car brands and yet it’s thousands of times more advanced.
Quake3arena Voice: You have taken the lead ☠️
best car in the world...
not a car... state of Art..
Just insane
I'm pretty sure Mr. Koenigsegg built this just to have the highest Doug Score.
Bugguati fan Boys 😶‍🌫️
100L, worlds biggest fuel tank?
Christian and his team at Koenigsegg has created my all-time favourite hypercar! The technology that they come up with it's just unbeatable when it comes to developing hypercars. The Gemera itself just goes to show you how innovative you can get with a gas powered engine, but also for a hybrid it just blows my mind what they have done with this thing and it looks amazing!
Price?
Bravo Christian! You have combined incompatible things, practicality and hypercar. I think you should definitely make an SUV. And not because it's a trend, but because you'll do it the best. And I think this will be your most successful project. Good luck to you Christian. 👍👍👍
😀❤️🙏 Halleluja helt otroligt, en hur jag är en fattig gubbe som drömmer om att få igång min gamla Audi coupe - 89 nu i veckan, 5 cylinder motor som låter som en Panzerwagen Tiger men detta ❤️🙏 Halleluja och bara tänket på krock säkerheten bak som de tänker på Halleluja inte många biltillverkare som jobbar hårt på detta, men åter allt är helt enkelt perfekt finns inget jag kan klaga på, hoppas att se den nu i Västerås på lördag 26/8 -23 😀 ❤️
😀 ❤️ 🙏
Nothing but just respect to this gentle men and the entire team behind this master piece. What a cool piece of engineering. All the numbers and the practicality features just seems unbelievable.
This guy has more inovation that all the other giant manufacturers, combined. The electric cars on the other hand, belong to another genius. E M.
2300 HP left my brain with a lot of wtf
Now you can kill 3 of your friends.
How to get the highest doug score:
When the wife says we need a family car 😂
NoOoOo You NeEd a FaMiLy CaR!!  The family car:
Perfect rally car
My god. What a machine. Truly amazing. Ground breaking technology a new step into uncharted territory in the realm of hypercars. Truly in its own league.
Can anybody please tell this guy that they made a missile that can drive on road😂
2300 HP ok sir
Koenigsegg will go down in history for crafting the unreal and scaling new heights of engineering marvels. This is simply unreal man
Wtf you doing Koenigsegg! This is not what cars should be capable of
What is top speed
Imagine going through the McDonalds drivethrough in this!!!
dream car
If i hit the Powerball, this is the ride. Take my fantasy💰💰💰😂
The Dark Matter alone is more powerful than the standard Tesla Model S! That is insane!
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Finally no one will be able to say a true super car only has 2 seats 😂
bro just destroyed every car brand ever
The back reminds me of a Porsche 718
I hope I live to see the day companies like this one go out of business. An ICE car with that kind of power? Good luck just getting enough fuel for this in a few years to even move it out of the garage - where this waste of materials will be parked most of the time anyway.  Overrated, overpriced trash.
how the hack can I enjoy the gemera? what is he thinking about? almost nobody can enjoy this car, whattta'?
imagine the Mastiermind behind thisncar was just Christian von Koeniggsegg. that Guy is the Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Albert Einstein combined for the Car World.
I can't afford this car but this man is something and has created a unique piece,left every thing in dust.
Cristian's love and passion for cars is very obvious during this video. The way he describes important aspects of this car is a testament to his passion. I love the fact that Koenigsegg team thought of creating a hypercar for family and actually brought the idea to fruition by creating this gorgeous machine that puts other big players to shame.  So many challenges overcame by thinking out of the box only possible if you truly are passionate.  Always has been and always will be a huge fan.
The coolest name you can give to a motor. "Dark Matter"
This is my dream car.
Unlimited talent point build
They need to make an Off roader Hypercar. I just would like to see what the engineers would do.
Outstanding! Koenigsegg, this is your MASTERWORK! Well done, Koenigsegg. Well done.
I'm very curious how they're going to get the cooling for a 1500 hp V8 when the original design was for a 600 hp high-efficiency (less heat rejected) 3-cyl. The 3-cyl would rarely be at high revs due to the direct drive and torque converter situation. Not sure that would have helped with cooling or made it harder. A less efificent 1500 hp V8... a lot to cool in a tight package. Oh and there's an 800hp hybrid side as well. Working hard under braking and initial torque demand, I imagine.
For everyone's benefit, I've opened a group on Telegram to share in fan chat. I am not selling anything, explicitly not pretending to be officially linked.
This thing is off the scale!!!!
This is the kind of car you can make in a video game but….  4 seats, room for luggage, 2000+ horsepower, fuel efficiency capability…….bro wtf how is this real
Koenigseg gemera
Christian what an Amazing Automobile and design it’s in a league of its own your team is Amazing thank you sharing this work of art ..Cheers
This adds a little pressure on some car's out there............... just a little pressure 🙄😏
This is the family hypercar I always wished existed.
Incredible engineering, very impressive and very powerful four seater megacar. Christian is a real genius his creation is miles away from the competition. Woww!!
So it's not electric? Pity.  :-)
Other car makers are avin nightmares over christian
Buggati needs to learn Koenigsegg
The Da Vinci of cars
What if you build a car with one dark matter motor for each wheel?😅😅
I'm going to buy one after I win this 1.5 billion dollar lottery tomorrow night 😂
The ingenuity of this company never fails to impress
Damnnn Koenigsegg never fails to impress 😭
Im not a car guy i just wanna drive something with wheels but cool i guess
I didn't watch the video, but I think you spelled "camera" wrong.
At this point I don't mind what color I am getting 😂
Every minute of this video is UNBELIEVABLE
Best quality and design. Koenigsegg is the perfect car👻
Make 4x4
Tänkte en sak som blev svårt att glömma...hmm...kapa den där till 2 säten! The trackversion...blir väl nästa grej...den vanliga och den maxlättade...drömmar och fantasier.
Price In US???
best idea in the world they had with this concept in 2020 ! Ferrari and Lamborghini need to bring out such nice ideas like that instead of ugly SUVs
Over 2k HP and over 2k NM and over 2 sits? All righty then. This dude and his team are officially insane... Yet the ones who will be able to buy this monstrosity and drive it are not on youtube watching this video and comment on it. Hell, those persons already bought it when it was in blueprints. They already know everything about this car. This is just a showcase for poor people.
This is Just called a dream car of every sports car lover
When Freevalve system will be available in 'normal' cars?
@granturismotv 😉
🤯😱
Finally taking the kids to soccer at mach 2
No! The Koenigsegg Gemera is used to have 3 other friends share a group orgasm ...!!! And yes because Koenigsegg is building the best weight to horse power ratios... Light and smart kinda goes with speed but speed does come at great cost for heavy cars (the not too smart conceptions) the Bugatti Veron at top speed would consume your entire gas tank in 12 minutes ( that kind of stupid !!! Lol) yes ! You can have a top speed higher than a formula 1 car but you would have to refuel every 3 or 4 laps... so yeah you are not finishing any race soon even less being able to lose anyone on the road for anything longer than 12 minutes if you’re constantly looking for fuel every 12 minutes....
Representation was amazing and that car is better than a work of art; it’s functional art.
This is so cool...
I love it
High level of engineering
Looks even better then a bugatti
GEMERA VS NEVERA ON CARWOW NOW!!!
00:15 mega car? I can dig it. Super car, hyper car... no, MEGA CAR MWAH HAHAHA

Nice loving it
Crazy
Lamborghini and Ferrari should be very worried
Can you give me one please? 3-cylinder will be great. 🥺
This is the most impressive feat of engineering in the automobile industry that I have seen in my entire life. Hats off to their engineers.
There’s no competition
Imagine what would happen if Elon and Christian’s engineers got together and they started spitballing ideas
Koenigsegg's engineers: how much power should Gemera have? Christian von Koenigsegg: yes
Too complicated and over-engineered for my taste. I want 4 independent electric motors for TRUE torque vectoring without clutches or gearbox, and a TINY engine as  a generator to charge the batteries.
IMG this is out of the world
Now I’m curious as to how the SUV model will look like … thus is absolutely amazing
I’m waiting patiently for more on the CC850… let Shmee or Mr. JWW drive it please 😬
How on earth does he stay so carm saying them figures him and his team are unreal at building cars this car with have other car company's crying into there pillows for sure
Love to know it’s top speed now…
Christian is real genius. He is the Ettore Bugatti of our times
i wanna watch a ccar
bad*
very very bed
Love the idea! but as small as the components are and high performance as it is, it’s gonna detonate.
I see what you did there, love the name ^^
The engineers HAVE to be aliens...
A family coupe.
They don’t build cars they build futures…
This is alien technology
Jeremy Clarkson once said that he would have to go the rest of his life without owning a Bugatti, and that was a very somber moment. Unfortunately I have the same feeling when it comes to a Koenigsegg...
it was good until they announced the second version💀💀💀
how much? and can i do my own oil changes?
wtf a jesko engine in a gemera... end of debate
Engineer: why the fck would you need 2300hp for a 4 seater!? Koenigsegg: for family Engineer: understandable
Koenigsegg is just a synonym for the best engineered cars in the world
This car sets new standards.
Remember when the Veyron came out and everyone was amazed? This is way over twice the power, still four wheel drive and has four seats yet weighs less.
This is magnificent, i so much love this, it can literally serve a whole family of four 👏
Why are Koenigsegg promo videos always look like they’re filmed and produced by a low budget social media influencer?
This isnt just a mega car, this is a work of art💯
Koenigsegg is The Benchmark!
Coisa de outro mundo
The cup holders sold it for me.
Howdy, can I have a Gemera pwetty pweaz????? I can't afford it right now, and my 07 Jeep needs a new catalytic converter 😂
looks like a strenched 911
All I can say, is what the fu*k!?
I am truly at a loss for words... when this video came out, I didn't know what to say, so I waited... but I still don't know what to say. This is just out of this world mind boggling insane
Every time I think Koenigsegg can't be anymore mind-blowing, they completely redeem themselves. Imagine what he will be coming up with 5 to 10 years from now. LET'S GO!
Gemera a way to meet god with your family !
The car weighs less then it’s horsepower 💀
2300 hp family car 💀
holy crap
Wondarful
2300 bhp family car 💀
This guy has aliens kidnapped or working with them with this tech lol. How is a 4 seater 2300hp ? This is out of this world …
Just give these guys their blooody flowers for doing this 2300 hp in a four seater ? Wtf lolol
Is this a joke? Four seater, twin turbo v8, largest fuel tank, luggage space, 4 wheel drive. Did he also design a hidden space for all this stuff? If this car is real he’s a genius.
My genesis coupe will destroy it 😎
Absolutely insane! Imagine if they had an f1 team…
At some point its gonna get a roof rack. I just know it
G.O.A.T
I own a koenigsegg Jesko Forza Horizon 5 and I hope it will be available in Forza Horizon 5 soon
The question, what if they make it a 2 seater with that power?
Ohh😮 I gonna say gemera new look and powerful horsepower the most epic 4 seater hypercar I every see this is my Ultra dream hypercar of my life I wish on 10 days birthday of my I want gemera I wish I could afford gemera but I'm poor and slow learning  I'm not normal person I have siblings and my mom about my dad long story his not in this world anymore 😢 I working so hardest but I know I'm not alone
Cristian von Koenigsegg is a legend
Forza is the closest I’ll ever come to driving this so fingers crossed🤞 😂
Koenigsegg out is THAT brand 🔥🔥🔥
Imagine 4 dark matter motors in a 4wd mega car
In a league of their own. I know Mate Rimac is also awesome and probably had a hand in some of this electric drive train but they only produce 1 car, Christian has numerous models in his range. Mind blowing.
ok, that's it!! I'm done. at this point, Koenigsegg must admit they're from the future, 50 years ahead.
This guy just destroyed every other super car brand and he says it so calmly
Thank you sir..for this amazing car..it's fantastic 😍.. by the way I like the sound "Dark matter" I love it..
Aaaaandddd this isn't true, just because it can't be.
I'm wondering at what point in his life the aliens gave him futuristic  technology?
If your DC motor is named dark matter then you are upto something....💀💀
History of Koenigsegg casually dropping the best car on the face of the planet: CCX Agera and its special versions Regera Jesko And now Gemera. This thing is truly art on wheels. The engineering behind it is absolutely insane and I look forward to seeing it more now it is released
Nevera ----Gemera   and they are almost looking the same with this colour . What is next  Ferera  with red colour? I see huge influence of China here copy paste 🤣🤣🤣
I always like dark green or similar color , thanks for the release 👍
absolutely revolutionary
Parece un Porsche Caimán de atrás
Need more about electric motor.
Great job 👏 congratulations ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nice torpedo
someone knows the first song where christian is speaking?
With Rimac coming out with their first supercar, I hope in the decades to come these 2 have the best friendly rivalry ever!
They could have made this front engine.
To say I'm mind blown is an understatement.
*vegeta kneel*
thats my favourite car brand right there!!!!
I was going to buy one but that song was so bad I’m going to pass.
Any day now, Christian will be flying out of the Koenigsegg hangar in his very own super hero suit.
This guy has alien tech or did the alien gave this to him ?
i cant understand how you do this. its amazing
How do you get full four wheel torque vectoring with only one electric motor ?
Смотрю в 2023 году июль 22 ты кокраз на смотре ран
Beautiful Car love it second to none
🙏🙏🙏🙏
I could not care less about a four seater
the best car in the world
For the 1400 hp the torque figure is way less than the previous one. Though the horsepower power went from 1700 to 1400 but the torque went somewhere went from ~3400 NM to 1800 NM.
2300 hp, i see entire families being wiped out because dad thought he could do something he clearly couldnt
i want one.
needs new front tbh, same face is boring
What the actual fuck!!!🤯
Super Thanks and we need and wish 8K Photos or videos in Real Best  8K  60fps  or 120fps  HDR10+  resolution clarity quality and Sound in full HD 3D Stereo Surround , Soon Please
3-cylinders version: US$2mi V8 version: US$5mi  🤣🤣🤣
boring dude
un fuckin believable
🤯😲🥹 WOW! Christian, you and your company makes the finest and best vehicles on the road. Thank you for your perseverance and determination in making the most innovative cars ever! What an amazing and beautiful car you and your team have made!
can i roll my windows down in my new privledged koenigsegg gamera?
@Christian: Phenomenal accomplishment(s). I just wish you could focus on making this kind of technologies more accessible to a broader range of customers ;) You are the one person I believe that can do it.
Where will I get the money to buy one... Give me a sec 🤑
Best family car.
Uh, only if I was a billionaire. Maybe one day.
Вот что создается , когда работает команда инженеров , а не маркетологов!!!!
You had me at "This is.." The rest is.. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
These cars are so sterile and boring. Meh
Maybe I need a $1.7 million cupholder
You can make it FWD just because you feel like it. What a crazy company
detta känns cyberpunk, framtiden är nu
Koenigsegg is in a league of its own. Koenigsegg is in a league of its own.
Grandma will for the first time be propelled by 2300 horses on her way to church. It will happen somewhere.
Incredible engineering love it so much.   We need more of you guys, who care about innovation and breaking limits rather than cutting corners for profits
1.5 million can't afford this why we watching. me too
Used to admire both Koenigsegg and Pagani, but the Pagani not really making any progress in terms of technology, power and even outlooks. The 2 models I love most from Pagani are the Zonda Cinque Coupe and Huayra BC. Sorry to all Pagani's lovers/fans. Just my own thoughts. Instead of the Pagani, the new brand that I admire is the electric car makers, nother than the Mate Rimac, the Nevera is an insane car, not only beautiful in looks, the performance and all the technologies (driving modes), torque vectoring created in house) and able to drive on the road  comfortably. The performance is totally insane. Good bye Pagani
Christian Von Koenigsegg is a genius in Supercar technology of the current era. Non stop brand new in house innovation. Triplex Suspension, no fly wheel, one gear drive, 9 gear light speed transmission etc etc and needed to be able to drive on the road of many countries. I was lucky enough even just to see 2 Agera RS out of 25 made in the entire world while riding behind. The exhaust popping sound alone was insane even at slow speed. Looking at the real car vs seeing in video is totally different! In videos, they are already beautiful,seeing in real , words just cannot describe how I feel. Keep it up both Koenigsegg and Rimac keeping the car world with all sorts of new technologies, even I don't have money to buy the real car but simply love them.
The Gemera is going to shake up the hypercar industry for quite a long time, quite the revolutionary car Koenigsegg. SWEDEN ALL THE WAY BABY
So honesty doesn't matter at all anymore.
looks like an aston martin
This guy teaches the world 🌍 who good Super-Cars most be done! 🤠👌
Im just glad this dude is interested in making insane Hyper cars and not Nuclear weapons.
So, it's a flash bank account on wheels.  Where are you going to use that top end speed? lol
Carro top👏👏
90 % of us will never be able to afford this car. Exacly like  corn stars, but we can experience both in a different way
All this for $2 million dollars 😂
I tried to make a comment but was left speechless. Over the top innovation.
If I was super-rich and loved fast cars, Koenigsegg would be on the top of my list. :-)  I was wondering though: Isn't a car that is so exlusive and made in such low numbers inherently less safe? I mean there could be a design flaw going unnoticed till I drive in it.
I remember the beautiful concept. A stunning work of art. Sadly this doesn’t look much like it.
As a lifelong Bugatti fan, I will freely admit. This is mind blowing. Amazing. I bow down to Christian.🙌🤯🫡❤️❤️
Beyond amazing
My new favorite Koenigsegg
This company just doesn't ever miss! The car of my dreams 🤩.  Much Love and Respect 💙 💯
As an enigineering lesson, this is pretty much perfect. What an absolute marvel of brilliance.  Sadly, the generic design really lets it down :( It should have been the poster car of the century, but imho just looks like watered down boredom
As an automobile engineer while seeing all these all electric shit and  when companies like Koenigsegg creates a masterpiece like the Gemera  can just feel the emotions as a car lover, mad respect to Koenigsegg one keeping ICE alive such a beautiful car with a beautiful machine ❤
A lot of people think Mr Konigsegg is Dutch, but no, he’s actually Cuban !
Can't wait till someone totals one and Tavarish gets it for a rebuild 😂
"Grown ups... Fully grown persons". Is that the target audience, or would adults suffice?
🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌👌
AMAZING WORK BY EVERYONE AT THE COMPANY ! THIS COMPANY AND CHRISTIAN AS THE LEADER AND OWNER IS JUST WHAT EVERY COMPANY SHOULD STRIVE TO BE !
I wish i could afford one
Who let Koenigsegg cook
Together with Rimac and Porsche, koenigsegg is a company that actually still innovates and does it in an honest ‘no Silicon Valley’ way.
Andrew tate received gemera and jesko this year i wish you will receive also
People are gonna say “Supra edits are the best” until they see this
Well done Victor.  Your team is on another level.
The perfect supercar these guys are geniuses
This is crazy
Let’s constantly move the camera around but never show a good view of the car.
Safe?
🤤❤️
They really just said "Fuck it! Let's make a family car go Mach Jesus."
Very very impressive I love this car it's my dream car
Bugaaaiii wer r u🫡
I can’t afford it but boy every supercar owner will shift to this as sometimes you want to take your family or buddies for a drift
CVK's Milkshake Brings All The Boys To The Yard...
I'm jealous of the mechanics who would work on this wonder
Nothing from K. about fuel capacity or efficiency (fuel consumption) and hence range. The 2 litre must be capable of (much) lower fuel consumption, possibly have bigger fuel capacity and have considerably greater range than the V8. Surely the 2 litre is more of a practical ('real world') GT.
This is insane. I have so much respect for Koenigsegg for how over the top innovative they are.
So much technology and yet not production car for under 1.7 mil , it can give me warp speed but it does not  matter if you cant afford it , feels bad , at least is a good investment for people with money to make more money.
Great, now 4 people will die together instead of 2, Nice!
CEO that knows his product in such details is amazing
Yeah, but can you fit a roof box to it?
I believe Christian is in contact with the galactic federation 🙂
Unbelievable, musk have to learn something from it to improve tesla 😅
Koenigsegg's only and best competition has been themselves since day 1.
amazing. simply amazing. I hope there is a book brought out about the engine and transmission - that would be a great read.
Imma gon tell my kid: son that's how the legend is born
The fact that they make every aspect of the car in house is MAD!!
Full on April fools prank vibes. The specs sheet is unflippin-real. Mad respect.🫡
Buggati just layed a brick in Volkswagen garden hearing this news 😯
Can’t wait to see what it does on the road 🔥🔥
I respect you sir. You're a pioneer and my hero. Much love from South Africa🙌🖤🇿🇦
booooooring!! dude and car.
Somehow Koenigsegg is still severly underrated. Just casually dropping figures that break the laws of physics.
I'm in love with this car!!!!
well what an amazing achievement indeed. Like many others it would be an experience to drive let alone own one, sadly that will not happen. In australia we wont even see one. oh well dreams are there for a reason.
I am definitely getting myself one.
The Gemera "RS" could  have the V8 with 2x Dark Matter electric motors for 3,100 HP. The Corvette E-Ray has an electric motor but not so much for electric driving but to go faster. The Gemera "RS" with 2x Dark Matter motors could satisfy similar tastes. This could be one reason for the huge fuel tank in the Gemera.
Damn
cars for arabs who should still be living in tents
If I only were a millionaire....
2800 nm torque ?! That's like a literally semi truck level torque from a production car that's bonkers
Alien technology comes from Sweden, confirmed.
Out of this world.
So this is what Tesla could've been if not focused on the masses and profit.... Well, glad we have Koenigsegg. They keep breaching limits like no other company. As far as we know at least.
Like a fine wine, better every year!
I’ll might need three please. One for me, one for the wife, and one for fun!
Never fails to melt me
Hope can learn more from chris..idol man company car
Nice Porsche
🇸🇪!!
This is the greatest car ever engineered since the invention of The car. Getting 800bhp out of 40kg is nothing sort of mind blowing. I firmly suspect that Koenigsegg is using carbon nanotubes, hard and soft super-paramagnetic to achieve this and if is that is the case this means their electric motor doesn’t contain copper or rare earth materials making it the world most sustainable electric motor.
I want 1 !!
This would be the Perfect SafetyCar in F1
I love that the presentation was done with a passion by the owner himself. 😎👍🏻
Can I get one with ISOFIX so I can mount our child car seat so I can drop our little girl off at daycare when I go to work.. :)
And still, not enough power to haul the weight of $100 bills it would take to buy one!  Absolutely Amazing! 💵💵💵💵💵
The emporor of hypercars , megacars KOENIGSEGG.  the best at what they're doing
They are 20 years ahead of everyone. I'd love to see an access version of the gemera around 120k€ with lower specs
These guys are clearly from the future, there's no doubt about it now
lets just appreciate its not another EV....
1:01
it’s a fucking hybrid with the biggest fuel tank ever made 😂 Koenigsegg is just pissing on the car manufacturing game…that’s fucking crazy
Christian Von Koenigsegg is a Legend
It's a shame that most of us won't be able to experience this beast but the numbers alone were enough to send shivers down the spine... Game id now entering in figures with three zeroes. Makes me want to stay longer and see the Era that's to come in future.
Good to see Michael van Gerwen on stage again 🙏🏽
So you're saying this thing does 0-60 in about -4 seconds now?😂 Absolutely crazy power and design. Perfect for everyday-use🥸
ugly !  agera & regera better
A master piece of engineering and walking art.
Poland love you Cristian ❤
They’ve got everything in this car ready before the customer ask
and the boss voices the commercial, nice
~look my car has this feature~ a genius bald guy : my features has a car on it
Truely the most innovative car maker in the world.
damn
I love Koenigsegg, they just make Crazy even Crazier and make it come true
Nice
this car has been in production for a decade almost
silent monster 😎
This is art
It's electric, so no thanks.  EDIT: Hybrid..
What just happened??? Unbelievable. . . Want to see it in person one day. . . Absolutely mind bending engineering going on. . . We need a detailed video on every components, Engine, The dark matter and the features 😍
루새드 새파어  Lucid Sapphire 과 태쓰래기 플래드 tess plaid 와는 언제 평가 시험하는가요?
i think this is more beautiful and more value than the rimac
Time to make highways with banked corners. To encourage 300km/h plus mobility. 👍
Bro built a spaceship and put 4 wheels on it💀
Way too calm for such crazy numbers!
It looks like car technology has totally overtaken the road construction limits.  There doesn't seem to be a place you could utilize that amount of power and speed safely without putting life at serious risk.  Despite that, this is a seriously beautiful piece of engineering.  All the people responsible for creating these cars really are on another level of imagination, vision, work ethic, and ability.
"DARK MATTER!"  Now that's marketing at it's best!
I love these guys, the Gemera concept was already awesome then they fit so much more into it, Jesko engine? Hot and cold cup holders? Passenger TVs? MEGACAR IS RIGHT!
Does it have mounts for a rear facing child seat
You know the company’s doing good when the CEO talks about a product as if he’s a reviewer seeing it for the first time. Now that’s an accomplishment. 😎
Does it come with a manual?
😮
And once again, I am in love. 😢
Wow
Thanks to the whole crew of Königsegg for building these beautiful pieces of art all car enthusiasts are dreaming of.
Where's Gemera? Who's Gemera? Why is Gemera?   kidding aside... what a beautiful and amazingly built machine!
2300 HP.... hm...why?  Even if it is 4-wheel drive the tires would never be able to obtain such good grip that you could use all that power.
Shows concept comes out with concept I’m glad I’m too broke to buy one of these cause I’d have every single model
@koenigsegg Quite budget introduction video, isn't it?. Is this car from the same budget? Contact professionals to present your product at the proper level
so they WILL make a faster car than the jesko, thought he said he didnt want to. Now hes talking about a 2300 hp version of the gemera which is just crazy, would love to see that, i wonder if he would make a few changes and call it something else
@Koenigsegg build a electric ion thruster hybrid  Ion thruster turbo charged = sound flames  hp power  recharge battery like in regenerative braking
But can it drift?
Is it a V8 or a 3 Cylinder?
This is either going to be a whole new level of hypercar or a complete failure
Nice car 👍
wow
just 20x my car's HP , nice job
when 1400HP is the base model!!!😅
Mom: we dont need a koenigsegg Me: but it can warm and cool the cups in the cup holders and has more space than your skoda ovtavia! Mom: okay wtf
koenigsegg always doing things their own way. Absolutely incredible
stunning
Haters got silent real quick
Koenigsegg is the best car manufacturers on the face of earth period
Looks like a Ford gt mixed with a Porsche 918
The beauty of EGG'S no one beat them✌✌✌✌✌✌✌
Porshe ????
Daumen hoch wenn du auch wegen JP hier bist❤️
I am so happy and grateful for what  Christian offers the world❤
So sick 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
I'm beyond impressed by what they have managed to do with Gemera. Amazing 👏
¿Porqué le ha quitado las luces de diamantes de 5 lineas delanteras y traseras? Literalmente era lo que más amaba del auto 😭 ahora se ve como un Peugeot
Koenigsegg just fucked up the whole super cars expectation...😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳🤯
Бугатти плачет в углу зала
Дожили в Кенегсеке используют мотор от Нивы!
Don’t you think he’s taking example out of watches?
Its a "Family car", I love it!
The engineering is explosive!
masbro koenigsegg kena bagi aku free valve system aku nak sarung kat lc baru boleh vtec on!
for real mfs koenigsegg always make me want to die in expensive way
This easily the most insane production car ever created. Nothing comes close to the Gemera.
Good Job Koenigsegg Team 👏🏽👏🏽
I've been waiting for a car like this.
Next step going smaller; Miata sized Koenigsegg but with more leg room? :p
This is so incredible. Christian Von Koenigsegg, you are my auto industry hero & role model.   However, l still think you're not human, but rather an alien. That's because Koenigsegg engineering is too otherworldly to be of Earth origin.
Christian von Koenigsegg you sir are a national treasure....infact make that international!!!!
Konigsegg is the one car manufacturer that actually makes new things, it is the greatest car company in existence
GOAT IN THE WORLD OF CARS
THE EXCITEMENT I HAVE🤩🤩🤩
в чём? покупатели данного автомобиля может будут восхищатся и даже вникать в техрешения но трогать не будут.
Damn we have not seen the front face of the cars once in your video!.. sincere F"CK to Koenigsegg, also next time try to rename to Kluiiwerrssr.... morrons!
Ultimate family car!
1400HP? Did i read that correctly???
Лучшая философия компания, лучший по всем параметрам автомобиль в мире
Enzo Ferrari would congratulate him.
You should be kidding me 😮 🔥
Please someone get me this @ koenigsegg
@carwow please get this car
Ten minutes of idle talk 😒
"Its just a family car"  The family car:
Koenigsegg's just art
How many units are there and how many have you sold? I want the 9speed version
I do believe that I may be a little short on funds until payday! 🤣
Alright now we have a new standard for a family car. Next up maybe 3000hp koenigsegg SUV?
This is mad science, I wish you had more affordable cars! This is the one car to rule them all hahaha
He never ceases to amaze.
omg!!!!!!!!! the numbers of the mixed engine is unbelievable💥💥💥💥....dark matter what a great name for the e-unit 👏👏👏👏...since I was a kid playing car card games Koenigsegg was a superlative for me...now in my 40th im completely burned with this video. My goodness...crazy to hopefully see what is in 20-40 years? Congrats for such a beautiful piece of art in and outside❤️
Cristian von Koenigsegg is easily my favorite person in this Earth rn!♥️👏  I was blown away by the concept version of the Gemera, but man coz Christian this nigga don't know when to stop!🥶 He done went from pullin 700 horses from a 1.5L 3 cylinder engine and thought uhm, can I fit the Jesko motor in that shiidd🤔  Then this legend went and did it,  put the Jesko engine in a Gemera, production car😫😫😫 Broo!! THIS MAN IS AN ENGINEERING FIT👏👏👏
insane
Ahh i see  To scare the shit out of all your family (by the way i still love the car)
Koenigsegg has always been in a League of it's own, but you outdid yourself on this one, just the E-Motor is Crazy in terms of engineering and technology🙌 Can't imagine to see one with my own eyes👀  Also the 2 Versions themselves are Amazing🧡
I was already impressed with the stats of the original 3cyl design, but holy shit. 2300 horsepower out of what could literally be a family car is fucking insane. If I had the money, this would 100% be something I would want in my garage so I could take my friends to the track and then in the same car take my family to run errands.
This Maniac performed a miracle 😮😮😮
i want a car
back looks like a cayman
Did he just called it bit less power??? 😂😂😂
now put the drivetrain into a 2 seater car
Translation: DO YOU SEE WHAT WE JUST F**KING DID?!?
I will buy a koenigsegg in this life❤
Bravo 🇸🇪❤
Just an Another Miracle!!
This car is "death on 4 wheels" ☠️
@koenigsegg as always you delivered master peace
what if they put the dark matter in the jesko absolut..
Now mass produce it and sell it for $100k…👀😁
And suddenly the Tesla and Rimacfanboys are gone.
Автомобиль мечты )))
This legendary company never disapoit us salute to koenigsegg
This car, in this green, is just beyond beautiful!! It kinda reminds me of a a TVR, lines wise, but so much more elegant! Koenigsegg never disappoints.
You are God
Koenigsegg is like vegeta,always asking itself - am i perfect yet? !!🙌🏼
wow I cant wait to buy one!
Can someone buy this car for me please 😢😢😢 in my name and all that
insane
😭😭😭🔥
💛🇸🇪💙
Much respect for Keonigsegg and his teams ingenuity🫡
Gemera for the family and CC850 for me.
Koenigsegg is mad! Real mad! Omg
I am sold 😮❤
This is a perfect example of why koenigsegg > everyone else including Bugatti. They are the only ones truly innovating. Everyone else is merely modifying. Bolide….what’s that?
yup Koenigsegg has done it again , well done this car is an absolute beast and its a four seater
Next video in 100:1 format please.
Koenigsegg... Wtf you guyz put 2350 HP in family car.... 😱 I bet no other company can come near to this even in next 10 years
The fastest coffee cup in the world
Koenigsegg is in a league of its own. Only Koenigsegg would name their new electric motor Dark Matter, just badass.
Gadiya uchiya rakhiya fans wont get it..
I almost shat at the factory 2300 hp and 2850Nm figure. my lord this car is going to be unreal. that's going to be one badddddddddddd ass car making a casual 2000hp more than my GTi.
They unlocked infinite space in this car
Koenigsegg deserves 4 Michelin stars cause they just COOKED
Insane
2300hp lmao
🤯💥🔥💯
Insane. The only competition they have is past themselves. And this presentation. The car. The boss. A list of mind-blowing technical facts.
My favorite *evil genius does it again. Honestly, if this car came with a reversible black hole in the luggage compartment vis-a-vis an acme black spot, I would be hesitant to react more than a subtle, appreciative nod.
😶
Koenigsegg is UNREAL. What i'd do to even sit in a CC850... This company is the pinnacle of auto engineering!
*I’ll take two please.*
2300 hp is insane
To me, the Gemera is in the same category as the F1 and the Veyron. Cars that changed the game.
Thank you Christian ❤
can I get one
Can’t say this car is good.
But it’s still a 2 door, my insurance will still classify this as a “sports car”. I need a true 4 door to save on insurance costs.
these guys are the best in the world. Theres not even a close second.
Beautiful!! Amazing piece of engineering....  Just the rear is a bit cayman-ish!
Can I get one of these please?
I hope this ends up on forza
overpriced useless vehicle for rich asses and collecting dust in their garages
Made in Sweden <3
Koenigsegg just fucked the entire super car world...casually 😅
A car like never seen before
I'm here witnessing history in the making right now
Way beyond Bugatti
If mancity was a Car brand
The modern Enzo, Ferruccio, Ettore... A league of it's own indeed. Here's an idea for you Christian - an F1 Team! I think that rivalry with Newey would be out of this world. They would have to create a new class for the two of you. F0 maybe? :)
This is insane on so many levels. A crazy project that actually got done,!! Kudos Koenigsegg.
Vad krävs de för att jobba i eran bransch mäktig bill ni alla har skapat snyggt
& This thing still rides on tyres... Geez the numbers are crazy
This nigga juss say 100 liters?? 😮
but it's fake, right ;]
I have 80$, take it or leave it
absolute mad lad. love it
They literally made a 2300hp family car
Cone Egg Said is just crazy.
Every car company has a terrible ca-  Koenigsegg and pagani: What about us?
Koenigsegg inovation is out of this world, absolutely no competition
If they did THIS MANY updates to the Gemera before coming to a production version, think what they have in store for the actual Jesko updates into production version!? Koenigsegg is literally leading the car industry in innovation and delivery.
The price?
GOD FUCKING DAMN
hahaha, we thought, we 3 cylinders is nice, but would a v8 fit? it does!
Quem Gemera serao as minas quando vc chegar num desse no role
Bugatti who? 🤣
The Gemera. ENOUGH SAID.🔥
i wish koenigsegg would come to F1 and spank redbull
Koenigsegg is in front of any other company
the fact that this company produces 95% parts of their own  "blows me"
What an incredible car that none of us will ever own.
ko  Koenigsegg in its PRIME
The day I win the lottery....
Wilson Fisk?
Hot coffee and milkshake live happily ever after 😂😂❤
kan jag få en?
Usain Bolt has been real quiet since this video dropped in
Finally a perfect daily driver.
They have now officially broke the race
I like this car, Aston Martin!
Spanking all other hypercar makers with a freaking family car!
That last revs 🥶🥶🥶
what the fuck
what happens when sweden actually tries to do something well
Christen is the kind of of guy to get so passionate about cup holders, I now find myself wanting said cup holders
pretty sure I could drive that without killing myself instantly
What is bro taking 💀💀
Koenigsegg is really the best car brand right now. Congratulations on the world record and the Gemera!
WTF?
To say “Koenigsegg is ahead of its time”, is an understatement 😢
Königsegg is just built different
HOW TF DO THEY KEEP DOING THIS WTF????
In love with that car ! <3
are trucks automotive? if it is , we are using 3 phase , 6 phase and mostly 9 phase , sooo not the first..
If I can't spell *KOENIGSEGG* then I don't want a *KOENIGSEGG*
nice toy for rich ppls
Can you open the doors in a low ceiling garage??
bro how
My absolute favorite car manufacturer as well as my absolute favorite CEO. May we both live long lives so I can see what revolutionary ground you will break next 🫡
koenigsegg why didnt u test the car top speed i think its a great car for family
This car is just sick ..... almost a supercar with the confort of a station wagon
Incredible
The man of the voice ❤❤❤❤
Koenigsegg and Rimac is going to be the Epitome of Motor vehicle Future
It's amazing the front design is remarkably signature for KOENIGSEGG✨ BadAss Spacecrafts design 🦾🦿🪐
Stunning kit. Wow
Chapeau! Incredible. Mr. Koenigsegg and the whole corparation, well done.
This car was created using Alien technologies and engineering, the specs are mind boggling to comprehend.🤯😍
An engineering wonder right there.
4 seater AWD 2300 hp hypercar/megacar...???💀💀 Ain't no way bruh... V8..? Luggage space..? 100 L fuel tank..? 0-60 in 2 sec..? Is this a first of its kind car? Does this even have any competition?
also their best looking car so far - this one is actually gorgeous
audi r8
when the CEO is more passionate and don't care much about making money:
A real “big boy” car!!!
🎉
To do all this and the car is one of the most aesthetically pleasing is unreal. To make only 300 is gonna make the price of these sky rocket in the after market.
Gay
I need that bag😢
Koenigsegg>>>
Wtf is a fully grown person?? Just say adult... No need to be PC all the time.
The have no competition
These guys created a whole class of car on their own. Koenigsegg is just different, next fucking level
A whole 200 families will be able to buy this
what did I just watch? I still can't comprehand how a car like this is even possible. It just shows why Koenigsegg is the nr 1. car company.
When he said 2 thous... I cracked laughing. WOW
Tate is buying this within a month
Disapointing it's a fuking electric. If even the supercar manufacturer quit fuel who's gonna make us dream ? Beside this the car is tremendous
The difference between Koenigsegg and most car manufacturers is that Koenigsegg actually innovates.
I dont think I will ever be rich enough to stand in the presence of one of these cars, but I'm so very glad they exist 😍
can i test drive one?!?! lol🙌🙌🙌🙌
When you want your family car to be from the future & go supersonic in style..
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Woow, Ikea is stepping up. Swedish glory.  😂😂😂😂
Yea, and where we gonna drive it Christian old chap? Every shit stain government has their gay little speed limits for us to keep.
Fantastic to be STUCK IN TRAFFIC ! And also … who buys this crap ?  I much rather be stuck in traffic in a mercedes or ford.
Everyone is making these hypercars now, but in reality their all just holding Christians beer all the time apparently
I wanna buy the TFG motor so I can put it in my gr Yaris, so I can still have the most powerful 3cyl
I didn't know that KOENIGSEGG is owned by Hank Schrader!!
buset monster baru
The should pump up the background music
Just think about the future of the automotive industry after Koenigsegg, road speed record holder already, fits the record breaking engine into a 2300hp 4 seater... 400kph will be common if the competitors invest as well and, man oh man, I'm scared what Koenigsegg will do with their next top speed aimed performance car after this... If they just strip the gemera into a jesko absolute kinda like bugatti did with the chiron 300 and bolide, they're gonna cross the checkered flags on the moon. The 'promissed' tesla roadster won't have records left to break
Waiting for this car in new NFS & Forza Horizon with Forza Motorsport!
Imagine passing a Bugatti and Rimac with your kids in the back eating ice cream
And to think there are people that think that VW Porsche models are better than this gems, from a company that does engineering, by themselves...
Can't wait to see this car tested in  Top Gear season 5 🔥
our kids won’t go to school late no more!!!!
Amazing and inspiring. The Koenegsegg Gemera is not only an engineering masterpiece but also a work of art if you ask me. In a league of its own.
i have to get rich , and i will . I want this car .
That is one hell of a car.
What a machine!
Koenigsegg the type of company to create an entirely new element just to make their cars 5g lighter
So, you found dark matter?!
Who let them cook bruh😭💀
Wait did he just say you can fit 4 suit cases in this bad boy naw he’s really exposing all These car manufacturers to be nothing but lies and scams
What a weird color for a Ferrari
Badass
That “Dark Matter” tech is badass
Koenigsegg wins at "Hold my beer, watch this."
I’m speechless, this car is just crazy
What the Supra should have looked like
now they need to make a truck with 2400hp
Crazy overkill of a car
What an awesome experience that must be to drive one of those things!
This is it, now u dont need to ge mera, Koenigsegg is the coolest damn carbrand ever
Yeah but ya know, being a swedish car an all, how does it handle in snow and bad weather conditions?
So, they went from the crazy 1700 hp 4 seater to the absolute bonkers 2300 hp 4 seater. Any other car ever increase power by 600 hp between concept and actual premiere?
You guys are crazy ! That’s what I like you are like the « high tech » of cars brands.
Can’t wait to drive this in Forza Motorsport !!!
I'm mind blown! Keep up the incredible work Koenigsegg!
2023 feels like sci-fi
Sigh. Another mad marvel of engineered performance I can never have or even drive...
the part when he say we have the 3cilendere ou the v8 biturbo killing me
Now to decide on the color. Or maybe I should just get a couple, say one in dark blue and one in arctic white.
This is insane
What’s the next car name gonna be? Camera?
If i had all the money in the world i'd drive this car. It's practical, fast and beautiful.
Koenigsegg is the best.
I guess its time for me to buy a lotto  ticket. this is a dream car right here.
This kind of accomplishment is the kind that makes you say "where to from here?"
100 liter tank ? i'm sold
Work of Art.
That’s fucking wild
Imagine dropping some odd $3M on the 3 cylinder version only to hear this mf announce a V8 version
My favorite car company by far. And the car looks absolutely amazing.
I will work my ass off to own a Koenigsegg car, supercar!
Imagine buying this while in house arrest.
When you think it could not get better than 1.400hp in a 4 seater, Koenigsegg comes with 2.400hp and some wild cup holders
Love it
Koenigsegg killed it again.
Best car ever!!
is VW the new owner ?? or just the body is made in porsche???
This is a 6:38 innovation, WooOOOHH!!!
Well it does seem to have everything. A perfect car.....?
HOLY SHIT!
Well done with the voiceover Cristian! And to the producers, you got the chills you were looking for!
WHAT THE HELL?!!? The fact that these numbers alone do not even impress him is incredible. Absolute masterpiece.
Its crazy that the V8’s sole job is to power the front wheels only. 🤯
Why offer two different engines at such high power levels, wouldn't it be more efficient to offer just one big one ?
its electric, who cares
Los de Buggati se debe estar arrancando el pelo pensando como superar esto🤣🤣🤣💯💯❤️🤩
I love you
This guy is my leader!!!
Hi Christian Koenigsegg!, Come this Car in Forza Horizon 5? I ❤ this car 😊
we will see how it does in practice against other cars. The Agera RST  was a complete failure at launching and putting the power down https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6jMR7-NZMM&t=1026s
thats insane
This company is absolut perfection in (super) Car manufactoring, to me! Forget about all this Tesla fail products and Co!
Nahhh u joking that cant be right
I get to see this car only in pubg mobile 🙂
I wonder what a koenigsegg SUV will look like when the time comes👀😂
Koenigsegg = Amazing cars with an ugly look, but this one at least isn't that ugly as the last ones. Looks a little like a Porsche and Corvette became a mutant child.
The ultimate supercar killer
Very intriguing simple idea.... let’s just put the electric motor with the gas engine make some kind of monster Prius and it works. It just works. I must say the engineering to make the electric motor is impressive kudos unknown person who advanced technology but charged outlandish fees. Brilliant transmission guys that thing is custom art. It take forever to get motors to work in tandem with the same gears. Whoever number cruncher and figured out the weight distribution a round of applause that work sucks.
2300HP 2850 nm torque 😳🔥💀
Can I get one for free please🙏 🥺
Koenigsegg just hits different, keep up the good work
This is insane
Supra guys big patience for you
Bugatti preparing to leave the chat…
Yea i was kinda doubtful at first but the cup holder sold it for me.
who hurt Koenigsegg ??
The best 4 seater car ever. Masterpiece!
Oh look a  Porshe 🤣 This thing looks so much like a Porshe that is funny
The way he just casually mentioned the horsepower and torque as if it's normal 😭😭😭
Marvelous
If Albert Einstein was still alive, he’d be bang. Cause there’s no way this man keeps on doing this.
KOENIGSEGG Mid engine Porschamera 👏
This man just said 2300HP like its nothing
It needs a 2016 minecraft youtuber intro
Sir, you have my respect
Illegal   this one
All hail the king of hypercar companies
This here.. Thats quality! attention to detail. Thank you Sweden
who ever has a the money for this car better do a cannonball record in it!
These Swedish cars only for super rich men 😭😭 ...save money to  buy tesla1317==726B for me....
God level engineering from Koenigsegg
Bruh? You guys are in 22 century.
Absolute insanity. Thank you for keeping cars fun while the rest of the world looks to make them all boring.
Koenigsegg always on top with their innovation and crazy ideas
Gangster
Can you pls gift me one 😢
ugly af
For years and years, I kept wondering. How could they top this eventually? They always did. That is, on the tech level. Design wise, I am not so sure. Probably dictated more by aerodynamics than esthetics.
Hes very smart. He knows where Bugatti will be soon with an electric motor added by rimac. Awsome car the gemera 4 seats. Mate has his work cut out for him. This is a exciting era for performance cars. 3000 hp soon.
Bravo!
Bravo!
I am Brazilian
Is it me or is this the best looking car Koenigsegg has ever done? I mean their cars have always been impressive looking but this is beautiful...WOW!
I absolutely love the design of the car. The back reminds me little of an older Porsche GTR
I wanna buy this car, all I need is $53 million dollars
👻♥️
The stats of this car seemed more intimidating than the jesko tho 😂
Gemera = "Give more". Oh boy did Koenigsegg give us a lot more than we imagined... 😊
this guy is the real GOAT
next will be ultracar
Better job than Einstein ever dream.
Koenigsegg is the car of the future
ok but thee price, for almost 2 milion, who is this for? Sheiks? Bilionaires? For that price I can buy 5, yes, FIVE houses, each of them having 6 or more rooms,, LMAO
Can't decide which of Koenigsegg or Pagani are the pinncle of automotive industry....probably both
What if they deleted the 2 rear seats and added a even bigger engine
Them - it just a electric car  Me - idon't care because it's a koiensegg car
The Ultimate Perfected Dream Car ! Can't wait to see how fast their fully Electric Vehicles are?  It's gonna be INSANELY FAST  😍💖⚡️🏎⚡️💖🔋🌞💯👍 😉💖🌎✌️
This three cylinder is gonna take milk nd juice out all those v8 nd v10s out there …happy milking ❤
Koenigsegg just changed the game - again! Wow!
Could that e motor run an airplane like a cesna for a decent distance?
Koenigsegg is the ones that follow the next sentence “the difficulty is make it easy” amazing job as always ❤
They never fail to impress. I mean how the fuck an 4 seater can have V8 and electric motor combining 2450 HP and can fit 4 bags. You could do track day and then go on to pick your kids up from school. Holy shit I wish I own one someday.
An electrical Motor with 6 freaking Phases😮 How talented he is❤
This is an amazing feat of automotive engineering. Well done.
@aristocar bhai video chaiye
Wow... As always 😯
just because it is 4 seater doesnt mean its "FAMILY" car ...its just bcz u can now take 3 of ur friends with u on track
Absolutely astonishing!
Koenigsegg has been innovating and tearing it up for so long, it's absurd they keep doing it. Hands down my favorite automotive company, as far as innovation goes.
Bugatti bolide 1825hp 😀  Koenigsegg gemera 2300hp checkmate 😎  Bugatti 🥲
The v8 sound in intro 1:01 just made me scream 🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every automaker needs to take note: this is how it's done. Can't say how can Koenigsegg top this? Because we know they will, it will be the dark matter motor car next!
Litteraly this is the only supercars company that has my respect, idk how ferrari has that prestige u do cars 20 times better
7:17 basically saying fuck Bugatti
just imagine how much faster it would have been if it had 12 cup holder ( 3 pr person ) ? i have figued out, that it is the cup holders that makes it faster than other 4 person cars !!
And the day when the Swedish fcuked the whole German and Italian motorspace with such grace. Welcome.❤
next technology, 2cylinder + twinturbo + dual dark matter mercury engine + Hydro Operated machine 🧐 ... alien works, no more gas
Masterpiece👏👏👏
this car is pure beautyfull art .
chyba się zakochałem
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
LONG LIVE KOENIGSEGG, LONG LIVE ICE
Probably already sold out 😔
holy. fucking. shit
Keep in mind he speaks out of his head. Means he really works with all of these things with his team. Musk type of CEO.
The power of this car could spin the earth wtf!?!?
There's nothing in regards safety towards this brand. The Net and NCAP is not having it. How can this be a legend unless if you want to write your testament, you buy this?  People must be crazy to buy this. This is a brand that should have gone towards aviation build, not cars.
6:00 I can't hold my laughter to see that massive V8 inside an engine bay that was designed for an I3 engine. And 2300 hp.  These guys are mad
This is the most innovative and authentic automotive company I have ever seen. That level of engineering and innovation is impeccable. All credit to Christian and his team!!!
We'll done Mr Koenigsegg, you live life at 20 tenths, salute
There’s not much too say other than tank you for what you do to the automotive industry. You guys are geniuses
How? Just How do they do it?
Such horsecrap, it's stunning the people of the world put up with this sort of ode to excess.
This is mind blowing, this is Zeus on 4 wheels ! 😎👌
Someone please get this on the autobahn..
keonigsegg always produce one of a kind car, its amazing
How much horse power should we put in ? Yes
i don't like the design :/
Beautiful!
Thank you, Christian von Koenigsegg, for once again inspiring and making this child's dreams come true
Finally someone did it, everyone  made it seem like you couldn't put a backseat in a fast car, this car has everything you need.
No compromise for big money
How can he calmly present this? How? Howwwwwww????? HOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?????????????????
Can't wait it for Forza and GT7!
Is it April 1st....???
Tbh, who thinks this thing looks like a Porsche? Koenigsegg is one of my fav brands up with Porsche/Mclaren!
Quick guys, let's make predictions: How many of this car model will rot in a Sheikh or Oil baron's garage?
Bugatti is better
Coming out and beating a legendary brand like bugatti ,,this brand is definitely something. ... Some day I would like to buy cars of this brand .
Christian doing the narration himself is class
Protect that man at all costs! 🙏🏼
Christian took the numbers to a whole new level! Good job Koenigsegg Thanks for making the fastest, quickest, most powerful and torquiest Mega GT [4-Seater Megacar] in the world!
People Like Christian Born Once in a Thousand Years 😊
L video editor
Hes like enjoy the Gemera, yeah when probably the fact that most of us will never ever will ever affort a car like this !!!
Christian, you and your whole team have done it again. This car is incredible, and will be a staple for future automotive innovation. out of the park, well done
Everytime Koenigsegg launches a car, I feel like other automakers are century behind in terms of tech. The Ghost Squadron is from out of this world❤
Koenigsegg just dropped the best car in the world and thought we wouldn't notice?!🙌💪
Axial flux six-phase Dark Matter motor. wow
Safemoon colors 😎
I'm just at lost for words how incredibly happy it makes to see that there's a company out that just says "you know what, we're making this no matter what" and then completely obliterates the idea. I'm so glad to see this kind of innovation now just to know that in 50yr time, they're going to look back and say "Koenigsegg was our reason."
What will the competitive price be?
Oh and just to remind people, this is the same vehicle we were introduced to so interior & everything has already been seen and the Gemera is supposed to run on Carbon Neutral fuels like Volcanol but is flex fuel and fuels like regular Gasoline is optional but not what it is supposed to run on, that and it's a PHEV, we just got a different engine & drivetrain for this.
Do you guys take trade ins? I have a 2019 Toyota Camry. 😂
Koenigsegg is the best
an excellent case study... but do we really need cars like this with the existing speed limits??? ... just think about it...
Just Engineering Marvel
There is now Company like Koenigsegg
Believe me, soon we will see the SUV version of this brand which is beyond what the world has ever seen. ❤️🇳🇦🫶🏽
If this car is exactly as he described it then this is an instant historic car and first of its kind. By blowing our the whole market it shows what the manufacturers are holding back
When are you building the next spaceship to rival Tesla 😂
Bro Casually Ended all the Hyper Car Market
Just Beautiful 🫡
.
The 2300HP Gemera is my new favorite place to watch lame Netflix shows.
wow
2.300. HP!!???? 🤯🤯🤯
4 door that drives like a 2 door
This give me vibes of ferrari and aston martin
i thought this car was finna be like 5 to 10 million dollars
Ferrari looks like infant infront of Koenigsegg
The elon musk of ICE cars but always thinks max drip. Dudes living the dream. I bet these are reliable too.
Small company with the same initiative show the world that they cannot build cars without passion. This man thinks of it all and jams it into one car. The fact hes building 4 seater hypercars with luggage space and heated and cooled cup holders that can achieve space travel is deeply profound. I want to meet this man.
The only car presentation from any brand where the technology is being spoken about 100% of the time. Lambo or Pagani bring out a new car and it's the 0-60 specs and a lightshow, that's it. Koenigsiegg are the ones inventing new tech every year.   Man I wish I could afford one before they sold out! Green is the dream!! Congratulations team this is actually art and we're all drooling and inspired at the same time. Unbelievable..
Idk why but Rimac Nevera came in my mind when i saw and read the name.
im trully speechless... i love this car
"Offer you all an experience never seen before" (all you billionaires)
When you think they can't get any crazier they just step it up again by a huge step like it's nothing. Really looking forward to seeing it perform on the road and track against it's "competition"...
😮😮
This is my new favorite car
Koenigseeg has always ben my favourite super car manufacturer EVER. They are FXCKING WIZARDZ that work witchcraft because HOW DO THEY DO THIS!?!?!?!? HOW!?!??! I want to own a Koenigsegg one day! I love them so much. Bugatti, Rimac, Pagani could never. 2300HP???? from factory???!!! INSANE! I can't wrap my head around any of it
AutoTopNL i have a quest for you
Koenigsegg just made everyone else to shit themselves
Can’t wait to drive this in Need for Speed someday.
finally a worthy car which can be deemed as a family car
that was the quickest 8 mins of my life. this man is god.
Only Koenigsegg would come up with something this insane...ly awesome.
I was privileged to run Koenigsegg for Aus & NZ previously and to see the advancement now with the Gemera at the time we had only the "TFG" engine now with the Jesko V8 so the addition of this Gemera model really has just smashed the competition. Koenigsegg has now just completely changed the game and this is all the car you will ever need. Well done Christian you continue to show the competitors you are in a league of your own and the bench mark you continually set is astounding.
Heated and chilled cup holders btw
This dude is a fricken genius, thinks outside the box and cars are worth millions.
Whenever someone asks why I think cars like Veyron and Chiron are overpriced and underwhelming, I just point at Koenigsegg. They can do with a V8 what Bugatti had to make do with a W16 and quad turbos in a big heavy tub. If you're rich and money's no object, I really don't know why you'd want a Bugatti over a Koenigsegg.
This is just wicked!!!
Thank you for making a car that only 5% can afford 😂😂
Bonds new Car
"Who believes in heart that Christ died to take sins of people and after that rose again -will be Saved."Repent for time is short
Drop in a Steve Morris SMX in a wagon and you have another 1500hp
"Raxial flux" ? Sounds like poor attempt skirting around a 100year old patent
He is the frikken man. What a legend! All (or almost all) in house designed and built. Insane. He achieved the impossible dream.  Imagine the regulations and challenges of starting a totally independent hypercar company!
I wish I can own one.
Yeah, ENJOY THE GEMERA ⁱⁿ ʸᵒᵘʳ ⁿᵉˣᵗ ʳᵃᶜⁱⁿᵍ ᵍᵃᵐᵉ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ
This confirms that UFOs are real
Bravoooooooo!!!!!!! SPECTACULAR!!! I WANT ONE!!!
❤❤❤❤
i'll take two
Holly shit …
Doug Demuro gonna be happy with cup holders! XD XD
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's INSANE!!!! 1700hp was CRAZY, but THIS!  <8-O
Restock the ghost bracelets please.
This is simply incredible!!!
Yeah,you'll have that with these smaller car companies.
😳😨😱🙌👏
”Impressive” sounds futile when it comes to describing this engineering marvel on wheels. Bravo Mr. K!
ahead of its time ... well done!
4 seater for the boys
3-cyl please
Wtf is a mega car
Hehehe why does this remind me of Homers car from the Simpsons lol
I always impressed by Koenigsegg and Pagani ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Does it have isofix points in the rear though.
Wow Koenigsegg is really taking it to the next level with innovation this is incredible 👏 only thing I wish the Gemera had wider wheel arches like a wide body kit.. Seems like the Swiss is hiding the most advanced machical magic 😬 oh the speedometer screen attached to the steering wheel is bad idea just attach it to the dash
That's crazy.. faster, better,  family car , looks amazing , electric charge,  what else ? It has everything and more .. amazing.
it's not the Elon Musk who is the Iron man. It's actually this guy
Making a family car World: It needs to be practical, economical, reliable, have lots of space and modern commodities Koenigsegg: 1400hp or 2300hp you choose
Unbelievable! 😱
He eats buggati for breakfast.
The previous version was already my favorite car... NOW THIS 👻
Why does Christian  even bother advertising this car? Isn't it already sold out?
wow. truly the perfect car
Dude this car is literally the car of all time
W.
Legends say he gave up his hair for better aerodynamics for mankind.  Thank you
Please give me a single word to describe this gemera 🗿🗿!!
nice Porsche
The world doesn't need this lunacy. spend that engineering talent creating something useful to the masses. Please
I have been impresed by this car since they announce it. Imagine having one Gemera.
But no NORMAL person cares... Innovation or not, most people cant pay their rent.. this is a nonsensical dream.
Every single human will impress with every single car that they show to us. How can anyone expect that this car over 2000 horses?🤯
That's actually incredible!
Next project  Christian and his team are going to built a mini van with 4000hp/ 4300 lbs of  torque hybrid, ya heard it here first. The first HYPER HYBRID Soccer moms Mini Van 2038 !!!
Koenigsegg really is what we all wish Bugatti would be.  Bugatti has the better looking cars in my opinion, and they have the name, but they're too much of a one hit wonder and too focused on extremely rich posh people.  Koenigsegg keeps it fresh and light. Not everything in the presentation has to be post and in a fancy suit and shit.   W Koenigsegg
I love Koenigsegg, and the Gemere is the best car for the next years. Buuuuut, it kinda reminds me of a Porsche
This is why Koenigsegg is at the absolute TOP in terms of automotive manufacturers, and one of my most favorite car companies ever. Forget Bugatti, forget Pagani, forget Ferrari, forget Lamborghini, forget everyone else. This man is mad in the best way possible. Kudos, von Koenigsegg.
What a master piece
Excited about this great technology.....
Christian and his team at Koenigsegg never ceases to amaze the automotive world, the amount of innovation coming out of this company is astonashing, they are in a league of their own!   Countless times this premiere had me speechless - how the hell have they managed to squeeze 1400 hp out of a hybrid three-cylinder engine and 2300 hp out of a hybrid eight-cylinder engine, all while fitting 4 adults, 4 carry-on luggages and a 100 liter gas tank????
Would love a walkthrough with the Engineering team, Kudos!
so if this is a "family car" does the rear seats has isofix?
Idk who this bald guy is but he needs to stop stealing my ideas.
Please don't lose the track of your design language! This one looks more like a Porsche!
Oops - you did it again. Astounding, as always. Unbeatable like never before. It was a pleasure and privilege to work with and to meet you, sir. Congratulations on all you've accomplished since!
If they were to build f1 engines and do any r&d for a team they would be UNBEATABLE
Wow wow wow wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥
All this sounds like Plot twist. Koeninsegg just bypassed the rest to the top.
Porsche fans: PoRsChE iS tHe BeSt CaR bRaNd  Koenigsegg: 4 seat 2300 horsepower hybrid that weighs less than 2 tons lol.
I didn’t know about the use of the Jesko engine… 😳.  That’s probably the most incredible car ever built from an engineering and technological standpoint.
it's a shame that the deal between Koenigsegg and Saab never happend.. Saab would today be the best car for normal people with the knowhow and enginers from Koenigsegg! :)
From an entrepreneurial POV, this man achieved all this in one lifetime. In just 3 decades. Stop comparing koenigsegg with Bugatti. Makes no sense.  Koenigsegg would smoke bugatti had it existed as long as bugatti. It already smoked it though.
BMW i8 engineers left the presentation. 😂
Absolutely superb
Now wait for Elon Musk to focus all Teslas energy on making a car that accelerates faster than this, instead of fixing all their issues like build quality, wonky software, mediocre handling, sub-par brakes etc. 😂
Wait what😮
Absolute game changing
GEMIGEMI
Nice.  You will also build a cross country version? I want take one.
Gemera = give more in Swedish 😎🙌
Jesus christ, that's an absurd amount of power. Been waiting so long to see more about this car since it was first revealed, they did not disappoint.
me and my 10 wives, 500 husbands and 1 son will absolutely love this car
More seats than cylinders, who hurt yall???? Koenigsegg's are superior
My mind cannot comprehend the fact that all of this is just possible… I am so speechless for words…
Koenigsegg has always been one of those ‘over the top’ kinda of companies but in my opinion they’ve just set a whole new bar. What a stunning machine, from every angle
Nice Porsche
RIP Tesla Plaid & all the techie nerds that have inflitrated the car community!!!
Songs?
Tesla has nothing on Koenigsegg.
Lipo power without the lipo!?!?
how about 0-400-0  ???
WOW.
Have a cake ✓. Eat it✓
The only irrefutable evidence of alien technology on earth.
Finally something that will absolutely smash a Plaid 😂
Imagine if this man was a vegan and wasnt known as a frozen chicken businessman… another reason to eat meat…
if you think that's it, Christian always goes one better. i ❤ this Dude
Googling “fastest car ever made” yeilded sad results until maybe 2012.  Corvette Sledgehammer had it for to long. F1, Veyron. Those came later. Now the list is anyone’s guess and I think it’s a marvel if the human race, not the cars. What has happened in the economy and people’s status to allow for the environment to have a 10 million dollar car that can’t be driven 5% of it’s capability on the road.
This is what happens when you let Engineers build the cars and not your accountants!
Just another level of art from another planet wow!
bro pls join F1
Great presentation 🤌👏
Beautiful 😍❤️
wow! simply amazing
what are the odds of getting SUVs from KOENIGSEGG ??
Finally, a car for gemers.
marrques Brownlee needs to check this one out!!!
This is called engineering.
He speaks of passions when he talks about this. Made me a fan. Well done. One day 💪🏾 I’ll be in one.
How the heck do you get 600 hp from a 2.0 i3? I swear koenigsegg is always on top when it comes to engine, just waiting for them to join f1, imagine how many hp they will get on 1.6L V6 turbocharged engine.
i wish i would be able to afford one. maybe one day.
KOENIGSEGG sets itself apart by innovation, its the IBM of cars !
What is the price guys?
I hope I can have this car someday in the future
Whatever you're paying your engineers, they're somehow still underpaid. Simply astounding what your small team is capable of, makes those big car corporations look silly for spending a decade "perfecting" meaningless crap while you revolutionize the industry in half the time.
This is lit 🔥
this is art
this technology and thinking is way beyond f1 and Christian does not race these cars how do they think it up and how is it possible to generate so much power i still dont fully understand it???
I want to see what happens when you place one Dark matter motor on each wheel. 3200 HP EV incoming.
its insanity and i want one now please sir!
Incredible work, Koenigsegg has done it again! What a gorgeous machine!
I can't wait to order this!
V8? I thought it's i3
I was confused between this and chiron but finally today decided to go for Hyundai Verna
Is it faster than the Ragera?
then this car is good for thefting , master plan with 4 guys to theft money with four full bags , and daimonds , gold etc
It Looks Amazing!
koenigsegg is genius man
the perfect family car
Mind boggling
That's called Alien Technology, Koenigsegg !!! Christian You are Creative Genius!
Wow… started from nothing and now look at that
is this a solution for a problem that didn't exist? I can't imagine there are many billionaires that are able to afford  this car, that give a flying-f about practicality. It's cool that it WAS done, and the constraints do force ingenuity.  But other then that, it feels a bit pointless.
long supra lookin thing
He's incredible
Finally a family car for me and my family...😅
I'm speechless
Gone be my first car when 🤞🏾🙌🏾
Can't buy it but love it
Holy hell. I am looking forward to seeing people test this incredible car.
🗣Áno - **🛡 Koenigsegg**, je vo vlastnej lige🫶🏻🙌🏻👋🏻**Ängelholm, SVERIGE🇸🇪**
No doubt that Koenigsegg is in another league no other car manufacturer can compete with them, Christian is so smart and always comes up with new technologies and ideas 👏
I wish i could enjoy the Gemera, but I'll only be able to watch videos about it!
Only one comment necessary ... Thumbs Up 👍!
M. Von KOENIGSEGG is just reinventing Automobile... All my Respect 👏
this feels unreal but here it is
So the car now has the jesko engine lmao. This guy is lex Luther if he was a car manufacturer
Christian Von Koenigsegg is the guy the people from the 90s imagined that will invent flying cars in the near future. He is capable of anything
There's automotive companies and then there's Koenigsegg
🔥🔥🙏🙏👌👌
Not one car manufacturer comes an kilometre close to Koenigsegg engineering bro, not a single one!! Dammit!!
Leagues ahead of everything and everyone else, the mind boggles.
Now this will be a best family moment for dom torretto.
man hör den svenska dialekten
It just blowe my mind at home they put an entire v8, 9 gears of transmission a hundred litre + tank and space for 4 cases at the back🤯🤯
This Guy is a GOD !!!
Track ID??
Christian is the Steve Jobs of the Automotive Industry! Always something new around the corner which no one thaught was possible!
Does anyone knows which version of Gemera they bring to Goodwood?
No match
Amazing piece of work.
I'll be your driver when you go F1.
Finally, a car worthy of replacing the Ford Falcon! 😍
aMazInG!!!!! I wish i could afford it :(
Dear Santa 😌🙏
Incredible engineering!
The only can company i would happily pay millions of dollars .. only if i had that amount of money 😂
Enginuity when they don’t have to answer to anyone
New Dreamcar for a generation ✅
This is a car that future Jay Leno is gonna have in his garage 100 years from now, as one of the last cars with a combustion engine. "It had all of these features and power! In 2023! In a world where mosquitoes were still around and a simple cancer could kill you!"
What a stunner, engineering at its finest  for a super hyper sedan
Fantastiskt!
This one blew my mind
I want to them make a suv...that would really be something else
How tf is this man not going crazy after creating a masterpiece ☠️☠️
They went from 2 seater, to 4 seater. Maybe a extreme one seater coming soon?
That's fking tremendous, conspicuously awesome, fire in veins, 🔥
Now playing: Only thing they fear is you🔥
I can't afford its center mirror, and yet the algorithm has decided I need to see this
No matter how advanced the GEMERA gets, Cant wait for the supercarblondie review of this car...🎉😂  "Wooow.. look at that carbon fibre... Oh big gold color wheels and see the beautiful green color paintwork..  bla bla blah...  😅😅😅
Wow. The 3-cylinder engine is the more impressive, imo. So light, a single person can lift it, yet 600hp... but most people who can effort it, will probably go for the Jesko engine
Nahh i gotta fight for one of these bro gotta wake the spirit man 😮‍💨🔥
here it is! freevalve AND direct drive!!
I need to get rich, so I can buy this car :,)
Koenigsegg will you ever think making a 600+ km/h new hypercar
This vs the Rimac
Christian von Koenigsegg is the man, I always dream  to become.
Do do do a speed test
amazing work of art and engineering....
Thanks god you exist
Absolute insanity the different classifications of type this car is in
Screeem loud Koenigsegg 🎉🎉🎉🎉
2300 hp and u said it soo lightly. Mannnnn
Christian is a legend. Koenigsegg is the place to go for innovation and extreme but thoughtful design.  The specs and stats of the Gemera are MIND-BLOWING!
Do they develop the gearbox systems in house?
I understand why, but it doesn't really look good with such a long window...
I'll never afford this stuff, but man this company makes me excited for cars in a way that no other can.
I'll take two
I’m not surprised I’m blown away. It seems like koenigsegg just casually offers cars that no knew they wanted or thought was possible. Unmatched by any other car company, yet they are pushing more tech every car they make then the giant companies that just copy one another.  I just wish they offered anything that the common man could buy so we could support their insanity
This is a prank right?
Dream hyper car❤
You are showing 4 pax supercare while pseudo activist in our government push everyday another traffic bans and speed limits.
imagine Koenigsegg joins the Pick up and SUV competition
Amazing solutions, congratulations to the whole team!
how tf do they keep impressing more and more every time
👀🔥
ㅅㅂ 앞모습 실물좀 보여줘라 옆만 주구장창 보여주네
The Gemera has destroyed all hypercars and rendered them unfit to hold that tiltle...............😂😂
how. it is literally alien I want to learn this whole drive train, the first time I saw the engine I literally did not understand what I was looking at only able to make out the intake, turbos and exhausts, this thing is the mega car, It would be a dream to just see how their engineers work and how different this car is, I was kinda confused as of recently where some of the really insane engineering in cars had gone and it seems koenigsegg has it.
i wanna have 😅😂
I think the 3 cylinders should be replaced with a 4 cylinder engine
The original design put an electric motor on each rear-wheel, my assumption is that the torque-vectoring would be controllable left to right by overdriving the outside wheel (like the acura nsx system). Now they've moved to a single electric motor: is this going back to a more traditional brake-controlled vectoring?
This is absolutely amazing. I'm making room in my garage tomorrow. This is the car Harry Potter would have drove in the wizardly world when he grew up.
Koenigsegg = 🥰🥰🥰
This is the future
Gamora?  -Starlord
Very impressive. Well done 👏👏👏
he presented that kind of number of a car like it is just a normal car, sick!
Perfect daily driver.
Absolutely brilliant 👏 👌 😀
If you’re buying a million dollar car this should be the specs
v8 is crazy
He’s like the albert Einstein in cars
jesus fucking christ i hope they can actually mass produce this. honestly a good mechanical engineer specializing in mechatronics with a machine shop background would be able to design and prototype complete lines for each component in a year or two.
waste of space with those two extra seats could have added another electric motors and made this car good
He is the Elon musk of the super car industry. Imagine if the 2 were to collaborate and design something GINORMOUS.
Lamborghini and koenigsegg has the best shape of cars in the world
2300 hp... just insane, as usual
They just killed it 😦😦
Just Imagine Your Buggati gets Smoked by A Family Car and Children's Opening There windows and Saying Your Buggati is Slow man ☠️🔥💯
Omg 2300 hp lol. Geez us
This new electric motor is more power dense than what Rimac and what Tesla offers. 800 hp compact electric motor is absolutely insane... but koenigsegg remains humble. How ? I'd be talking so much trash that I'd make Tesla and Rimac invent science fiction technology to shut me up.
Lol lemme guess......theyre already sold out
Sounds amazing. Can’t wait till it comes out. Hopefully I’ll get to see one in real life lol.
When you have no competition
These cars cannot put the power down and are actually beaten by baseline porsche from start. Waste of money
Wanna do it for friends and family! ♥️
Am I the only one who loved it until seeing it was a 4 seater?
It's almost hard to believe but they keep doing the impossible project after project so I believe it
I won't be surprised if they started making space ships
The future is here baby🎉🎉
Christian is the mad scientist of the hypercar industry, the merchant of speed, and he just gone insane!
Koenigsegg just accelerates away from any competitor.
❤️👏🏻
Jebany, jest genialnym przykładem powiedzenia "jeśli uważasz że coś jest niemożliwe to nie przeszkadzaj osobie która właśnie to robi"
This is the most desirable car in the world to me, an ultimate performance vehicle that can be used as a real car, cross country road trip in a 2300bhp car, amazing
Mind blown
Craziest thing is, this is a 2300hp 4 seater and it will sound like the Jesko. Insane
As a die hard Koenigsegg fan, this video had my jaw dropped at ever moment. I don’t think any company will ever put out something that’s as impressive, elegant, and beautiful as a Koenigsegg. Never fails to amaze me.
And suddenly, no one cares about all these Rimacs anymore.
The only compromise is the price
Simps ask “What’s the color of your Bugatti?”  Super-Sigma-Mega-Top-G- Chads ask “What’s the color of your Koenigsegg?”
Europe as always building the most impressive cars in the world. Nothing new.
That is passion right there... Not over the top, not forced.  The way he goes on and on... Even the special mention of cupholders and how impressed he is of them. Great one
You guys!!!!!!  Just destroyed every car company
I love bugatti but the innovation of this company is absolutely astonishing 😮 bro like how
The most impressive carbrand ever.
i saw a preproduction model in newport beach at a car show a few years ago. insane
THIS JUST CREATED AN ENTIRE NEW CAR CATEGORY. 'MEGACAR'. That sound🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah that 2000hp ev isn’t the worlds fastest accelerating car anymore 1500 hp twin turbo v8 plus an 800 hp electric motor it doesn’t stand an chance 😝😝
In other words they just destroyed the other supercar company with this new koenigsegg gemera
Check mate!!!!!!! Game over
This is history
Someone has either been fired or hired at Bugatti after this video 😂 they must be thinking their R&D is slacking
Please please please be in the new forza 😢😢 it’s the only way I’ll get close!
This is the no-expensive-spared, pinnacle of current automotive technology. It’s mind-blowing. Bugatti, Lamborghini and Porsche are just fancy VWs and Ferraris share parts with Fiat and Dodge and all of them are really just marketing to sell merchandise and SUVs but Koenigsegg is pushing the technological envelope because he is passionate about engineering.
You guys seriously did not have to provide us a glimpse of TWO unique gearbox & drivetrains for ONE vehicle, like calm down.
I just get ready from saving up, but working at Circle K to buy one of these and then come up with a better one so that’s another 15 years Slaven at Circle K to get a better model and then… I do it again
I would have loved to be in the room of the men who designed the power train of this vehicle, the headache would be soo worth it
He literally destroyed every other supercar on this earth yet my guy said “2300 hp” like it’s nothing with no excitement and all 💀 He’s even more excited about the cup holder that could heat/frozen the cups 🤣
Thank goodness this car isn’t fully electric
2300hp in a family car 🔥🔥🔥
Completely speechless after watching this...
:O
Why are they not in F1?
Lol most cars are 1400kg eith about ten times less power. Amazing he can get sll that power under 2000kg
What I like about this guy i that he always achieves the impossible, he all should learn from him (including Elon and co.)
he's a master salesman
He just has fun, absolutely amazing, he does what we all would do “what if” “can it happen?” Just exploring
I would marry this car
Ultrawide 21:9 Thank you.
I'll never even see one,but I'd own it !
this is seriously going to be one of the greatest vehicles of all time. complete marvel of a car.
Can it fit 4,  6 foot 4 grown men
it's a crime to fit so much in a single car, it's just mind boggling 🤯
YESSSSSSS
Wow! Just Wow! I wish I had the money or even a friend you could afford this!😢😂
Why did they have to make it so ugly though
I know for certain there will be another new type of Gearbox after the LSTT, like this is ridiculous (in a good way).
Absolutely mind blowing. I can see them developing an SUV from this platform.
OMG!
he is like bald Johnny Sins but in car industry 🤣🤣🤣
A work of art!
They should start building space craft
Can't anybody be original anymore or have we reached the pinnacle? Because this is basically a mid engine supra.
To much talking, I want to see the car in action sliding around the curves at 90 plus mph, hiting the straightaways doing 200mph plus if it can!! There are other cars out there that can do that and more hint ** FERRARI **among others.  Until then not interested.
FINALLY
Imagine if you could have your cake and eat it too?   Koenigsegg: höld miên stein
Quite simply, the Best car in the World!
You've hacked the game.. congratulations!
Thats the most beautiful green ever 🇸🇪
if i was to bet on any company to make a spaceship think Koenigseggs the one. Like how is all this possible in just one car like WOW!
Koenigsegg is basically telling the other hypercar manufacturers « you will never catch up to us and we will prove it ». Guess what, they are right!
He deserves this camera angle and the clothing he chose. If he is to be, and is, an innovator in automobile industry, then he is a god-like figure in the segment.
All the brands be fighting each other while keonigsegg just fly past, keonigsegg will be remembered for the innovation in engineering and absolute wonders they have brought to market
Never seen someone more excited about cupholders lmao. Dude is an absolute Chad and a legend. Car is AMAZING
Someone was pushing 2600hp from their BARRA.
They made need to invent a new type of rubber to grip this car to the pavement. This is amazing.
Donut media is gonna have a field day with this
Who is gamera...why is gamera
Imagine the Gemera systems mixed with the telsa semi..
Andrew Tate has joined the chat.
finnaly a good daily driver car.
this is a history 🔥
Koenigsegg is one word away from “Flux Capacitor”.  If anyone is going back to the future, these guys will be first…
You need to make a super car that's around 400K or less to compete with all other brands and to dominate them if you can.
omfggggggggg
So fast it blows your hair off.
Childeren never gonna be late to school now
I need to win the lottery, I have to have one!
$5 says this is why The Stradman went to Sweden!
Somehow this can’t be possible. I mean wtf??? HOW? 4 seater including luggage, over 2000hp, less than 2t and so small and beautiful… This is absolutely, without no doubt, the craziest car in the world!
Now it would seem we need a Jesko Extreme with this drive train and ultra low weight with no frills
To be real here, no other car company can get better than this. What else could you possibly want if the Gamera is not enough? You cannot compete with Koenigsegg
Take my 5 dollars lol
This is THE Car
2.300 HORSE POWER AND ITS 4 SITER??!!
Endlevel
So 3 million dollars? For a daily? 😂
Science fiction
No one asked but we did it 😂
God, I've loved the Gemera since the concepts pictures. Please bring this to FH5 🙏
Dislike doesnt show how and what is inside. Its not supposed to be a review but a reveal
Finally, a perfect daily driver
This company is the embodiment of engineering.
wowo a 4 seater but wont show the seats I wonder why.....
Nikola Tesla of motorcars.
Now thats a car!!
I want one❤
I have a kidney to offer
This is wild, this it ground breaking rn!
He is amazing the age he was on his first car CRAZY !!!
I will get my secretary to get in touch with you guys soon about ordering 1 as my daily driver.
But it's just a car. How is it better than my camry?
I feel like Cristian is just trolling the auto industry big wigs. What a guy and what a company. They never fail to impress.
so is it faster than tesla s plaid?
Everyone is saving for this car now. And they know it
Why do they call these cars mid-engine? It's as much mid-engine as Toyota Corolla.
I have always loved you KOENIGSEGG if ihave a choice between your car and all of the cars in the world i will still choose you😍
If you’re spending that much on a car who is going to buy the poor version? 😂😂😂
O melhor de todos os tempos 👏🙌
Engineering at its finest 🎉
Nobody does what Koenigsegg does. Period. Wow.
The family needs a car like this
This car is insane. If I am ever able to snag one. I'd love to have you autograph it.
The car looks like it was designed 15 years ago
I’m mind blown
My absolute dreamcar!
Egg is the Apple of hypercars
6:04 I am gonna crap my pants now😰
so, you could technically swap this into a 90 honda civic right?
Theres really no excuse now for any other manufacturers. This machine has it all.
Yeah this is surely an engineering feat but the car tries achieve too much, sometimes less is more
I feel like Koenigsegg could build a house with 1.400 horse power.
Did they just make the best car ever made? Holy fuck it’s perfect 🔥
Bro ended supercars industry ❤️‍🔥🔥🤣it’s a work of art and the car of the decade it’s like he discovered a cure for cancer broo
Can't believe after listening also everything he says seems impossible but that is the true master piece of art and engineering
Simply wow
vroom vroom
With what they've done here..... i think everyone else should just close shop.   This is just pure insanity......  And from a country known for beinf sensible 😂😂
Wow...
When asked why he made it.... he simply stated, "because I could"  His etho was the whole family should be in on tge dun too.  He's a bloody legend.
Out of the world. Unbelievable
Wtf 2300 hp? on  a four seater?
A sociedade não esta entendendo...    Best engineering ever
This isn’t a car, this is a fucking space shuttle
sheeeit! really mindblowing
I wonder if that can beat most of existing supercars beeing in reverse gear? Good idea for video isn't it?
all i can say is WOW ,,, move over german car makers and everyone elce.
All this technology but they cant produce a decent lap time around Nurburgring.. that should be their next goal.
Koenigsegg forever
I think this is absolutely the most mazing production car ever made when you consider how powerful, beautiful, and yet well rounded it is.
For the Dad that has everything haha.
Destroy everyone 🥵🔥
Pls pls buy an F1 Team
I could kiss his bald head
Bro is presenting the best car possible as it was a regular one 💀. That is by far the best a car can be and the idea to put in the V8 is mind blowing.
Of course I'll never own one of these, so I'm not sure why I am so excited that it exists.  Cannot wait to see a Gemera with 4 passengers passing Ferraris on a track.
Better than Nevera
i see shades of miura from the profile
…a very expensive copy of the Porsche Panamera concept.
Price 😅  i will Buy Lamborghini in same Price😅
Meh...
Mercedes F1 needs to partner with this company
WOW 🤩 Christian and his team has done it AGAIN!
I don't even have any words to describe how impressed I am
God bless Christian von Koenigsegg and all the people who work for him.
This man is a time traveler bringing us nothing but future tech!. 2023 wasn’t ready for this 😅
I love Koenigsegg, I just love it.
I prefer BMW
man what the fuck
how is this even possible. mind boggling
Damn Koenigsegg Took Next Level! 🤯
Another car I will never be able to afford. Perfect
Simply when others try to get into space. He is near boundries of "Where no man has gone before".
Koenigsegg is a company that does right move after right move 💪 if you start a company, be like them
Can just appreciate what we are experiencing. Outstanding evolution in technology.  Wow 👏🏾
If this isnt the most passionate brand with the maddest of scientists in the entire automotive industry then i dont know anymore. This is a masterpiece.
Where's the sound?
Koenigsegg, what the fuck you guys are absolutely mental! Best car company of my time man, holy shit
Przemiły Łysy Szwed ponownien zmienia świat Hyper Cars 😁
Just 2300 hp
The one car I’d want for life.  V8 version of course. Can't imagine spending 7 figures on a 3 cylinder
I love Swedes, I work closely together with them for more then 20 years now. Partnering with them and developing with them is fun and everything is about thinking outside of the box.
Bugatti ain’t got nothing on koenigsegg
Man, I love Koenigsegg. Every car they create is a work of art and genius.
Top speed plz
What is the price?
Unbelievable 😳🫡
Sick car! So a future koenigsegg EV could be a Rimackiller. Four ”dark matter” e-motors, one on each wheel, 3200hp 🥹
So, now they're "megacars". What's next? The "ultracar"?
This is what you call genius
2300hp in a production car. Koenigsegg is really blowing the competition out of the water.
Those numbers with 4 seating capacity 🤯🤯
I would literally leave everything to work with you guys. What a dream of a car!!
What happens when you give engineers unlimited resources and ask them to make the craziest shit
My future car!! I loved this car before anyone else knew about it. I knew it would be the Holy Grail of cars
I'm all for innovation, but frankly this horsepower war is getting old. Where on earth can you even drive this thing besides a circuit? On normal roads you'd only be able to exploit around 20% of its potential. It would have been more impressive to me if he figured out how to make a car that weighs less than 1000kg that can carry 4 people and make around 800hp instead of this.
So happy for the six people who get to enjoy the Gemera
I just creamed my 👖 🥴
Out of all the recent hypercars I've seen, this is The One!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Engeneering team: sir, how much power do we need in the Gemera?  Christian: yes.
THE GEMERA a car that has it all from speed, power, comfort, practicality, looks, aerodynamics and even technology. THE GEMERA is both  a mechanically marvel with it's  Dark Matter e-motor as well as  light speed turbulon transmission or [lstt] and work of art, plus magic heated or chilled cup holders. In love with her I would love to own one but that won't happen sadly. Christian von Koenigsegg/Koenigsegg team thank u and keep making mind blowing vehicles 😘
Nice i am excited but kinda useless, tremendous amount of money and for sure that every car is already booked..
All specs aside. Total of 8 cupholders? That must be some kind of record for hypercars. Like there are minivans and mpv´s that have less cupholders than this.
Koenigsegg is a fantastic car maker.
F... unbelievable
Let him cook
Wait so are they offering two versions s 3cyl and a V8? Or only the V8?
Nah, this Is beyond mental 😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
can you get a Wave Motion gun as an option ?
Take notes other car manufacturers
I get these cars are super expensive but damn these cars deserve way more hype than bugatti
Love this family based car
Ik his name is Cvk but still who is this guy !? And Cup holders 🫡
You guys are insane.
koeniggsegg is KING !!!!!!
Wicked 💪🏻💪🏻👍👍
how the fuck is all this thing fited in that car, mind blown
They did it again 🥹
Mind-blowing ❤
Looks like a dodge viper and astin Martin had a baby.
2300 Hp on a 4 sitter car 💀
Koenigsegg is the new Ferrari 💯
My dream car
La voiture et top mais Christian tu t'ai un peut laisser aller là ça sert à rien d'enlever du poids dans la voiture si c'est toi qui le prend  Aller prise de masse Christian pour la prochaine annonce
oh and it goes for 5 million$
Am I dreaming...or did I really just see history being made..? Holy crap!!
And people get excited in  apple events 😂..
The Name 🐐 Koenigsegg 💯
I know how Koenigsegg's thing is making hypercars that push the limits on what automotive tech can accomplish, but...  can ya'll make something for the common man? Like your take on a Corolla, just a small efficient hatchback in RWD with like a 0.6L i3 engine that makes like 200hp but weighs like 800lbs? Like pushing auto tech but in the other direction as well? Something almost silly?
I will enjoy the Gemera… on all car review channels.
2300hp!!!
never full screened a video so fast
Okay! What! Damn
If cocaine was a car manufacturer
I must say, 2300HP is a bit more than my car has 😅😂
This is awesome for automotive world
The transmission alone is one of the most incredible feats of engineering ive seen
Lol the world's most powerful 4 door megacar
So when Aston Martin said the new DB12 was the first super tourer...Mr Koenigsegg be like "lul hold my *insert sweedish alcoholic beverage here* here's the first hyper tourer". This honestly looks insane, what a mega piece of engineering.
These motors are a step backwards. They are not the most torque dense when you consider the rpm. 600kw and it will put the same torque to the wheels as a model 3 performance that uses less than 400kw
How is any of this possible?? Are they getting consultants from Hogwartz?
Many companies claim to push the edge of car technology. Koenigsegg IS the edge...
Christian:2300hp for family car sound good
You guys are incredible.  What a BEAUTIFUL car. It's not even a car, it's a piece of engineering ART. GREAT work!
Missed opportunity to call it ''Ennumera'' properly spelt Ännu mera and it means *even more* in swedish.
This is an amazing car. Wow!
If the company gives me one for free...I am not able to do maintenance for it 😂
You guys are way ahead of any hyper car manufacturer's keep going guys 👏
Do peolple realize that.. Koenigsegg just obliterated everything in the hypercar scene? This is fucking INSANE.
Song name at 1:08?
im poor
Bugatti killer !!
One man these cars so good but so expensive but one day will get one haha
this car is crazy 😱 best car manufacturer ever !
Heroes at Koenigsegg. Genius Leader with Christian. I wish to own one in my humble life, but I must say i enjoy just the tech around all of it. <3
who in the right mind make a 2300 hp with 2800 nm of torque family sedan 💀
So basically you're saying F you to all other so called hyper cars 🤦 this company will enter history for ever 👍❤️❤️🫵👌👏
That's just incredible. Can't wait to see what Bugatti is gonna do now
Bugatti Bolide: *Left the Chat* SSC Tuatara: *Left the Chat* Hennessey Venom F5: *Leave the Chat* Aspark Owl and Rimac Nevera: *Leave the Chat* Koenigsegg Gemera with V8 Engine plus Electric Motor = 2300hp is the KING!
torque tubes are nightmares, Chevrolet tried this & the couplers have never held up to regular use  (I have a Z06)  & the transmissions & flywheels have never liked torque tubes also, von could we go more in depth as to what is different engineering wise
How could I possibly enjoy this car with 3 other people ?
My God, I expected amazing with this car, but this is entirely beyond that…. Astonishing, Mindblowing, a Masterpiece of Engineering.  Just Wow 🤯
Can the boundaries be pushed even more?  Christian and the Ghost squad engineers: hold our coffee cups! 😂😂😂
This is literally unfair 😂😂😂 I love it🔥🔥🔥
I’m currently working on something that may put me in the position to buy these cars. I’m coming for them all no matter the budget.
Is this the reason, strad is in sweden?
Its insane❤️❤️❤️
Is it legal, fuk
where is a "freevalve" engine?
Stance it.
i think it looks great, and in person too because i saw it at a koenigsegg dealership in 2021 along with the jesko absolut
Once again, they came, they saw they conquered.
They even named the car parts in a cool way dark matter that is such a sick name
Legitimately afraid of this guy, cannot bet against him or Koenigsegg, ever.
Imagine Elon Musk and Christian von koenigsegg working together. Whats next then 😆😄
Did I just heard 2300 hp ? 😮
Can I buy this from eBay?
Unbelievable!!!!
Ich schätze zwischen dem heiß kalt Getränkehalter ist einfach ein Peltierelement eingebaut.. eigentlich nix besonderes. Aber schön wie er sich selbst darüber freut. Ich persönlich finde es im Vergleich zu den Leistungsdaten vernachlässigbar. Beim Beschleunigen mit 2300 PS vermischen sich dann wieder der kalte Milchschake und heiße Kaffe auf der Rücksitzlehne.
He is talking so calmly about this 2350 hp machine 🙂
The Agera WAS my favourite Keonigsegg
If they make a full ev with 4 dark matters it would have 3400 hp
I want to see a closer look on those rear brakes - those look gnarly!
Top 3 best car brands
At this point, Koenigsegg was the only sole car manufacturers in the world to make pure ev car irrelevant
Ellerinize sağlık,bundan iyisi şam da kaysı,mühendis arkadaşları kutluyorum.
I was waiting for interior view too 🫠
KOENIGSEGG IS AHEAD OF TIME.
3 cylinders is still fast
This car is just too awesome
How is he able to control his excitement talking about demolishing all competitors. Absolute badass!
0-100 in how many sec? 😂😂
WHAT İS THAAAAAAAT
Cool👍🏻
The real definition of "Thinking Out Of The Box" 💯💯
gottlos krank
Even if the automotive industry doesn't want to give koenigsegg it's flowers, there's no denying the innovation and the creation of some magnificent cars. I hope I can eventually own one
That car gives every other super- & hypercar company a good night kiss with blanket 😅
Koenigsegg is synonym of inovation
Just different
Remember peak Steve Jobs era Apple? This company is the automotive equivalent.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT FREEVALE???
Hope the power train is reliable. Lots of new tech to go wrong. Amazing car and company. Packaging so much into such a small space.
Hand down Koenigsegg just won the title of the greatest car manufacturer in history , making a 4 seater with this kind of specs is out of imagination 👏 bravo
You could easily think that it's all been done in the world of extreme performance cars. Then Koenigsegg develop this. The innovation is completely next level.
I'm just speechless. One day i will own one of your cars!
This car DESTROY others car companies! This is insane!
First it was the video about your industry changing gearbox, now this. You absolutely won me over, your excitement about what you create is contagious
It’s godly
It’s a Porsche Caymen in the back an an Mclaren in the front lol
Chrsitian Von Koenigsegg's engineering is something else!
It’s quite funny now Koenigsegg Have something Bugatti doesn’t have a four seater car. Now can Koenigsegg brag all they want even if Bugatti and Koenigsegg Are on the same level in luxury But one thing I like about Koenigsegg they doesn’t brag about there cars
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
They just singlehandedly destroyed the supercar category. This is a BEAST. GOODNIGHT.
The side mirror cameras got removed That was a shame, but rules are rules and laws are laws
It's truly an engineering madness 😮...
This is a gamechanger, like this thing is work of engineering, art and practicallity while being a hypercar amazing.
Koenigsegg is by far one of the most innovative hypercars brands on the planet. Salut to christian von koenigsegg for making another marvel of technology
1:45 4 people* 🤓
Those rear calipers look bigger than the rims on my civic 😅
may i get the drink-holders without the car?
What if they make an F1 car ?
Don't care what anyone says, koenigsegg is the only car manufacture actually pushing technology forward. Until they came on the scene all car manufactures were intentionally drip feeding tech and BS-ing us with "that's the best we can do". Really love seeing everything they do. Even if I can only dream of having one.
Other family cars: ☝️🤓 Koenigsegg family car: 😈👻
wow, I am just 2 weeks to late because I was in the market for a Gemera. BUT unfortunately we just bought another Hybrid. Perhaps trade in the Fiat Panda Hybrid over three years.
Build a solo seat track car with a tilting/ leaning cockpit. I notice when I corner hard on a motorcycle I don't feel any lateral G force because it's compensated with the leaning.  But cornering in a car it feels like you're getting ripped out of the seat sideways.  It would be revolutionary to bring that sport bike/ fighter jet feel to a track car!
Definitely going to buy the v8 version 🥲
WooooooooooooooooW
Looks like Porsche
All nice and good, but can i get one pls
This will be another masterpiece! No one can build cars as this company does it!
it literally looks like the porsche taycaan
Gemera, the hypercar for the family
If only i had the cash...😢
At last a family car that I can't afford
I've never been more scared of a price reveal than now. I WANT ONE.
2300hp 4 seater 🙌😂
This is what I imagine the future looks like finally a hyper car that makes the blood boil without any compromise.
The best thing about Cristian is that he never stutters when explaining any of his cars.
a 2000+hp family car with a 1000km range  wow
Yeah.... i gotta get it 😂
2300 HP 😧😱😵‍💫🤯.   What really ….. wow guys .
Koenigsegg just casually fu*king with the industry
BRO WHAT😳
Utter genius... How is this even possible? This incredible!
This is ridiculous
Pioneers. Well done!
I love Koenigsegg and Christian, support theeir work, but seriously, all i could say was WHAT THE F all the time, it´s AMAZING.
What did he say? 2300 HP ?!
Oh come on, what's the bullshit!!!😁
This is my ultimate dream car. It has monstrous performance and stunning beauty without sacrificing the comfort, space and practicality. An absolute perfection.
thank you for not going fully electric
Impressive
Just amazed by how he's listing all that and I'm trying to calculate where he fits all that just amazing
Awesome, well done!👊💥
What is the price with the V8 ?
Whoa! 😮
These guys are more innovative than the F1 cars...Im serious, they actually do the hard work of innovating things to work for everyday production and use..
Love it
Imagine looking at a car with 1400 hp, and thinking to yourself, “ehhh, not enough”
I new that they where hinan present something big that day. But this. I mens come on guys. It's outrages. Bugatti has to pull something big out of the bag if they wanna compete now
but why compromise on the original concept wheels...they were perfect..but still...amazing car
But can it fly?
I read somewhere that the V8 upgrade will cost an additional $400K.
This is the pinnacle of engineering! Koenigsegg at its best!
This is awesome
I knew there was no way this thing would have a 3cylinder
Work of art this car is and my man made a v8 version of this car just wow
Dominic torreto's favourite car
Lamborghini slapped a lambo badge on an audi suv  Ferrari slapped a v12 and a ferrari badge in a mazda  Koenigsegg reinvented science and logic to bring the family along with no compromise. What a car.
Bugatti just better
The only company Koenigsegg is competing with is Koenigsegg itself
so it is non combi audi rs6 that looks better and is much faster? :o
Does the 2300 hp variant also have 100L tank? Or is that only on the 3cyl engine variant
It becomes part of my dream car collection which is my dream garage
Now you can Uber with it.. Great !
no one will even touch the 3 cyl engine option
Wow 4 seater and 4 luggage. I like it, so practical.
He is so calm, showing us the greatest car ever built. 🤯😳🤣 If you're rich and you dont have this car, what are you living for.
I'll take 10 lol.
yes please
Why don't we mass produce things like this?
Global warming pfffft
How sad that most of these cars will vanish deep in some collectors' garages and never be driven on real roads.
Now this is what I call innovation
Чуть меньше, чем похер. Машина, которую 99,9999% жителей Земли никогда не смогут себе позволить.
Dominic Toretto is proud of this. Family first 👊
Once in a great while, Aliens send representatives here to help ease us into new technologies in order to save us from ourselves. DaVinci was one. Christian is our very own well-spoken Alien.
Just unbeliavable! They are simply re-writing the rules and looking at the future
With that power, this car has ability to send the whole family to heaven in just seconds.
NEXT LEVEL!!!!!! wowz
Wtf dude how this is posible and even more how these people thought that the v8 could be in the gemera  The fucking best brand of cars
Gemera sounds like beast
Never fails to amaze me literally 🔥🔥🔥🔥.
😍😍🥇
It's so nice of Koenigsegg to remind me every once in a while that no matter how successful I am in life, I will never be successful enough to own one of their cars! Very thoughtful!
❤
No words are enough to talk about how amazing this piece of art is... I am super excited about how the technology is advancing and now as I am writing this comment I realize that if I am fortunate I might get to see one in person... lolz can only dream of driving one ever... oh wait.... can't wait for it to drop in Forza.... lolz...   But seriously, is Mr.Koenigsegg from this planet, or does he have actual alien tech....?
That's why she's the goat ♑
*the Dark Matter huh*
The only problem I see is that Koenigsegg have spent time developing this amazing game changing 3-CYL with ‘free-valve’ tech and what not only for their existing V8 to take all the limelight thanks to the gargantuan power figures it outputs. I do hope some of the customers choose the cheaper 3-CYL because it’s an engine I would like to see more of (not to say that Koenigseggs traditional V8 isn’t exciting, especially with this new HV8 configuration - but I also want to see Koenigseggs all new engine get time in the spotlight too). Either way, what a fantastic car!
Was waiting for the production model to drop
Wow, Koenigsegg is truly a years ahead of the competition
I have ever dreamed of a Koenigsegg since I was 4-5 years old
That's a nice family car
Christian and the team are at the forefront of car innovation and will soon be supplying others
This is going to sound weird. I got goosebumps when he explained the innovations. I don’t even know what to say anymore. This man and his team are geniuses. Amazing.
KOENIGSEGG is always on top for producing the most powerful first " " supercar things in the world. If it's from Koenigsegg, we shouldn't shock hearing "it's the world's first ever produced...". But still It's just UNBELIEVABLE what they've done with the new Gemera. It can beat the most of the fastest 2 seater supercars in the world even after being a 4 seater. A 2300 HP 4 seater... This is an absolute beast. It's a magic done by Koenigsegg. Still Unbelievable🫨😮hats off 🤩🤩. Love Koenigsegg ♥️🫡
*Just imagine the day someone like Akira Nakai San getting a hold of these beautiful works of art and making infamous RWB Koenigsegg versions* 🤯🤯
What in the hell. This is unbelievable. Only Chris and his crew would get this done. This is mind boggling. I can’t even. These are engineering marvel.
this is introducing the Gemera and, out of everything in the car (besides drivetrain), he focuses on the cupholders 😂
Wish I could own one.
Wow 👏🏽👏🏽
*3:54** All I could about was the flux capacitor* 😂😂😂
I just want the cup holders. Beautiful work of art. Normally not a fan of green but on this one it works.
I hope this is the 2024 exotic car from lego technic. It’s the only way I’ll ever be able to own one.
2300HP inside the DM´s
The base version has only 1400hp and thats disappointing!
Guy is an absolute genius, hats off!
This is madness in great colour.
this is amazing
Wow.......absolutely drop dead gorgeous. There are too many superlatives to mention on how good this car looks.
40-50 years to late, now purchase it put it in a garage and never start the engine! If its done this way, 2 thumbs up! But still a wast of resources!
2300hp wow
Thats why Stradman went there
Hyper car, family car, just sicj
They beat rimac record in a flinch my god. I thought rimac record will stay for atleast a year but Koenigsegg has other plans
I’m so certain this is going to make History! 🎉❤
Normally, the concept car will be lighter than the production version, however, Koenigsegg even make this car lighter
mind blowing, but i can't wait to see the next Bugatti Nevera  3000 hp ,4000 nm 500 kmh top speed.
Bro whatttttt 23000 hp 💀😶‍🌫️
On one side we have Koenigsegg pushing their technology to it's absolute limits On the other side we have companies nickel-and-dime their customers to a subscription fee for their heated seats..
Koenigasssssseegggggg
OK, so is this the forbidden vehicle in MENA right now?
I love how they are still so down to earth. Cool company.
babe dw, its a family car
Wow. Just amazing the level of engineering going into this
Rimac is still the one
I have two Koenigsegg already but this one looks freakin awesome
It was just like 8 months ago that this company blew everyone's mind with the CC850, with its manual transmission and retro styling. And now this? Sometimes you lose perspective, but the sheer rate at which they _destroy_ the boundaries of what we thought were possible is mindblowing.
I feel so bad for any mechanics that have to work on this monstrosity
This could very well prove to be THE best car ever made. I bet you this thing is worth, at the very least, 170% of its original value in 20 years
Unbelievable salute to the team❤
I love Gemera sooo much Incredibly beautifuil!!!
The presenter seems to be an expert in many aspects of this car. Who is he?
This seems too good to be true 😂 😂
Definitely my favourite super car / hyper car manufacturer by far . So much innovation insane power levels    . If I was 9 years old again Koenigsegg would be the poster of choice on my bedroom wall .
Unmatched technology they have, the most unique and  practical hypercar, I always wondered there should be a supercar that fit four with luggage and here we go Koenigsegg nailed it
He only made this car after the wife accussed him not spending enough time with the kids
Jacob and co should build a watch that resembles this car
Black hole engeneering😂.
What in the actual fuck.  C’Mon Christian leave some innovation for the others.
Gamera? Does it fly and breath nuclear fire? :D
WOW
wife: "honey we need a family car" me: "gotchu"
next up Koenigseg optimus with 4 seats 3k hp  and you are able to fly it like a jet and overclock it to 6k hp
I can't wait to see this thing scream down a track
Just breathtaking 😍
Did I understand that correctly? ...you can choose if you want it to be rwd, fwd, or all wheel drive? Or did he only talk about the electric engine? Blew my mind. Perhaps its been done before i have no idea
bugatti be like 😡😡😡
Christian should be internationalised. And made to work at space X..
So forget the Tesla Plaid then 😂
Israel is bombing Palestine. Nobody cares about this.
CvK never disappoints 🎉🎉
2350 fucking hp. And you can daily drive the damn thing
Crazy. Absolutely
This company is just on a whole other level in terms of engineering.
I would buy only because of hot and cold cup holders. Otherwise meh.. 😅
Not sure why you made it look like a Aston Martin.... Please bring back the rims and tires you had on the pre production model, and never ever use this green again. Other then that, an amzing enginering achievment and stunning car
The 4 door Devel Honestly all of you outdone this car and congratulations for making into production because this is just mindblowing insanity
i need to see this thing move
straight up fayyerrr! 🔥🔥🔥
You could literally buy 30 2020 Supra’s for 56k each or one of these.   I think I’ll pass. 😂
i wonder who tf would buy 3 cil version
Still ugly as sin!
Great 👍
Our king is back 🔥🔥🔥😍
yeah great company
the most beautiful car on planet earth
I want to hear Doug DeMuro on this one :D
A stupid car only prince’s can afford.
Enjoy the gemera!!!
2 thousand and 300 hundred mother fucking Horse power thats  unbelievable 🤯🤯🔥
Liked to see the interior tho!!
Christian is just a genius. I can’t wait to see this thing run. That 2300hp monster is going to be insane and even the other version is still well into hypercar territory and will destroy a lot of other supercars and hypercars. Amazing.
800hp Dark Matter emotor in a bike, please Cristian
🧘🏾‍♂️😁
I’ve made a four pages long  presentation of the gemera’s powertrain in class last year, yet I still have learnt new things from this video !!  This is astonishing. Peak modern automotive.
❤❤❤❤
I’m wondering if standard vehicle use in the future will be like this
Cannonball size fuel tank, over cannonball style performance. Sell them with a sticker saying no cannonballing allowed, or else... 😜
All I can say is DAAMMMMMMMMMMMMM…..
the back looks like the cayman 718
You Guys are completely crazy. I love it!!! hahaha
Shorter yet a great presentation! ❤️
sorry, but ... that's just too much camera movement ... you and your product have so much presence, it didn't need all that pushing and pulling and tilting and swiveling for support.
This thing isn't a just car, it's a TARDIS!
wtf
We have made contact with Extra terrestrials, it's Koenigsegg !!!
Keonigsegg has never messed up.
thank you
Christian you are a G.O.A.T
wtf
This is the best car company I'm gonna say it
i hope they use that 3 cylinder to make a compact car the koenigsegg way, that would be truly interesting
I don’t get how he can be so calm anyone would scream
So let me get it straight: *revolutionary 2l 3 cyl. TFG* became obsolete... before you started production⁉️ I think you took this _innovation_ thing a little bit too far Cris😜
The cooled and heated cup holders are enough for me to buy this car ❤
I love that the Ghost Squadron logo is still being used.
Piece of art
Can't believe there's a showroom here in Cheltenham where my sister lives (Cheltenham is a Bayside suburb of Melbourne). Couldn't miss the huge logo on the outside of the building. It's in a sort of semi industrial area so it kind of looks out of place for a luxury car brand. Just how many Koenigsegg's are there even in Australia? I don't suspect the number to be more than a dozen or so. EDIT Just googled it and I was way over in my estimation. Apparently there are just 2.
Now this is Innovation
How much for 2?
Looks like a porsche
I am à bugatti guy but this car is so fucking awesome. Good job
I need to change now, Koenigsegg made me too excited. Even tho I probably never would be able to buy one, I'm just happy for an industry and engineering itself.
Golf 4 is a nice car too
Imagine building a car with 3 cylinders in mind and then slapping a V8 in it because why not? 😂 Imagine trying that with a GR Corolla
Kristian is an absolute madman and I love it!
this company is living in 2200’s they are doing impossible things creating something more than a car, the regera, the one, jesko and now this WOW
Hah! Foolish me, expecting a "normal" reveal of an extraordinary car...
Is it sold out already?
It’s amazing to see how far he’s come since the early days and so awesome. Doing what car guys can only dream of, innovating genius technology that’s sure to trickle down and change the the industry for only the better!
Best car company in the world!
i'd love to get one
Bravo, well done team!
Koenigsegg is the dopest hyper/mega car producers
I'm sorry, did he say the car has 2 ENGINES??
What a machine.Soon as I saw the first pictures of this beauty I knew it was game over for the rest.Unbelivable.Truly innovative and truly amazing.Bravo Koenigsegg 👏🏻
😳 they fitted v8 with 100 litre fuel tank on 4 seater car with 4 luggage bags 1 electric motor in size of a 2 seater hyper car?
Man this guy and his team are absolute geniuses
Koenigsegg owns it! nothing more to say! they the best current production car company!
So much power, South Africa can use it to combat loadshedding!
best family car
This guy is Crazy! What other family production car has more than 2000hp!? Great news is that full-families will be entering the shadow realm together 😀 Jokes aside, well done to KOENIGSEGG 👏 FOS maybe?? 👀
Koenigsegg is in an entirely different league......pushing more boundaries than anyone else..... Gemera is my dream car
Koenigsegg pushing the boundaries, like always.
I can't wait for my Gemeras delivery.... i mean for the Lego version
Looking forward to the day of testing performance !
Blah blah blah...
He is an stunning entrepreneur and the company is unique.
RIP Bugatti/Ferrari and name any
the best of all time❤
Just the heated and cooling cup holders is crazy haha
Don't be surprised when Koenigsegg releases the world's first UFO in a few years! This company is from another world!
I am lost for words... This is something like from the movie-world... Allmost unreal. This is why Koenigsegg is THE PINNACLE in the automotive-world! I am so proud to be Swedish!
SUV next please!
I like GEMERA
Mind blowing hyper car I love this koenigsegg
Telling us in a video what this car has is one thing, how about showing us how it goes for real? That's what I want to see.
This is definitely the most powerful supercar, with so many top technologies integrated in extremely limited space!!!! This is SO IMPRESSIVE!!!!
Christian never cease to amaze me. 💯
Only koenigsegg can offer a base model with 1400hp 😅   Its Like a billionaire would say: hmmm school fees are upcoming, i better save money and buy the base model
I am fan of it since 2021
I'm sure it's already sold out, even more so I would buy this car, it's a rare piece I wish they would produce quite a lot of them...
Now I just want you to use a heat energy recovery system, so that you can probably nearly double the power output of the V8 and increase efficiency.
Well this is a seriously dumb car 😂
crazy is the only word to describe this bulky head😂
its hybrid or elctric? awd right?
Just incredible! Please do give us an in depth documentary on this one.
a mega car with surprisingly 4 seats ming blowing family car
Love this guy man ❤
That's fucking insane.. Welcome to the future🎊 Congrats @koenigsegg 👏🏽
Someone please check whether he’s an alien
Ever since that “Need for speed”scene, this car been my favorite 🙌🏾❤️
That drivetrain is some seriously clever packaging. I wonder if the V8 version might have problems with overheating though
❤❤
Always excited to see what they've come up with, only for them to fvcking make 12 of these, sold out before production😂😂😂
truly incredible achievement!
So you build the most badass MEGACAR, and you could have an extra eye too, for separating your cold drinks from hot ones. Interesting decision! 😂😀
Problem is, you can't get hyped for something you'll never be able to afford
Absolutely Mind blowing 🤯
1min in the video, I want one. 5min in the video, I need one. The end of the video, why can't I afford one ? 😅
Love this company but it’s a shame the industry is at a point where you can release a new car 5 years after release if that new car
Mad respect.
Can I get that TFG into my 2013 Abarth 500? 🤣 Man. Christian and everyone at Koenigsegg are absolutely mad and the car world is a better place because of it.
Fking crazy man
My goodness! The innovation just keeps coming from Koenigsegg. Truly mind-blowing stuff!  Shmee150! Where you at? I said when the Gemera was originally introduced that you should sell whatever you had to sell to order one of these. I hope you did...
I have lots of criticisms. My bank account however is looking more at a Nissan Versa 😂.
2300 bhp and 2850 Nm i mean its nuts. Gemera is  gonna beat ass off Nivera in chiron
What happen if I accelerate gemera while cooling milkshake and heating coffee 😂🤔
The Unreal, Realized.
Bugatti has just been bitch slapped
for me its the most beautiful car ever made, I am a huge Porsche fan and for me nothing could have been more beautiful, but that beast is just the new king of beauty
Family friendly hypercar 🤫
I work on cars for a living at ford and see the gt’s quite often and I indulge in a lot of car news and such and always have for years and all the companies slowly lost their little kid in a candy shop just amazed by everything feeling I used to get goosebumps just hearing about all the new technology and used to be so excited and stunned but damn Koenigsegg is just so far ahead now and they give all the excitement back, the wrap around transmission while retaining a 9 speed capability then making a HOT V V8 is just F****** INSANE this company has become my favorite in every way their innovation all while maintaining reliability from everything I see  where McLaren is impressive but lack quality and reliability etc just a league of their own they make all other brands including bugatti rimac etc look like fools and peasant cars I don’t care who you are what they are doing is absolutely incredible
in the first half i was dissapointed that power was reduced from 1900hp to 1400hp... but later this blew my mind away.... one more important thing is that such a system can make the next gen after jesko a super car that goes 550km/h
now imagine if it had the CC850 gated automated manual 💀💀💀 beast
Someone can gift me one? Any oiler ? Thanks
4 full-grown adults as long as two of them are double leg amputees. No way in hell anybody with full-grown legs gets them between the front of the back seat and the rear of the front seat.
I want to see this car on savagegeese.
Good luck finding replacement parts when something goes wrong. I’ll take my Toyota over euro junk any day. Jk this is beautiful. I hope to get to see a gemera one day
This is absolutely mesmerizing! The technology is light years ahead of everyone and although I will likely never see one of these in person, just knowing it exists reignites my love for cars 💕
Thisbis absolutely fucking mind boggling from an engineering perspective. What the fuck? If it wasnt Koenigsegg, i wouldnt believe it. This is incredible!
Okey Koenigsegg u got me Hyped I'm spending my money on the Gemera in the Crew 2
I gotta get rich 😂
Didn't see the 2300hp v8 version coming! Cant wait to see the records being shattered! What a company
I like the second last comment, "For you all to enjoy" I doubt that, only the very wealthiest few will even sit in it let alone own and enjoy one.
Should have been an SUV. 4 seat cars are on the way out.
The name sound like a black girl I dated when I was DL.
Koenigsegg is one of the greatest car makers in the world!!!! The Gemera is an "Amazing Accomplishment!"!!!
They really do be in a different class
Cant wait for carwow to race it in a drag race
You telling me if they do an all electric one with each of these motors in all 4 wheels, they gonna output 3200 horsepower. That’s madness right here
Hell yeah im so excited to never be able to afford this car for the rest of my life. Glad the company made this for the 6 people that could afford it on our 8billion planet
This guy is true car genius!
It'll only cost about 3 million dollars,
This guy is an automotive genius!!
Give me 1 in Viola Pasifae. How much?
I'll take two.
he said Tourbillon? 😲😳😲😳😲
Said it before, saying it again- Koenigsegg is the absolute pinnacle of automotive engineering  I’ve always been impressed with their engineering and manufacturing, they come up with designs and ideas that are better than anyone else. But this is different. This shouldn’t be possible- like I can’t make sense i Of it. 2300 HP in a car which can seat four 6’+ adults comfortably and 100L of gasoline. With instant electric torque. At this weight. With a transmission that can shift from any gear to any gear almost instantly. That revs faster than anything, and gets to 60mph faster than everything. It doesn’t make sense, it’s not even in the same world as anything else that is being made today.
Does this mean the cars without the ghost package can fit 5 carry-ons now that 4 fit in the back?
Bro just casually saying it😅
I was wondering what was taking the customer cars so long to start poping up. Of course Koenigsegg doesn't disappoint and comes bad with an even more impressive version
It's impressive but it's not really a looker to my eye. Prefer the designs of their two seater models.
🏎🔌#Koenigsegg 👏
Christian is the pinnacle of engineers. Absolute genius and amazing, sir.
All billionaires will que for this, still waiting 300mph agera but this one is dope.
Why everyone is presenting like Tim Apple?
I can only ever dream of owning a Gemera, but to witness its existence, which is the pinnacle of automotive excellence, feels like a privilege in itself.
Popularmente conhecido como SUPER TRUNFO
Wow
The Gemera is first of it kind. What a beauty 🎉
Put this powertrain in the Regera and see if it can beat 457kph
Immediately after video ends, Doug DeMuro screams "4 cup holders!!!"
great. another ultra rich person "made" a car. kewl.
😮 two thousand hp less than two tons weighs
That transmission is as complex as a Watch wtf haha. VERY nice!
I love Koenigsegg simply because they're better than most if not all car brands. CvK and his team really outdid themselves with this car. A 2300hp 4 seater? Listen, if Koenigsegg makes a 7 seater SUV thats just as mad as ths thing, I will buy it. After like 40 years
Looks like a weird Porsche
😯
The sheer amount of innovation being done at this one niche car company is astounding. Keep up the incredible work Koenigsegg!
2 тонны 2.4к лошадей, 100 литров бак, бля, пусть она тогда летает
Please add two Dark Matter motors to the front axle of the CC850-DMR ;) - Nevermind two - Add three, one on the crank, and two up front - Ill develop the battery :)
Is Koenigsegg the greatest car company on earth?
@Thetriplefcollection
I'm gonna buy this one day, I promise
50 years from now the Gemera - and its creator - will be epic defining.   Today,  Christian is awesome, period
Now I know why Stradman was in Sweden
It is a shame that manufacturers for mere mortals have given up completely. A BMW M2 is as large as this and weighs 1750kg.
He has the best engineers in the business! No doubt about it..
Absolutely speechless. Can’t even wrap my head around how advanced Koenigsegg’s  engineering chops are
One of my favorite Exotic cars🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those doors are massive. They long for no reason. 😂😂
Peak of automotive innovation
🤯
Mechanics nightmare. However, a work of art!
Koenigsegg is so damn underrated. Noone ever really talks about their cars
Just speculation but the Chiron replacement is supposed to have a V8/Electric motor setup making similar numbers to this. Excited to see what Bugatti Rimac comes up with
Koenigsegg is the GOAT in the hyper car space. Don’t even try and argue.
Congratulations, and here's to the success of the cars! Absolutely mind bending figures and stunning to look at!
The is absolutely the most incredible car of all time. Game over.
What the fuck did I just watch
at this point, it is impossible for us to stop christian koenigsegg becoming lex luthor.
You shouldnt forget this date koenigseg made history
A 26.4 gallon fuel tank!! In a Hyper car, Thats insane!!  Plus you still have the electric to fall back on. UNBELIEVABLE !!! Christian is a GOD. wow just wow.
I don't like driving cars, mainly because of other people on the road, but from an engineering perspective this is absolutely ridiculous. This car is a reminder of what humans are capable when we set our minds to something.
1st it was that insane clutch system.. now it is this fine beautiful machine. 😍
I will sell my child for this car! Any buyers? They have healthy kidneys and liver.......
beautiful choice of colors to present the car
Heh, for me the 3 other seats would mean 3 ppl for me to scare with my driving😂, Mr. von Koenigsegg.
this car is for those with F*** you money buddies
Lost for words :)
Michael Chiklis is that you?! 😂
i dont like the design, im gonna skip this one
They made the production version cooler than the concept. This thing is going to be insane.
🐐
Wow...that is BONKERS! I want one!!!
The engineering involved in this is......erotic.
They raised the bar even higher for the entire automotive industry.
This car is out of this world
Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow!
This is just insane, i lost my words
The Gemera is a mid-engine two-seater car that can fit four full grown-ups without compromising the experience. It took years to figure out how to make this possible, and the production version was presented in 2020. To make it work, the team had to innovate new types of drivetrain, technologies, and design. The car is capable of running in E motor mode on all four wheels simultaneously or on the front or rear axle with full torque vectoring. Additionally, the team created a three cylinder TFG version with 1,400 horsepower and a YESCO V8 engine with 2,300 horsepower and 2,850 Newton meters of torque. The car also has creature comforts and function systems, infotainment systems, and hot and cold cup holders.  Key themes: 1. Innovative drivetrain, technologies, and design 2. High performance engine options 3. Creature comforts and function systems
Thats fuckin bonkers man
Gamera the (turtle) flying car...lol... Koenigsegg my favorite car company..
Thats cool and all but wheres the….F1 Team?
i am speechless and also broke... but if you need some random person to test drive it id be more than happy to XD
Greatest Car ever?
So basically Warp 2 !! 😂🔥🔥🔥
Talk about raising the bar of car design/engineering.
Props to the advertising team or editing team
it's look like aston martin cars 😀 british green
Wtaf 😵‍💫🤯🤯
This is it, we're here...
DEAR GOD! The acceleration of the V8 version is going to be VIOLENT!
If I was rich I choose the 3 cylinder version
Anyone notice how his speech is tho? Next to no “ah” and “ehm”. Amazingly smart man!
Legit king pin vibes
engineering at its finest
I love how Cristian talks about the cup holders with, almost, more excitement than when he talks about the drive train and packaging on this masterpiece of a car.
I got enough money for this bad boy
just wow mind blowing...
That green looks amazing!
Now, if only the big 5 would use their brains and come up with a daily driver that is even 1/4 of these specs...   Ya, I'm not holding my breath either.
The ultimate family hyper car
2300hp 💀
WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST HEAR. THIS CAR IS MAKING HISTORY
Build a revolutionary SUV! I’d love to see what your imagination can inspire.
Well, Christian, you got me at the "Jesko V8". Amazing.
Wow. That's amazing. Great job pushing the industry forward. Maybe one day we will see a Egg for the masses.
I remember this thing being insanely impressive before with just the 3 cylinder plus elec motors, my kaw hit the floor when he said they fit the jesko motor in there and got 2300 HP
did he just said 1400hp 3 cylinders ?💀💀
Dude is such a liar.  He ended with "Enjoy the Gemera". Let's do a class action suit for false advertising.  Who is with me?
Great time to be a billionaire
Weak car
That gearbox and awd system is unbelievable, unbeatable car
Design is quite mid.
Lets see how long it takes doug to get his hands on this car
I love everything about this car, its so innovative.
Amazing. To all the gender studies majors out there: what you’re currently learning is utterly and completely irrelevant to the future of mankind.
this is a cool idea but there is no way its more comfortable ride then a luxury 4 seater, and why would u go 400 kmph with ur family in the car. just get a nice benz which makes it feel like ur floating on air
King pin !!!
nah bro said grown ups
Imagine when all the technology and innovation in this car trickles down to everyday production cars.
heated and cooled cupholders?  nice, I'll take two!
Ok im impressed
Ladies & Gentlemen, that's how it's done...mike drop
Det här är helt otroligt
christan and your team thank you
not to be sating summin bad, but doesn't the back look like a porche ?
mercedes took how long on the one just for this to essentially be a big ol "what if" accidentally producing 2300hp is so funny to me. incredible work & car.
🤯
You guys just invented a time travel machine well done!!!!!!
It's not even electric! 🤣🤣🤣
anbolivovol
Definitely the greatest hypercar manufacturer
2269hp. WTF KOENIGSEGG! You guys are literally making the most powerful street cars anyone could buy. Insane.  Can't wait for the EV-only versions, you guys have a real shot at making the fastest car in the world!
I want to see an all-electric with four of those dark matter bad bois.
Holy crap!
Can't wait to take this car to my 9 to 5. all though I hope it doesn't drink so much, gas prices been high around here lately
This is amazing and all and I hope to catch glimpse of one one day, its a shame that only the richest of the rich get to experience these things...and they won't even drive them. They'll take delivery and put it away....such a shame man. You should make the buyers sign a contract to where they have to put 10,000 kms the year they buy the car
Reaaaaallllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy cooiioooooooooooooooooooooooooiiiiiooioiooiiiiooooiiooooooooooooooooooooooooooool🤦🏻‍♂️❤️❤️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Cringe
🔥🔥🔥
Now all the men have a perfect excuse for why they spent so much money on a car, they did it for the family.
26 gallons is not the larest fuel tank lmao (100L ) my truck had a larger oem fuel tank
If I win the lottery you know what I’m getting first this then a garage 😂😅
Time to sell the house for this baby
Is this the greatest car ever?
If i had all the money in the world, this, is the only car i would need and the only car I would buy.   And of course an old manual car cause i love manual.
I wish i had the moeny because i absolutely need that V8 Version of the Gemera!!!
If I didnt know any better I'd guess it was an Aston Martin launch. What's with the choice of color?
Ima own one of these some day
Just a couple of weeks ago Koenigsegg jesko broke the 0-400 record and now they launched this 4 seater car which has a supercharged V8 jesko engine which gives 1500hp with new 800hp electric engine and its called "THE DARK MATTER"..... Its 2350hp in a 2 ton car.... WTF
Koenigsegg: "We're building a new car, deposit is 3 million, we dont know what we're building or what kind of car. You interested"  Customer: "Take my money"
if i get 10k likes koenigsegg should send me a Gemera
Masterpiece 👌
Drving bom with the fuel tank
look at these  car that i will never own
For this company - idc, I'd be a janitor going to work in a Miata 🗿 living the dream of having the coolest boss. Now to get that dark matter fitted into a Miata...
he also should classified as hyper-man.
this is voice of Mr. Christian von Koeningsegg?
I think there we have JP's new Car xD
Oh my word
And it’s better looking than the prototype, only koenigsegg can do that!
I doubt any of the owners will make use of the 4 seats or the huge luggage space, but i hope at least 1 does.
It really is special that the rest of the world are just barely getting a grasp on a hypercar, and Koenigsegg built a two door, four seat, megacar.  They are creating huge strides in the supercar world.
The specs looks badass
Swedens Pride
can we see speed run and top speed you should name the video ( 2300 hp gemera ) 😂👌 nice
Styling nothing special
When I saw the Gemera for the first time I understood the meaning of : « Dream Car »
Dear Lord.
I hope they do more with that 3 cyl model than just with the gemera, I feel like it could be outshined by the V8 version when 600bhp out of such a small unit is an insane achievement and I hope it doesn’t go to waste. Maybe a small light sports car with just the 3 pot in the future
The minute you drive off. Minus $890,000 in depreciation. By all means buy one today!!
You guys are unreal!
ok good for u ... i was thinking which one of you people who commented here can buy and drive this shit..well when i can not buy something like this well i can imagine some 5000hp car and 4 seater with many more options ... who cares.
This company is doing Art
But can it run Crysis?🤔
7:56 My coffee always enjoys itself when seated beside a milkshake. The milkshake doesn't enjoy it much though...it sweats a lot. I'm glad they fixed this issue
The Gemera V8 2300HP/2850/NM is now, my favourite car in the world ! ! 😎 😁 😀 ! !
Smokey's "Godzilla" vs the gamera in a race please, it must be done
Great one Christian
Koenigsegg is INSANE
Bugatti has 24hr to respond
Mr. Koenigsegg wanted to be humble and didn't make a show from the fact that he has pushed boundaries that were previously thought to be not only unreachable, but practically impossible to see for many car manufacturers. His speech, with all due respect, doesn't do justice to this achievement. I am sure that for the moment, such numbers feel positively surreal and our minds cannot really comprehend such an outrageous amount of power.
This is a game changer!
I'm convinced this car will spin its tyres way all the way to the end of the half mile
600hp 3cyl alone is crazy then you add a dark matter e motor with dumb amount a torque, companies are gunna but these in pickup trucks and pull whatever they want almost
2300hp🤯
So you can technically build an all-electric mega-car? Great video!
Simply Amazing!!! 👏 😃
Koenigsegg is above anyone else. Nothing come close.
Can I get crowdfunding please? I need to buy diapers
Holy Mackeral! The stuff dreams are made of.
The way he talks about overcoming design/engineering challenges, dude thinks he is on the level of curing cancer lol
Interesante
What colour is your Koenigsegg?
Other companies make 100 compromises to get their cars streamlined and cheap to manufacture. You guys just invent and patent 100 new and revolutionary things, just because you can. I just wish you could make a Koenigsegg light, a subbrand where you mass manufacture cars with many but not all innovations for a lot less money for a lot less people. Compromise just a little bit to hit a price point and manufacturing output.
does it have the floating 360 dash cam tho
If you wonder how much it cost, you can’t afford it!
Fatta att precis ha käkat på Max och sedan trycka plattan-i-mattan i denna bil
M I L K S H A K E
that is the ugliest koenigsegg to date. what is it like 50% front wind shield and 50% car?
I wanna two seater version Gemera! With shorter wheelbase, the handling with be incredible!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
AWD and mostly materials that won’t rust… perfect winter family car.
Best car doesn't exist 😂
It's totally insane. This is Engineering at a different level. Koenigsegg just doesn't cease to amaze by their achievements and innovation. Hat off.
Wooooow…..just wow!🤩🤩🤩🤩💯💯💯🤌🤌🤌🤌
It is a pity I could not afford even an oil change on this but hey, that is life.....Next week....I will win the lottery...Next week!
Bin gespannt wenn er bei TopGear OffRoad fährt 😂
I will never been able to drive or own a car like this, but it‘s such a joy to watch & hear this this guy talking. Amazing engineer and visionary. Respect!
I have never been a hypercar fan i guess i just was a megacar fan, can someone give me a small loan of 3 million dollars
It's all great, sure, but... IS THE FLYING BALL CAMERA STILL THERE??
Love how these guys keep innovating like this. I really would like them innovate to the point they make a high volume $30000 to $40000 sports car with a manual transmission that I can afford but I guess they not trying to be in that market lol
I'm watching this like it will ever be a part of my life. Incredible machine though.
The greatest car company of all time
How does all of that fit?!
Porsche Panamera left the chat...
How much for triple cylinder engine version?
Thanks Christian for making such brillant cars!
0-400-0 ?)
anyone remember the quant?
My jaw kept dropping lower and lower... Now I have to go all the way to Australia to pick it up
Bravo Maestro 😍
I would assume wrapping a transmission around a motor would be the result of a crash if it were any other company.  Other groups talk about subverting expectations, but congratulations on making us question everything we had thought a car could be!
Its just perfection, everything, down to the last minor details
2000 horse power, incredible
I almost bought one, then I woke up 😅 in a dream, obviously.
CvK is the star of the show and his cars the babies
If aliens exist, the only thing they would want to come to earth for is surely Gemera
looks like a porsche
Can’t wait for Doug to get his hands on this
HOLY FUCK !! What else can you say !  His engineering is next level!!
I wish that they fit V12 inside not some shit electric engine
You are a man of history
We're only making 15 and you can't buy one
i mostly think koeniggsegg is a bit over the top but this car looks just so elegant and nice
I love your cars and company. I will probably never get myself to wrangle my economy and mentality to pursue myself to get one of these awesome cars, but want to give some advice in advertising (as a fellow swede and advertisement person) a product line. Since you have Mr JWW aboard, let this smooth talker do the intro selling. When he is done, then King Koenigsegg gets passed the olympic lantern and does his magic. Again, love you guys and full force ahead!!!
Heja. Wow. Perfekt presentation trots  - så många siffror och tekniska termer - fakta som talar. En sansad svensk framställning.
This man and his team are decades ahead of anybody else, it's just amazing.
Gemera became the fastest koenigsegg ever produced 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just remove the TFG and replace with dark matter and get 200+ hp. Make the car smaller without comprimising space
Koenigsegg just blows our minds every single time he talks about his car. He is so knowledgeable about his car.
Jesko V8 in the gemera.. 🤯💥
My good friend I cannot wait to purchase such a beautiful piece from you masters
That is a big F__k you to Bugatti 😂😂
They should make an Suv😭🫶🏽
He dedicated his life to his dream. You can see how he is opsessed by bringing his ideas to life, not making money out of them. He is a true artist. I envy that bold motherfucka!!!!
❤
I bet they are sold out already
The only thing the Gemera is missing, is a tow hook. “World’s fastest 0-60 while towing a boat”
ریدم حاجی
This company is light years ahead of the pack. What Sorcery Is This.
Mr. Koenigsegg you are a genius..
Ngl mind blowing 🤯
a whole 2,300 HP?!💀
2300hp...    And I thought the F5's 1815hp alot
Beating "most" 2 seated cars? Which car couldn't be beaten by the Gemera?
Okey.. I need some money..
Pretty amazing...
Seems like the guys at Koenigsegg are the only ones out there trying really hard to invent things from scratch. Really impressive.
only you could do this <3
Bad ass on a different level :) well done Koenigsegg
Am I now on another planet?
Absolutely insane. Love the presentation from the man himself. Well done to all that worked in it, it's a work of art!
Gemera be like" what Bugatti? "
They’ve done it 📸
One day ill get one T_T
Koenigsegg badass holy moly iednrifnfofmddiftmfi
Koennigsegg to Formular 1, is my wildest dream, motorsport is  all they are left with to conquer.
Just wicked!!!!
Imagine spanking everyone in eco mode with this thing 😭😂🤣 also still managing to get 500-700 miles in one tank sheesh lol
And with all this level of engineering and tech awesomeness, these will be sold in very limited numbers and spend all their lives in garages collecting dust going up in value.
Christian Von Koenigsegg is a LEGEND
Did I just hear dark matter lol. This car looks to be obvious wizardry.. nice 👍🏻
Wow just wow
There is the possibility to kill Ferrari with this
Just gonna leave this comment here to remind me to work hard so I can buy this car one day. Inshallah ❤☝🏼
Without a doubt, the most exciting car company on the planet! I’ll take one, along with a matching Jesko with that drivetrain for when i’m alone.
Amazing
what to say; ITS KOENIGSEGG.
Something totally unnecessary 😅
No question its incredible. But surely the term production has to be used loosely. How many are going to be made? I'll be more impressed when there's a few for sale with 10k miles on
Gemera looks and sounds like Nevera
This is why it is my favorite car ever, breaking the limit of other automobile industry is Koenigsegg favorite thing to do  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This power is useless in the real world, where u can go 130 km/h max, absolute joke, no one can use it than just a tiny part in the german autobahn
Imagine how many times this dude have to say "No thanks, mind your own business....have a nice day" when BMW, Audi, Porsche, Ferrari etc. is calling to buy.........
Wow
Christian Von: Enjoy the Gemera Me: 😍 My wallet: 🕺🙅‍♂️
This anouncement makes me daydream of a "what if", Image a jesko R or Jesko RS harvesting the fruites of this technology combination. Just wild. This also why for me Köenigsegg are the automtoive superhero around the block.  Also I love the name of that new E Motor, Who ever came up with the name must have had a really fun time.  P.s. If Koenigsegg is happen to invent a new kind of Turbo, my votes for the name go to "Singularity" or less Scintific "Black Hole"
Absolutely amazing. I love this dude too, perfect leader for this company.
Don’t think I’ve seen a car that literally baffles ya mind as much as this
He got me with the Cupholders.
Never felt prouder to be a Koenigsegg fan.
Mr K! Your crazy, I love it! ❤️
As a cook I would love to visit the factory and meet the team! Koenigsegg have mastered the multi disciplinary approach to making performance art with an ergonomic highly considered feel. ❤
Well done Christian! Now, please can I have one?
Literally rewriting the modern car, fuckin ridiculous, Christian is the genius of he car world
This is mind blowing 😮😮😮
Wooooooow 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Koenigsegg should make a gt3 car to prove how good they really are!
"The production car is always worse than the concept" Koenigsegg:
Why it looks like a re-design Porsche?
Beautiful! (GREAT Colour too...)
When Christian mentioned the Jesko V8 fitting in the Gemera to make 2300hp.........my whole body shock and had goosebumps. Truly amazing what an engineering mastermind and the brilliant team at KOENIGSEGG can achieve.......Respect!!!!!  edit-> grammar
New favourite car. I don't care what anyone says. Koenigsegg for the win. This is an absolute masterpiece in every single way. Even the cup holders 🤣 those cup holders alone are more impressive than most cars
This is car engineering peak. No other company can beat that. I'm speechless
Looks better than their other offerings, IMO
inb4 world record maintenance cost. Cuz, u know, there is a transmission to be removed, just to get to the engine... 😉
I thought the 600hp 3 cylinder was amazing but I wasn't expecting the hot v8 by a long shot
How the fuck have they packaged that? I don't get it.
Just casually Hot-V'ed one of the coolest motors of all time, this is crazy.
Simply unbelivable. You never cease to surprise us Mr. Koeningsegg! Keep up the good work!
Dark matter ⚙️
Oh wow, this is super impressive,  I mean mega hyper impressive.
The more he explains the details the more I’m like ‘WTF’
The engineers at Koenigsegg are the maddest madlads ever.
It's beautiful
This guy is too much! On top of that they fit a 100l fuel tank?🔥🔥🔥
I hate that I can’t get this.
This color is so beautiful. My favorite green color shade. The car is a masterpiece. Great job
Ge mera is swedish for Giv more in english. And you certainly did this time......
Useless
I am completely blown away....... I hope to one day own The Gemera. It is truly awe-inspiring!!!
Crack!
“Four full Grownups”…….well…define “grownup”! 😂
I was always disappointed when I heard they were going with a 3cyl engine... you can boast about all the tech & impressive horse power, but at the end of the day my cave man brain just goes "more cynders.. better" or at the very least when you throw down serious cash on a car, having a big exotic engine feels like it goes hand in hand.  So hearing that you can option for a V8 variant, that.. that's bang on perfect!  Don't get me wrong, never in a million years could I afford something like this... but I am very curious how many they sell of the 3cyl & 8cyl variants.. and of cause the cost difference.  If they hold up reasonably well mechanically... this may end up being the first hybrid to never drop in value..?  Great stuff, I hope I see one someday!
Best car brand in the world
🎉❤
Not even 1% of the current viewer amount can afford one of these :,)
2300hp are you mad! man! your gonna kill everyone! i want one!❤!
Looks like Mercedes AMG ONE
And……..they’re already all sold. 😅
Wish Koenigsegg would go on The Joe Rogan Experience instead of Hennessey
I think it’s fair to say I have a new favorite car. Time to start selling organs I don’t need 🖤✨
If the price is around $60k!! Ill take one!!
Honestly at this point i'm 100% covinced this koenigsegg guy is a time traveller from 100 years in the future with the engineering knowledge of a highly advanced society
Pure awesomeness!
This is always been next level.  Masterpiece of engineering and form.  Congrats to all involved!
just trying to understand on how the Powertrain works just ... melting my brain ... just Koenigsegg things
this should be the safety car at silverstone
@carwow
Never be able to afford one, but still love to see the passion Christian has for cars
I´ll take two please.
Oh this is just down right nasty.
And there's probably no chance that 2300hp version owners will have the opportunity to let those horses free, for this is not a car but w masterpice to be held in a safe place, with as low mileage as possible...
I am impressed. Its a great car
Absolutely incredible and beautiful. I do have one thing i noticed though, the carbon fiber pattern near the exhaust dont run at the same angle from those two pieces of carbon fiber. The ocd in me saw that immediately
Mind blowing 🤯
Incredible, would love to see what it does at the Nürburgring
developing such a useless car...
That's what I call innovation
This is automotive perfection
A million dollar hypercar that can be used as a daily driver.
Looks like a Porsche and a GT-R fused. 70-30
So, how much does it cost?? And, no, I can't afford it... Lol! Super nice though, the engineering is spectacular. Anyone know what the weight distribution is on this car?

👍
"Something we all can experience together" Yet 99.999% of the world will never be able to afford one or drive one or even SEE one on the road.
If i had the Money i would  have bought It
finally, I will buy one tomorrow
I swear this dude is tony stark
League: Mega Sedan Population: 1 Entitiy Identity: Koenigsegg Gemera
wow.
I have a koenigsegg in forza
❤
Christian von Koenigsegg is still the reigning automotive gigachad. The Gemera looks like an absolute monster. Love how it has heated/cooled cup holders. Throwback to the iconic line from the Jesko video: "Cupholders. Cause why not? It should be a practical car."
Now that's a car....!
can’t wait for Mr JWW’s inside look video!!
Software looks like Tesla, and you know what, that’s fucking great. Don’t fix something that ain’t broken.
This is really cool. BUT... I'd love to see Koenigsegg take some of this tech and put it into a much smaller, lighter package.  Something made for real-world driving, and affordable for non-billionaires.
Truly on the cutting edge of technology and what car makers believe is possible. Absolutely insane
Can't wait for the gemera to smash the heck off rimac for the fastest accelerating production. The gemera will obviously hit the quarter mile in sub 1.5secs.
In my opinion, Christian von Koenigsegg is one of the greatest geniuses of our time. Elon Musk, for example, is a business and marketing genius, and most of his success is based on the blind idolization from his fans. But Christian is an engineering genius. He and his company are constantly pushing boundaries and achieving feats that no other manufacturer would even dare to attempt. It's truly impressive!
Koenigsegg IS innovation. Innovation means Koenigsegg. Innovation IS Koenigsegg.
Please give me one!
2300 HP wait what?????
Fun Fact: the Rimac, an electric car worth $300,000 max is priced $700,000 more than this car.
This is the most beautiful car I've ever seen!! Incredible!! 💚
Porsche Taycan
...absoluter Wahnsinn 😅
That V8 version is a game changer 🤯 Who will order/get the 3cyl version now? 😁
god dayum son
Koenigsegg is Number 1 then Bugatti
Why would anyone lucky enough to afford this car choose the 3 cylinder version!!? As far as im concerned, its the hot V8 model or nothing.
damn i want one
❤great again, now i need the money for it, my best producer 👍
Koenigsegg is a joke now wth happened
too much talking
ill take one, thanks :)
Pretty cringe to use an empty stage for a video just to make it look like there's people there. It's like those fake ads that pretend they are on joe rogan podcast.
Did he just say they put the tranny around the dam motor.
V8?? never expected that 😍
insane engineering
I thought I was dreaming that he said they could fit the v8 in the gemera. So I had to watch the video again to make sure it was true😅
"but honey, it has four seats!"
Incredible..❤
The kid: "Daddy...stamp on the gas pedal!"
How to say that you are a humble super geniuses without  saying you are a humble super genius. I am incredible proud to be a swede and a  engineer. This is a example what  happens when you stop copying and starts thinking
Kudos for the hot/cold cupholder   Is it spillproof when you do 0-60 in 2 second?
Incredible , ingenious , absolutely love the colour
Really wanted to see him in the back seat, he's huge 😂
🙌🙌🙌🙌
Best car brand 👌
I feel koenigsegg is now becoming its own identity of pure speed
But the real question is, can you deliver tofu in downhill mountain pass roads meanwhile racing against street racers without breaking the tofu?
This is the car im waiting for and its unbelievable to c it now ❤️👌💪
thai man is mad
Don't have words for this man and his team. Mind boggling stuff in an art like car.
"I'll take stuff I'll never be able to ride in or afford for 100 alex" would be a dream come true to see this car with my own eyes. Would love to know how much the 8 cylinder version will cost... im think 5 million range? Any guesses anyone?
HOW MANY LITERS OF FUEL CAPACITY?!?!
Front end is exactly looking like AMG ONE
The cup holder innovation is probably my favorite part of this car
BTW with the side-by-side heated-or-cooling cup holder  Koenigsegg offers a level of (real) luxury that no other competitor* can match... * like Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Mercedes Maybach, etc.
W koenigsegg
Koenigsegg is literally the only car company in the world doing things way differently than anyone else. To innovate new technology consistently like theyve done over the years is unmatched in any industry!! Great job!!!
Jesus Christus!🤯
Between Koenigsegg making unbelievably fast vehicles that are practical and Pagani making literal ART on wheels! These 2 companies are in a completely different realm than other automakers. My absolute 2 favorite car brands alongside my love for BMWs 😂. Phenomenal work! Can't wait to see these things ripping up the pavement!
Koenigsegg should make F1 cars and should join F1
You guys are so amazining, I want one
how much?
Just Amazing
Christian has surpassed his already formidable lead in cutting edge hypercar technology!  Amazing!  I want one!!
Ultimate daily driveable hypercar platform. I keep asking why more manufacturers aren't doing a hybrid EV-RWD/ICE-FWD for an AWD, the 4 seats are a massive bonus. Christian never disappoints.
This is completely crazy and georgeus...but why those shitty a** screens for the two people in the back...shame on any mfer whoever it is that get the privilege of getting up in that beauty and says..."i feel like watching some trash movie in Netflix instead of enjoying possibly one of the best soprt cars ever made"...
Do a lucky draw, Give someone a giveaway of this fine machine of a car, I DARE YOU 😊
epic
Shoehorned the Jesko’s V8 in to the Gemera! I cannot believe.
So Genera will be the fastest Koenigsegg, not the Jesko?!
Everyone else is just fighting for second place at this point.
Christian Von Koenigsegg is a mad scientist/genius! This man has turned fiction into reality time after time. My deepest/most profound respect to you Sir. May you live forever.
Christian is the Christopher Nolan of the Automotive Industry. Hats off, Koenigsegg!!!
This is insane
The definition of old money
Bro, if the smaller engines numbers weren’t crazy enough. They manage to shove the insanely powerful hot V8 to just absolutely crush and embarrass every other car maker in the game. Can’t wait to see these on the streets.
I would have got one but I’m not crazy about the 4 seats tbh. That’s why I went with my 98 civic
This guy will kill with tech, hat off
watching this with 20$ in my wallet.   and im excited for this car
So you're telling me that there's actually people out there who see a 1400hp car and say: "nah, I want more". Madness. Brillant, but madness.
Stop beating around the bush, make an SUV and make money.
Its not a spacey car, its a spaceship on wheels, completely crazy. Imagine the Roadtrips in this thing.
❤ so much ..to bad i dont have money 4 one 😢..but thats i a have ps for..to dream😅
OMG that electric motor........
My brain hurts after watching this.  This makes every other vehicle seem blehh…it’s times like this where I wish I was a billionaire who could afford this beautiful machine.
Move rear axle about 30 cm forward.
Congrats to the team on bringing this to market!
Nuts.
Skulle det vara möjligt för ett äldre, men stort fan från Köpenhamn att komma förbi? (BEVI)
In Germany we say: Heftiger Eimer !
World Premiere of the Production Version Koenigsegg Gemera at the new Gripen Atelier - the birthplace of each client specification Gemera. Love It.❤
Viking bonkers car 🇸🇪
I really really admire CvK and the whole Koenigsegg team. They always bring something really exciting and amazing technology & features to their cars. 🫡
I can see most people here talking about the numbers as an engineer I am thinking about how they made this happen and I'm still not able to comprehend the packaging of the V8!!!😮😮😮hats off to @Koenigsegg for making this happen.....
It has been mentioned here many times but I love all this reveals by Christian. Another proof, why Koenigsegg is the number 1 engineering breakthrough automotive company on earth. They just pushed again the current limits behind well known borders. Mindblowing. I'm again amazed. Well done Koenigsegg team!
This is my new favorite car, hands down.
Gemera with Jesko are 2 cars I love with all my heart. I'm not much into this kind of cars. More like old classics, but Koenigsegg did absolutely amazing job here.
Just pre-ordered it. Can't wait.
#KNOWDAT🎥✈️💫
what a beautifully unique car.  Curious to see if it can beat my Tesla Model 3 in a race.
This car is perfect. There is no argument.
Swedish engineering, the art of combining innovation with quality!
I want one 🤦🏽‍♂️…
the inside of that car is simply beautiful. amazing work
Good lord can I please have one guys? to advertise the brand around chicago??😅
If you lend me one I will give you a 5 Star review lol 😂😂 🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗
This is crazy.... give us some test driving :O
Dear God it's a masterpiece   Please let the Hv8 gemera come. To forza.  Please. We will worship that car in forza trust me everyone loves Koenigsegg.  We also really need the jesko absolute
Undoubtedly the best car on the world
This guy just broke the car industry... again 😂
Koenigsegg have really outdone themselves with this beauty of a car, Dark matter electric motor is mind boggling straight up future tech and to think they have 1400HP and 2300HP versions makes other car brands look like they are sleeping on job. Well done Koenigsegg 👏👏
Seeing this it feels like other brands are not even trying anymore. 😆🤯
Koenigsegg… Always beyond ahead than any other car maker.
Yeah ....no....im waiting for the faster versions in a couple years before I put my hard earned money down!!
Beautiful, hope the buyers are going to drive it; be a crime not to.
Dear Christian, You're a genious! Biggest fan in Portugal right here!
This is unbelievable. It's an engineering piece of art🔥
Sounds amazing.  I'll take one, wait 2MM, maybe not yet.
Bindblowing 🤯
Why would anyone buy the lesser option if one is loaded with this kinda dough? 😂
Wait, did he just say the Gemera will have a 2,300 hp version?? Wonder what the hp limit is before it becomes pointless to increase hp? "We could never have believed we could achieve this. Its like one thing leading to another" Who but me understands this...
Honestly probably the most innovative vehicle company out there right now.
An absolute BEAST!
Mehhhh.  Does nothing for me since I can't afford it LOL.  I'll stick with my corvette.
Great, another billionaire toy.
Beautiful car
great visuals great writing and great producing
Now its getting a little too close to porche designs , it looks like a porche , even the name sounds carrera , panamera , sorry but not sorry
On my way to sell my house, car, etc.
Of i have the mony i am gonna buy it
Is it only me who was thinking Aston Martin while the ad was playing ?
I'm a fan of Techonology and the thinking hours that went behind this. Just boggles my mind!
Oh ok now I'm convinced, when I saw the article I was like how the heck did they pull that off, I mean how do you put a V8 in such a small space whiles accommodating those electric engines, now I'm blown away, it's nuts
A polícia do Brasil se importa em trabalhar nos carros da minha marca ? A Koenigsegg ? Não estou brincando até porque minha identidade foi revelada
We NEEED a track video!!
Much love to the madlad car company owners like Christian Von Koenigsegg and their design and engineering teams. Mate Rimac has  got some fierce competition.
Koenigsegg is just Stark industries in Real Life
This is what I love about this brand, they are constantly on a whole new level 💪
Look, i’m a real Bugatti Fanboy, but sincerely I have to admit, I have always loved Koenigsegg’s from the beginning and with this Gemera and its out-of-this-world specs 🥵🥵 man o man… this is just science fiction-turned-real. Deep respect for Koenigsegg and their achievements.
So much for supercars, so much for hypercars. This is a megacar.
insane
hey, how your free valve technolgoy is going?
The first think I allways check with new Koenigsegg clips - how many minutes will the pleasure last! Anyone else too?
It's shame this is not a pure EV. ICE vehicles are obsolete. Aston Martin are doing the right thing - teaming up with Lucid. The Lucid Sapphire will be faster and more practical than this ICE vehicle and for a lot less money only $250k.
i'm honestly never going to be able to afford one of these (or even see one with my own eyes irl), but goddamn this car is amazing
This is truly insane, wow
anyone else just find their dream car
This is Unreal....I'm floored..this is technology and it's finest. Truly state of the art. Thank you
Literally they offers 4 seats with enough space in hypercar. A way ahead of competition.  ❤
Hey Bugatti, Take that for a spec sheet. Take your marketing budget with the gemera 🎉
Imagine fixing that transmission 😅
Ok that's absolutely ridiculous. I don't think I can even afford the cupholders.
2300 hp is crazy
An artist. A miracle. A legend.
sound masterization in this video is out of this world.
YOU'RE MY IDOL, CHRISTIAN ❤️❤️❤️ SALUTE TO YOU AND THE WHOLE KOENIGSEGG TEAM ❤️❤️❤️ THIS IS MASTERPIECE
This is what happens when you listen to brilliant engineers and allow them to work magic instead of being held back by the bean counters of other car companies.
No other Swede than Mr Koenigsegg makes me prouder, not even ABBA...
just art
Twok
Bro just imagine the next cars that r coming shit bout to go crazy
Nobody saw it coming. Stuffing their TTV8 in the back of a four-seater, that's just bonkers insane engineering.
Koenigsegg are just on another level
Crap. Its the fastest production car.
This  guy really needs to make cars for the masses! Please!?
1500hp motor plua 800 electric combin3d 2300 hp how is jt not rhe fastest car on earth. It should easily hit 300 mph and 0 to 60 under 1.9
How many will be produced? Are any available? How much?
In the most positive way: what the hell is wrong with you ?  this is truly f***ing amazing!
10 years from now Koenigsegg : "4 seater quantum jet power, hybrid with pump gas, race, and jet fuel maps on ecu"  Now *THIS* is PodRacing
Ah yes, a family car with a bit more "oomph"
@AR12Gaming Coming to FH5?
Looks like a supra
It may be like $2 million, but this car will change everything simply with how much they compacted this engine and battery setup. Carbon fiber helps a lot with weight reduction, but this will change cars.
I think the base model with 1700 hp would probably be enough for my daily usage.  But 2300 hp would be a nice option in case I ever wanted to go fast on weekends
Koeinisegg is just an amazing company! They made me fall in love with the Aggera and now this my goodness
I would like to enjoy the car but I don't have enough money.
Just wow!!
Wait wait wait... I didn't know this would be a production car!
Congratulations to you, sir.  Mind boggling innovations indeed. Salutes to søta-brors Reodor Felgen ^^
Another day being a couple of steps above the rest of human beings, Christian. What a machine.
This has been my favorite car ever since i first laid eyes on it a few years ago.. if i won the lottery this would literally be the very first thing i bought
Excited to see Rimac-Bugatti’s response… Matti need to look at his specs again!😂
I'm calling you when I'll be a gazilioner
Amazing that a small company can do so much.
I can’t even say these numbers and tech involved without laughing…this is too fucking good to be true 🤯
What the fuck did they just make?
We need one at Illuminated Ones!
You have a new rival (Devel) a dubai automaker the Devel sixteen is a car that ways less than 2000 pounds but yet has a 13.2 Liter V16 or V8 option  that makes 5000hp and 6800Nm of torque 0-60 in just 1.80s. This is a new koenigsegg killer beware. This could beat the Jesko Absulot plus its cheaper costs only 1.8millon$ you are not second favourite car brand for nothing because you put speed to speed. You can do better Koenigsegg you can beat that devel for me and for all your fans
My goodness. The amazing became even more amazing. Spectacular would be an understatement.
2300 hp family whip holy shit!😮😮😮😮
Can someone borrow me $1.7 million? I will return after 200 years.
Do you take direct debit payment plans for people with bad credit ??? 🤞 🙏 🙇‍♂️ 🙏 🤞
As a Swede this company is something im rly proud of to have in our country
Wait till I catch up to you big boss
Who is helping thede guys from beyond the ice wall? No way in hell tho i love this brand the best. They are the ones creating this. They arent. The world had electric cars in the 1800s that was taken away and erased from history by ww1 time... They are just re using the tech.  Who is behind that ice wall helping them is my question...i know yall arent the ones who keep coming up with this. Tho i do love you guys for taking credit.
6 phase motor😮😮!!! I only heard of 3 phase motor 😅😅
We See us if I win the eurojackpot
Rolling art. Koenigsegg is in a league if their own!
Mad lad. Fucking love this dude
looks too tame to be a "mega" car, needs to be way more drastic, like a bosozuko version of this car would be appropriate.  very sporty looking tesla I will say
Já vou encomendar o meu agora !!!
Excited to see how the dark matter raxial flux motor work
Now put that dark matter motor into the Jesko Absolut
I want soo much this car in 1/18 scale
Excuse me did he say sports car?
Can I put a car seat in the back? Baby boy wants to ride!
can someone fit this electric motor to a bike?
Yeah......I just drive a 1.3
So, another Hypercar that doesnt look like a Hypercar. Meh.
Koenigsegg should race in WEC
I don't have anywhere near the money to afford one but I want it
I'll take one in  Metallic Amethyst.
Koenigsegg 2:1 Aka The Gemera
what I liked the most is the Hot & Cold cup holders. something I might be able to afford.
Beautiful car koenigsegg now 4 seater
This is fucking revolutionary
He had me at ‘ Dark Matter ‘ 1400 or 2300 never before has anyone been embarrassed to say they ordered the low power version 😂
💪🏼 2300 ps???!!!!!!!!
And we were amazed by 1600hp
What a Mind Blowing Art  excellent work Koenigsegg! 👏
at this point might as well do a fully electric version in the future
What's with the recent trend of manufacturers making new supercars look as ugly as possible.
it seems like this is technically the best car ever
omg a v8
I feel like Koenigsegg and Murray, granted their completely opposite approaches, are the only ones left in this industry capable of creating groundbreaking monsters of technology without relinquishing those basic, visceral feelings every sports car should bring.  I think I'd still have the T50 (in my dreams, of course), but this is very, very, very, very close second.
This is why I am broke. I get so excited about commercials I just buy. I am glad I don't have enough money to have one. 😅😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Koenigsegg is in a different league. Each new model is a realization of what others would consider impossible. I salute Christian and his team.
I’m just happy Christian decides to use his absolute evil-mad-scientist genius level brain for automotive excellency !!! Cause like … that Dark Matter drive unit on its own-is ridiculous!!!🙆🏾‍♂️🫨👌🏾
Ok but does anyone know how to pronounce Koenigsegg? 😂
Looks like Aston Martin and a Porsche had a baby.  Kinda boring for that amount of money.
YES PLEASE!!! 😮 Now with a V8!!😮 YEEESSSS PLEEEASE!!!!😮😮
9:00 The sound produced by its electric motors is simply extraordinary and unmatched.
That’s a gorgeous car but that color really adds to it.
Koenigsegg just kicks the ball out of the park every time they bring a new car😂
If fuck around and find out wss a production car
Rip SS Chiron
ive always thought when they make hyper cars bigger theyll only get faster
Shoutout to Koenigsegg for doin it for the tall homies
Woooow that's incredible
wow -   just wow
Can’t wait to own one! ….on Forza. 😭😭😭
They say 4 full size adults can ride in this. I want to see these guys getting into the car. Video or it isnt real
Here's a production of a car none of you can buy
Wow, I mean... Really Wow. And it looks amazing too!
Goated
Design & innovation peaked! 💯🔥
Out of all Koenigsegg Agera is still my favourite ❤
Bow down to Christian von Koenigsegg and his team of engineers.  The world's best.
It’s confirm that I don’t deserve to breathe the in same air space with you.
Look at him standing there. Now imagine 4 of him in that car. Now imagine it having hypercar performance. That an engineering phenom.
2300 HP. Jesus.......
The cup holder sole me man 😂
love it
😮
💚🙌
this is THE car
This is insane 🔥😮
Well, Koenigsegg keeps dropping the mic… I’d love to know more and see all the details of this beats. Perhaps James will give us that
This car is a truly masterpiece of engineering
To me Koenigsegg are not so much cars, as engineering fairytales. I never get tired of listening to all the new solutions that they have come up with.
Over the years, they will try to implement these amazing engineering concepts in usual cars.
It's time for F1 Christian!
the only car company that ever made me contemplate knocking over a federal reserve bank
Favorite Car Brand ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
These are things I wanted to create when I was going to school to become a mechanical engineer. I wish a company like Honda would pay attention. This is what the NSX could and should be. The current NSX is a joke. Why not use the current Civic Type R drive train. That can easily be tuned to 350hp. Then put on a 150hp electric motor. Instead of a huge lump of a car that was over engineered, you keep the car simple and light. Focus on the driving experience. These modern day engineers need to get out of their own way.
Finally! Now I could buy a sportcar to have three of my friends enjoing the trip. Yep, that is the only reason why I don't have a sportcar.😉
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗿
2300holy pony’s
Soon in Jay Lenos garage
If they do enter F1 then everyone else is just fucked.
La dinguerie !
Christian is a man he thinks he is...
mind-blowing 🤯 🤩🤩
All the specs sound impractical, i can't imagine how the hell they made it possible. This is something unreal. From now on, people can't compare Koenigsegg with any other brand. This is just next level shit 🔥🔥🔥
Ok, so how much are we talking again?
This man single-handedly is saving the combustion engine 🙌🙌🙌
CVK is the new Steve Jobs. Koenigsegg is the new Apple. Every reveal they make is truly stunning and mind blowing. I was not at all expecting two versions of this car - one with a flipping V8 in it. Holy mackerel......
i got 5 dollers
When the owner takes care and not only look to numbers this the result!
my brian just exploded from so much geniousness in the same car... melting right now...damn what a thing...
Incredible.
you can tell the difference between koenigsegg and other car manufacturers Christian really put love and pride in his work 👏
i will chose HV8 version
Less then 1% of the world will ever see one in person let alone ride/drive and hear it in person. I love the idea of these cars, great one for some billionaire stuffing it in some garage never to be seen again. 😂 It's a gorgeous car nonetheless.
Man’s just said 2000 like it’s normal😮😮😮😮
Will this model get permission to be reviewed by car journalists?  How come this brand does not get any official online reviews?
I want to hear it damnit!!!!
Koenigsegg making every hypercar look instantly outdated.
Koenigsegg! I´m almost crying of proudness that you are Swedish. THANK YOU!
i would love to see a coupe or a convertible version of this car
Yep yep I am pretty sure thats a car !
Christian and Elon is just on another level. They are our age geniuses.
Another car that will only be seen in the Arab World.
Damn that is hot.
100l, coffee AND a milkshake... holley cow, where do you sign up to give the kidney?
Finally, a hyper-sedan that's fun for the whole family. Koenigsegg setting industry standards, once again. Mindblowing!
jesus christ,,, mindblowing
Absolutely incredible engineering feat. Unfortunately I might never be able to afford this car tho lol, but if I could I definitely will buy!
Well. Now I just have to figure out how to justify getting to enjoy it.
Here i thought it wouldn't get any crazier than it already is.
Well. Now I just have to figure out how to justify getting to enjoy it.
Amazing next level sh#t
I just want to shake Christians hand and thank him for making such beautiful machines that I know I’ll never be able to afford🔥
Wow a supercar manufacturer that actually creates something innovative, not a copy paste as others
Please buy an F1 team I'll support till I diee
bugatti fanboys be like: bugaty is stil beter!
A brilliant man. One of the top 10 entrepreneurs in the world.
alright when is it gonna be in a forza game
Best
you tellin me they fit a DAMN V8 IN HERE
This might just be the perfect car to ever exist
okay so, best car ever made. Literally.
Bugatti crying in the corner and punching the air. 2300 hp and under 2 tons, 4 people and luggage. Might as well be the second coming of Jesus
if you are a billionaire family guy there is no better car than this on earth.
What is the top speed of this monster 😂😂❤😅
It also has a towing capacity of 30k pounds. Cooks you breakfast and tells your boss to f#%k them selves 😂
Ferrari who?
When a car maker competes itself
If he were to create an F1 team and join, it would be game over for all the teams in there.
By chance, if the guys filming see this, love how you for no reason decided to shoot on vintage anamorphic! 10/10 from me
He did say "offer you all"...now that would be nice!!
ils viennent de détruire la concurrence dans le monde automobile, Bugatti et Pagani pleurent bien fort devant la nouvelle Gemera !
Perfect dream car
I would take the 3 cylinder twin turbo free valve engine and shove it on my GR Yaris or my 1999 GLi Corolla Altis(if the stock AWD Transmission from the Lancer EVO 8 can handle it).
As soon as I hit the lottery, I'm coming for you!!!!!
Bugatti :- I am doing suside 😢
the packaging for powertrain is astonishing...
Only figured out that this now has a little less than 1000 HP MORE than the One:1. Absolutely nuts!
Agera, Regera, Gemera. Three legends
This is crazy
we made a new hypercar with 2300 hrsprs. BUT, can it fit four luggages inside ?
I'm starting to think all the supposedly crashed alien technology the USAF denies it has, actually is all in the Koenigsegg R&D department...
If I had the money I would run to Ängelholm and buy it… that is how much I love this car. Swedes when they create something they mean every word of it! ❤
Christian you are a legend
this is so nuts man I need one pleaseee
Koenigsegg is a real world Tony Stark
wow another car that we can't afford. unbelieeeevAaaabbbbbllle
I love his work its my Idol  2300hp thats freakin enormous
Nice.make a SUV.with no compromise to luxury and speed.God speed.thanks for Gemera.
Where can I buy one...
That's peek technology, thinking this car is possible even to create and work well is just mind-boggling. Tremendous piece of engineering, well done Koenigsegg 👏
this is why Koenigsegg is better than all other cars
The Gemera is honestly the most impressive Koenigsegg ever
Bugatti and RIMAC are about to bite dust together for a while now 😂😂
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
absolute WIZARDS you guys are!
u look like the watered-down butcher from warcraft
i want 1!!
Where's his Nobel prize?
Mampu tengok je
Nice job on this one Christian.
Koenigsegg have genuinely combined magic and science yet again. Absolutely mind-blowing.
I really respect the engineering behind this marvel. But it has been way too long now and we’ve all been dying to see top speed run the car promised to become the world’s fastest car — the Jesko
I'm feeling enligtened listening to this
koenigsegg is still a speed menece
Would love to see it in action!
how the fuck did they fit the V8? This man is a wizard!!
The thing about all these fast electric cars is that they don’t impress me due to the fact that it’s electric. But when you get mechanically moving parts that are stable enough to produce a combined total of 2400hp. That’s proper engineering
When they cut to the car on stage I felt lot of energy lot of dancing.
Stunning
Alltid älskat era bilar, fortsätt så!
Finally i can die peacefully with my family while going 200 mph
Beyond insanity.
Not that I'm ever going to be able to own either of these, but what a predicament to have: do you go for the most power, most innovative production 3 cylinder ever, or the absolutely mental 2300HP V8?! I can't help but feel either one would be a piece of automotive history in itself. Definitely earns a place in my dream 3 car garage!
Regardless of the criticism Koenigsegg gets for reliability (some unfounded and some accurate), no other company that I know of is going this bonkers with engineering. If there are others, please let me know and I'd love to follow their innovations too! I'll never get to even drive one of these cars, but the prospect of having some of this tech trickle down to regular cars is really exciting.
No manufacturer comes close to koenigsegge’s drive for innovation and advancement in technology, so many other have said this but koenigsegg is in a league of its own
Gemera bien en avoir une ^^
I would love to work for this company.  Time to get back to studying, need to make it happen.
Cant wait till mine arrives
I look forward to millionaires on YouTube showing them off 👍.
Absolut all Koenigsegg are  Dream Cars  😍😍😍
OMG 😮❤
Holy crap dark matter e motor
This is the result when you give your Engineers some freedom to pursue innovation and  craftsmanship instead of following the mainstream trends. Simply amazing!
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪
this is art
Imagine being THE MAN designing and producing the finest road cars EVER made by the hand of man in all of world history.  From Carl Benz, to Frank Duryea and Henry Ford.....Meet Christian Von Koenigsegg. The alpha among history's automotive moguls.
It's ugly as F#$k.. Bugatti is more beautiful.
Love it
Those are some sorcery.
Hacker hai bhai hacker
This is literally a priceless work of art 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Why are they using Lamborghini sounds 😂
Koenigsegg is unmatched
Im so veeery impressed by Koenigsegg!
I’ll take the v8 version, thanks 😁
Kingpin???
WOW WOW WOW
I want this. This is the future of cars. This is a masterpiece.
Koenigsegg is out for blood 😮
Yeah, no idea what to say about this thing other than WOW!!!
He said less than 2 tonnes? Top gear article claimed the v8 version weighs 5,900#
impressive, well done
Otroligt! Svensk ingenjörskonst när den är som störst. Man blir så stolt!
Koenigsegg makes "Emotions" not just cars
Koenigsess next car name gonna be Negira then Nigeria 😂
The worlds most powerful 2.0 , plus most powerful 3cyl engine in the world
Yeah, nah…
Koeningsegg is the reason top gear stopped production ,also how much is it ????
Will take two :)
The incredible part here is the weight. All this power, complexity, and 4 seater practicality, I'd vision something like a 2.5+ ton truck. Even "regular" 2 seater super/hypercars are getting in the 1.5- 2 ton range (and many with the quoted weight being dry weight thought not sure if that's the case here). And this is still a comfortable, road legal 4 seater with proper real seats.
All other cars are done now. The Koenigsegg team just completed cars.
There are 3 biggies in the whole car industry today: 1. Christian. 2. Von 3. Koenigsegg (team)
Honestly what the fuck? Bugatti just shat themselves.
It's not engineering anymore it's art.
Mensch, gibt ja doch noch neue Verbrenner. Für Millionäre scheints sich noch zu lohnen.
Wow🎉🎉🎉
A v8 ?
Now it makes sense why they took this long to give us a production version it's a refined, work of art and over-engineered well done Koenigsegg👏👏👏
What an absolute madlad, but I love everything he produces
Bald founders always amazes me
This is absolutely unbelievable! I miss the words to describe it! It is fantastic what innovative things Koenigsegg invented! I really love and admire this company. Well done and thank you Mr. Koenigsegg for what you do... 👌
Time to play some Eurojackpot
koenigsegg is ❤
Nuts 🥜 that’s all I have to say 😮
❤❤❤❤
An absolute masterpiece of design and engineering that I will never be able to afford 😢
When car enthusiasts make cars🥺
This guy just took your function luxury sedan & said "Let's make it a Hypercar." I definitely didn't expect the optional engines. Nice move my friend because now my broke self looking at my Kia Stinger who's dream car was a 2 seater threw thar dream out & wants one of these.  #MoreTheReasonToBeAMillionBillionaire
From the rear looks like 718 GT4 😄 Still looks pretty diecent, i bet it wasnt easy to make intresting, beautifull and functional 4 seater proper egzotic I hope it will be really successful and maybe some others 4 doors who knows :)
My uncle used to have one of these
Cute, now get in the back seat 😂
The hot and cold cupholders. Every invention deserves a patent. Christian and Mate Rimac are the geniuses of our generation in the automotive filed.
Is it faster than a $100,000 Tesla Model S Plaid?
This guy is a genius/mad scientist . Love it and the whole company. Between him and Maty Rimac, astonishing.
A true 4 seater with 2300hp from factory... woah.
Yes but what would be the kelly blue book value?
Would love to see Elon Musk OEM some of your IP!  Mind Blown...  Keep innovating.
will we have a road tests?
You can't have the cake and eat it at the same time. Christian Von Koenigsegg: Hold my beer!
I can feel the power from Christian’s breathing/gasping for air. Living legend.
This is the Best car in the world and nothing can change my mind.
No comment, absolutely speculation
Brilliant!!!!!!!
How many driving modes does it have?
Finally found the perfect school run car for the wife!
the rest just gotta admit defeat now bruh
Ok, i hated it when it first came out, now i (want one) cannot afford one
Are we there yet? Yes we are
Koenigsegg, along with Pagani are what Bugatti used to be pre-war. Art on wheels
❤ Toyota Corolla GR ❤
The real hero at your shop is the folks who were tasked with cooling this thing. I can’t fathom how that’s happening.
So that then leaves question is there any reason to get 3 cylinder version because I think V8 model will be what everyone wants. (It's almost same kinda option like GMA t33 automatic option where only 3 out of 100 was ordered whit automatic transmission)
What a machine. To me Rimac is so steryle and boring compared to Gemera. The design, engineering everything is better
These 2 versions are... Genuinely unprecedented. Incredible packaging and ingenuity. And 4 full-size adults! Wow.
I'm just saying WOW such a beauty. 🇸🇪
This is something else. Koenigsegg has always been crazy with innovation and ideas. But this ... this is beyond the wildest dreams. Congratulations! I love the specs, the looks, the entire package. Looking at this makes you keep dreaming and working harder and hoping that one day you will be in the position of owning this masterpiece.
What a creation🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unbelievable 😮 what a innovative brand!
Christian is a legend I have never seen such amazing technology ❤
It is mine blowing
There are some supercars cars that only sell themselves based off of their cool brand and the status stmbol it brings. There are some that sell because they look good.  And then there's Koenigsegg, who sell their cars purely on having outstanding and cutting edge engineering that are leagues ahead of anyone else. A work of art hidden within each carbon fibre body, and an engineering marvel rivaled by none. Well done Koenigsegg. 👏
In my opinion it looks too similar to Porsche. Like... If I'd see this car rollin' dwon the street and wouldn't see the logo, I'd go - yup, a new, cool looking Porsche.  Koenigsegg was so different, that you could tell straight away it is a Koenigsegg. The same goes with Pagani or Bugatti.
WOW
mind boggling indeed
It's amazing... It's fucking amazing!
Why does the front remind me of the amg one
I still feel like the storage you could put inside the car is too cramped.
cant wait to not get this
Forza Horizon 5 when?
I wish someday you guys will enter F1!
Another dimention only!
if this man hasent made the best all round vehicle ever, please show me this mystical machine
worlds largest hypercar fuel tank WOW 100 LITRES i wonder what is the range
This is absolutely phenomenal! Kudos to your entire team on this mind-blowing car.
Fantastiskt.  Grattis!
I admire his candor and forthrightness. There is no high phony rhetoric or PR nonsense. He's not just some suit showing someone else's great machine; he helped engineer it and is still astounded as everyone else at how amazing it came out, and it's definitely a steal for what you receive... not that I'll ever be able to buy it.
Its just mind bending
Wow!!!
Propapbly I never have in my life but mind-blowing. Passion to reality.Carry on mr
I will own a kong one day 💪🏿
Christian and team, you guys are absolute animals and legends! What a car, and what an amazing feat of craftsmanship. Truly beautiful. Cngrats and I hope this does as well if not better as  it looks.
This is serious innovation
Imagine picking up the kids from school in this 💀
The question is will the great koenigsegg build an ALLLLLL ELECTRIC VEHICLE?????
With such an amazing set of technical minds at Koenigsegg, it shouldn't be too much of a problem for them to find the solutions to the current madness surrounding the future of cars with a revolutionary new propulsion system that is totally clean and efficient. Of course, if the sleeping masses woke up to the lies and deceit of governments, this wouldn't be an issue.
When he said: "4 seats", I thought: "Oh no, another SUV-like hypercar", happily I was wrong
Koenigsegg🔛🔝💯🗣️‼️❗
The production version is even better than the prototype. When has that ever happened?
Gordon Murray and Christian are just legends. They are true automobile enthusiasts.They are not another SUV company. Look this car, gorgeous, practical, faster and looks like anything else. Congrats. We salute you Chris. Cheers.
I’d like to see what they could do in the cordless vacuum market…
Congratulations
The whole Automobile industry on one side & Christian Von Koenigsegg on the other side.
the French are light years behind
!!!Just put some oled!!!!  screen Please, Not LCD  Such a car, congrats
Koenigsegg is killing every car brand
This is gonna be the fastest family car ever built.
The engineering, commitment and transparency sums up Koenigsegg. Wish to buy one one day!
The opening introduction feels like it’s done by Top Gear UK during Clarkson era, good stuff.
Ridiculous, of course, but at least it's something original unlike what literally every other car manufacturer does
The pride of Sweden. I just love what this man does
Koenigsegg technology is so far ahead of everyone else its insane.....truly epic car they've made here.
By far the most exciting car of the last decade, wish i could afford one..
is it just me or it looks like a lotus car
OKKKK.....where  do I buy one?
sit down ferrari
Only Koenigsegg would name their new electric motor Dark Matter, just badass
What motivates the double caliper design of the rear brakes?
I am personally in love with Bugattis but can't hold myself without loving Koenigsegg
Koenigsegg is a car company from the future, period
I'm not really into flashy things, but I want to work extra hard to afford this piece of engineering marvel
Wooooow. What the..... The Guys from Koenigsegg are just unbelievable. Awesome work. A pleasure to look at it. Mechanics and electrics are otherwordly. Go on. You are true inventors.
I guess I’ll be that guy but does anybody know the name of that upbeat song that kicks on when he says the production version
Impressive !!!
I love how friends name their cars , Gemera and Nevera . beautiful cars , beautiful names
This is the most innovative and badass car in automobile industry, I wish one day I can see one of these :)
This man truly is a living breathing "Wizard" if there ever was one. Just outstanding.
The way and the rate at which Koenigsegg evoles their brand and technology is honestly astonishing. Thank you for being my favorite automotive manufacturer
To me Koenigsegg is a car company that I truly respect and admire. Passion, technology, improvement, designing and development is just amazing.
Please @Koenigsegg 🙏🏻 allow people to use the configurator so we can dream of having one 😢
amazing, must be a nightmire to work on that engine though
Outstanding, truly.
Still get smoked by a Barra falcon with $2000 put into it.
Koenigsegg truly stands in a league of their own. Their engineering prowess and innovation set them apart from the rest of the automotive industry.
First glance looks like an AMG One A Mercedes front A Mclaren side And a Porsche back
It's the car Homer Simpson was supposed to event in his brothers car business 😆
I WIsh you all the best
Can’t wait to see Drag races. Such a uniquely beautiful machine.
He knows what he wanted and went uncompromising and had got like minded people working together amazing it's a simply art..
Information OVERLOAD!!!! CAN NOT COMPUTE!!!
Pretty green.
This is truly mind boggling..this man is a true genius . you are the goat🐐of our time..
How fast do those doors open? Just want to know when I order the 2300hp version and my friends need to vomit at the end of my street 😂😂😂
It’s gorgeous
yeah if i was rich id buy this one
So sad that most of the limited production run of these amazing cars will end up sitting in a heated garage never being used as intended for fear of depreciation.
One e motor hp = sjv + 200hp 🤣
i don't think ill ever enjoy the gemera but its an exciting masterpiece for sure
Boring !
now ferrari and Lamborghini and other sport car brands looks cheap cars compared to this
This is the perfect learner’s vehicle.
Amazing engineering tbh
Man blir lite stolt att vara svensk motornörd när ni producerar dom absolut värsta bilarna i världen 😁😁😁
🔥🔥🔥
That's why we love Koenigsegg, they always push the limits of what's possible to do in a car to the next level
one more time a masterpiece...
Amazing !!! ❤❤❤ Well done Koenigsegg.
At this point every other hypercar manufacturer should just give up
nice
I Dunno what it is about this guy...but of all the worlds billionaires etc, he's the one I would like to spend a day around a BBQ nailing some beer, whiskey and a nice smoke, while talking engineering, cars, tech and everything else. Kia Kaha Christian...keep doing what your doing mate
I cant wait to hear performance.numberd compared to thr Rimac Nevera  2300hp vs 1900. That means this car ahould do high 7 second 1/4 mile times. At over 180mph. And should do 0-60 in under 1.7 seconds and do 100ft in 1.2 seconds
Gemera = Givemore
Koenigsegg 🔥
The one who Reign. Koenigsegg
Koenigsegg team are coming from another planet! Congratulations guys perfect job.
2850nm of torque....my jaw literally touched the floor....
Koenigsegg epitome of car industry
YES
Now that they made such a powerful electric motor, why not make a fully electric Königsegg with one of those for each wheel?
I'm just speechless
Amazing cars 🚗 all.
now the question - can it fly?
Family Car 💀
Mind boggling 😅
Dark Matter?  LOL!  He's the new Nikola Tesla!  Koenigsegg is THE best car company in the world!
Hopefully we get the germera in forza soon 😂😂
Imagine this guy and Elon Musk combine brain power to solve this world's problems. Such as food and water scarcity, and pollution.
We should talk about Swedish Engineering from now on…
cool, another hypercar that I will never own or drive in my life
How in the 3rd dimension does Koenigsegg produce another brilliant innovation here!?!?!?
Christian's brain is a work of art. That Gemera is the ULTIMATE CAR to ever exist, for both practicality and performance.❤❤❤
4 sits that nearly nobody will ever use because the car will sit in someone's collection forever.
That is R-I-D-I-C-C-U-L-O-U-S
this is crazy,2300hp with all those features and it weighs less than 2 tons???Koenigsegg really needs to think about making a spinoff company that will create cheaper cars for the normal consumer but with all the lightweight wizardry and hybrid knowhow because the future cant be completely electric still need a little bit of fissile fuels, just that we need to be more efficient
2300 HP holly smoke
no engines plz
Опять всё раскупили. Расходимся пацаны. Кто последний в очередь за вестой?
Apparently the production car is even more powerful than the concept that was introduced back in 2020. Up from 1700bhp to a massively scary 2300bhp. And being able to fit four full-sized carryon suitcase bags?!🤯🤯
How the fuck
With the jesko we’ll stop chasing world records they said. Incredible how they came up with a beast like this 🤩
why dont you guys aim for fastest car in the world?
Sheeesheeee
I think this is the best engineered car of all time. What they were able to acheive into that form is unfathomable
Wishlist: CC850, Agera RS, One:1, Ragera, Jesko Absolut and now a V8 Gemera... Please Koenigsegg, you make me have to work about 17 lives to get them all... Christian, you're a genius, Chapeau!
Actually looks pretty well built. I will be looking into this vehicle more. Great video!
Ugly.
slaps 2300 hp in a practical 4 seater and refuses to elaborate, absolute mad lad
A car could never be this amazing ever..unbelievable team Koenigsegg 👏
This car stands as the epitome of automotive elegance, a true marvel of design. Congrats Christian and team!
In other words  Ferrari Lamborghini etc etc Get back in your holes....... Daddy's back in town
the only video game where I "tested" this car, it's The Crew 2
crazyyyy
I had the feeling that Koenigggssseegg will be the ones who be the first to go over 2K horsepower in a stock car 😂😂 the Ghosts never disappoint 🫡 love you Koenigsegg 😃
I'm just a poor student but I want this mindblowing machine, even if I could never afford it. I want it more than any other car.
They are so far ahead they will need to invent new tyre compounds.
still unable to afford it...sad face
Koenigsegg one of the best automotive company in existence
koenigsegg should buy volvo or saab, if they have the funds
Koenigsegg = futur
Death in 4 wheels
What a beautiful machine
Koenigsegg has been very busy the results prove it all well done
new family car just dropped
a work of art in the sense it is totally irrelevant and useless. just like any F1 or racecar unveiling...almost nobody will get it and for sure nobody will drive it on the public roads. at least the race cars don't have any personality crisis. with 0 utility for the world it is plain stupid. but I see that youtube is full of people that can afford it and will take the kids to the neighbourhood  public school in it
cayman - boxter behind of the car
Basically the best automotive company in existence.
this  guy, real passion!
Yeah yeah yeah👌👌👍🤩🤩😍 I love it ❤
What I really appreciate about Koenigsegg is how transparent they are with their innovations. I have been following the Gemera since launch and had been following Koenigsegg's evolution closely since the CCX days, so I was familiar with the acting principles of the Regera derived torque converter present in the early Gemera. When Christian opened with how the team had worked on integrating the "LST" into the car but ran into packaging issues, In that moment I was thinking about how one would tackle this problem. My first thought was exploiting the operating mechanism of the LST,(the many clutch system allows for unique packaging as no longer need all gears on one shaft) so when Christian said that they resolved this through this "Turbulone system" I had a wonderful "AHA!" moment where I understood what they did, something which could never have happened if Koenigsegg hadn't explained how the LST works in great detail with the release of the Jesko. I truly felt like I was being brought along the path of innovation with Koenigsegg and sharing their triumphs with them, like how one might feel when your football team won the championship; they were sharing the victory with us by allowing us to understand why each innovation was possible. It's for this reason that I can't bring myself to feel anything but fondness for them, because I'm so smitten for this collective of mad scientists I'm not even mad that I could never realistically own one. (Not that I won't be trying)
Na! Nabuang na!
Koenigsegg Owner real Sportscar Lover, his own design & Technology own Idea in cars, full satisfaction 😍👌💖
And two minutes ago JP published a video visiting u guys. What is this live rn
Christian you mad man! I love the genius and the technology Koenigsegg as a company can manage to do and come up with.  Koenigsegg is a new world Viking but as a car manufacturer, they are here to stay and here to conquer☺️
Give this man an oscar
Between Christian von Koenigsegg and Mate Rimac, the supercar/hypercar market is in a fantastic place with some down-to-earth and driver experience motivated guys at the top of the chain. How they interact with press and content creators says it all compared to some of the bigger companies. Fantastic bit of engineering from an inspiring team!
He's a little late to the game realy, Electric and hybrid vehicles are dying, within 5 years they will hardly still exist.
I can't believe my ears, 2300hp on a 4 seater car 🤯
looks cool ngl. When somebody asks me what car would you buy with money I always respond Koenigsegg. And that did not change for like 10 years
this is what not cutting corners look like. unlike mainstream thieving auto industry.
It's official. Koenigsegg is my favourite hyper car maker. Not that I'll ever be able to afford even their cheapest model but damn what a beast!
This man is a genius. Sweden should announce him a National Icon.
Salute to all the unsung heroes who have poured their heart and soul into bringing this car to life.
WOW
Christian von Koenigsegg is actually an Alien coming from the future, bringing us technology that not even the top R&D from the best Car manufacturers are able to produce.  You read it here first!
THIS SHOULD GET THE CAR OF THE YEAR AWARD
Love this Car <3 Will never own one </3
I am in love!
Wow just wow
News out of Koenigsegg is always exciting, and mindblowing. They're always announcing something groundbreaking and probably bending the laws of physics in the process.
A team of DaVinci's - these guys always blow my mind (with added authenticity). Simply incredible - great work everyone (as always).
Can I get one for free pwease?? 🔥🔥
Even if you are a huge fan of Bugatti, you cannot ignore how good is the Koenigsegg and how much great work they put in their cars
What's the towing capacity?
Respect 2 U Brother, Stay Blessed, 1LUV
heutw kommt jp‘s koenigsegg video 🎉
As said before. Give this man and his entire team an Oscar. This is beyond art in the automobile industry. Well Done!!!!
When 24 Hours of Le Mans?
Ballpark.
I love they went "this 600hp 3 cylinder is great but what if we put the jesko v8 in it?", tried to fit it and managed to do it
Baniyas around the world drooling right now
What a engineering marvel. Absolutely bonkers!
Wonder why this is pronounced djemera and not gemera with a hard g, as Swedish doesn't have a soft g. Since the Jesko is pronounced Yesko, this should also be pronounced more like Swedish.
Okay. I have to admit. Koenigsegg really have proven themselves to be probably the greatest sports car company of all time. Just a couple weeks ago they beat the Rimac Nevera's 0-400-0 world record and reclaimed the title with the Regera... now we're getting the most powerful production car in the world and its a 4 seater. And we're just waiting on the Jesko's top speed test. Considering all Koenigsegg has been achieving recently, I don't have any more doubts of the Jesko Absolut breaking that top speed record. When I saw the 304mph/490kph run of the Bugatti Chiron SS 300+, that was amazing. When I saw the Rimac Nevera's 23 world records in a single day, and the 258mph/412kph run for fastest production electric car in the world, I thought that was insane. But damn Koenigsegg. You're at the top.
🤔😅 *_Dark Matter E-Motors!_* *_In a league of their own indeed!!!_*
Long story short... they won
Who else wants to see it race the Rimac?
Why am i even watching when i can’t afford it 😢
Pwde mo try ug sakay sa inyong sakyanan ,sir...
looks really slick
I believe this is the most advanced production automobile the world has ever seen...
I can't believe that they actually put a V8 in this pushing over 2300HP that is INSANE. Koenigsegg never fails to impress me
compact family car , love it!
im trying not to think about the camera man running circles around the presenter while the presenter talks about the car like its an affordable multi purpose family sedan, lmao
Masterpiece
W T F. Bro Mr. Eggman has made his company create new technologies that seem sci-fi at this point. WOW
Wow 🤩 really incredible work 👏🏻👏🏻 truly a piece of technology art, when it’s the best a human can produce. Congratulations 🎊🍾 really looking forward to see more of the Gemera
2300hp lmao, what a flex
Porsche Silhouette
Damn.
This is another level of "thinking out of the box"!! My mind was blown and I needed to rewatch it again before I could believe what he and his team has done.
"Fits 4 grown ups" Don’t you mean 4 big kids 😂 I mean they’re drinking milkshakes in this apparently…
Aston Martin: Yay! We built the world's first Super Tourer! Koenigsegg: Hold my beer!
I can’t wait for the Doug DeMuro review of this beast! i bet the quirks and features will be incredible
Damn i really wish the price tag on this would be 90% on sale so i can buy it
A work of art!
this is fucking insane
Stunning, mindbendingly stunning. Chapeau Team
Why is Gemera?
Bugatti should DI'E in shame
Bugatti should bring W16 Hybrid with more than 2500+ hp Megacar❤
Reminds me of the Homer Simpson car. Yuck... gas powered...
I want whatever this guys on.
MAN!!!! I LOVE THIS CAR....ONE DAY I WILL GET THIS CAR
Finally, the Cayman she told you not to worry about
This is the epitome of aspirational cars. And it looks amazing too!! Hats off to Koenigsegg. It will be on my dreams.
Engine..?  what is this discusting pollution machine..?
I support sweden 🇸🇪
The thing is that it's a good car for everyday and commuting 🤣😂
Nice cars. Instead of focusing on numbers and being the fastest, most powerful, etc, they should focus on building a brand like Ferrari. Ferrari sells nice cars that are elegant and luxurious that happen to be fast. At some point, more power becomes pointless
Koenigsegg is just unbelievable
Talks about being a true 4 seater, scrolled through, did not see the interior  Mission succesful?
When aliens visit us and ask "Take me to your leader", Christian, you have to step forward!
When the creator of the invention is boggled by what he has been able to pull off. That my friends, that is an Oppenheimer moment
Thanks Christian. Ordered 5. 😁
i've never been so excited to own something i'm never gonna own anyway 😂 i think imma start a gofund me or smth, i only get $150 a month so it will take a while
I have never had more respect for a company in my life.
🫡👍🇸🇪
Unbelievable 😦 I'm gonna cry man 😭🔥
So... basically... this is the best touring car in the world.
Next model will be named as "Camera"
I got a chub.
I mean how r other companies going to outcompete that, what do the engineers at Koenigsegg eat. The transmission on its own is a piece of art.
I wonder if Elon Musk dreams about owning a Gemera one day? 🤣
So, let me get this straight A small volume company , that operates for just 20 years just mopped the floor with every single manufacturer on earth ….  Namely Mercedes, Ferrari, Ford and the hole VW group ( that includes Lamborghini, Bentley snd Bugatti) just to name a few… HOLY MOLY…..
If had the money, I would buy it 👏👏👏
Grattis Christian, detta är så jävla coolt! Världens mest innovativa biltillverkare och allt här hemma i Skåne,. Det är coolt!=)
Koenigsegg is always the beast in the world 🔥
I was a little disappointed when they said about the power drop from the original reveal. But when they announced a 2300hp hybrid Jesko??? Koenigsegg have done it again
bugatti : you need a special tires, need a special gasoline and need some special mechanic team to reach a top speed koenigsegg : you just need a long stright track 😎
Damn what a sexy car it has become. If i would buy any supercar, it would be a Koenigsegg, just because they innovate and dont screw the people.
Koenigsegg should stand for automotive innovation
Industry leader
Green ahs comments
practical, hypercar performance, seats 4?  Tbh, that's the Tesla model S Plaid as well as the Lucid Sapphire.  If you are going to talk about track performance, the Gemera isn't going anywhere near a track, don't be silly.  Ok enough bashing, I think it's great that the Gemera is totally out of the box thinking.  Cars should be celebrated for being different.
Can this last in Dubai's heat?   It looks all amazing until it starts overheating. I would be interested to know how it handles the hot climates
Holy F! thats a Holy G emera - that keept on giving - Ge mera.
Christian is literally kingpin fron daredevil
listen…..right…hear me out, with all that said. Do ya’ll HEAR how that shit Roar!? Jesko engine is one of the best sounding cars to this date
I want
buggati better be ready
Mind blown 🤯
The man is just Steve Jobs of cars
This is a car company that makes their own parts, they don't resort to borrowing from Japanese brands or GM like so many others, they make their own stuff and that's commendable. But if I am wrong please correct me on this.
This man is an absolute genius and visionary!!
Porsche 😅
Wow! Next level engineering paired with inspiring design. Phenomenal! Is this the science of art or the art of science?
I remember when Jesko was first revealed I visited my Swe friend for his birthday and mentioned Koenigsegg to his dad in our short chat. He didn't give a single F about it. If we had such automaker where I come from I'd be sh*ting myself!
I like how this is supposed to be a public reveal for normies but the engineer in Christian just can't help himself but to talk about the tech and lowkey turns it into a tech talk lol
congratulations, what a beast ( that I never will drive ;-)
Can I have it for free? Please🥹
Exciting as always, the evolution of your company is mind blowing.
Amazing Christian, what you and your team develope is nothing but amazing!!
sooo, could we get it in FH5
What has this man done? My mind is in pieces!
Cannot wait to get mine ... only need the money and an allocation and ill be right
Copied Maruti style DRLs🥲
I was waiting for him to open the door and take a seat in the back of the car. He is a big guy and it would be a testament to see how well he fits in there.
Now this is mad! Gemera is like Geverything
Amazing engineering. I wonder... is FreeValve going to make its way into the bigger engines too, or will it be exclusive to the TFG? It seems like any engine, big or small, would benefit from that technology.
Christian is everything Elon wishes he was. Just absolutely defies credulity the things this man continues to achieve in engineering.
Working hard so I can own one soon.
Damn, I thought that Gemera already was a dream car, but now is even better! <3 I think that this 3 cylinder engine would be perfect to put in some everyday car, like SAAB ;)
Most appropriate use of this emoji: 🤯
WTF, how many HP? I still believe that I've misheard something xD
This is what you get, when you allow your engineers to let their ideas fly like a bird...amazing work again, very very very impressive! 😮
#Madman
How did you wrap the engine with transmission! And also Hot V8 version packaging absolutely looks amazing. Congrats!
300mph??? 😎
please, pleaaaase, let mat watson from carwow drive this car
WTF MAN  ain't no way they built this hell of a thing
my nissan patrol has 125litres of fuel tank
2300 hp is this a spaceship or what
"we wanna buy a family car" Koenigsegg:No problem
Can't wait to buy one of these! But will wait forever, unfortunately
WTF this guy is crazy
Please get on Gran Turismo.
That's a fantastic green.
OMG said God when he drove away in the new Gemera :) Herregud sa Gud när han körde iväg i den nya Gemera :)
wow wow wow
Unreal Package How is that possible
The Specs on this Machine are just Unprecedented.
Christian took the Rimac acceleration numbers personally😂. Yet again they’re defying the laws of physics!
What man it is, proof that perfection is possible! design is not something what is mind blowing or too flashy but this is Swedish style . I would like to have this one !
I think rick's flying saucer car will drool over this car's looks (and some of it's engineering) ;3
I think  Koenigsegg got an alien 👽 locked up in the basement. 😮 🔥.
Engineering State of Art.
MIND BOGGLING !!!
Another dream car added to the list and to my wall guess I gotta not some work effort in
Someone needs to investigate this guy for sorcery. Thats the only explanation for this car lol
I don't like that weird C pillar split by the exhaust tips. It looks bent. It should have been flush from the side.
Gemera is basically a family car for the rich
iiiiiiiiiiiiiii am EAGERLY awaiting the reviews from 'ThrottleHouse', 'TopGear', 'Haggerty', 'AutoTrader' and others on this.... S T U N N I N G L Y B E E E E A U T I F U L  B E A S T !!! 👌🤞👍😏 😎🇬🇧
Quite suitable for a car named "add more" (ge mera in Swedish)
❤
Good run for Koenigsegg, first the Regera record, then this.
This car looks so expensive, I don't feel like I can afford to watch this video... and its free ._.
Dear Christian, I eagerly await every new introduction. Because it is always something outstanding. This time, too, I am totally thrilled. I hope you will soon be able to see and hear the Gemera on the road!
Like a porsche 918 spyder. But gemera looks good. 2:58 3:04
🤝✌️
Dem numbers are MENTAL! Wow!!
I’m just curious, how will it protect from side impact?
Ultimate cars one after the other
I like that when someone said "I wonder if the V8 will fit inside" instead of shouting, waving sales charts and screming "You are stupid", the team said "Well... there is only one way to find out" xD
Those specs are insane and it looks ridiculously good to boot…
They're the ones who'll keep making future car enthusiasts loving IC engines in a crowd of EV douchebags
Working hard everyday just to become the customer of Koenigsegg ❤
There are few moments where am I prouder to be Swedish than with absolute engineering masterpieces like this. Ni är helt otroliga.
V88888888 yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaahh
a family car pushing 2300 hp 🗿
Koenigsegg is one of the very few car manufacturers that still makes me believe there is hope in the future for us car fanatics. Everything this man touches it becomes gold, he's a true visionaire, he's one of a kind. Hats off for you Mr Koenigsegg, never let us stop dreaming
Insane, so looks like the Jesko engine version comfortably under 1:1 power to weight ratio
2 technologies does not sound great.hybrid ice and ev is not good says Sandy Munro.
Holly crap!
All I see is a "styled" Taycan, looks to much like Porche to me =( looks WAY better than the Taycan dont get me wrong, but it stil looks like you slapped on a high end bodykit on one 😳 This is a step back from the beauty you usually make and the unique style you have had so far =( What makes this special is all the rest of the car, not the looks, just so that is said =)
KOENIGSEGG and its founder are inspirational. Wish them success.
Bravo👍👍
So basically. You’ve just gone and made the best car ever. It looks nuts!!
MegaEvGasCar
😮
Need Koenigsegg in f1
Geezus F'ing Christ 😅  Christian Von Koenigsegg is a damn mad man diabolical genius 😂  I wish I could win the lottery and be able to buy either one of these things.... I'll take one in that green too, beautiful color 👌
2400hp 😅 Carwow needs to review this
Koenigsegg living in the future
This just makes me giddy!
Amazing
If I was a billionaire, I'd buy one. Alas...
The SVX windows go hard
Really bad that I don't have the money for this miracle of a car.
The perfect GT does not exi….. 😮
EVs could really learn about weight savings from Koenigsegg
Where is Jesko? Not your dad, the car?
Dark matter + HV8 = F22 raptor, but on road.
(SO NICE)
2300hp it better come with 6 months of training or it will be the next widow maker
Koenigsegg never fails our expectations rather exceeded it every time ❤❤❤
0-500kmh/500kmh-0 time ???
they put a v8 in it instead of the 600 hp 3 cylinder. thats crazy
where is yung lean
For a moment I thought that the bald guy is Dominic Torreto(Vin Diesel). lmao.
2300hp 2800nm 😨👍
HOW DID HE DO THIS
800hp DARK MATTER 1500hp JESKO V8 2800nm Torque 1.9 sec 0-100 kph 4.9 sec 0-200 kph probably under ~9 sec 0-300 kph and ~17 sec 0-400.
omg
He is the man he is HIM  It's frekin mind-blowing 🤯🤯🤯
These specs are just crazy 😮 it‘s so nice to see that a small company like Koenigsegg is always pushes the limits out of the possible!👏
I wish they hired Jeremy Clarkson as the narrator of this video
Most innovative car brand ever.
Holy Shit
Και εσείς τον Πανόπουλο αντιγράψατε ;;;😂😂😂😂
i know the goal was to get the most awesome 4seater hypercar, but they ended up with a car looking like and Aston Martin, not like an koeniggsegg anymore sadly
Gunna buy 2 of these :)
V8 twin turbo, electric motor, battery pack, 100l gas tank, all wheel drive, 9 gears, 4 passengers.... I just knew its going to be great 8 minutes. Just brutal.
Mom dad can we buy this 4 seater
Gotta love the names of all the hardware❤
2300 horsepower in a car weighing less than 2 tones is insane!!! ESPECIALLY WITH A CAR THAT CAN SEAT FOUR!! TRY DOING THAT BUGATTI
Gemera is the name of a beach in dubai.
Will the drivetrain fit in my Miata?
Bra gjort alltså
THIS IS THE NEW MOST POWERFUL PRODUCTION CAR IN THE WORLD!!
Wow.
fkn sweedes did it again
*IT'S RARE TO SEE A PRODUCTION CAR THAT EXCEED FROM THE CONCEPT 🥶*
Yo what has koenigsegg given birth to ..... Pure Mind Blowing... twothousand..suqbshu whaaa
With the HV8, can you still drive  the rear wheels and front wheels separately or together?
There’s two models? 1400 & 2300HP?
I did not expect the V8 to be in the gemera. This sounds more unrealistic than the manual and automatic gearbox in the CC850. Also, props to them for still selling the three cylinder engine even though everyone is going to buy the V8 version. BRAVO KOENIGSEGG!!! HOW DID YOU EVEN FIT THAT V8 WITH A 100L CAPACITY WITH 4 FULL SIZE CARRYONS
BUGATTI WHO?
This car is incredible
Electric engines aside, i think the ice will be reliable ..
There's a boatload of great technology in this car, I'd have to say Koenigsegg is right at the leading edge of such things on the planet today. These are like concept cars but you can buy them and license them. On the downside, the styling, especially of the greenhouse, leaves me a bit unsatisfied. I also can't really like the windscreen. But as a piece of engineering the car is really a fantastic achievement. Much too expensive for most of us to ever own, and much too extreme for most drivers anyway. Congrats to Mr Koenigsegg and all the team!
Beautiful 4 seat super car !
This is the most ridiculous video I've ever seen, what a work of art
Amazing
1996 DTM Opel AWD  layout, very cool.
Bravo
League or language
Hyper 2×2 coupe hollycrap
This car is now my motivation to be successful in life.
People who are trying to scrolling to top on PC
bugatti who?????😅😅 , this company is out of this world
Wow❤
Koenigsegg just announced a 2300hp car like it was noting
Wow! Just wow. Can I have mine in Titanium Silver?
If this does everything they are saying then my lord these guys are the pinnacle of homologised motor car creators.
Costumer: so is this car a rwd a awd or a fwd? Koenigseg: yes
Warum sehe ich vorne und hinten nur Porsche ? 😃
What about a truck with 4 dark matters and a twin turbo V8? With over 4K HP? Please? And call it Black Mass
Impressive!  But who the hell needs 2300 HP? 😣 I suppose it doesn't matter, since the Arab Princes who buy these will just keep them parked in their 500 car garages.
Anyone else getting chills just listening to this 😮❤
Gemera Super hype car dress in Luxury Sedan  cloth. i cant wait to see the first car on the road.
Lotto tickets here I come 😍
Koenigsegg is literally competing with themselves at this point, teaching major brands how things are done
Wow absolutely breath taken.
KOENIGSEGG..! You guys really pulled something unthinkable in automotive industry and brought it into life.! Kudos..
Incredible engineering!!! Would love to see a Urus killer in the form of a Koenigsegg!! Vehicles like this make it exciting to see what the future will bring.
Dont see who the target audience of this is. People who can afford this kind of car could also buy 3 cars where one of them is a classical 2 people sportscar.
Now i am even more happy having pictures of this car everywhere in my room.... this is absolutly insane
Chris, you've outdone yourself!   The Gemera's AMAZING!
it makes HOW MUCH HORSEPOWER? 2300? i was a little hesitant to call the old gemera a "megacar" but holy crap this truly is a megacar
Suv would of sell better.
Koenigsegg has no competitors on Earth
Zakspeed would be proud of the transmission. Reminds me of the DTM Calibra. Nice one, I remember working on a S1 Pikes Peak replica and the only option of having a quatro with nice weight distribution was following their design. Glad to see it done again.
The engineers at Koenigsegg are absolute mad lads!
Bro shoved a v8 into a 3 cylinder engine bay 💀
They took a cool car that was a bit heavy, didn't like to turn and chewed up transmissions... Into a reliable track weapon with no asterisks... That just happens to have luggage space.  Can't wait to see this thing breaking track records.  It's like a 4-seat 918 with triple the horsepower.
The Gemera is the best looking Koenigsegg
Damn, that door is bigger than my bed.
Hilarious...........................
Iam sorry Jesko but Gamera is the new King👑
If it wasn’t for me not being a millionaire and them being Swedish, I’d probably buy one
This is just amazing
I can't remember last time I carefully listened to each single word of a presentation with never having the hitch to change the video! Christian your passion transpires
Where is Gamora?
Best car ever ☕️
A few days ago Orbit Culture published "From the Inside" and now this. I don't know what the hell is going in Sweden guys, but now I expect from them non less, than an announcement of the first commercial ready fusion reactor within a week.
New level Perfection !
The fact tht they put a v8 in tht thing is crazy🔥
#DDE Gemera?
It must be extremely frustrating to be congruent with Koenigsegg, it must be like I give up every day, even the devil on his shoulder must be thinking what the fuck are you up to now?
Holy mackerel 🐟
"we wrapped the transmission around the engine"  WHAT???
I would love to run the cannon ball run with this!
Yeah, blah, blah.. People have been trying to neuter the sports car since the first mom said "can't we take our shitbag to the grocery store in your hypercar?" No, FUCK NO.   Purity. Look it up in the dictionary. This is a (supposed to be) supercar. Go take your Toyota Sienna and pick up your bread and cheese and fuck off.
What have Koenigsegg done, these guys are making the big OEM's play catch up. Raising the bar so much by still keeping the IC engine alive.
6:06 1500hp + 800hp GADDDAMNNN  6:15 2300hp💀
Christian, will you marry me?
It's amazing what one person can achieve in a life time when you do something with ABSOLUTE PASSION.
The car company that always pushes the right boundaries
Damn how many innovation do you want to make??🤯🤯
What is the price and expected launch date of this new version of Gemera??
❤❤❤
Someone give this man a cookie please!
I know I will not be able to afford to one of your creations, ever, but I don't care. You're the spirit of innovation in it's pure essence. Sure there are others, but they mostly ride the fame train with smug. You just create masterpieces.
BRAVO !!!
It's such a non Koenigsegg style but damn... the colour and body shape is gorgeous and I'm all for it.
Koenigsegg is really on a next level in terms of engineering, technology and performance, absolutely amazing
WOW!  is the Understatement of the Year!  C.V.K.  has done it Again!!!  This is A Mega Flex, maybe even, The Ultimate Flex!
Cvg is genuinely the god of the automotive space, he is something else
Koeni's egg is in different LEAGUE
WHAT
the green color makes me want to call it Koenigsegg gamora (guardians of the galaxy reference)
:O
So basically r there 2 options for the gemera?? The 3 cylinder and the V8?
normal people: Koenigsegg is insane making a 1000+hp 3cyl hypercar that fits 4 people  haters: yeah well it's slow compared to [hypercar comparison]  Koenigsegg engineers: *demonic jesko v8 noises*
huge respect for Mr. Koenigsegg for including not 2 but 4 cup holder in a 2K HP hyper-car cause I wouldnt want to have them cup in my hand during driving 😅🤣
d man! s2s2s2 true lovely brutality
Epic looking piece of engineering, If you could only minimize the price ….. all I can afford is a poster of one.
In my opinion there is no debate that koenigsegg is the best car manufacturer in the world.
this is literally the most excited i have ever been about something new coming out most insane vehicle i have ever seen, truly a league of its own buying a scratcher tonight ...
It its bugatti for breakfast😅
"Dear Santa Claus .. I promise that i have been a good person this year .." and so on .. 😀
2300 hp  That’s insane 😮 Woow
the Gemera on a rally would be INSANE
Who hurt Koenigsegg?
They couldn't get the free valve three cylinder to work so they put the V8 in
First Koenigsegg that I am truly existed about. This is what I call innovation. Mega work guys.
Maeeestro ❤❤❤❤
This episode is really a engineer’s wet dream.
Good bye Ferrari, Porsche, BMW, etc... Your engineering departments are screwed once again!
Which organs can I sell to get this…
the best first car for a student driver ig
what color is your koenigsegg?
I love how dedicated he is to his brand. He explains every detail of the car just proving that he is fully part of the development process. This is the best super car in the world in my opinion.
Love how this went from a boring but fast hybrid 3 cyl car to omg just take my money car with these awesome changes.
I clicked this video and thought oh yeah well yet another sportscar but hey, just look at it. I am really stunned that this thing has actual practical use. Damn that's amazing.  I hope they deliver perfectly fitting luggage cases too! Best in the same color as the car.
When is the poster coming out?
Koenigsegg team has some crazy brains to always make their own shit that outperforms everything else to ever exist
What a complicated way to die rich
Phenomenal
Has it been 3 years already since they presented the Gemera 😮 the specs and claims of the 3 cylinder were mental to begin with, but to go and fit a hot V8 and go past 2k bhp is just astonishing. Just sad that 99,9% of automotive afficionados will never see, hear let alone sit in a car like this.
Dude I have goosebumps ... Christian is right up there with Elon and them on an innovation level
I absolutely love the innovation of Koenigsegg, I just simply can't tryst a Hot Vee turbo setup on a production car yet. Let's see how that's holding up in a few years.
This is seriously impressive. WIsh I could afford one...
шведский Торетто представляет Семейный гиперкар...
I wish I wad over 18 and rich af so I could buy one...😢❤
😳what the f%@k did I just witness!
He is building them like people build RC cars
Christian, you and your team are really on a league of your own! This is an engineering masterpiece that the competition is going to have a hard time catching up with, if they even can😎 outstanding work!
Koenigsegg knows no boundaries. 2300HP is indescribably bonkers! How do you put 2800Nm to the ground? Surely they can't be dumping it all at once. I'm curious to see if this upends the Rimac Nevera's numbers.
Wow. That’s so cool
Well.. it´s fun…. Ifyou translator  the name.. Gemera in Swedish is Give more
It is imposibale 🔥🫣
Thats what i'd call a mega car! Not just a fat PU and an emblem on the front making the price, but actually improving and setting milestones and then working towards them! Big props to you and the team! Just amazing!!
Wow. First- i just hated that gray glossy color on pre production version, so this green looking so fresh & cool! All the shapes of the car are looking like they been modified, but they aren't! Well done Koenigsegg- now this is the top hyper hybrid car!👍🏼
Wow! Just wow!  This company has always been one of those biggest innovators in the industry but this time it took a giant leap forward.  What a work of art and engineering marvel. 💪👍
This is absolutely amazing!
SHOW THE FRONT OH MY GOD
Who Bugatti what Bugatti??  Koenigsegg is the king.
This guy is the best problem solver in the world. He makes everything possible in practical and even fancy ways!
What are the chances Christian donating this car to me?
100L = 26 freedom liquid units🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅  Probs did something similar to airplanes and bagged/waterproofed a compartment. Would be the worst replacement or repair on the entire auto industry
Average Koenigsegg W
Wow an amazing engineering marvel of a car!!  Side note:  Does he do a presentation in Swedish too?  I always thought it was interesting all the high end sports car reveals are always in English instead of their native language.  I guess they exepect most of the sales to be here in America?
To me one of the greatest ideas of the 21st century. Christian is one of the greatest minds I have seen this century. From small beginning to where we are now with Koenigsegg is marvellous 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 keep up brother 👍
Imagine what Mr jww's reaction might be at that event .
Legendary. It was good to hear it from him itself.
I am wondering this car will be faster than Absolute in top speed if Koenigsegg want. Although They say it’s not necessary havening a car to go faster than Absolute due to the road regulation other practical facts.
Well done  team 👏👏
HOW TF DID YOU GUYS MANAGE TO PUT A V8 IN THAT THING?
Good God 🤯 I cannot wait for some of this to trickle down to the rest of us 😅
Finally a 4 seater for everyday use I might look into one for the family 👍🏽
Christian Koenigsegg 🛡 > 🐎 Enzo Ferrari
Let me guess already sold out😂
Very amazing job, just need a little stylish rims 😅.
Cmon, stop adding cars to my imaginary drive way!
Next Level of Innovation
am i the only one that see this car as a copy of like 4 cars?
Holy shit
🤯
Just absolutely ruined an amazing mega car with that color.....
The only super/hypercar that I want. But perhaps I have to work until my age is 200 years old in order to afford one.
Hey... Mr. KOENIGSEGG, any chance you'll make a car for the average non-billionaire citizen someday?.... just wondering.
Was gonna buy this, but didn't seem fuel efficient enough. Decided on a 2001 pontiac aztek instead
A
He and his brand are the pinnacle of automotive innovation 👏🏼
The family hypercar
100 Litre fuel tank in a car sized this??? Mind blowing isn't it? Koenigsegg is in a entirely different league. Respect+++
If I could I'd only drive Koenigsegg, so damn impressive every iteration!
Christian is like Elon in spacex he’s making inovation after inovation packing bigger engines in smaller spaces and revolutionizing gearboxes making them insanely small or excelent combination of manual and auto gearbox at one package love your work👌🏻
This guy (CVK) is totally insane! 😮 I was casually watching the video thinking , "ah the four seater family maga car is finally ready" and around 6min to the video this guy drop a nuke! Damn guys, CVK is the real world tony stark! True visionary and a genius! (True that guys look a bit like Obadiah Stane but who cares?)
600 3 Cylinder 3 Valve engine? How the hell is that possible?
Compliments!
This person is crazy :) He could solve important problems and make a world a better place, but instead he is building incredible cars for the very few.
Wish I could get to go to Sweden to see you guys.
That one engineer on a Monday morning: „guys let’s put a V8 in there aight?“
Koenigsegg, please do the performance dynamic exhibition and test 0-400-0 in the future just like the other models.  Can’t wait to see that.
that’s fucking crazy
I really want to see how this works. Amazing.
2300HP??? Are they really took it really personal cause the Rimac Nevera beat their record 😅
Next SUV ?
so if CVK wants to build an ev in future ,they can have 4 dark matter motor in it & it can produce 3,200hp wtf is going on .
😍
The accent ruined this video
it one thing 99% of us couldnt dream of buying this , but to know that a car like this exists is itself amazing 🤯🤯
Snyggt Christian! Det märks att du kör Tesla
The engine is in the back. Why isn’t it called a rear engine
sick
"We had a truly miraculous 3 cylinder engine that put out 600hp... but we were like, 'What if we took the 1500hp TTv8, turned it sideways, and squished it in the same space?'" Bruh, Koenigsegg alone is worth fighting to preserve Sweden. Global automotive treasure.
0 to 60? top speed? range? non the specs that matter, Give me my 9 min back!!
It’s like an even cooler Panamera
I almost passed out after listen to those numbers.
The cup holders sound amazing
compare to the concept this is way cheaper in look
I want whatever magic Swedish zaazaa they are smoking. What a truly awesome feat of engineering and innovation. 2300HP!!! IN A FOUR SEATER! Absolute mad lads and that’s why Koenigsegg is the best car brand of this era
This genre is where Tesla and Lucid play. A family car which can beat hypercar. And now the hypercar …want to be a family car
Hatten av! Grattis till er för att ni skapat ännu ett mästerverk! 👏👏
2300hp???? 0 to 60 in last week.
CVK never fails to make it a stellar presentation and produce some incredible cars. What a beauty.. Congratulations to the whole team for achieving this
Woah absolutely jaw dropping. Everything about this car is outstanding. Car of the decade.
I would love to enjoy the Gemera  Man I hope you guys never stop building these masterpieces
A 2K hp production car?!?!?!? Duuuude what is this!!?!?!?!
😢
man you got to love Koenigsegg.....
Always Setting the Sky As Limit Christian Sir! Mad Respect!🙏! It's Always Inspiring Many young Car Enthusiasts To do More. Keep Setting the sky as limit!
As someone who will never even touch a Gemera in real life, i'll just wait for the next Need for Speed or Forza Horizon game so i can play with that car, lmao😂.
nice
Really amazed, I would love to work for Koenigsegg and be part of such amazing creations!
This video is proof that the production version can be more fascinating than concept version
Seems like a Lamborghini on steroids.
This is absolutely my dream car
Congratulations Christian. Simply amazing.
How to buy? Is there a website where we can buy this
damn,they showing levels to other companies
This. Is. Just. AMAZING.
ayo koenigsegg got back the fastest road car title back less go
It looks so good and sounds amazing. The only thing i hate about Eggs is their doors. I know people love them. But i hate them. That reason alone makes me not want to buy one if i could afford it. Which obviously i can’t lol. Just don’t want to have to worry about having to park a foot  away from any curb so i don’t ruin the doors.
Richard Hammond can now put another extra 3 people in hospital.
Suck on that Bugatti
If God was a car....
Some rich dude is going to turn his family into paste with those power numbers. Insane.
Gemera is a representation of the powerful minds at Koenigsegg. Minds that can go beyond normal standards and come up with extraordinary art!
CVK is obviously more of a genius than how Tesla stans claim Elon to be lmao
cant even fit that door in my apartment haha, motivation i guess
I always thought it was impressive how much they managed to package in this car, but when he said it has a 100 liter tank my jaw dropped.
Cant wait to see Gemera vs Navera
What a machine ❤❤
Koeingsegg is probably one of the companies that are involved in UFO crafts technology in my opinion. They are jumping too widely 😈😎👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
the toblerone version
My dream car! As my bank account laughs out of control for the rest of my life. ❤well done Koenigsegg. 👏👏👏
Claus you are breathtaking! I am a design engineer and I can see all the effort it took to build this masterpiece. I am chuffed!
I wish I could enjoy the Gemera Mr Koenigsegg… Sadly my eyeballs will have to make do with a YouTube vid ‘cos I doubt I’ll ever see one in person. Never mind drive one 😂 Beautiful car none the less.
Everytime I look at Koenigsegg, they come up with another revolutionary piece of engineering marvel. First competing with bugatti for fastest car, coming up with DirectDrive in Regera, TFG and FreeValve wit the Gemera, and now having such creative ways to fit more into the Gemera. Koenigsegg is really a master of challenging and pushing the boundaries of what's possible
Brilliant brilliant and brilliant 👌👌👌
an american commander in the ardennes once said something that aptly describes the concept of what koeingsegg's done.....NUTS!!!
Celebrating this vanity project is gross. Only he global "elites" will own these while you are relegated to your 15min city.
Dark matter = prelude to the flux capacitor. 😀👏
at this point, koenigsegg is first and foremost an engineering firm and a car brand second, bravo.
This man and his team are absolute geniuses..... Wow
Wow it was like a hypersupercar sedan/hypersedan. I wish they would also create an suv also. Hypersuv❤😊
The transmission with the engines are a piece of art
Ok, so not sure if you have some extra time… please design and compete with mainstream manufacturing.  We poor people need the great inventions but in consumer grade applications.  Maybe selling some patents would do the trick.. idk..
remember guys, if you just pull yourself up and work hard enough, your boss’s boss might just be able to buy one! don’t give up on your dreams 😍
Holy shit
Mind blown
Roadster ripoff
am i a bad person for saying that i would take this over a Bugatti🤷‍♂
The stockholem Ghost is so sick ❤
replayed 2300hp and 2850ftlbs of torque 5 times to make sure i didnt hear that wrong
Reminds me of the Lamborghini Polo Storico.
As a automobile enthusiast and a mechanical engineer myself , i would have initally thought all this numbers are just a big part of hoax , but oh Lord here you are , proving what not is possible with these mind blowing technologies . truely you showed us the actual potential of technological advancement -jumping of each and every barriers coming in the way. "Koenigsegg, a small butique car company that is setting standards for major money banger car brands"❤❤
Unbelievable! Simply mind numbing! This man should go down with the greats.  At this conjecture in humanity, we need efficiency more than ever and I don't think any human (or the largest conglomerates) on Earth does it better than him.  Pure respect and love for him! I hope I can meet him someday 🙏🏼
I'll wait to buy a used one. New ones are too expensive
Koenigsegg: _2300hp cup holders_
2300 HP Hold me please 😂😂😂 time to set new records I thought it had 1700 HP  Now 2300 HP 😭 this is crazy 9 speed gearbox is crazy for acceleration  I did not expected this it's crazy how far they came  They took too long but it was worth it
So has Christian taken the crown from Gordon as the most incredible car manufacturer and designer?
In competition with no one but themselves
cant wait to see this drag raced
Blud put 2300hp in a family car 💀
I wasn't going to buy this but I couldn't resist once I heard about the _cup holders_
by aspiring what not is possible?
Wow!!
Wow! Wow! Wow!
I'll take 8
My favorite car to drive in The Crew 2. Outstanding job.
Only Koenigsegg can surprise us. That's why I love this brand. ❤
2,300 HP are you kidding me! 100L fuel tank capacity, like whats going on here? I need to get up and go for a walk. THen i heard about hot and cold cupholders!!!
Those doors will not open in my garage 😂😅
How the fuck did they fit their big V8 into that? I thought they specifically developed the TFG for being more space efficient?
My favorite car ever!
The attention to detail by uploading a true 21x9 video format and not just a 16x9 with bars is appreciated for us ultra-wide minority.
Is it just me or did the original gemera have those camera mirrors, while this one has actual mirrors?
Christian von Koenigsegg > Elon Musk
Christian is a genius.
Congratulations Christian and the Koenigsegg team. Truly the best in the automotive industry.
Nobody: Koenigsegg: we made a 2300 hp 4 seater
I am out of words.  Well... I am actually proud that I live in Helsingborg only 30 min drive to the HQ and factory... I also had a 1 min chat with CvK some 10 years ago, when he hold a lecture about EV cars in Dunkers Kulturhus. He is such a warm and humble person.
All i kept hearing was he just made the greatest car ever made, ever made. Like wtf how is this possible?
i was here
LIKE NO OTHER !!!
Few people in all of history, do this much, in such little time…. Impressive.
I already have my order in getting the v8 model
2.3k horsepower is mad
Sadly no one could afford these cars ever every exotic  car manufacturer prices these cars out of poor people sad to say your going to hate the 2026 car mandate
How 🤯
Wow truly mind boggling
Literally the best of the best.
This company continues to blow my mind ever few years. Insane.
Waiting for a full electric car from Koenigsegg...
The amount of new technology they invented, they deserve to be in f1
looks like an extended supra
What a time to be a car enthusiast, what a time to be alive.
And I have a Camera!!!
🇸🇪🖕🖕🖕
Time to sell my house, my car, my wife & kids.
Helt OTROLIGT 🤩🤩💥
I think the back of this car is amazingly similar to a 718 cayman lmao Incredible car nonetheless
800 hp for a single electric motor????
All for the rich, as per usual. Not interested.
Koenigsegg: Because why not???
this is literally art wtf, engineering unleashed
Insane. But at what cost? Lol
they put  2 people to scream for sound compensation .. Pretty clever!!.. now don't tell me 2 people in rear wont be screaming and brave
Does that mean gemera is the fastest koenigsegg?
Great innovation, team of Geniuses 👍🏻

Test topspeed koenigsegg jesko absolute and gemera brutal topspeed 🐎💥💨🏎️🎅🦹🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️👳‍♂️👨‍🎤👽👽👽🤖🤖🤖
The no 1 best car in terms of reliability  Hope I can afford one in 10-15 yrs
Art
I love this , honestly would put the money up if you had it to buy this 😂
Ah yes my next family vehicle
I don’t understand how this company can do what it does. Every single car they release pushes the boundary, and not by a little. Unreal, this just shouldn’t be possible.
hot and cold cup holders, you fucking legend.
"With no compromise"  Except for the price and very limited quantity so only like 3 people can drive it.
Finally a car I can Buy.
koenigsegg with another BANGER CAR. like seriously this car looks soo good i would want to own one! nothing can stop koenigsegg from building cars that some people find impossible to make!
@the.squidd is going to make an absolute heater about this thing in 10 years.
Absolute awe and admiration for Christian and his amazing team! An inspirational force for the automotive industry.
Mr. Koenigsegg and his team are a bunch of mad scientists! They are bonkers.
Legend
I cannot believe this is happening!! Wow koenigsegg really shocked me!! This is wonderful!
and yet toyota can't make an engine with >120bhp that gets better than 20mpg.
Swedish engineering at its best 🇸🇪🎉
This sounds absolutely impossible but yet there it is right in front of you. I can't wait to see more color combinations.
I want one
Was only a few days ago I saw a comment on Reddit about how they will never release this car
Not enough cup holders. ONLY reason why I’ll keep my 1999 Corrola.
They went all out!!
THE perfect car.   Thats it
when koenigsegg uploaded a video then it is something special
Beautiful and groundbreaking cars like this one, will make movie production companies pay Koenigsegg to be featured in films.
they even made e motor as an engineering masterpiece... i ain't complaining if Koenigsegg creates an EV
Maintenance on this thing must be a complete nightmare.
Wtf this is a perfect megacar...
No hate, I would like to see those numbers put to the test. Like sponsored drag races, 0 to 60 launches and track time footage
WTH
i want one. no, i want them all!!!!!!
2300 bhp ; 2800 N.m.  Just out from factory!! Now that is something.   I like the name given of your new electric motor:  DARK MATTER!! Ftw!!   Crazy engineering.   It’s my wish to someday work for you Sir!    Crazy engineering.
This is too amazing for a "new" company to make an incredible hypercar more that Buggati has...
WOW
Gemma - 3 cylinder TFG 1400bhp Gemma - HV8  2300bhp
Holy shit
thank god it's not another SUV. Seriosuly an amazing piece of engineering.
When are guys gonna test the jesko absolute it's been a year Daddy
Looks like Aston Martin lol
Show the car.
I'll drive it but im not letting anyone drive me in a 1400 hp car
pretty impressive,  gotta wonder what his all electrics will do.  Have also wondered why he limits rear side visibility on all of his designs?  That carbon intake could have been lexan.  Maybe not as cool looking, but when driving these kinds of cars, people are always pulling up in your 'blind' spot to take a closer peak.
Thank god they didn't go with cameras as side mirrors...
I will only say this once, I will get one of these cars no matter how long it takes mark my words, I am coming for you gemera
Nice doors.
That is absolutely incredible. Just truly incredible. I think that might be the most impressive car I have ever seen. It puts the other super car manufacturers on notice. There are cars that change the game, the SVJ in the aro department, the Bugatti chiron SS in speed. Then there is this thing. It revolutionizes how to build a super car and what the future holds if other cars look to what was done here. It is the bar.
This is probably as close to alien technology as we could possibly get at the moment on Earth.
Yo this car just blew my mind !!! Absolute engineering masterpiece.
Genuinely a masterpiece.
God, what a beautiful car. Koenigsegg is my favorite company just from their story, engineering, and everything else. Seeing the grey one in person was a dream come true. One day...
Omg, I need one-oh...wait..my income is poverty level:(
How in the name of the God he put all of that stuff in size of car and have 100L fuel tank and 4 bag space and 4 person 😮. Pure magic at it peak.
This company inspires to do better so I can buy their product.   …it’s that good.
Truly inspiring!!! Nothing in the world compares...oh I want....
“Mega car”is not a thing. It will never be a thing. Please stop pretending it’s a thing. 😂
Wondering when we’ll see the suv..
will this be an affordable car for the average salary man
My new poster car✨❤️
Amazing. I don't know what else to say! 🫢
About halfway through his spiel about all of the complex engineering I expected him to stop and say, "just kidding it's magic."
youve heard of super wagon like the zagato shooting brake, now its time for hyper wagon
Bruh bruh this guy right here is a genius he is so far ahead of the mega/hypercar drivetrain/engine build time. Like he is Elon musk to electric car to the hypercar world. I don’t think Bugatti or McLaren pagan could touch his cars
This would be my daily winter grocery driver if I was filthy stinking rich.
A lot of Porsche vibes tbh
2k hp??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Minblown I love this car
Wow! Who would have guessed the production version would be more wild than the concept!? 2300hp available as an option when we thought 1500hp was insane with the concept!! They truly outdo themselves.
AMAAAAAZING
Since the Gemera now gets the 5l V8 option, I don't think anyone is going to opt for the 3 cylinder version. (And it makes me sad cuz that engine was an engineering marvel)
The freevalve 3 cylinder is incredible and now there's a V8????
This is a work of art. A project made with passion !!!
Koenigsegg has absolute beasts in terms of genius and innovation
Truly amazing Christian!! It must be extraordinary brainstorming for these wonderful possibilities…and then! Bringing those ideas into reality! So exciting and thankyou! Truly inspiring!🥂
I'm in love with the company
This guy is a straight up genius!
It does everything. I want to see this car doing off-roading, that's the only thing he didn't say.
Imagine them having an f1 team with no regulations, Just a free pass to do whatever they can
#absolutely #amazing #overwit 🥇 🤝🏾
This thing is a piece of art, Koenigsegg. I'll never afford one but i still can admire it😂
This is the one to get. Everything gearhead engineering nerds love about Koenigsegg, plus the ability to share it with 3 other friends/family members?   Masterpiece.
The V8 version is going to be insane
How can we replace the beauty of that exhaust sound! Fxxking gorgeous!!!
I cant believe they were just like whoops the jesko engine fits if we make it a hot v
Finally the long awaited family pet monster is coming to production
Their innovation and just taking things to insane levels is why they're by far the best hypercar company!
One day, I hope to.
Koenigsegg never fails to impress the world with its art and its technology. Mr Von Koenigsegg is the Da Vinci of automobiles. Every single detail of the Gemera is unique and it's going to be one of the best ever manufacture monster till date.
Insane in the best way possible
who would win: a beautifully crafted italian hyper sports car with unreal amounts of horsepower or a bald swedish man with an idea
I would love to see how those big freaking doors compare to some others. Those are some big big doors.
Hats off to CVK and team❤. U guys have taken the industry to new heights in terms of tech and innovation. I'm so proud to be a Koenigsegg fan🎉
Unbelievable. What a time to be alive! Koenigsegg is constantly pushing beyond the limits of what we thought was possible. This car is from the future 😍
Another masterpiece
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait to see this thing being driven!
As cool as this is, I'd love to see a smaller 2 seater version with just the V8, to compete with Porsche
Great engineering. 👏👏👏👏
These guys deserve everything they make cus they're so hard working and real! But one question is that is the car only going to be in a limited amount or available to the masses or pretty much anyone who can afford one? I'm guessing since it's supposed to be a family hypercar it should be available to as many people as possible who can afford it. If so, then this would really sell off the shelves fast!
The man Elon wishes he could be showing off yet another incredible machine.
Awesome car! Yet additional proof that Koenigsegg is completely in a league of its own. I used to love Koenigsegg because it was an “underdog” in the huge super then hypercar industry; however, Koenigsegg has surpassed all of the other contenders 10x or 100x the size of Koenigsegg. You guys are just amazing at innovating and then effectively marketing your product innovations so that people like myself who can never afford a Koenigsegg actually remember all of your products’ amazing innovations over the years that are named just as ingeniously as Koenigsegg’s technology. Congratulations!
Prius is gonna drop in sales now
Greatest car ever made of all time on planet earth history in this universe of all of the multiverses in infinite time of automobiles
Most innovative recent car I have seen, just wish ur cars weren't so overpriced. I get it for the clients who buy them their price is nothing  Sure R&D and quality and ur carbon fiber wheels etc are worth more money but not millions of dollars  U limit ur production numbers to raise prices to create exclusivity. Which all brands do. But still ur too pricey   Not for me, I am an avg dude who cares what I think anyway  But eithet way ❤ u and keep making automakers jealous so they innovate to catch up to u   You and Mate ceo of rimac and Bugatti are the 2 most innovative car innovators of this century  Keep it up boss
I did the math and burst out laughing. 2300??????? ?????????????????????
They sure do a lot of crazy innovation at Koenigsegg
Hell. Yes. Well done. This is 100% the future.  4 full seats, coupe looks, full electric drive with fwd rwd awd capabilities at the tap of a finger, plus the sound of a ice.  They got the formula exactly right before they even added any Koenigsegg magic. With that, it’s simply the greatest automobile of our lifetimes, and it’s not even close.
WHAT THE F*** 2300HORSE?  ON A PRODUCTION CAR, IASGWHDJ Is this even legal?
What kind of sorcery is this??
RIP competition
2300Hp Oh my lord. That's insane!! Can't wait to see the first tests of this beast! Too bad, I will never in a thousand years, will be able to afford a car like this 🥲
This is just insanity. JUST WOW!!!!!
Just for the record, if Koenigsegg simply took the Regera with it's direct drive, put this crazy dark matter E Motor on the front wheels, put one quark motor on the crank and used the Jesko V8, they would instantly have a car with 1600+800+335 = 2735 HP, with probably the same weight even with additional cooling requirements and with a power to weight of 1.65, it would destroy everything else on wheels. Or he could just put it all on the rear and have a direct Regera successor with 2735 HP. Just think, without doing anything new, Koenigsegg already has everything ready to build this car.
The engineering of this beast has my jaw on the floor.
I want two.
Can't wait to buy this kar
Pushing the technology and industry forward, as always Koenigsegg!
WOW! WOW! WOW!!! This is incredible.
excited to see it on track knowing that  ill probably never be able to buy it. thogh i will try to get a drive
Imagine the possibilities if they licensed the electric motor to other manufacturers! Take, for example, the Abarth 500e - replace the motor with the Koenigsegg electric motor, and you've got THE hot hatch...
Лысый сверхчеловек в очередной раз превзошел всех... 🐐
Koenigsegg just dropped probably the coolest new car in 2023. I have no idea how they fit all that in there. I thought for sire they lugage space would have had to have been compromised to fit tue V8 but the fact that its still retains the same size is insaine.
This is actually insane... How is this even possible? The fuel tank is bigger than the one in my Land Cruiser....
Koenigsegg, for the love of God, PLEASE start mass-producing your Dark Matter and Quark motors. If we can make "crate" versions of electric motors, it will be a lot easier for enthusiasts to adopt them quickly.
Damn!!!
Im 30 and when I see this i feel like a kid
Goodbye all other car companies.......
Just phenomenal, so much brilliance in this video.  " We would have never believed we could achieve this at the get-go.  It's like one thing leading to another". This is why it is so important to take action on what you learn and to build on it.
Hopefully I'll win the lottery one day so I can at least drive a Koenigsegg once!
Now this is called crazy
Absolutely speechless! This is innovation at the highest imaginable level! He reinvented the wheel, the combustion engine, and now the electric motor!! All hail Christian Von Keonigsegg!
Koenigsegg for F1 2028!!!
With that technical Specs, just imagine the next 2-door coupe that is in his development.
SUPER FAMILY CAR?
All American has is the corvette 😂😂😂
They were able to put the V8 Twin into the Gemera, and now it has 2300 Horse power. Yeah it’s safe to say Koenigsegg is the leader of this segment!
Add more ground clearance, stretch a little bit, this can be an SUV. Like tesla model x, tesla model y, mercedes glc coupe. Imagine the beauty
I want one.
There is "over engineering "and then there is Koenigsegg technological innovation that is 10 galaxies away.  Very impressive!  Anyone who has the chance to buy and keep this is a part of a very small crew of people who understand how much effort and advancement went into the powertrain, engines and what will be in regular road cars in 10-15 years.
Inspiring to see such persistent innovation. There is no analysis paralysis at Koenigsegg!! You guys just go for it and make it happen.
I really like the car and the color spec of the paint and wheel color, but the actual wheel design Im not a huge fan of.
All I can say is… WOW! ❤️💯 Vehicle engineering at its absolute finest.
Jesus this thing sounds amazing
It looks like a koenigsegg twist to a mix of a 718 cayman and a taycan and i love it
Ferrari punching the air right now
Beautiful machine - pity i couldnt afford a wheel nut haha
When my back pain gone I’m coming to you for the roller coaster 🎢 that I can control can’t wait for a mid-engine 🫡
Gemera...? More like GAME OVER. Koenigsegg better ramp up the production of these as I guess they are all sold out and the orderbooks must just be piling up to fill a whole warehouse.
Dare I say, this may be the greatest car of all time in terms of practicality, drivability, and performance.
I'm happy it doesn't look like the Panamera..
what kind of weed the engineering team took
i almost spit in my screen the moment he announce the v8 version. HE FIT A V8 IN THAT SMALL SPACE OF ENGINE BAY. V8!!!!!
Love it! But, it looks like a Porsche to me.
It looks affordable is it similar to a Corvette?
The World's Greatest Engineer
Im sure Koenigsegg has a fully functional marketing team and whatnot, but theres something that brings another level of authenticity and passion seeing Christian himself presenting his creations. This vehicle legit boggles the mind
Christian pleas make similar gemera for middle class people!!! 300k-400
I almost can’t believe it. How did they fit a TTV8 in there? I mean he explained it and I get it but, man. What on earth. I’m flabbergasted
Christian and his team did it again! The jesko is on a league of it's own but this... Geez. Congratulations guys
Outstanding, remarkable, unbelievable... Can't wait mine to arrive! Come Christian, you already took my first payment!
Ok I've never been excited about a car release, but this! This is awesome. Another car on the wish list. Sadly I'll never be able to afford it, but can't wait to see some videos of it ripping around.
Ya'll better not give this car a 2020 year stamp. It's not our fault u bit off more than u could chew and gir 3 years behind
TA LIGADO UMA NAJA , A CABEÇA DA NAJA MANO AQUELA COBRA QUE ANDA EM PÉ , MANO DO CÉU , ESSA LOGO É MUITO AGRESSIVA , PORQUE VOCE VE A NAJA COM A CABEÇA EM PÉ PRONTA PRA DA O BOTE
Simply, simply incredible! Amazing innovation and work from you all yet again! ❤
This is BANANAS.  This team is operating on levels we haven’t even thought of yet.   Holy moly.
QUANDO EU OLHO ESSA LOGOMARCA EU VEJO A CARA DE UMA NAJA , BLACK MAMBA
Insane
it was 2 years alrdy since i first saw the prototype...time really flies
🤯
Gemera is the hypercar i love. IF I HAD MONEY!
The face I made when he said 800hp out of one electric motor. What on EARTH
HOW!? Just how?? I am mind fucked with this car
I would love to see a road trip vlog in the V8 version
Elon Musk of the automotive industry
First mega car? Megar car- luxurious hyper car
Chocante
UAU
Just wild
what happen to the 3 cylinder engine?😊
2300 hp? wtf
That Gemera with 2300hp AWD is gonna be a bullet in acceleration like a missile and probably beat that Rimac Nevera 😂😂😂 😊😊
whatttt????? is this the dream??? damn I wish I was rich
Koenigsegg never gets enough attention. This has to make news
The rumors has it, that  Christian von Koenigsegg was the only survivor of the UFO crash landing in to the Baltic sea.
amazing car but I don't understand the  marketing. who wants a hyper car to bring your kids to school and go grocery shopping...?
Thiss is amazing ❤ yayyyy finally they made a car with 2300hp thats a hybrid! Now its time to do that same or similar thing with the Regera and turn it into a Regera SS with maybe 2500hp 😊😊 and have it be AWD thiss time instead of the RWD 😊😊
Don't forget they are also testing/using AI for engine management "The system will learn over time the best ways to operate the valves, what's most frugal, what's cleanest… It will eventually start doing things we’ve never thought of," Koenigsegg says.
Incredible. Dream car.
Wait, I am not a Saudi prince, why did I even click on this.
This man is single-handedly carrying the automotive industry on his back, from an engineering and innovation standpoint. He is also giving customers what they want instead of force-feeding boring electric-only vehicles.
Damn! Sir You rock! Every feature at comfort level too is unheard of even in a full blown passenger car. This car will be the best.
Christian is a believer of dreams. We all think the cars are impressive but it’s him that impresses us. Bravo 👏
imagine goin 0-60 in 1.9 seconds with your family on board😂
He’s the Elon Musk of gasoline cars…. Pure innovation and ahead of his time.
Soooo Can I buy like 2/4 of those Dark Matter Motors.. and make my own electric monstrosity? .... Cant wait to see what people come up with.
As far as pushing the limits, they are in a league of their own. They make all the other super sports car manufacturers look silly. Congrats, the car looks even better than before.
Bravo Christian!
Sorry did i miss the pricing point for either option ?
dude, it looks like a 911. why cant car manufacturers, especially those of the prestige of companies like koenigsegg, make interesting looking cars for once? like jesus christ. i want a sportscar, not a flattened minivan
8:18 Is that the v6 or V8 sound too me sounds like A motorcycle but so unique
Can’t wait to see these on the road
LOOKS LIKE THIS "SPACE" IS ABOUT TO GET DECIMATED BY THIS BEAST! GOOD BYE PORCH,ET al!
So what im hearing is i could theoretically put this 3cyl in a gr carolla?
THIS IS INNOVATION
You know you are doing something right when at least 10% of the people watching the video.... are haters. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m literally giddy and excited saying “Oh my God. Wow!” just like the meme. This is insane
Helt sjukt. Vilken bil <3
One mad family gonna buy this for their cross country adventure above 400 kph  *LET THEM COOK*
This company’s passion to progress and innovate is incredible. They push the boundaries every time they announce/ release a new vehicle!
And this how you know every other car manufacturer is lying when they say "well there just wasn't a way to make the packaging fit..." or "there was nothing we could do within the limitations of..." NO. This proves that that's all BS for "we are too cheap and don't actually care enough to sacrifice some profits to make things better"
True innovation.
A true blessing to the gearheads, car enthusiasts, car lovers, etc….   Just wow!
I'll take one of each.
It won't be long till F1 teams are knocking on Christians door asking if they can use his technology...........  This company is freaking amazing.
Another masterpiece. Your cars give me a reason to shoot for the moon 🎉
This is pretty cool, can't wait for Engineering Explained to dive deeper into the details of this and Doug Demuro to talk about its quirks and features and drive it
How do the doors open?
Honey, I think it's time for a new family car.
Wtf.
Looks like a boxster and an FD rx7 had a baby.
Amazing just amazing. They need some cars under a million dollars
This is a mind bugling challenge this is what I call impossible become possible and real .....love Koenigsegg
Would love to see them put together an F1 package.
This is unthinkable
Thank you, guys, for being as mad as you are😢❤ this is truly a dream made reality
Drop your linen and your grinnin, here we go
Another Koenigsegg and Christian W
I appreciate all of the engineering and compassion that goes into a Koenigsegg. Just have to figure out how to afford one.
The quark and dark matter engines are just so incredible
600 HP from a 3 cylinder is mind boggling
I love the doors!, you don't have to move the front passenger seat forward to get the back passenger out, finally!
2300 Horsepower?! That's absolutely insane
It's not the fastest car in terms of acceleration though.
I've said it in a few videos but I WILL own one of your amazing machines one day
Wait,……..WHAT!😮
This is why Koenigsegg is the car brand that I like the most in the world.
The car lives up to its name. Ge mera = Give more.
I need a cat that's REALLY powerful... heheh. Holy crap!
I ain’t gay, but shit I’d marry bro
Amazing. Put the black matter engine on jesco too. And lets see that on the ring)
What is the reliability looks like with Koenigsegg ? They innovate a lot but I doubt their cars run a lot... When I see their new gearbox I cannot help but wonder about reliability....
wow
can we buy those luggage? it looks cool
What a beauty!! Fantastic. And the power is not from this world.
Bravo🙌
Well, they did it again... 😎
This is pure insanity, they can ran the combustion engine and/or the electric one in both axles? Also I was wondering how the V8 will fit with the twin turbo and he just change the turbos to a hot-v configuration. The amount of job in this car was insane but they took it to an another level.
It’s crazy how useless these companies are for making a product 99.99% can’t buy
Christian von Koenigsegg really is what Elon thinks he is!
Bro just used watch technology in the transmission 💀💀 dude never fails to blow my mind
Long live the king🫶🫶
This company man it’s absolutely magic
If Christian von Koenigsegg says unbelievable twice in a row, then I am believing it.
My favorite thing about Koenigsegg is they seem to be the ONLY auto company that is truly innovating, not just rewrapping the same frame/motor every model year.
Christain, your whole story is amazing- you are truly a modern day hero l
Am I the Only stupid one who clicked on this video thinking that Koenigsegg made a camera?
I'll take a wagon version
ohh so what I saw in ny was a prototype
So i think the cool thing here is that koenigsegg were able to fit the jesko v8 in the car and that is what they are referring to i guess. Reason why they were so pumped. This car’drivertrain is its main attraction tbh
2800 tq!!! Geeeeeez!  I want to see it drag  and how composed at slower speeds.  Just wow
Ultimate family getaway car!!!
How many of my body parts can I sell to afford this? 😅😭
I've never wanted a car so bad in my life lol  Bravo Koenigsegg on making a great car even better!!!
Should build a smart phone
Parabéns admiro seu trabalho.
Damn i wish i could enjoy it
Christian is a pure genius!
The technology that they invent is amazing 😍
It's improbable that I'll ever be able to afford a Koenigsegg. BUT!  There is no question that if I ever can, I will. The brilliance and ingenuity are on a completely different level then anything out there. Time and time again. Thank you for doing what you do.
Amazing work. I was gonna go with the Camry but now I change my mind.
My biggest wish is to own one of these.. 🤩
other manufacturers should have done things like this instead of going for SUVs
I’d give up one of my testicles right now for one of these no cap
Hey Christian can I get a job at Koenigsegg so I can be a part of history like this?
Watching this guy talking is absolutely fascinating... He's a true genius and my engineering idol. I'm always mind blown with Koenigseggs videos
An optional v8 with 2300 hp
I want one so badly!! My birthday is in February for the givers out there 😂😅
A historical car. Simply perfection.
this man put 4 heated AND cooled cupholders in a 2300hp, four seater, mid engine sports car. what a fucking chad
The rear end look like a porsche cayman, isn't it?
😮😮😮
This the car rich people should be excited about, it does everything, but better than anything else available
Most of these comments are by bots lol. So stupid.
It's a Duese!
I thought when he said mega car it was over the top, but this sounds like an engineering marvel
That is such a nice green! Haven't seen a hyper/megacar launch in green. This is sick
My dream is to work for them. Christian is really an inspiring person.
So the entry level model has 1400 hp . Ok
What a masterpiece!
All I have to say is Mercedes 😭😭😭😭😭
This is going to be LITERALLY the BEST car EVER. So powerful, with so much comfort and luxury. I wish I had 1.7 million.
Do lucky, successful potential owners really have to waste valuable time with JWW in the UK??
So close to calling it the Gamera! 0/10 stars
Unbelievable
I need some help to fix my jaw dropped on the ground
Have to stick with my honda sport touring hybrid that's all I can barely afford. 😂
As incredible as it is impractical. But awesome nonetheless!
I would take the 3 cylinder version. 1400hp more than enough for me.
What a beautiful machine. Love everything about Koegnigsegg and everything Christian does for his audience. He's so transparent with how he makes his vehicles and always willing to get interviewed.👏 Unlike other car company owners.
Wow!
ah yep, also we fitted a 2300hp engine in our family car
Impressive engineering!
WILD 🤤
Just a wonder moblie
This is how real men fight competition 💪 not wrestling in a colosseum
Bro put Grand in the Grand Tourer segment🤣  Genius, never change
Wow 😲, work of art & Engineering
Increases number of seats. Number of people to experience these machines? I am just jealous.
Koenigsegg keeps outdoing itself. Is there no end to their inginuity?
WTF do you have Jesus on your engineering team or something you are a mad man.
The best overall car ever made?   (Objectively of course because many cars may hold special places in our hearts)
Unbelievable!
Yo, is this dude an alien ? He's making spaceships
Looking forward to seeing how much I can save on one through carwow
Might be the greatest hyper car ever built
3:15 Interesting Opel did the same around the engine at the front of his Calibra racecar for the ITC in 1996.  Anyway, great car as always.
are they having problems on the TFG thats why they offer a V8?
I never thought they will get the jesko engine in that, but it just like I would be dying to drive one🙆🏻‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️😳💀👍🏻❤️🔥
Amazing
There is no other company with ingenuity like Koenigsegg. Nothing comes close!! Everybody else is playing catch-up. Kudos! and best wishes!!
150 top speed😐
So what kinda engine does it have.... Darkmatter duhhh
I want that car when I grow up. (I'm 22)
Incredible stuff, I wanna touch one
Finally a good reason to have kids.. honey we need a family car.
Wow! Christian is such a genius 🔥
it’s an engineering wet dream. Those things achieved by this team is inconceivable!!!!
Definition of Koenigsegg = Never Disappoints 🏎💨💯
Absolutely unreal. I love that from the very beginning it and it just keeps getting better.
Koenigsegg and Gordon Murray are the best current car designers
Koenigsegg and Pagani are pioneers.  Their cars are more art than vehicles.  Absolutely stunning!!!
This is a 4 seater 🛸
Such next level vehicle technology  If only I were rich enough to buy one and enjoy what absolute perfection Christian has built 😍😍
What is the point of such a nice presentation when the 50 people in the world who can afford this have already placed their orders?
C'mon! The car was already mind blowing and I really wanted one but now they're offering  one with a hot v! Ok, goodnight everyone! 🤯
Lovin this company!
Where is the video for top speed both this car and the Jesko???? you claim they are faster than Bugatti and have less time 0-100.where is the prove for that No? Why don't you just be honest with us??????????
i am always amazed with your creation koenigsegg!!! mr christian von koenigsegg, i always dream one day i have some koenigsegg cars!!! God bless you and your team sir!!!
I don’t think anyone can appreciate the engineering of this enough. With the Jesko V8 you’ve got the most powerful production car to date, allegedly the fastest accelerating car to date, 4 seats for 4 real people, countless luxury features, daily drivability, and less than 2 tons? They set out to make a fast 4 seater and accidentally made it not just the fastest 4 seater, but the most powerful production car ever. WHAT?
When he said I3 enine😢 When he said V8 engine👏🥲
let doug demuro drive this!!
Holy F !
Outstanding
goodjob 🤟😁😎🎉
Checkmate. 👑♟️
So is the car completely different now?  Originally it was a big electric motor RWD, petrol engine FWD car, which on paper sounded impressive, 1700hp AWD, but the problem is that if the batteries run out of power while you were driving it on track, then the car became a 600hp FWD car, which would handle horribly.  Now it seems we have downsized the electric motor in favor of 600hp ICE engine driving the REAR wheels, while the dark matter electric engine drives all 4 wheels, is that right?
Ok now thats OP
Surely this is nothing compared to the UFO he drives as a daily.
I wish Koenigsegg made sub $100k cars so I could one day afford one
When he started talking about the v8...I was like yea right😂..that 3 cylinder cant handle 600 hp reliably. Then he said both options are available...😮 now this is what you call innovation.
I love how the exhaust comes out the back they really killed it with this one 😎
Now all what’s missing to this power train is the Manual / Auto Transmission they had in the CC 850. What a genius
A ridiculously expensive car that no one can afford and the one that can will never even drive. The car will just rot away slowly. What a messed up world
Udah gilak cok, 2400HP
Overpriced and ugly   The Gemera.
Wow
I am amazed. Just the 3 cylinder with freevalve would have been enough. What?!
Its a koenigsegg mixed with aston martin design
Wove gemara comes to production that's good to hear after having a family the Koenigsegg will be with me
I don't want to be silly. But Chris. Can you please made world's first "Mega-SUV" out fo the HV8 Hybrid?
Finally the dream of mine came to production ❤. Baby Gemera im coming for you. ❤❤❤❤
So will this be faster than a jesko ?
insane is an understatement.
The agera is my inspiration, its what brought me into car culture. The gemera is everything ive ever wanted to see ina supercar. Koenigsegg never fails to impress, legendary.
It uh be available 2032
4 fully grown persons OR 6 Joe Rogans.
Congratulations guys! What a machine.
Hollywood has Tony Stark....The real world has Koenigsegg...
If I could afford it ❤ lmao
I don’t know which one I am impressed with more……the car’s design or that building’ design?!
Who does this guy think he is, Tony Stark? I mean what next, the car will braid your hair...
I love that they promised a 10/10 dream car and delivered a 1000/10 dream family car
I would pay good money for my milkshakes and coffee to have a good time. Very good sir.
Wow. Phenomenal. Can't say enough about this car and it's development. From one true car enthusiast to another - job well done.
I got about $50. Take it or leave it.
This is why Koenigsegg is the best the carmaker in the world. As a mechanic they never cease to amaze me with their revolutionary powertrains.
It's magic
Finally, a car both Clarkson and May will love!
Yo who hurt Koenigsegg’s feelings like 2000hp in a 4 seater that’s crazy
I can’t imagine the regular service costs due to that packaging…
This would be the One car to rule them all ... 4 people 4 carry on  100 litres of fuel and power to dominate  every car in road while going on vacation  hats off to you guys  Jus imagine four having champagne in this car down the road and sports car comes and this car destroys it with four people in it 😂
How much?
His next 2 seater will be amazing
Thank you, Sir Christopher Von Koenigsegg, for adding joy into the world. 🥰
Christian is just making cars to surprise himself over and over again
This kind of vehicle needs to have at least one production example historically preserved purely to signify an incredible mark on the timeline of automotive history. What an amazing piece of engineering AND art.
Drops a bomb on the automotive world yet again! I am so in love with everything they do and come up with! ❤😮😊
Be nice to make a small car for the masses with some of this lightweight tech this car is beautiful in every way but out of reach for most.
I’ve got nothing to say…  👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼
I love how frank and straightforward he is. There's no lofty fake speech or PR rigamarole. He's not just some suit presenting someone else's amazing machine, he helped engineer it and he's still more surprised than anybody how amazing it turned out and it's probably a bargain for what you get... not that I can ever afford it.
Wow a new video! I love seeing it come up in my feed! Imagine getting to work there!
Koenigsegg lives in his own world where nobody ever says "that's a dumb idea" or "that just won't work". Awesome💪🏆 i want to live in that world...
Can't wait to see it in car wow
Can't wait for the Gemera Station Wagon. It would be also good to see the 9 seater Toyota Previa/Renault Espace F1 version made by Koenigsegg. A good interurban coach (or unibody) bus with 1 MW... May we ask also for a ergonomic bycicle with a locking torque converter instead of gears... A cheaper version made of fiberglass resin or some bio material fiber so regular people can buy such masterpieces of technology...
Just... holy shit! No words
Introducing the world’s most sublimely engineered hot & cold drinks holder
Koenigsegg with another beautiful car, this is why I love their vehicles they're consistent and innovative everytime
All Sold Out since Geneva. 😘
What the actual flying fuck?! What the fuck?! Bruuuuhhh this is AMAZING!
What planet do you come from?
That engine change, is absolutely insane. The figures this car puts out is beyond anything. What the fuck!
Yea but this car will go 15 mph carrying billionaires to events. Great car though. 2300 horsepower wtf.
Wow Koenigsegg always surpasses everyone's expectations!
That is an amazing motor in such a small car. Super impressive 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 (edit): Nevermind. This entire car is a breakthrough in technology. Truly incredible.
A masterpiece in engineering 👏
The perfect gumball 3000 car
Christian will always be Koenigsegg
5.35 A.m here   Congratulations very good healthy new morning again preserved for my self happy to watch this and work for koenigsegg congratulations on 30 years on working , making ,production of it world premiere.   Glad we don’t have to steal the goodness to shove our faces in camera.   Saying I was in 😂😂😂😂   Many congratulations I woke up to some great work done for koenigsegg Gemera. 1990’s It has been Minah always I have hated here for doing and knowing and watching go through sickness of others.  Gemera says she looks the same as she is Thankyou for being there Christian..   Sorry for the Prostitute couldn’t handle the embedded chipped information and whore thought she has to read it every time open her .... fuck scenes every time 😂😂🎉fuckall joke of 90’s dragged for too long by the got getting fucked on streets high five 😂😂😂  As you asked so writing it for you don’t you ever get blackmailed by whores looking at cars and drooling asking for fucks   I am World know recognised Designer for all the cars.   No denialism about getting into fittings whores asked for. 😂😂😂 whores can get so cheap never thoughtcrimes and them😅laterrrrssss go forever    Thankyou for letting me know about the shoved images of public whores taking off how much fleshy set you can have jiggy wiggy giggle times to see them😂😂😂  Disgusts me.  Every time    Glad I am not an actor.   Being World maker has been place of Creator really really God.
Koenigsegg has some of the best engineering! 🔥
Wow!
gosh...
Damn Christian
Simply the best 👌
He's like the willy wonka of cars ---> you want magic? you want the impossible? yes, plus its fun, beautiful work of art, and engineering genius.
As an Aussie bogan driving a commodore why is this the only supercar that has my interest?
2300HP ON A FOUR SEATER?????
I knew it was going to be epic when my video screen size changed for this.
I can only assume how long the waiting list is already
New dream car unlocked 😊
This is why i love Koenigsegg  if they can they will.. So many questions.. could it potentially dethrone the jesko absolut in v max
Simply an engineering masterpeice
Christian is the mad scientist of the hyper car manufacturer world he always does things outside of the box and build some insane kilometer eating machines 😮❤
Wow! This is a Marvel 😮
The time to wait was worth to see that unbelievable masterpiece of engineering that’s really mind-blowing.  Chat GPT made my statement more completely 😉: The Koenigsegg Gemera is a true masterpiece of engineering, a marvel that leaves one's mind thoroughly blown. Its awe-inspiring design and groundbreaking features make it an extraordinary work of automotive art. Koenigsegg's pursuit of excellence has yielded a vehicle that effortlessly combines power, performance, and sustainability. The Gemera is a testament to human ingenuity and a remarkable feat of automotive engineering. Admiration is an understatement when it comes to this exceptional creation.  👍⚡️🔋🏁
“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in” V8 in the Gemera!!! 🤟🏻
These are the only car presentations are worth to see.
Koenigsegg produces cars that fly! Now I get why they have a runway. ;P Just like watches, the one word that drives the price up: Tourbillon. :)
🤩 wow 🤩
Electric cars were invented by ENVIRONMENTALISTS to combat GLOBAL WARMING which was literally caused buy stupid cars like this that literally no one wants. Every single development and improvement in electric cars was done by us. It should be ILLEGAL for people who are DESTROYING OUR PLANET to steal our technology.
As a mechanic, I literally gasped when I saw the cutaway of the transmission, and literaly couldn't keep my jaw shut when you mentioned you managed to cram a hot-vee version of the current V8 in there. What a work of art.
This is the definition of engineering.
I cant afford it but here I am gawking it 😭😍
Drop the price, we poor people also want to experience it.
Wait a minute... You wanna tell me, that Gemera is getting a production version only now??? Then which version was all this time before this day?
I am... SPEECHLESS, I expected the TFG 3 Cylinder, but when he said they fit the Jesko motor inside... I lost all words and thoughts that could be conceived
Only if it were not priced in millions
Hoowwww is there 4 seats, a V8, a massive fuel tank, 2,300 HP and decent luggage space plus a hybrid motor in a family car that’s a Hypercar and smashes everything else everywhere is Christian from another planet cuz him and his team have impressed me more than any other manufacturer ever could this car is just mind bending I’m struggling get my head around it all 😳😍
I think I speak for all of us when I say oh fuck
800HP from a single pancake motor. Thats nut!
🤯🤯🤯❤
2300 hp!?
This work of automotive opulence and exquisite engineering beauty blows my mind! Well done Koenigsegg!
YEEEEEWEEERREEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
Sports car, super car, hyper car, were now at mega car. Giga car next!
This one  of the few examples I can think of, of technology being innovated and advanced the way people thought would happen. Instead of humans just wasting all their energy fighting over politics and buying scams and McDonald’s. Imagine if everyone had this attitude and intelligence where we would be as a society.
What. The. Freaking. Hell. Oh my God!
Just koenigsegg casually putting a v8 in a car that was only supposed to have a 3 cylinder
You could have just called Martin Schanche....he had a similar drivetrain setup on his rallycross car in the early 90's🤷🏾‍♂️
Wonderful as always
To bad 99.9% of us will never in our lives make enough money to buy one of his cars😢....so in the spirit of AMERICA FUCK OFF DR EVIL.😮
I would take any Koenigsegg over a Ferrari or Lambo
I've said it before and I will say it again, Christian and the entire team are the single most important event to happen to the automotive industry EVER.
Finally a car that looks like a car
I rly do love u for what ur doing to this industry 🙏🏻🙏🏻 plz try to stop the electric bullshit
What a joke two engines option for such a unique car…… just like any regular car manufacturers with different engines option….people who bought the 3 cylinders model must be pretty pissed off…
sveriges konung!
Och allt detta började med en Norsk film från 1975 om en cykelreparatör/uppfinnare, Reodor Felgen (och hans kompanjoner Solan Gundersen och Ludvig)  Minns ännu Mitt favvo-uttryck från Solan : Nä, dra mig nu baklänges (ända) in i fågelholken ..... Undrar vilka som är Christians "Solan/Ludvig" Flåklypa Grand Prix heter filmen och SE den!! (Finns också som vinyl-LP)
engineering mic drop
What a LEGEND ! This is just next level insane.
I swear this car is so complex that if Christian told me the Gemara had a retro encabulator I’d believe it.
I'll do one better, Why is Gemera?
Making the impossible, possible. Imagine if Elon & Christian made a vehicle together. We might be able to travel through time.
Congratulations Christian.  Every engineering achievement in the Koenigsegg Gemera is a pivotal flabergastingly insane engineering masterpiece. I love it.
Is this an exercise in compromise? I'm having trouble understanding who this is for. 4 seater pretending to be a 2 seater sports car? Nobody wants to be sat in the back of this.
Hold up. I want to make sure I heard this correctly because my mind was utterly blown away. So, the production version of the Koenigsegg Gemera will have the V8 from the Jesko, or is it still going to use the 3-cylinder? I repeat, my mind is blown so I have no what to believe. xD
It is confirmed koenigsegg are the best car manufacturers in the world
If koenigsegg is on motorsport it would dominate it
I have so many nerd questions right now... 🤓
Incredible. Innovation on top of innovation. Kudos!!’
Companies like Koenigsegg move the needle forward for everyone. Huge victory for the automotive world.
These are insanely amazing! Go Koenigsegg and Christian himself too!!! Hell ya. Unreal company and products
lemme get one ill beta test it
Congratulations!!
You all really have created the ultimate 4 passenger vehicle known to man.  The in-house engineers, under your guidance, have designed and manufactured some of the most innovative technology put into a 4/wheel car, bar none.
Masterpiece... the Ultimate Design and Execution of all things Beyond Automotive!  If I hadn't watched the video I would not have believed something this technically innovative and advanced could be built.  Congratulations to the entire K Team!  I want one...
It's amazing that a company so small continues to push the boundaries so far.  Great work.
excuse me but that’s fucking outrageous, holy shit! 2300hp in a damn familycar? WOW🤯
i'm definetely gonna be buying this
Flabbergasted is an understatement.
Peak of Engineering at it's finest
as always this is a true masterpiece
Just casually dropped that there’ll be a 2,300hp version near the end there… 😆😳
yep. that’s fucing. insane
The number of people who will own this car in relation to world population, is so infinitesimal, it almost makes no difference whether its real or an illusion.
these numbers bro wtf
This car alone compels me to become a millionaire so I can have one of these in the stable
Phenomenal car, phenomenal engineering, phenomenal team. Koenigsegg can do no wrong
I love your brand and would love to join your team 😢❤
This is turly a superhero car. It's like if Batman Actually had a car. Gemera as the next Bat car?!
I got chills at 3 different points of this video.  I was thinking that rev note doesn't sound like a 3 cylinder... Now I know why.  There is a reason why Mate Rimac idolizes this man. CVK is the Nikola Tesla of our generation. If he ever decided to make an affordable, 300-400 hp version of this car, Koenigsegg would absorb Tesla and take over the world.
ok, where do i sell both my kidneys..?
the new ghost
I think I need to be that guy that rides around in these kinds of cars here in Guadalajara Jalisco and throughout the whole country of 🇲🇽. Most be scared lol I ain't 😏 , I'ma press the issue
Christian and Mate are the true visionaries of the auto industry. They are in a league of their own and no amount of personal wealth will enable others (*Elon) to compete with these two brilliant engineers.
when is it coming to Forza?
Wow another car created just for the gluttonous .000001 %ers
Sounds like an absolute blast and the mechanics worst nightmare
The graphic at 6:15 seems so insane to me I almost thought this video wasn't real
Christian and his team is on a different level ,genius
mad scientist
The Koenigsegg company is just them fr
Impressive
CHRIST ALMIGHTY. This news with the Jesko engine hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm truly impressed and proud of the Koenigsegg team
What an actual … Is this even legal
It's weird that he is wearing a mic and playing it out like he is talking to a crowd
how does the production version look even better than the pre-production models? this thing looks wildddd
Incredible. These guys just do things differently. Obviously extremely far fetched, but imagine a factory f1 program…
Bro did the car go from a I-3 to v8?!
Family Car but 1700HP😅...
Omg! Koenigsegg, are The automotive innovators. Unbelievable ability to make dreams come true. Koenigsegg, making dreams come true. Sounds like a good slogan.
I am a car fan for my entire life but i have never been as impressed as i am right now by any other car The power that thing has but then as a 4 seater and a huge trunk and all the other comfort features it provides I am absolutely stunned and amazed  And it really is unbelievable that this vehicle is even possible and going in to production Brilliant job Koenigsegg
Can't afford it, but I'd like to borrow to drive it around my hospital making surgeons jealous enough to buy their own 😁
nice
Ammazza che bomba!
I wasn’t expecting a V8 variant. Very cool car! Can’t wait to see driving
Amazing
Everyone 2 years ago: The Gemera could only fit a 3 cylinder for packaging. Christian: "Lemme show you something really quick."
This car has everything possible, except for comfortable seats
Now imagine if Koenigsegg replaced the three-cylinder/V8 engine, the Tourbillon/LST transmission, and the enormous gas tank with three more Dark Matter motors, one on each wheel for 3,200 horsepower. Or just sold a Gemera 'E' with the one 800 horsepower motor, and a 1,300 Watt sound system that plays obnoxious farting and grumbling noises of your choice of an inline 6, a flat-crank V10, a  V12, or a quad-turbo W16.  The Gemera is an amazing achievement, but the combustion age is undeniably ending.
Looking forward to see how reliable the freevalve system turns out.
I remember in Midtown Madness 3 driving the CC8S around for hours back in the early 2000's.. A 4-seater 2300hp hypercar isnt even something I could have dreamed of as a kid.
Mainstream car manufacturers have a lot to learn from Koenigsegg on how to better serve the industry...
unbelieve 100000/10
Im more impressed by the weight and efficiency of this thing more than anything. You are motivating me further Christian! Hopefully Koenisegg will still be around to be my rival one day. ;)
He has put on many pounds mein gott
🤯
The Volvo Super Car 😂
Mind blowing all those advanced techs and how it was managed to fit in the car. Koenigsegg is light years ahead of most the cars brand just with the gearboxes (little thought to he Regera).  A space shuttle could seem technically outdated in comparison.   I just cannot wait, just as for the Jesko, to see this car on a track.
All I wanted to see is how the door opens! :p
*I LOVE when he says Dark Matter. Like some SyFy*
None of the mega rich who will buy this car will opt for the smaller engine. Don't see the point in offering it.
It should look like a GTR but curvy hhahahha
How fast can it do a quarter mile? 8-9 sec?
It's not too hard to believe because it's Koenisegg ... but it's just unimaginable for us , right ? 🙃🤔 So .. there will be around 500 horse power (or more) for every passengers in this Gemera 🤪🤪
Would a koenigsegg enthusiast who’s been a koenigsegg exterminate since the need for speed movie premiered be privy to one of these works of art of he happen to hit the lottery? 🥹
You Are going to tell me That this car has 2800 HP?!?!?!
You did WHAT? 2300HP 4 SEATER WHAT THE
This is absolutely insane!! I wanna see it drive!!
That might be the best car outright. Other then off-road it’s a good fit for every task and you get 2300 hp as bonus
And this is exactly why this is my favorite car brand
this is a master piece
Damn I want one!!
useless.
Eat that Rimac😂
Show what the car can do. Less talk
I’m actually speechless
The man is a mad scientist and I love it!
All these konigsegg fanboys in comments lol Bugatti is far more complex pagani is like peace pof art. Konigseggs are unreliable kit cars with ford engine lol cant even go on a rally that lasts few days with one without braking lol.
If they licensed their technology to the other auto manufacturers and allowed this into mainstream cars, Im sure it would better the planet.
There is car companies and there is Koenigsegg.
Well, I have a ModelX Plaid and the acceleration (2,6s 0-100) is "too fast" for me and I only used it one time just to test it.   Hyper cars are dead, simply unnecessary. And too expensive.
Wow!! 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️ Simply Amazing! Congratulations!
they were like "well we have this 600 hp 3 cyl enginnering marvel of an engine to keep the car light and have more room" , "oh and we managed fit a 1500 hp v8 in the same space" christian is an absolute madman
Koenigsegg used to be a disruptor in the super car industry. Now, they have transitioned to being the leaders of that industry. Congratulations to Christian and his team. That car is truely a remarkable piece of engineering.
Koenisegg is a pioneer in Automotive engineering and car mfg.
dream car.
insane engineering
Na Koenigsegg is tweaking
Simply the BEST.
Behold, A Century of Masterpiece!
The video of background music is too loud. The editor should get fired.
What is the point of making a ‘family’ vehicle if you are only going to make 300.
As a mechanical engineer, this blows my mind! If someone told those specs to me with nothing to show, I wouldn't believe them. No other automotive company is innovating on this level. Truly visionary, cutting edge, and inspirational, as always!
Crazy. Wishing I was a billionaire at this point 😁
Who knew Koenigsegg would build a convenient family car? Christian, my good man, I shall take two. (Now, what to do with the old minivan?)
I hope i will buy one day with cruising with my family. I hope
Incredible 💯💯🔥🔥
Bravo Koenigsegg
Transmission around an Engine? Man, these guys are insane... Kudos to you Koenigsegg.
The stats blow my mind; i keep wondering how did they do it? But then i remember its Koenigsegg they can achieve almost anything in the car world well done. Keep on breaking world records. Well done Christian and team!
Cant wait for this to be my family car
I want my cake and my ice cream and I'm going to eat them both!
This is fantastic. Hands down my favorite car company.  Unique, creative, innovative, and passionate.
It is insane cause Koenigsegg will some day go down in history as the greatest automotive manufacturer in the world... Someday, we will see old history documentaries on YouTube and such talking about all the breakthroughs Koenigsegg has done, just in the 2010's and 2020's. Absolutely incredible.
FAIL.....Take one look at that cheesy cheap dash display........hurl...........👎
My dream car. If I could change one thing it would be the wiper on the windscreen. Yes it's very 'endurance racer' looking, but there should be a way to hide the wiper(s)
Pfft, inte ens dragkrok...
Unbelievable car!!! I was excited to see this car happen as it was with the free valve engine design. But, with the Jesko set up hot v style, I can’t wait to see some videos of these things out on tracks, air strips, or streets. Insane!!!! If only I had a few million in the bank hahahaha
It's been 8 years... Finally, freevalve goes into production Edit: oh, wait, there is no freevalve😢
imagine you are on the top of transmission game, yet still innovating for a better one
Yo do a giveaway, and rig it completely in my favor
Koenigsegg strikes again. Well done, it was definitely taken to the next level, well done Christian and your team...   THE        SHOW MUST GO ON
There’s no doubt in my mind that in the executive meeting where they decided to add the Jesko engine into the Gemera the "Nä för fan, nu tar vi och jobbar” energy was very strong
Bruh there's absolutely no way he managed to have what's already an incredible car go off the charts. 2.3k HP with all of these luxuries in such a compact space with the V8 engine somehow still fitting without sacrificing some luggage space? Truly an engineering marvel here without a doubt. The level of competence in your team to make crazy ideas work is just mind boggling like you said and is just very stunning to see these kind of results. Can't wait to see what the future holds! The past was already benchmark breaking stuff like with your Regera and One:1 which I've seen in-person. Wonderful cars just can't get enough of how this company operates. Not a single detail missed anywhere like what more can you ask for in a car?!?!
Dream car for sure ❤❤❤
wtf this is truely cooooolll
This is such a gorgeous vehicle. I just love how this company innovates every single time with each car they put out.
Help
2300 HP!!! ... Only Koenigsegg
Man I always knew Koenigsegg was special when I was just a kid. Look how far they've come......just wow
Meanwhile in Russia... 😰 Unbelievable genius KOENIGSEGG!
This car is stunning , 4 people hyper car. I guess that's the reason bugatti partnered with rimac now to produce their own version ,but i highly doubt if it sees light in the near future ,chances of it being a 4 seater are real slim. Forget it with a boot even for two luggage 😅. While gemera will be roaming out in reality .
For some reason my order isnt going through.............is 8k not enough cash down? Lol
muricans: "uh let's built another 7.7l V8 engine with 400 HP yeaaah muricaaaa"
This is totally crazy, heads of to the entire Koenigsegg team for their incredible work
Amazing car and technology😊. However, just the very wealthy will be able to afford it and this car will only be driven to its full potential in German highways. 😢  Still amazing achievement👍😎👍
I really can’t wait for Doug DeMuro to do the review on this
God bless Christian. This man has done so much to prove to the Automotive world what’s possible.
Can I apply for your next commercial project please! I promise less highlights, under exposures and more accurate colors to revolve the true balance of the car.
All I gotta say is... WOW!!!!
Congratulations on another absolute Masterpiece.
Insane figures and technology. CVK does the impossible once again ❤
👀
This is the next level of aliens giving technology to Steve Jobs. They came back to Christian
If I ever win the Lotto then this will be my sedan, what shall be my truck.........???
2300 hp?😨😨😨😨😨
He’s the automotive version of Willy Wonka, absolutely insane mind boggling creations that nobody ever would dream of…….let alone making it work……and he’s cranking them out, one right after another. Thank you sir for these beautiful automobiles!!!
The hot cold cup holders is all I need
THIS is pure car porn... fucking hell, what a combination of innovation AND usability..AWESOME
Dis emotor tech would give Mercedes the edge over rb no?
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! Too bad I could never afford such a car and to enjoy such technology.   If idiot politicians, specially morons in EU left the companies alone, didn’t mandate EVs that won’t be suitable for all… we could have technology like this combining both ICE and EV at the lower end of the luxury market and have incredible cars and SUVs that utilized the best of both worlds to provide the best possible experience to motoring enthusiasts and even regular motoring public.   Shame on you all corrupt politicians!!! 🤬
Christian = Count Dracula
Best car company hands down, always delivers high performance good looking cars that reach insane speeds. I love Christian and this company❤
Koenigsegg is the only brand with enough balls to make an insane e-motor just to scrap the idea and make an even crazier one. This is just top notch engineering
Shame they stuck the wing mirrors back on. I thought the side cameras on the prototype were pretty nifty. Is this purely to conform with US regulations, are the cameras still an option?
Impressive work from koenigsegg they prove that they are the king when it comes to hypercars
Bravo 👏🏾
wtf this is science fiction
This is what happens when a Genius drinks too much Kronenberg and Carlsberg.
I've never had a bigger hankering for cake than after watching this.
I've been a Gemera fan from the very first day it was revealed and have been eagerly awaiting it's launch but this is truly ASTOUNDING and beyond anything I could've imagined Koenigsegg coming up with! Amazing work from the entire team, they've outdone themselves with this one!!!
Wow wow wow!!!!!!  The V8 version is SUCH a surprise!!!!!!  Just when I thought he couldn't out-do himself, here he goes AGAIN!!!!!  An absolut, living, LEGEND!!!!!
Looking forward too the "next Regera typ car" (not Gemera) 2 seater sportscar. With this technology. 😅😅😅😅 Of course the Gemera is cool too... 😁
Dont forget to test with 1000lbs of people driving hard.
This is basically the M5cs on every single steroid to exist
can't wait to see the carwow review of this one
Man koenigsegg is the most insane vehicle manufacturer in the world!!! Arguably the most innovative company in the game! Constantly pushing the limits and creating things we will see in the future let alone in upcoming koenigseggs. Christian and the koenigsegg family PLEASE PLEASE keep up the insane work and thought process! If anyone thinks their on the same level or anyone's on the same level they need to hand their keys over
Some People say Gordon Murray is the Man but i say "Christian Von is God Father"/Granddaddy"
credit where credit is due, don´t know what else to say
Did he really say 2300 bhp holy shi
Saw my first "Egg" video in the mid 2000's... immediately fell in love. You and your company are in a league of your own!!! Incredible what you have accomplished. Dont see yall slowing down either!!! One day I hope to encounter an "EGG" in the wild. Team #GHOST
Would be nice to see a Koenigsegg f1 team
Koenigegg is the most innovative hypercar  maker. Carry on Koenigegg, love it❤❤❤❤
looks like a lotus
Koenigsegg technology completely destroys its rivals
Gripen meaning SAAB Gripen?
Very interested in the 'tourbillione' (sp?) transmission and the TFG engine.
There's not really much to say other than... absolutely insane.
Time to do 4x4   …. Or suv
It does sometimes feel like the Koenigsegg team is wasting their talent by simply making luxury cars for un-derserving rich people. Their capabilities goes beyond making fast cars.
Asså...... SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This thing is gonna be so fast bruh 😂
That must be the best car ever made.
2300hp... Wow
It looks like an obese Porsche
Koenigsegg is like Apple when it first came out.
They are just on another level period.
Koenigsegg, knäckebröd o snaps❤
That's a nice looking vroomvroom!
How many of these will see more than 15 miles on the road or track in their (first) lifetime?
ah yes i cant wait to drive to the nearby shopping centre with my family of four in a literal 2300 hp 4-seater hypercar
Very Impressive Machine.
Usually a hybrid car consists of a smaller and more efficient motor with less horsepower helping a bigger combustion engine, that way you get the power of a larger engine without most of the downsides. What koenigsegg made here is using a bigger, less efficient and less powerfull combustion engine to help an eletric motor, it makes no sense. Even though the preview engine sound actually sounds great (if that is the actuall sound the car makes), just make it all electric already. People behind this project spent too much time thinking "how can we do it" instead of "should we do it".
Christian is a living legend. His genius is way above anything else
Masterpiece
四人乗りハイパーカーは最高👍
okay but when are you delivering my jesko?
He doesn't miss. I'm telling you, doesn't miss.
im not even a big fan of koenigsegg but they really are in a league of their own, its mind boggling
Jag tror inte min ögon, så sjukt. Christian som statsminister 🇸🇪💪
To all the Koenigsegg engineers I mean this with the utmost respect but what the f*%* are you smoking I mean come on at the rate you are progressing at model after model year after year the way this is going you going to be cracking flying cars in 2027😮😮😮
This dude must NEVER sleep!
Why 2300HP. Dear god that’s insane
Wow, this egg has everything a man can dream of in a car. I absolutely love it looks awesome. No big wheel gabs tires tucked in nicely.
Damn. Dream car. This is insane.
Really difficult to explain to my wife why I have an erection watching a Swedish man talk about gearbox technology, so I just said I was watching porn instead. Saves having an argument.
the child in me fully took over and could not stop grinning! man this is what dreams are made of
This man NEVER disappoints!!
Watching Koenigsegg since the CC8S featured in the Guiness World Records book back then with the most powerful production engine. What an honour to witness all these innovations and unbelievable achievements. I was literally clapping at the end of this video. And besides all the technical, mindboggling stuff - every car is a piece of art! Congratulations!
Ferrari, are you keeping up? Or too busy losing at F1?
Holy Shit.
I swar to god, this company never stops to suprise me… its just mindblowing how they are creting such things… other companies can hide themselfs for real…
insane
The commentary is cringe worthy.
That's my dream car I'll never be able to afford.
I just got Goosebumps 😂
I wish I could afford this I would buy it immediately
That electric motor seems this entire car is kinda revolutionary. I wonder if other car company's will try to mimic it. Tho by the time they re create it I'm sure you will probably make a stronger better version by then.
Mr Koenigsegg is competing with himself at this point
600hp 3 cylinder is crazy haha
And when we thought their engineering can't get any better...Booooooom!! They hit you with the flash bang. smh
They are just breaking world records on accident right now😂
how many lives i have to work for it?!
Just when you think an automotive company can’t get any better. You know for a fact Christian was just walking around the engineering space and caught a glimpse of some of them playing around with assembling the Jesko motor in the gemera in Catia lol.
1st person I'd call after I won the Powerball, well 1st company I'd contact!!
WOW
Wow a V8 in a Gemera, imagine that 👏
HEJA SVERIGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
🏁🏁🏁Second to none thanks Koenigsegg ❤ Best automotive reveal of 2023 😎🤙🏾
Бива.
Okay, I'd drive this one...... even though I'm a stick-n-clutch purist!
I'm going to call it. This HAS to be THE car of the decade! It has it all: 800hp Dark horse electric motor 1500 V8 ICE 9 Speed Light Speed transmission  4wd with torque vectoring Any combination of electric and/or ICE propulsion. 2850nm of torque (enough to restart a planet? 😂) Room for 4 adults and their luggage 100 litre fuel tank Etc,etc,etc............  There is no other vehicle in the world today to tick so many boxes.....  Once again Christian & his team have demonstrated why they are simply the best. 👌
What is the name of the song in the beginning?
I was impresses but when Christian started talking about swapping the jesko V8 there, man I had an orgasm
Fy fan, I know as a future nurse I will never be able to drive this car but man it is looking so cool!
I named my cats Gemera and Jesko
Holy Sh*t! These guys are mad geniuses 🤘🏻
why cancel the electric exterior mirror?
🗣"Hybrid might be a good option these days bos" 🥚"Oh yeah sure, I'm thinking 1500hp V8 + 800hp e motor, y'all cool with that?"
How the owner of Koenigsegg is not knighted yet or something baffles me. What he did before with the 1-gear engine, what he did before with the torque-converter that baffled the industry. Now all this in the Gemera... C'mon man😮 I KNIGHT YOU FOR CREATING A CLASS BEYOND A HYPER CAR
holy hell, ya'll through a Jesko motor in this beast....Mind Fn blown
Spectacular. And now the super rich can bring their whole family to Caffeine & Carburetors in one car!
This company has almost everything except, Racing DNA the most important thing for car enthusiast. But this company is aimed at your average millionaire who knows nothing about cars
Another level all together!!!!
2300hp 4 seater? That is mind breaking.
So awesome.  Watching Christian and his amazing company over the years has been almost like watching a young Enzo Ferrari in real time   They create magic in Angelholm, Sweden just like they do Maranello.  What they have been able to achieve starting as a small company in Sweden is incredible.  The new Gemera is really cool and the green color is wild.  I usually am not big on green but this green is really nice.   I almost choked when I heard the "basic" car has 3 cylinder TFG with 1400 bhp!  Ha ha.  Amazing.
So now on to Formula 1? I can see a Koenigsegg Champion F1 Team!!!!
Mind blowing... as usual! Bravo Christian!👏👏👏
Did they just release a video in 24:10? This is the first time I've seen a Video on YouTube perfectly fitting my monitor
Absolutely greatest man in car industry.
Again ... The KING is Here ...❤💖💖💋💋💋💋💋
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Certainly a unique beast of a family car. What's more amazing - 300 of these will be ever produced.  Both Veyron and Chiron gonna have some tight competition.
I'm an engineer and still in shock at how many new ideas are here! Bravo!
They're the only car company right now that gives me some comfort of knowing what cars are capable of in the future. They're so inventive!
you had me at heated cup holders ill take 2 in red please
I am speechless....Bravooo.... I will probably never be able to own one of this beautiful machines but just the journey of this company is so inspiring!!!!
2,300HP in a 4-seater, from factory…let that sink in.
This company just dont stop to impress the industry, They are outstanding.
CRISTIAN.... CAN WE HAVE A DARK MATTER GO KART TO PURCHASE TOO PLEASE 🙏 🙂
I hope there will be a documentary about the engineering behind this beast
Ufff brutal
This is actually mind blowing.
When you accelerate in this car, you do not go forward. You push the entire world backwards.
Holy 🤯
Innovation to the highest degree
2350HP and you can take it to Mcdonalds drive through!? This, Ladies and Gentlemen is why Koenigsegg is the best car manufacturer hands down.
Wait, what?! I did NOT see that v8 2k+ hp model coming!
Kan man köpa en på klarna kortet?
A world premier that's not coming to Xbox GamePass?! OUTRAGEOUS!  Edit: Nice car tho.
Holy Shiet!
Bravo!
Genius company
😂😂❤❤BRAVO, AMAZING 👏!!!!❤❤😂😂
This video should’ve ended with him getting into the backseat of the car
Fully gowned.. aka typical american…. Haha
2300hp... excuse me what
Someone tell Fermilab the team at Koenigsegg have found dark matter... oh and it can help cars reach 2300hp!!!
This guy is just living his dream.   Good for you Christian. I'm very very happy for you. I hope more people can do what they love and become wealthy from it.
Koenigsegg is nothing short of pioneer innovation.
hes not human . him Elon and zuck
This is actually insane with the Jesko v8. Best car ever made
christian is just different daimmmmm😮
I love that they are always on their own business, and even when don’t innovate with the other companies they just create some amazing things other companies would just dream of. They are killing it as always! 👏🏻
No other car I want rn than this
This is can only be considered witchcraft  ,mind blown
Gotta get Doug to drive this thing!
Fuck electrik, nur gasoline
They're going all out on this one, 26 gallon gas tank?! This is their main vehicle the best they've done so far.
Yes, I'd really love to enjoy it. 🔝
En drömbil som man aldrig kommer få chansen att äga.
This is absolutely outrageous
Love that they called that emotor "Dark matter"... that sounds menacing
CVK knows absolutely NO BOUNDARIES!!! Bending the laws of physics to his own will, every, single, time!! I am so lucky to say I have lived to witness this greatness! 🔥🔥🔥
Bonkers, I love it.
What can you say?  Wow!
This is closer to a 4-seater spaceship than any car ever considered, let alone manufactured!  This is here is what keeps most petrolheads dreaming! What a time to be alive. Thank you, Koenigsegg!
W
song name???
I love this Brand.  I have Never Seen a koenigsegg in real Life But this is just mind blowing  Please keep up the good work.  Is there any Chance you Van Build a affordable Car? I mean all the other manufactures are Not doing a good Job at the Moment like a golf gti from koenigsegg only better
This man is a legend. Can't deny that. And the echos of history will remember his name and his cars mark my words.
Wasnt the Gamera using an inline 3?
Holy fuck i cant even explain how hyped iam. I need this car!! 😍
Christian, you can be the greatest car builder of all time.  Commercialize your amazing technology and take over the automotive world. Make the same battery in a smaller version with less power, become the foremost automotive battery manufacturer in the world. Your technology is by far the best on offer for any auto related product. This car is mindblowing. They got the V8 in there… THE V8!!!! 🤯🤯🤯
Bugatti is cool and exciting, but nothing can beat Koenigsegg.
I want to see Chris Harris take this around a track! Simply stunning design and I love that green color!!!
Can't decide on the Gemera or the new Prius? 🤔
carwow need to make a vid about this🔥
Sir Christian! You the true Alchemist of the Car Industry. Amalgamation between Analogue tech and the Dark Matter of EV:s. Leaves most contemporary Supercar makers in the road dust behind. Way behind... GMA & Rimac exempt 😊 Way impressive, way-to-go 👍🏆🎩
It’s like a mixture of Ferrari and Porsche I love it.
Hope Koenigsegg develops a go anywhere car. Like 911 Dakar.
omg yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes :)))))))))))))))))))))
Talk is cheap, show it working
This is a great and interesting way to learn about the power and engine of this car
Looks like my new car
WOW 😳
video edittion  direction went like "i only want good old classic  top gear edit alike"
I actually thought they were going to do an I3 motor. Crazy they were able to shove a V8 in there. Insane!!!!
I am so lucking forward to my hand over, see you all soon guys. Great presentation 👍👍
Ok so my simple interpretation of this is as follows.  We looked at our competitors innovation over there varying existences and laughed at it. We then finished our beers and got to work.  Simple…
Incredible
I’m going to say wow!
I always wondered why top tier performing cars can't be a family car.. This is a car that everyone wants
Never been much of a koenigsegg guy, but this made me a fan. They just seem to be so genuinely invested in making the best car they can. Awesome to see!
May I please have the first one?
This is gonna be my new dream car for a while
If only I can afford this…I’ll close my eyes and pick this all the time 🥹🥹🥹🥹 Practicallity! Naughty!
So with all this technology, why don't you break into the world of Formula One !!!
All the innovation that koenigsegg has done... yet they couldn't figure out how to integrate a parking brake into the rear caliper?
Koenigsegg is always one step ahead just no words
I can’t stop smiling 😭
There’s no way those tires are going to hold up. Customers will need a tire subscription
EXQUISITE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION #perfection
If money was no object, I would have many Koenigsegg vehicles.
Koenigsegg blows minds again! Next up: Koenigsegg economy car with free valve !
Also, please gift the world with the freevalve technology. Thanks!
WTAF
I’m pissed you can’t go through a drive thru with those windows? 🤷‍♂️
Wow I didn’t expect that how insane! This man never ceases to amaze!
This is why koenigsegg is my favorite ❤congrats
this must be the best car ever made
.....If he says it's gonna fly to the moon and back. I would believe him. He put a THE V8 in it. 😱🤩
This thing is way more incredible then I ever could’ve thought. Can’t wait to see one driving.
The back end kinda looks like a Cayman
Mr. K you are the fucking King! ❤
Dark matter and lightspeed. Take my money❤😅
All that and it's absolutely beautiful.
Did I hear that correctly? 3 cylinder 3 valves making 600hp? How is that even possible?
You can’t unsee this!
No one does it better!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Jesus christ Christian is a bloody Genius.
could listen to the man talk cars all day, just has a natural aura around him. phenomenal man.
Imagine what they could do in F1
Koenigsegg makes a "slow version"  It has 1400 bhp  Ok then
My favorite brand right now
This car is leaving everything for dead
Pushing the boundaries with every step forward. Bravo
I keep repeating, I love this car to death but I absolutely dislike the dashboard. Looks like someone stuck an iPhone to a Subaru. Why can’t this look like the One:1 or a Pagani Zonda?
Wooow, one day
Hes a wild boy... 2300hp, awd, 4wheel vectoring etc
Koenigsegg made it again, That's a propper mega car. I hope one day i can see one in person!
WOW 🤯
A Gemera with a Jesko motor in it. My new dream car, hands down. (Not counting any hypercars).   I need to know what the price is so I can just confirm I can’t afford it.
I'll take 3.
I don't think Christian understand the word practicality by any stretch of the imagination. Your vehicles cost more than two million dollars there's nothing practical about what you're buying.
Koenigsegg: “This sounds too stupid and impossible, it surely can’t be done!”  Also Koenigsegg: “Hold my beer! 🍺”
SUCH A HUMBLE GUY. THEY RAISED HIM WELL, LOL. IM GETTING GOOSEBUMPS WATCHING THIS AND I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT CARS SINCE 08.. 👏👏👏
I’d love to be able to just touch one if you can make that possible for me I’d die happy your are my top car manufacturer by miles i Inspire to build a car half as good as yours one day only way is make it happen I have crazy ideas never seen or heard of
WOW.
ill take one. (maybe in the next life time)
Christian is my GOAT!! Next level
I can't wait to see this thing on the track.
The V8 Gemera is now officially the #1 most desirable car in the world.
The automotive industry may have just peaked. We're witnessing history boys and girls!
Jag var orolig för att jag skulle behöva renovera min 9-5 biopower für daß Klima, aber den här familjebilen sköljde bort alla mina tvivel. Jag kan få både V8 och etanol i en.
It's so cool!
It's not EV... in 2023... still too late.
It's time to make an off-road machine.
Koenigsegg just made the ultimate car. Something that goes well beyond "hypercar". Truly insane.
This masterpiece needs to be in Forza asap!
Gosh I hope Manny Khosbin buys one.
I am a Bugatti fan boy but when it comes to innovation koenigsegg is killing the game right now. If they ever need to make a ￼homologation vehicle that is priced for the average consumer I will be first in line
5:50 THEY DID WHAT!!! 2,300HP!!! 🤯🤯🤯
Christian von Koenigsegg is the the Tony Stark of cars!
incredible. This company might be one of the greatest and innovative car designers in the world. This technology can trickle down. Thats exciting.
You are the king!
Staggering that this is coming to the market
FINALLY!! I've been following Koenigsegg since I saw the CCX on Top Gear as a 12 year old. I'm so excited to see videos of this car on the streets.
2300HP 💀🫣
@dailydrivenexotics put that order in!!!! Let's goooo!!!
Ok now what happens when you add 4 Dark matter motors to a car? Light speed? or mach 3?
Sure, I'll buy one. Just tell me where I send my severed right arm to..lol
imagine being rich enough to buy this car, but not rich enough to buy the 2000hp version but ONLY the 1400hp and showing up to your rich friend's house like if you brought a 2.0 Supra instead of a 3.0 lol wtf
Truly a marvel of automotive engineering.
Holy crap 😲 2300hp? "mają rozmach skurw..." 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Absolute insanity.
soo good
2,300 horsepower? Oh my....
Love this company!!!
BLM likes this DARK MATTER engine :)
wow awesome!  love it and look forward to learning more about it... not that I could ever afford one, but love the design, technical achievement, and forward thinking...
4:37 Nice. 4WD on both drivetrains independently or combined makes this a lot more fun, no more math equations to figure out how much power goes to what wheels at a given speed.
ICE folks and EV folks all sit in awe of this thing.  WOW  Always the unifier, Sir!
next car will be the tartaria with 5000 hp
Test drive 🙏🏾
Wow! Just absolutely wow
This is legitimately the coolest car ever made.
Christian Von Koenigsegg is an absolute monster at what’s he does, thank you for existing and somehow exceeding expectations every single time 🙏🏽🙏🏽
I'm spechless....how ????
Had to look at the date when I heard those hybrid numbers to make sure it wasn’t April fools
Wheres Doug demuro he needs to review this
Now we all we need is a wagon... Or, dare I say, an SUV?
These guys are the definition of Engineers👏👏👏
Koenigsegg working alongside extraterrestrials at this point because holy shit
This is mentaly distarning😂🎉
I love Bugatti but Bugatti could never...
Absolutely insane!
Koenigsegg will always be my favorite brand.
2300hp holy shittt, this thing is going to walk anything you put in his way.
Christian is an absolute madman.  We need more like him.
This will be around $50,000 right?
Its lighter than a Chiron, it has more power than a Chiron, I wouldn't be surprised is this thing is faster around the Track against a Chiron, image beating your Competitions Top Model with a 4 Seater Car, I love him.
2300bhp lol… wow.
Shots fired at Rimac and Tesla!
Finally a proper release of this car lmao
I was expecting changes like interior and packing, not a whole ass new power train combination and new e motor. These people are just insane. I love Koeniggsegg! Not only that, someone at the company said, what if we V8swap Gemera? Pure insanity
Insane.
What a masterpiece of a machine, I hope someday I will be able to afford 1
Eh, Mr. Khris, wheres the flatout footage ?
Say what?
Incredible!
Can I just have the motor for my Honda? 😂 electric or combustion, I'll take either (or both) I'll take your sick mulyi clutch semimanual trans too..  Ah, screw it, now I just want a whole car 😂
Incredibilis.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 2300HP 4 seater saloon car... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 WANT!!!
People that want live in the past = We want more Petrol cars People that want live in the future = We want more EVs People that want live in the present = We want more Performance Hybrids with proper engines, cheers
Sweet baby Jesus what have these guys created.
For me the most beautiful car ever
Love to see these cars although I can't even imagine buying one of them in my whole entire lifespan 😂
I’d say take my money already but I wouldn’t be able to afford one of the tyres ! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
2300hp in a road car is nothing short of insanity
What!! The concept was amazing, how’s the production version even MORE crazy!! Christian @koenigsegg I’ll take the “old one” if you’re done with it 😂 amazing car 🙌🏽
KOENIGSEGG GEMERA - Swedish engineering at its best! CvK is the mastermind of a company where innovation dominates. At the beginning SAAB AUTOMOBILE was a kind of obstetrician...
Hugely impresive. It's amazing what this company can do when not limited by cost cutting. Work of art in every aspect!  Other brands can't even keep 4WD in their single motor EV cars...
Wow, just wow!!!
The bar raises even higher. Every time I see something new it is even more mind blowing than the last time. The King!
2300 fkn HP WTF
Trade for a Honda jazz?
This is it!!
Christian von Koenigsegg is in a league of his own!
Someone brought CVK to a drag week and he said : Let me show you how iI do it! And he made the Gemera!  Incredible cars every time...respect Christian
Awesome
it looks ugly
I like the Car, but first i thought its another Version of the Porsche Taycan ^^
Amazing now let's see it in action.
That door flowing into that rear air intake in that color. Whoever made that decision. *slow clap*
😢I want one!
amazing car ♥
Cannot wait to see it on the road🤯
HE JUST UPED THE ANTY I NEED THAT.
I really wish they'd have warned me to wrap my head in duct tape beforehand,  as my brains have exploded everywhere 🎉
It's on my crypto shopping list 🤠👍🧦💸  Will there be a Right Hand Drive version?
Wow! Just Wow! That's all I can say! Congratulations Koenigsegg! Cheers!
If I could only have one car…
Meanwhile while they took so long developing this car the ‘it’ crowd are already bored with hybrids. K will have to go full bonkers EV to compete with future Bugattis, etc. It will be exciting.
I would love to see a rewiev compared this car and the Nevera from Rimac
Its really funny for people who are not into cars. This brand talks like they invented something very creative; but if you break it down; they sold cars for 2 persons and now they can fit for people😂. In 10 years they will make a fast van🚎🚀
fuck everything els temperature controlled cupholders :0
Panamera with 2 doors
Fantastiskt bra jobbat med bilen! Hade önskat högre video/ljud-kvalitet dock 😢
you should make a version with a rear bench seat so the owners can put 4 bitches back there (i know its "only 3 seats")
The man with the egg head creates another incredible egg !!!
A slight bit overboard.
Woooow 2300hp and over 2800Nm 😳🤯🤯🤯 this is F-ing amazing 😮
Okay guys this is it. We are witnessing the greatest car ever made
The whole other car makers are left into dust.  Koenigsegg just touched the sun.  Ovations please!  🎉🎉🎉
MAGNIFICENT 😎 👍
that is 1,341 hp not 1700
They dont have any competition.... nobody even comes close
4pl
You had me at 1400hp...
I'll have the H-V8, please. Does it come with a trailer hook?
Congratulations! Looks stunning!
One question, does Walmart sell the oil filter? 😲
bro makes me smile so fucking much im gay only for this man
Masterpiece. Pinnacle of automotive engineering.
If I ever win the lotto, THIS is exactly what I'm buying!
😂Can beat Ferrari suv
That’s what Lambo and Ferrari didn’t have the guts to produce, and they both ended up with “tasteless soccer player SUVs” instead. Hats off to  Koenigsegg, always brave and forward thinking. Kudos!
👏
This is proof of extraterrestrial life. This is not of this world
I’m going to earn this. I will return to this page.
It would be an honor to work at any position in this company. Maybe one day.
Congratulations to Koenigsegg they made the first mega car of the world. 👏👏👏 This was my favourite car and now it’s upgraded I’m soo excited to see what it can do… 😎
totally mind-blowing
When i saw it, I thought, hmm bit boring looking. Once I heard the info...... yeah, most amazing car ever made
the whole thing looks like a mix of an AMG ONE and some Porsches. but i like it.
What just happend
*HOLY CRAP* 😳😳😳😳  Koenigsegg will always be my favorite car company, because of reveals like this. Casually reinventing automotive technology to the point where everyone else looks like they're going backwards. This is next level engineering, design, and execution, all wrapped up in an all-around nuclear Swiss army knife of a vehicle 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I'm just a poor boy, from a poor family, spare me my life and give me one of those" 😮😁  Beautiful car!
Introducing, the world's most useless car.
OMFG 😳😳😳 the v8 tt is going in the Gemera!!!! 🔥🔥👑👑👑💚💚🥳🥳💦💦
They not hold up in naming 😅
And people still say that Bugatti is better, that car is an absolute work of art in every way
The concept was already one of the most unbelievable cars imagineable, and yet now the production version has somehow not gotten tamer but instead become even more ridiculous. Words cannot describe how badly I wish I could have one!
Gr8 car, gr8 presentation.  You should merge Elon with Christian.
Savage numbers :o I want one. Oh wait... I forgot I'm poor guy :}
Bonkers. Love it.
Christian Koenigsegg is a genius
I wish I was that rich. I would daily that car everyday for sure, because why not...
KOENIGSEGG is doing real innovations while other brands compete in the amount of screens they have, which all look like cheap chinese tablets slapped into the dashboard.
No point for such fast car in 2023 with traffic regulations and congestion.
He really does embody the kid in us all that draws and imagines a rocket on wheels, but the only difference is he is a technological god with an eye for design heaven! If you were to ask me for one person to rule this planet for the rest of my lifetime it would no doubt be CVK!!!
This car is absolutely BONKERS Im in a lost of words for these numbers and this amazing car, the best ever koenigsegg to go into production in my opinion. Cudos Sir to you and your amazing team.
What a car,,damn
Whats yhe price?
I am disappointed that the tire logos are not aligned between all the tires.
It's getting more and more difficult to find words to describe how incredible Koenigsegg is. At every single of your car reveals you show us concepts I would never come across even in my imagination, put to reality in the best way possible. Each of them is mind blowing on it's own and some of them I watch with actual tears of excitment in my eyes! However what seems to be the most challenging to wrap one's head around is the consistency with which you innovate at the pace you do. I wish you always succeed to keep doing what you do the way you do it and thank you for all the inspiration you provide to us car enthusiasts! Peter
The passion Inhis presentation
I love this Swedish company
Much love from 🇲🇽  truly a beautiful spec
More details and visuals please.
holy
2850 newton meters of torque 😵 And it's a 4 seated. It's not a family car now...
2300 horsepower, are you fucking joking 💀 and if they can fit this much in a 4 seater, (WITH LUGGAGE SPACE) Imagine what they could do with a 2 seater, the jeskos already outdated! Best car company in the world by soooo far
I'm giggling..... this is just genius ....... absolutely incredible!!!!!!!
I am fully convinced that if Christian and Elon got together we would have Anti Gravity Drive in 5 years time.... Dude you are a mad genius!  WoooooooW!!!!!
I would love to drive that car, car.
This is just the max prestige LS swap
This is the best car company in the world
you managed to push the already impressive car to new heights, koenigsegg is really something else.   this is my most favorite car ever, my dream car, koenigsegg Gemera
BUT WAIT THERE’s MORE 🙌🏼
Koenigsegg is the only car company that when asked why their product is several million dollars they reply with: we invented the technology.   Every other company asked the same question replies with: we have a nice logo and use existing technology.
I actually shed tear over aweseomeness of this car. Christian and his crew are driving the car industry to where noone thought was possible
Once again Koenigsegg proving why they make the best hypercars!
More seats than cylinders
This guy is a genius
i need money
this is insane. Sign me up.
This to cars what the millennium falcon is to soace ships, fast AF but you could live in it comfortably
The madman shoved a V8 in there…
Great....now my keyboard is full of drool. What a vehicle.
Thats the dream car 🤤
Obviously the work that they do and the innovation is exceptional, to put it mildly... And they are leading the industry in that regard.   But what makes it even more striking is the fact that the founder and CEO himself not only presents the car, but knows every inch of it, and does it in a simple and direct manner with no extravaganza... That makes it even harder to find.
Christian and everyone at Koenigsegg are just so far ahead of the rest of the competition it’s genuinely staggering. For a small volume manufacturer to come up with such innovative technology that puts the big corporate brands to shame never fails to astound me.
Dude, what is everyone else doing? Lol unbelievable 🥲
Nürburgring incoming. 😎
Was not expecting this , wow ! people are going to be mad they passed on it
Only Koenigsegg can give their customers a production car that delivers more than the prototype version. Amazing.
I’m lost for words 😳🤩
I think this car was made to prove a point and its a beast of a car😍
Thats the first koenigsegg that appeals to me.
I think we will see functioning lightsaber and hovering speedster in less than 10 years
I kinda wanted him to get in the backseat :D
Lets call this car what it is, its the first Hyper Tour
4:01 Doesn't the BMW iX M60 have a 6 phase motor on it's rear axle?
OMG... omg... That's engineering at it's best while others are getting locked on only electric! I'd really love to test that family car and give my thoughts.
Mind blowing level of ingenuity, the folks at Space X are sitting with their jaws wide open.
Imagine if they had a Formula 1 team...
It's funny to see how they innovate every year like they are facing some competition 😂
Christian is the only guy I could listen to for days on end and would never get bored
Formula 1 could learn a thing or two from this guy
Elon who?  CVK is the GOAT.
elon and koni are easily the most hands on automotive brand owners, never ever disappoints
When are you going to do the top speed test of the absolut? It’s been over 3 years now
Porsche have left the chat 😅
Gemera  лучший  автомобиль в мире!!!  SUPER!!!
holy crap
2300bhp :O I have no moar words <3
the regera just broke the 0-400-0 record and it looks like this is gonna beat it with four seats and then the Jesko is probably gonna beat that. Koenigsegg doesnt cease to amaze
Now to watch it break records 🫠🫠
I need a new car to take the wife and kids skiing in Feb 23 for a 10 hour trip.  Chuck some 4S on those wheels, and I might even enjoy that drive back.
This was supposed to be uploaded on April Fool's right???
3 cylinder hypercar, welcome to Koenigsegg, we do it differently around here.
Really Impressive, exceptional, superb car, a masterpiece of engineering!  Outstanding work, Cristian, you have reached a new level: a hypercar from another world.
I love how Christian always sound really stoked about the cars he makes. He's been doing this for over two decades now, but he still sounds amazed by everything they pull off.
Koenigsegg are just incredible on its  own
Hats off Christian.
Absolutely unbelievable, and not to be smug but I predicted they’d go down the V8 route months ago, after the newer compact transmission and the Jesko’s development allowing for the engine to fit. Koenigsegg are at the forefront of the new generation of performance motoring and I’m all for it. What a car, i want one when I’m older - pray for me guys!
The Bugatti Chiron was always considered the ultimate car, combining supreme luxury, looks, and speed. This car beats the Bugatti in every way and adds one crucial feature on top of that: Maximum practicality. The Koenigsegg Gemera is truly the ULTIMATE car, and will continue to be for a very long time. Congratulations Christian and your team for such amazing and innovative work. You’re truly challenging the entire landscape
the cup holders alone are awesome, but HOLY SHIT idek how this was possible
Yeah. This is pretty amazing.
add this car to Forza Horizon 5 plis @Forza @koenigsegg
and this is why koenigsegg will always be top 1 in the industry
You know its a big deal with Christian isnt wearing his floral button ups
9/11
You guyes are incredible!!!
Why are people saying it has a v8??
When it doesn't fit, they bend the laws of physics to make some more room.
How narrow can a stage be? Koenigsegg: YES
Koenigsegg is really tackling the challenge of being one of the fastest grocery getter
Koenigsegg is pretty much the only name in the business that's still innovating and creating something that's an experience and not just flapping the same gum motions again and again. The technical achievements alone are stunning. When you add up the whole package and purpose, it's an out of this world car.
Otroligt imponerande, stort grattis!
All the time and money spent on the 3cyl engine is wasted. Everyone is going to order the V8 version!
Omfg 😍😍😍😍😍
without words .. this guy is the elon musk of automotive design
this is officially my dream car
AND on topp of this insane its looks really good. 😊
My lord
Wow I absolutely love the koenigsegg gemer definitely one of my favourite koenigsegg koenigsegg is on another planet of being different innovative and very impressive what an absolute beautiful super hyper car wow
this is insane innovation. a car truly worth every penny.
voiture pour gosse de riche....totalement inutile...
Koenigsegg is just like apple company when jobs was alive ! But in a different industry 💯
Koenigsegg will always be my favourite brand
How 🤯Crazy 😂👋👋👋
INcredble!!! This is all the Exotic car you need and you can still pick up three ladies from the club. It's a Megasupercar!
there's no way anyone is drinking coffee in my Gemera!
how many kidneys will it cost me?
Alltså vad i helvete är allt jag kan säga
Yes, they fit the jesko v8 in the engine bay that was originaly ment to store a twin turbo 3 cylinder engine...
Please please please reinvigorate the beautiful possibility you created with the CCGT and go racing! This is amazing. I cant imagine how well you could turn a racing formula on its head.
The ultimate touring car!
Bye bye 3 cylinder :)))))
That voice-over verges on parody. I laughed out loud when it came on.
If KOENIGSEGG ever plan to go into F1 the rest of the manufacturers will play for second place.
Wow.. it’s amazing. Koenigsegg You made it ❤
its good that its not electrical shit
Something tells me they're on  a pay-us-before-we-start-building-it basis....
Are we back to the golden age of cars ?
Viva las Von Koenigsegg
2300 hp lol in a family car, good luck with that.
You guys are nuts 😆😆😆
You won me over with the cup holders 👍
nice to know i can take the whole family around the Nürburgring
It is fucking AMAZING
2300 hp wtf
You can never imagine of what this guy can do and his company.. he put every other car manufacturers to shame with his innovation and technology
Cant wait for Doug to review it and give it a Doug score!! Thisss!!!
I can’t wait to see what is next from them 👀 very amazing car
😍
Lex Luthor ! I called it first! :D
pushing boundaries
Wait. Is Mega above Super and below Hyper?
Wow, Wow, more Wow. First off, that is one fantastic looking car!  This company never stops innovating, never stops thinking "what can we do next" When you look at the masses of boring cars out there Koenigsegg never stops putting a smile on your face
Thank you Christian, beautiful 👏🏿
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This is amazing ! Love the Koenigsegg ! I will make a lot of shorts about this !
Whats up with the wheels though
This is just pure genius. Koenigsegg is just unreal.
Koenigsegg what a beautiful car🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👏🏾👏🏾🎊
Like someone is gonna buy the 3 Cyl version...
Is my mind playing tricks on me or are the front tires actually larger than the rears?
Absolutely amazing, you and your team are legends of motoring.👏 Now where's that lotto ticket 😁
I'm starting to think Koenigsegg is developing alien technology.
Off. The. Charts...  This is outrageously good in every way.
BTW. Buy that "Emily" - Project from NEVS. It's very well designed, looks like a SAAB - EV. I think that a lot of your buyers or fans of Koenigsegg, would like a "normal" car as well from your brand.
The engineering is simply staggering 😳🤩🔥🙌🏻
F1 technology look out of date and a joke in comparison to these road cars 😂😂😮
this car is simply mindblowing, but away from that, i noticed that the main camera is getting out of focus point as it moves away from the subject, also that filter that gives the man a yellow edge on the left.. anyone noticed. please videographers share your thoughts !
one day. i will buy this car.
This man is too smart
Imagine what wizardry Koenigsegg could pull with an all electric megacar
No other cars are in the same catogory as koenigsegg!
Well done all around... well presented!
This is the most revolutive car in this century. If I could get one car in my lifetime, it would be this. What a masterpiece.
Satan i gatan...!
I have nothing to say... 😮😮😮
You are not even close to RIMAC.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE
Next level engineering art.
Absolutely mind boggling 4seater hyper car
See you soon!!
Finally! 🙌🏽
Plz  put this car in forza
This is another level. OMG
Well, Koenigsegg just completed the automobile. This is the final frontier.
The launch feature has to be very violent!
Unbelievable. Mind-boggling engineering. Koenigsegg is the epitome
keonigsegg should join le mans
It's absolutely stunning.
I could not believe the words that came out of the speakers in my monitor so I watched it again after wearing some headphones, and I still cannot believe it.
Wow. That’s incredible. I didn’t expect a Jesko drive train at all
"Finish him" Koenigsegg wins!
Amazing, this man is a visionary and is always pushing cars to the next level where else other car companies drag thier feet
So impressive, loving it 😎
Wait!! There's a V8 version!?!? Daaaaamn that's so badass. 2300hp!
Sweden used to be a great country, this company makes me hope it still is. This is market leading, the SpaceX of the Nordic
They stole YASA motor's design.
bruh did they beat the jesko absolut already
It is hard to believe that this is real. I mean it's amazing!
Will our old cars be able to run on "renewable fuel"? Or they will force us indirectly by making it impossible to drive our beloved cars, to change our cars to new cars which are capable of running on renewable fuels? That would mean I'd need to sell my Koenigsegg?
WOW, just WOW! I was already excited for this car because of the uniqueness it is bringing to the market and now they upped the ante by making a hot V version of the Jesko V8 engine! They are the modern era madmen of hypercars. The multiple patents on transmissions, electric motors, door hinge system, and extensive use of carbon fibre like none other automaker out there yet!!! I really want one of those Dark motors and a battery pack to retro fit to a truck and see how it would do vs the diesel motor since it makes similar torque numbers.
me looking at this video like ill ever get a chance to buy one lol
Christian, you're a great narrator. Also the Gemera is the perfect family car, love it. Can't wait to dive one!
Koenigsegg is SO far ahead in the automotive world, there's literally NO competition anymore for them. Christian said all those years ago that he could do better than any other brand out there, and I challenge ANYONE to find a brand that makes better vehicles that are technologically more advanced than a Koenigsegg.  It's not even fair. Koenigsegg is not just kicking everyone's butt, they are EMBARRASSING the entire world with their vehicles. There are SuperCars, and then, there are Koenigseggs. Literally, they're in their own world, in their own Galaxy, in their own Universe. NO. ONE. CAN. TOUCH. THEM!
SICKKK.
They make all their R&D cost back on the sale of one car.
HELL YES. Glad they did not go homosexuall and only made a 3 zylinder (or some electric dogshit) absolute legends
wasnt it supposed to be a 3 cylinder
The Gemera is the result a bunch of mechanic geniuses and millionaires passionate for cars started thinking "What if" while building a car
Ever since I saw it I wanted one
That engine into Regera and instead of three Yassa electric engine it could be 3 Quark engine and Regera can have 2600hp and AWD...insane future
Just when you think no one and nothing can out do Koenigsegg, Koenigsegg out-do themselves.
That double brake caliper in the rear is awesome. Is it a parking brake?
But does it have Isofix?
I wonder how "Jesko Ultimate/Absolute +" with the 2300bhp could look like to to set the speed record...Koenigsegg is achieving tremendously in its engineering department and possibilities seem to be endless I am not stopping dreaming!...the end point of others is where Koenigsegg begins it seems.....that much power, luggage capacity, that drive train configuration all crammed into that one package beggars belief! Keep re-writing automotive history Koenigsegg.
Start planning that crossover. Nobody buys cars anymore
WTF!!
It's green because that car is a monster
Holy god😱
Well Done! First car in years that I would like to have. Now I must focus on those tricky Lottery numbers, that never match the numbers I choose...
let me order one even tho I’m broke
Now this car is awesome, it's probably the most awesome car I've ever seen.
2:10 it looks even harder to get in and out of now.  old version https://youtu.be/1mPmCDS66Qc?t=351
I need to hurry up and win the lottery man
dafuq? like, this seems like one of those silicon valley, "we can do anything in a small package" thing - but this is koenigsegg, this is for real :O yeah, sold, anyway, how much?
Absolute automotive masterpiece.
dem grapes are sour, shut up! 😁
They really REALLY need to be an F1 engine manufacturer.
Holy shit, a family car with 2300bhp, lucky for me I can never afford one. :D
looks like shit for a koenigsegg are you serious
2300hp in a 4 wheel drive, 4 seater car that can hold 4 carry on suit cases with a 100L fuel tank.. mind boggling isn’t the word
Take it to the top!
the best car
I have never been so excited, for something so remotely that im never going to own. Or probably even see.
i could hear him talk for hours ....
Buying this with lottery
How the hell is this possible. Other supercar manufacturers have to get bought out by VAG or they'll go bankrupt and then Koenigsegg with its 400 employees is doing shit like this? HOW?
Also forgot to mention.  The best 4 seater car ever
I'm still waiting for the drag race between any koenisegg and the nevera
What have they just done 😂
Koenigsegg engineers are out of this world! Mind bending tech!
Bloody Ell Del.
Gamera is a friend to all children
Hello.
What the absolute fuck did I just watch
Its not often I comment. But this is over delivery and a well appreciated one at that. You have successfully surprised me and have surpassed my expectations of you. Hats off man. Truly, hats off.
This is in another realm of engineering. I cannot begin to imagine the performance figures 😮
In german we say "Technik die begeistert" normally as an ironic poke at technology not working as intended, and thus not exciting us. But in this case, I mean it unironically. This technology and level of innovation and dedication is truly amazing.
No words  Just wow 👏🏼
hoped for 400+ run, sad
2300bhp…..🤯
That's wild
all i can say is that i have a new dream car, and i recon i will most probably always dream of owning this mind boggling piece of machinery
😮 impressive ❤
I'm waiting to see gemera vs nevera on the drag strip . Please carwow make it real
Koenigsegg is to ferarri what bugatti is to lamborghini
JUST WOW! I DONT BELEAVE IT! WE MUST SEE IN REAL THE 2 OPTION OF ENGINE SYSTEM FIRST. WITHOUT THE REST OF THE CAR! WE ARE TALKING THAT THIS IS THE 4 SEATER MIURA OF OUR TIME!
Just listening to this giving you goosebumps!! Koenigsegg is just on its own league! The engineering level and technology possibly the best ever in automobile history. I know it sounds loud but look how much new ideas they brought to car industry! Bravo Koenigsegg 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I know that your workers and your peers admire you. You're a genius. For once, if money weren't an object, I'd prefer the 1600hp to the 2500hp version (I admit those figures are inaccurate)
If there are 👽 working with humans,this is the company they are signed under 😅
So a casual 600hp upgrade,  like it's a piece of cake. 1700hp in such car was already brutal,  2300hp is unreal. Gemera can easily be added as 8. wonder od the world. I am speechles. 🙌💀
great car ! ... looks same as a cayman at the rear
Koenigsegg never fails to fail. No wonder so many choose to buy Bugattis instead.
GAME OVER!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is Gemera?
I will take two.
Everyone in their Bugatti and Tesla Plaid are punching the air right now!
can wait until the Rodan edition come out. Go go Power Ranger powe sword activate!
Imagine if Koenigsegg entered f1, they would kill the competition with this kind of engineering.
The teamwork of this masterpiece is simply mind blowing ... they turned the impossible into existence
This is mind-blowing. These numbers had me thinking I was high😪. Koenigsegg ushering us into a whole new dimension of super cars
I'll have 2!
Out of this world engineering
imagine what they would do if they just built car for race track without comfort or trying to fit 4 people in tiny car 🤯🤯
by far the most beautiful machine yet
Speechless. Absolutely speechless. I don’t want any other car now. This checks off all the boxes ever.  Also you know the engineering had to be nuts when CVK says it was difficult. 🤯
Koenigsegg is like that girl who's always gassed up guys that she never notices her flaws
How is the world could you top something like that?  It's literally impossible it's has 2300hp, 4 seats and a truck size fuel tank.  That is a fucking vehicle bottom line!
My mind needs re-calibrating, this is incredible! 👏😀👍
The Rimac is amazing but this car especially with the V8TT is on a different level. Engineering is out of this world. A single small electric motor called the dark matter... what!
Mind bending technology. Been waiting for this day since the 2020 motor show. Thank you Koenigsegg ❤
Masterpiece! Congratulations to Christian and the team
Is it faster than basil expedition?
Wait, so it's still mid-engined???  Mind blowing!!!!
That is so impressive, extra cream on every level 😎😎😎👍👍👍
haha .. helt otroligt!
2400hp hypercar station wagon  jesus fuck 😂😂😂😂😂
The 3 cylinder model would be the one I'd buy, if I had the money.
Even in the heat of battle Koenigsegg doesn't miss
this right here is the true definition of God Mode Status
”Enjoying the experience together”? So when can I come and get one of them? 😊
Their fucking naming sounds like it was made up by a gaming company "Turbillone transmission" "Dark Matter e-motor"  "Megacar"  It's just missing the RGB
Things are always better when they have a tourbillon
Can’t wait for Doug to do a full review of this
Practicality and Koenigsegg in the same sentence lol but this is incredible.
absolutely amazing.
no noooo no, 2300hp, 4 seater? are f serios? i need a cup of espresso, fast
wtf Koenigsegg this supposed to be somewhat competition for other car makers. Ya'll just took this out of the moon. 2300hp in a 4 seater is not even dreamed by anyone.
Christian is the Enzo of the Millenium. Time will show but I think he'll be an even bigger legend. That guy is pure genius
Can a wooorking man afford one? 😉
You make me proud to be a Swedish engineer! 😊
Why is Elon Musk more famous than this G.O.A.T
The swedish Elon Musk
we need a fully electric Koenigsegg!
WHAT!?
CVK is not human and also not from this planet.😐😐😐
the entire family be pulling up in one of these
Just wow! Congratulations, you're a genius 👑👑👑✅
holy fuck!!!
Wow!
Genius !!! 👏🏻
engineering on another level
He had to watch a lot of star trek
I keep hearing a lot of numbers…..then he said fits 4 carry on lauguge in the car 😮 holds 100fuel litre 🤯
2,300 hp and nearly 3,000 nm is insane wtf
That isn't a car , it's a land train
Game over. Arguably the best car ever made.
What a time to be alive and owing only a bicycle
Hell to the frickin yeah! Oh these cars are masterpieces! This car is blowing a frickin way!   Ohhh I love Koenigsegg
I LOST IT  when he said they fitted the V8 from Jesko!!  we are lucky to be living in the same era of christian von koenigsegg! What this man has acheived in last decade cannot be matched by any company! what a car he has created! wow
That is just insane!! The Gemera must be the one and only perfect car...
The only car maker that's actually inventing anything... and it's not just anything.. it's groundbreaking everytime
A 1400hp 3 cylinder?! That's crazy
those numbers are insane.  like mind boggling. i dont understand.
did he just say 2300 hp?
Most expensive cup holders in car history! 😃
This is the only company that makes me feel I am missing out on not being a 'car guy'. Their passion for craftsmanship and performance is super contagious.
Wow.  Please don't let Manny get one and park it in his garage.  Let people who will drive it get one.
I am just waiting for auto journalists to review this car and have their minds blown.
The absolute best in the solar system
W T F  😂😂😂
Christian is the final boss of the automotiv industry
Wow just wow! Amazing engineering! I wonder what the split will be for the 2 engine sizes? What does everyone think? I would imagine a lot would go for the V8.
I want one.
I bought 5 of those already.
Climate controlled cupholders! mate REVOLUTIONARY!
We’re too young to witness Henry Ford or Enzo Ferrari in their prime, but we’re alive at the same time as Christian Koenigsegg himself. I don’t think we should take that for granted
looks like my next car
I need one 😭😭😭
Simply amazing
Gemera or "ge mera" means "give more" in Swedish
holy shit.
& Tesla still didn't launch the Cybertruck & the Roadster
I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E
Amazing. The future is now with Gemera
this car is just mind blowing, Koenigsegg is just a crazy good company. It´s gonna be interesting to see if the remiac can beat it.
OMG 😱 Just amazing 😍  You are the best 👍🏻
YAAAAASSSSS, well done Koenigsegg!
When you say "to offer you all an experience", does that mean I can expect a track day invite in the post?
Has Koenigsegg won the car?
CHRISTIAN, AND THE MEGA TEAM. YOU'VE MADE A MONSTER!!!! I've never been in such awe in mylife at a car premiere.
Yet the new c63 weighs 2100kg, 💀
Sheesh,,,just sheesh
No car manufacturer even comes close. None.
Engineers are in another level.
Koenigsegg > bugatti
The best of the best👍🇬🇧
The stuff this company comes up with is other worldly! When he said about the jesko engine I near fell over!!!! And I'm sitting on the sofa!!😂
This is pure perfection. The ultimate dream car for me. Well done
I personally liked a more angular shapes of the concept more, especially the doors. But again, fitting this V8 with a transmition in such a small space in just incredible.
Literally astonishing. My jaw is slack.  I cannot be more impressed.
well, who would not want to own 1 of these ... :} greetings!
the King in automotive industry strikes again ..Thank you Christian Von Koenigsegg and your whole team..You are awesome !
MR JWW spec Gemera. NICE.
Varje gång jag ser något nytt som du Christian och ditt team tagit fram, blir jag så stolt och tårögd av att vara svensk! Tack så mycket, av hela mitt hjärta.
this is insane
Whatever they are smoking over there, I want some
Why's it got the ass of a Cayman?
WoW! Just.... Wow! 🤯😳
Sucks to be poor
I really hope to see the Gemera next Weekend at Goodwood FOS.... God I love this Company and their Brainiacs
Please do not go the EV route. You are our last hope
Simply the best 👻
he was really proud about the coup holders
Damn! Can we please get Koenigsegg to have a Formula 1 team?? Imagine their expertise, technology and innovation in that style of car and sport!
Nice, good job
I cried.
Once again Koenigsegg have outdone themselves with another masterpiece. The technology is literally out of this world. If you pressurise the cabin it will look in space as if it belongs as a space ship. Bravo!
A car than anyone can buy! Just like the Volkswagen Beetle. Im amazed this company even exists and that there are fools willing to pay 2-5 million USD for them, ignorance, stupidity and pride never has known any limits on this planet! :) We never needed any batteries since we have had FREE ENERGY since the 1890 and anti gravity since 1954, none of it is used for obvious reasons. Everyone is living in a LIE
It's a shame the world is going g away with combustion engines because this man and his company are changing everything once known about this type of power plant
I think by bringing v8 option in gemera they have done unjustice with Jesko..In my opinion Jesko should've been the car with 2300HP
I'd love to drive into the local garage and ask them to the transmission on this car and see what they say.
There are no words for this
Just mind blowing
its insane, simply insane
I would love to see Koenigsegg in Formula One.
This is what over achieving a product looks like.. then over achieve it some more because, why not 🤷‍♂️
Insane! 🤯
Can't wait to see carwow race this omg 2300 HP I will buy one
Wow, just wow. This is mind-boggling. This makes me wonder what will Mate Rimac do to make the next Bugatti "better" than this.
Koenigsegg doesn’t get enough credit for always pushing the envelope and reinventing the wheel
Koenigsegg is the reason Bugatti had to buy Rimac because with innovation like this... Bugatti would've gone out of business.
600hp from 3 cylinders is just insane. Bravo Cristian, you never fail to amaze us!! 💪💪
Never been a big fan of Koenigsegg, but this is beyond impressive. I am baffled.
Big Cayman
Next video: Oh hi its christian van koenigsegg we actually found a way to make a 1l 2cylinder engine that runs on water and produces 3000nm of torque and 6000hp
They bent the freaking spacetime
holy shit that v8 fit is making this car so much better
Impossible! 😮
Чума авто. 🤝👍👌🫤😎🇷🇺
Nailed it!😃
Watching this while drunk is really epic
Engineering masterpiece. As a mechanic I am flabbergasted. Just stunning...
Unprecedented 💯❤️
Koenigsegg did it again. When you think you know what they are doing, you are already running behind. Best car company in the world!!
Words fail me
Just wow  😂
Bugatti headquarters are in a state of panic
❤Gemera❤
This is impressive.
Time to replace my VR6 MK4.
loose the electric engine , its a shame its in there , we need to disable EV cars , fuck them . Petrol for life ! nice that u put a V8 in there , but a V10/V12 was preff. better .
THey should have called it the Chimera because it looks like it wants to be everything, and succeeds
Great innovation! Love to see you pushing the bounds of technology. On one end of the high end csr spectrum is your team making some of the finest engineered vehicles ever! And on the other is Pagani, making some of the most beautiful things you've ever seen on 4 wheels.
Ths is utterly mindblowing. I can't wait to see it perform. If I'll ever have the money, this, and the Jesko is on the list for sure.
2023 rolls royce Company
Now, everything you need to add is a tow bar
I have a Question Christian. What does this car not have??
Christian Koenigsegg probably has someone on his staff with the role of frequently telling him "it can't be done".
Salute to Koenigsegg for making such an engineering marvel. This is the future of Earth, sustainable, fun, fast and did I mention fast.👍
They should be making warp drive for space ships.  I think they could do it.
2300 HP, holy cow this thing will fly, we have a new Bugatti killer. Congrats.
I want to see a fully Electric Koenigsegg with one of those motors driving each wheel. Imagine having 800hp 1250nm with torque vectoring at each wheel?  Combined hp of 3200 and 5000 torque doubt any battery could handle such a thing. Maybe having one electric motor front and back would be more plausible
I hope it's legal in Portugal 🇵🇹...How much would it cost!?
At this point with Koinigsegg need to start developing engines for flying craft they have genius engineers, very impressive with their clutches and drive trains
That is how we do it in Skåne!
this is the car ever
Just a kid enjoying cars, that’s what this company is and I love it
Two things. Reminds me of the Lamborghini Muira 👌🏾  Mercedes can no longer call a 4 door sports sedan a Coupe. Mercedes just stop.
This is stupid! Like damn how are yoh guys doing thus
More seats than cylinders
7:49 If I was ever in the back of that thing, I wouldn't be able to focus on netflix
Koenigsegg: we built this! Other car brands: what?! How in the hell… koenigsegg: this is how we did it! 😁 other: what??
V8 + hybrid + 4 seats + bigger fuel tank + lugage space. A car like this was unthinkable just moments ago. So, where do you go from here?   I know their next car will be even more amazing, but I can't even imagine... HOW?!
Family Hyper car 🎉
Or you can just buy a Tesla Model S Plaid for a fraction of the price or that car, get your whole family in and still beat that car.
I just love Koenigsegg. Their design & engineering = absolute masterclass. 🔥
What a nice MEGA car! wow with I could afford one someday! Great Spec on this car
Ok you convinced me. I'll take one.
What?! How is this possible? it’s even better than I expected from the prototype. Amazing.
_holy frick, the V8 inside that_ with _AWD,_ with _4 seats_
Christian and Koenigsegg are the gold standard of the super/hyper/mega car world.   When I win the 650 Mega Millions lotto tonight I will order one of each from Christian. Well done once again!!!
The car is no-doubt 🔥🔥🔥 but do we get the custom Koenigsegg designed suitcases too as goodies? 😬😂
You must have lost your mind, of course, we all love it!
Congratulations, you did it, the practical hypercar!
Poor tyres… 😂
Next model the niggera💀
What they achieved in the transmission and combination of electric and ICE drivetrain will be talked about for years. Insane innovation.
Amazing if I could afford  a hyper car it be a Koenigsegg
I mean we've known kind of what the Gemera is all about for a long time now. But man...I did not expect the V8 option...bonkers xD
WOW❤❤❤❤
It's like Koenigsegg is telling the entire auto industry "Hold my beer"😂
Yeah experience for sure .. anyone buying these things is not traveling anywhere by cars anymore anyway
Koenigsegg i just saying "check mate" to the Germans French and Italians every year and that is beautiful . what a beautiful  piece of a car! 😍
These cars don't really get enough attention for how absolutely insanely awesome they are.
Was this video artifacting for anyone else really badly?
I would like to buy one.. in Gran Turismo
The 3 cylinder, twin variable exhaust per cyclinder 3 valve sequential turbo set up is truly remarkable. And that 9 speed gearbox.....
Why am i broke??? There are so much cars that would make me happy
Serious question.  Will the V8 version be capable of 300mph given its weight and power?
This looks like a fusion of a mclaren and a porsche, looks wise
Exceptional work and we're happy to share it out.  Remember us when this does its tour again.  It was great to see it the first time and even better to see what you've done with it.
Elevou o nível da parada!!!!
Insane
love your cars
The Dream hyper Car
The amount of innovation brought by Koenigsegg in the automotive world is astonishing.
Gemera or ge mera or give more
What I love so much that even when presenting such a great work of engineering the way its spoken about is simple and straight to the point
That's the meaning of MEGA!
Bravo Koenigsegg! Never stop creating miracles!
Another useless, that 99.9999% of them never seeing sunlight hangar queen show room car. I’d like to see four adopts travelling 200-400km in that rock hard thing .. yeah …. Right ..
koenigsegg are so brilliant at building cars! imagine them in f1. not saying they should but damn theyd be good
I was speculating on a 4 speed version of the lst with a evolution of the regera  hydrocoup. Did not see the 2300hp Jesko engine option coming at all. Mike Patey "every time something new is created the whole world advances". Congratulations team Koenigsegg!
A work of Art.👌💢
2850 nm of torque 😂 good grief christian.. seems like you want sed family to die of terror in your car 😂 damn that is CRAZY.  2200 Hp 😳
I'm thinking of buying one. How much was it again??
Just wait till you see the SUV! Oh, it’s coming! You’ll see
Koenigsegg, siempre lo mejor
What's the point with the horizontal cross  on the seat back. Is i a A-moral car? It will definitely give a bad feeling for a christian who is not fallen. But i ges it will enjoy a satanic person who knows that it soon will be upside down as it goes with people and their kids theese days. It isn't Scandinavian tradition, but it could be a new inverted swedish standard.
U know it’s a beast when the car has more seats than pistons
I will have one some day.
My jaw is on the floor.....but who on earth is going to want the 3 banger ????
“Insane!”  I like the understated nature of that statement 🤗
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Looks like that dark matter created a space portal which is why they can fit everything
For me this the car, THE CAR !
I love Koenigsegg since the days of the CCS i also love Bugatti however Koenigsegg in my eyes has always been in a different league. Amazing cars and way ahead of everything else 👍👍👍
My new favorite car honestly. The Agera RS1 stays in my heart though.
Best and badest car company in the world!
Do you take cashapp
I legit just remembered how badly I wanted this car on my way home today and I come home to this 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
Even if you're not into cars this is a great car and commercial.
I'll get two of them please
GAME OVER.
people at koenigsegg, I love you!   I love your ideas, your design, your philospohy, your innovation, your cars and your boss.  Not in my budget, but I like to dream! :)
OMG🤯
This level of innovation that is without an equal has no competition at all, hence the “Megacar” title. Well done and well deserved. 😍
Comment section is so full of people like me
I just hope that koenigsegg doesn't shoot themselves in the leg by bringing out both versions at the same time. I mean if you can get an V8 one...
I'm drooling watching the stats on repeat 🤤🤤🤤
At a time when everyone is going EV, Koenigsegg comes out of nowhere and builds a monster of a car that everyone can experience. This car will go down in history as one the greatest car of all time. :O
This car is gorgeous. Definitely will be my first hypercar.
looks like a very efficient barf-machine for the rear passengers
2400hp!? God damn that is some seroius juice and its a 4 seater!
They did it again. Jesus Christ. ^^
Boy am i dreaming right now, is THIS going to be on the streets!!?? The next thing koenigsegg will build is an full on flying car that can also drive! If there is one company capable of building this its gonna be koenigsegg for sure!
Bro I’m impressed. 😮.. This my dream car Fr. One day 🙌🏽🔝
Wow wow wow
I never even considered you folks getting into the touring car arena.   But here you are....absolutely above and beyond imagination.  Once again raising the bar  Excellent work people!!!
tbh for business this is not the best thing to do you should've stayed with the tfg engine and kept the v8 for a RS or like the sec sequel
Im happy to see Koenigsegg get the recognition these days and the respect they rightfully deserve. Back when they had the CCR, nobody was talking about them. I remember arguing with people saying Bugatti this and that, saying what the hell is a koenigsegg etc etc. Now look how far theyve come with the community.
Nice
how many of u think agera had better design than this?
I want to see that dark matter E-motor or some variant in a motorcycle.  WOW.  Just WOW.  Unreal.
I love to see Christian on FoS this Friday and thank him for everything what he has done for Motorworld ❤
The exterior looks like a mediocre aston martin.. Disappinting design tbh..
And now all I have to do is to win the euro lottery three times and i can own one!!!!!!
The options list:  Standard pack, entry-level Mega-car.  Optional extra, small power upgrade for Giga-car
In the history of supercar brands, there have been periods where certain automakers have excelled compared to the competition. Now, it is undoubtedly Koenigsegg's time. You are witnessing living history.
I wanna imagine the reason they threw in the Jesko V8 is just because they felt like it
Know we need a 3 cylinder turbo roadster with those 600HP and one gear transmission to compete with the big powerhouses Porsche, McLaren, BMW, Audi  Mercedes-Benz!!
These guys are fucking insane! Like dude, 2300hp, AWD hybrid, 100L tank, less than 2000kg , fits 4 people with luggage comfortably and looks like a proper 2 seater! That just simply does not sound like something that should be possible.
Have to say, it's about time!
I'm lost for words. I can't wait for the Engineering Explained analysis of this car
Every swede: I'd rather have a volvo..
Outstanding, when the Agera came out I could not believe it was real now this? Are you kidding me? They just keep pushing the envelope and embarrassing the italians and germans
Beautiful!
Ayo calm down lmao
You are crazy!!
Keep up the good work! This is awesome.
Wow! Imagine 2300hp and 2850n.m torque  🤔🔥
part of the thrill of having a supercar is sharing it with others thats why all the people that owns them have gopros and uploading videos. but you cant really enjoy that when they are all 2 seaters. now this is truely a game changer car that i will never own cuz im so poor :D fml
Damn. 🔥
Man this car is just perfect, the engine is amazing, the design is insane and that color scheme is crazy easily one of the best hypercars ever produced plus it has 4 seats making it way more practical than any other hypercar, this is truely amazing
This is the one I’ve been waiting for
Astonishing!
Why not make it full-electric from the start ?
Which one came first, Koenig or the Egg?
holy fuck, awesome windows
Tourbillion? Like the mechanical watch component?
Let's make the prediction now: K-egg will be the first company to put the flux capacitor into production. Within the next 7 years.
👌
I can not take Koenigsegg seriously or respect the brand until I see more reviews and longterm tests. You never see lap times and other car journalist say that people who own them say they never work. If this car works then I am saving my pennies but its a practical Koenigsegg that should be used daily. We will need to wait and see.
Wow! Engineering brains 🧠
Looks like a bigger Porsche. Looks good tho.
Koenigsegg you outdid yourself on the Gemera! 🔥🔥👏😭
Just laughing out loud.
You must learn carwow driving your cars. Create a idiot mode, it might work for him and avoid you looking like bad car makers.
Now we wait for the dragstrip videos..... BTW sustanable/renewable fuels are a myth.
So this will just probably the best, fastest, longest ranged, most exclusive ICE 4 seater this world will ever see! The resale value should be reasonable
Must be nice to be rich😊
They said the perfect car doesn’t exist…
No offence but this has been out for years 😂
this is why i love koenigsegg! no other car maker would ever come up with this crazy stuff
they're on their own league. IN-SANE
the ICE should have been thought as range extender rather than a connected wheel engine
If Koenigsegg would have the financial muscle to take their brand to F1 with their own engine they would have beaten any team. No doubt.
How to did they make the production model better looking than the concept???
i'm going to pre-order 😋😊
When you say "to you all" are you referring to them rich people that can afford it I assume, because we peasants will never have something like this. It's sad but GG for the innovation part of things its an impressive car as for the who can have this, its a dream for 99.9 % of the people. We're too poor for this technology!
so its a transgender?
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
How in the world is this possible ? How can so much fit in this ? Keonigsess is 15 years ahead of the other company
That’s insane… he is a car engineering GOD!!
How about you show 4 people sitting in the car?
"Because I am Matt Watson"
That can´t be real...again... Koenigsegg dit it again an masterpiece ... Thanks for your passion :) Love it.. :)
Absolutely stunning engineering. God help the mechanic that has to work on it though; I can't imagine there's room to work on anything without pulling almost the entire drivetrain out of the vehicle.
The Apple of Super Cars!
Unreal
Yeah, but when can we see it in action?
It's a beast❤❤❤❤
MIC DROP
This is THE car
I was waiting for it and it’s finally here!!! It’s beyond all expectations!!! It’s from different WORLD 😂
They make doing impossible shit look easy
SHEEEEEEEESH
💚
6:13 WTF
Companies like this see the future and embrace it, unlike American car companies. I do want to see companies completely get away from combustible engines
Once again on the razors edge of possibility never satisfied with the last iteration. Stunning.
I want one. Where and when can I buy this.
I wish more people could experience such technological marvels as this car.
Gemera is absolutely amazing!
Mary Poppins is taking delivery of the first Gemera i assume!
Finally a "dark mater" that actually exists 😅
2300 HP car with hot and cold cup holders. Im sold 🙌
That Hansel (Christian) is so hot right now
My next daily
The car, the brand, the door, the engine, the speed, the fuel efficiency, the fuel tank, the acceleration, 😮 Its all MODODOOO!!! Madness 🤯
Som jag sa sist jag träffade Christian när jag var en av alla som va med o byggde nya hallen. "Kan inte vänta o se va du leverera näst" Ja va kan man sä du slutar aldrig att förbluffa en. Tack för du e du och sluta aldrig bygga de vi andra bara kan drömma om.
Mind blown....
NEXT LEVEL
He really peaked the car up to it’s finest possibilities    An actual legend in the car industry
So ice and motor are both connected to the same transmission ? Both use the 9 speed ?
It truly mind boggling 🤯
So cool, i hope the 300 ultra rich owners truely enjoy looking at in while it sits in a garage awaiting for it to appreciate for resale.    Sincerely,  Another poor
GIGACAR, TERRACAR, PETACAR 😂😂😂
how many cup holders does it have?
You are number 1 Sir. Thank you
Blah blah blah...its for millionaires...
In my opinion they should have kept that v8 for Jesko only and have sticked with TFG for gemera because Jesko is there top speed car and gemera is family hyper car..I hope they also use their 2400 HP system in jesko production version...by the way love this beast and huge fan of mr Koenigsegg
Jeeeeeze dude… between Koenigsegg and GMA, they rule the automotive world…
Bro who hurt Von Koenigsegg? Madness!!
a family friendly sport car??! i'm sold
I cant Believe this car is so powerful
This brand has officially become science fiction 🤯
Holy smokes what a car. Wow.
I can't be the only one who kinda wishes there was an "entry level" version with just the 600 hp TFG three-cylinder, right? It's an insanely cool and unique car in any configuration, but 1500 - 2300 hp is so ridiculously powerful that the whole car is overkill. Imagine supercar technology like the TFG in a less expensive, even lighter four-seater, still with 600 hp. It'd be even more legendary as a sports car than just another plaything for the uber-rich. Like a 911 but faster and more practical with an engine half the size and twice as advanced...
That's the Manufacturer which will never disappoint you. Yeah that's Koenigsegg 💥
These are the people keeping automotive company alive  Thanks you ❤
@mrjww I suppose you'll be having the V8 then 😎
Practically the best car in the world
This is mind blowing 💯
Just when you think Koenigsegg can't outdo themselves they outdo themselves, crazy stuff.
dayumm the use of space is insane to fit all that he said in there , wow
Imagine the amount of sick that you could get out of the kid's on the school run!
all they need to do now is make an electric car with a dark matter motor on each axel, 3200 horsepower. God knows how traction will exist on this electric car 🤣
❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Amazing
Now put in the Shift by wire transmission from the cc850 and it is the best car ever produced  Just incredible
my god, they have done it again.
Father of supra 😂
The quickest, most expensive and most stylish way to get to the airport when you're running late for a flight with family or friends.
Bugatti fan boys not gonna like this  one 😂😂😂. Well done Koenigsegg. Its insane what you inovate ans achieve
I don’t get who it’s for. If you want to pay a crap ton of money to go for a 1000 mile tour you buy a luxury saloon to waft you along like a Lexus or Rolls-Royce. Those are quiet and vibration free because they have lots of very heavy sound dampening and soft suspension.  If you want to go sideways on a race track you buy a 2 seater hypercar. If you go sideways in a 4 seater the people at the back are going to puke on you.
This is absolutely beautiful, im proud to be a swede. But one question, how are you going to put all that power down to the ground without the wheels slipping?
"Gemere" in italian means Moaning lol
Now….I want a WAGON version. Not that I could ever afford one. Plus, more interested in range than power.
watching those numbers they made a 4 full grown up man killer machine XD
this car is a technical marvel! respect for so much technology and courage on 4 wheels
This is with no questions, the greatest four seater car ever made.
I want one. I think that says it all keep up the great work . And the great innovations, it can only make the world a better place
put 4 Dark Matters in a new electric Gigacar..
Impressive, but I think Matte has it. Sorry
How they have accomplished it, is mind-boggling with the DARK MATTER
Only Koenigsegg would make the production version BETTER than the prototype!
Damn! They´ve done did it again. A masterpiece! Didn´t expect less from Koenigsegg. Congratulations! Can´t wait to never own one xD
I dream about Koenigsegg going into F1 and show how it's done....
Stop saying "persons"
quoting one of the YouTube Agera R videos: "try this in a Bugatti" )))
So many know-it-alls in the comments correcting people on the 8 cylinder engine without watching the video. God bless the internet.
the fact it has two versions is insane   -let it sink in ( 2300 hp V8 , 2850 torque ( with the electric motor   - A 3 Sylinder making 1400 hp with the electric motor combined is insanity 😮‍💨🤌🏼.    above all that  its only 1 electric motor ( dark matter ).
This company never impress me
I love that this team follows the "what if we could" philosophy and then does it. Idea to Execution
Christian is the Super Hero of automotive industry!
this car is a technical marvel! respect for so much technology and courage on 4 wheels
damn what a car
2300Bhp ?!?! What!?
I hope those bespoke suitcases are compliant with Ryanair’s carry-on luggage rules. Don’t want to get hit with those extra charges.
Next the flux capacitor with 1,1 gigawatts .... Well done Koenigsegg. Very impressive
Esse cara é um gênio. Meus parabéns.  E nasce mais uma lenda. Carro perfeito. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love this man.
They should just enter Formual 1 at this point. A masterpiece 🤌
The look of disgust as im hearing these numbers 😂😂. Like how are the just going to defy logic and put all that power in there. Stupidly impressive.
Next GEMERA SUV ;)
I’m I the only one hoping for a miracle to happen so that I can be able to afford any one of these?
This is one of the coolest cars I have ever seen, and its really not close.
They squeezed a V8 in it? Jesus
You guys are legends!
He is a true genius and visionary. Just beautifully done.
We lost communication with Bugatti...I repeat, Bugatti is missing!
Bring back The Stig!😃
Damn beautiful just too good to be true.. Hats off to you❤❤
i kinda laughed when he said megacar, but after watching that, he might be right
Respect 🙏🏾 talk about being in your own league at the top.
can it drive over 500 km/t now the jesko engine is in it.and can the downforce keep up
Koenigsegg is the gift that keeps on giving.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Personally I rarely make comments about any video but this is peeking technology, peeking design, luxury, engineering.. mind blowing.
Mental.
Christian vonK is a modern Ettore Bugatti!💓👏👏👏
Did not see the V8 coming well done ne
Thats tiny little motor so powerfull and even they put v8 on 4 seat family car, how can it? Just wow for the enginer behind this masterpiece
What the actual fuck, this is incredible.
Please let Sandy Munro tear down the Dark Matter electric motor. I think even he wouldnt believe his own eyes. This car is insane!
Nice. I wondered why Stradman said he was going to Sweden in his latest video.  Hope you are having him as a guest to see your new releases.
So you’re saying I could have a 2500 HP car while enjoying a milkshake?  Real question is, y’all finance?
I love companies like Koenigsegg because they show us what is possible to achieve when we put our minds to something. Amazing machines and one day I hope to own one!
Bro what? TFG concept was already mind blowing! Then put a V8 into an already fucking fast car.!? How are they thinking like that ? 2000+ hp on a road legal 4 seater from factory with AC, infotainment and Heated and cooled cup holders, 100L of fuel tank? Who ever came up with these ideas need raise.
it should be called SUS (sport utility supercar) 😂😂
Koenigsegg just put all the sliders to 11 O_o
The engineering behind this car might as well be sorcery. I can't imagine how intelligent the people working at Koenigsegg are.
BEAUTIFUL
Car of the Year. This is absolutely mind boggling. 🤯
This is one of those things that seems to good to be true on paper, yet it actually exists. Absolutely insane.
Like, especially for the phrase: in house production 💪🏻  Btw did the website just crash now due to unexpected volume of traffic and interest?
Christian such a visionary! Just so impressed with how advanced these guys are. So cutting edge just absurd!
I know envy is a sin,but i wish I was one of the lucky ones who will get to own one.Stunning as always.
Amazing hyper-car! Amazing Koenigsegg!
Love love love the idea
Now I'll have something to take my kids to school in 😁
this is absolutely mindblowing.... im amazed
I have been waiting to hear this 2.0 3 cylinder free valve engine for age's! I hope that's what I heard at the end. It sound's like a turbo charged moto GP bike  ❤!
Wauw takes your breath away if i ever win the lotto :)
Ok when I heard of the V8 option I thought that surely there would be a compromise with the luggage situation. Guess not! Super impressive.
Ain't no way they can fit 4 bags, 100l tank and v8 in one config. My head hurts just thinking about it ;) On the other hand, I'd guess that you have to choose between 2 or 3 options: 100l tank, 3cyl, 4bags; v8, 4 bags, normal tank; v8, 100l tank, 1 or 2 bags; or everything all at once because why not
Yes, this car does look like a camera.
Prefer Morgan Freeman as the VO, but oh well. Sick sled. 🤙
Woooooooooow
This company never ceases to amaze the world with their unbeatable innovations. 2300bhp ? Kudos Koenigsegg 🔥🔥
I love how they just swapped an inline 3 for a fucking V8. Legends
this is the most ridiculously insane thing I’ve ever seen
🤯❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
One day insallah
Please let me be driven in this masterpeace (at least) once in my lifetime. It is my daily dream car from the moment you presented this project.
Hooked me at Dark Matter.
DAMMIT! HOT V FIT THERE?!?!
I’m speechless, just absolutely speechless that such perfection can exist!
Jaw dropping...
❤SUPERLATIVA❤
Riktigt sjuk bil, Kommer aldrig få åka en koenigsegg, men man kan bara drömma
Absolutely brilliant gentlemen right there 👏
Imagine being in the backseat of this at the nurburgring. Watching shrek 2 while your Dad beats records 😂
The repairs on this mf I am more interested to know 😮‍💨
You can always count on Koenigsegg to push the boundaries of engineering. What a massive achievement, and the car looks awesome!
💛
I loved christian von koenigsegg getting excited by the cupholders, he literally pays attention to every single detail of the car from the ground up. He's an inspiration for every engineer
The power of Swedish enginerring knows no bounds. I fell in love with the beautiful Koenigsegg Agera, the CCX, the Jesko, the One:1, and the Regera. With this, the Gemera, with different types of engines, including the V8 with over 1500 HP? Koenigsegg never ceases to amazes me to no end. Props to you Cristian. 👍🏾
I want the 2300+ bhp Gemera 😅
Impressive engineering!
What the hell did I just watch. THey just released a car with literally no compromises. SInce when was that possible, I missed the update
What. The. F*ck. :O
Astonishing
Heatable cupholders. 😂❤
i take 2
Thought he said “Koenigsegg Jumeirah” 🐫 🇦🇪
Christian the rest of the automotive world should be learning from you. I think you should join the F1 gig, something tells me with the right driver it would be childs play for you guys to do very very well.
A v8!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats hard to believe even after seeing it
Koenigsegg is the best production vehicles in the world.
CVK is god tier
I'm already saving for it. Nearly there, just need the remaining 1.699M
Price it right and you got a winner.
Beautiful thing. An engineering master piece. It's a true shame that no one who buys one will ever drive it or use it.
Koenigsegg Shows every time that engineering can be art
They never miss, coolest cars on the planet
I am definately too dumb to work at this company... and yet I would still love to.
I am open for you guys to send me one for test driving. I’ll take real good care of it.
Wow! Epic, Epic, Epic Car! 👍
'DARK MATTER eMotor'.... Only Christian Von could come with a name like this...... They are the best when it comes to Automotive Innovation and naming new technologies both😂
Koenigsegg saw the Doug Score and said "yeah we can do that"
Hi, curious person here from "How in gods sake did you do this"-Newspaper. Just one question. HOW?
koenigsegg: lets make a little less exciting 4 person sports car? also KOENIGSEGG: here is the most exciting car ever produced but it also fits 4 person DAmnnnn
This can't be real, can it? Like... This isn't real... Right..???
cars always innovative, always lighter, always in the right power band, always pushing the envelope, always insanely expensive, always all carbon fiber, always the same shit.  BUT THIS ONE HAS 4 SEATS AND U CAN FIT A HAND BAG IN IT!!!. wow guys. I have a feeling koenigsegg fans are more cult followers than fans. 99.9% of you will never have enough money to even think about putting a down payment on a car like this yet you cum over it as if it was the pinnacle of innovation... Truly a product made and designed for nobody.   All of these cars will sit in garages and will never be used. This shit is starting to look a hell of a lot like a money laundering business.
Booom the king did it again.
Okay seriously is there ANY fault to the gemera because I can't find one at all. 🤯🤯
Wait WHAT?! THIS IS INCREDIBLE!! There are 2 versions of the Gemera, both with electric motors but one with 1700hpin the Little Giant 3 cylinder, AND ONE WITH 2300HP AND THE JESKO V8?!?!?!? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Wtf 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Bloody hell 2300!?! HP HOW 😱😱😱😱, one of my new fav cars. Christian you have done well. exited to see the acceleration numbers, may be in the low - high ones. Try get a car to 3000 HP next time little challenge for you. Stay king mate. 👑 Love from the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 🤝 🇸🇪
Wow! 👍
2300hp !!
Levels!!!!
To those few who bought a Koenigsegg: Thank you, you made this happen.
Saudi Sheiks liked this
hmmm... not convinced yet. id need to take it for a test ride  sooooo when can i come by ?
You guys are on another level - just WOW!
It’s like an Apple presentation I love it
Ford should've gave that gt to Koenigsegg to fit a damn v8 🙄
Right Hand Drive please and talk with the high end dealer in NZ called Giltrap. Price  as stock ? i will want options though.  HR V8 version pls cheers, Ptr
Game changer Respect🫡
Only “hyper car” I would want when m3s and gt3s exist. Sorry rarri *still need the amg wagon tho
That is a crazy amount of performance, especially from a four seater let alone all that storage wow congratulations to the team at Koenigsegg
WOW!
I am honestly scared to know, what this and Jesko can do to records...
It is a diaper car, if you can't handle that power
😦😲🤯
2300BHP in car as light as the Gemera is absolutely mind boggling, and probably borders the line of insanity! Looks like Koenigsegg is about to have yet another land speed record in the books!
Wow, just wow❤❤❤
I acually thought in the intro "hey they put wrong noise over the 3 cyl" and they now say it has the jesko v8 in it? Unbelievable!😮
The egg himself at it again.
This might be their most exciting car they’ve made. I’ve always thought it was a cool concept but had know idea they were gonna make it a 2,300hp beast .
This car is really mindbogling
That car in both forms of hp will sell out .
In a different league
“Production” version. It’s literally a hand built multi-million dollar low volume (how many have they sold again?) car. If Koenigsegg want to impress me, make a $100k (sub-100k would even be better) car with just half the the innovation
This is ridiculous! You already went beyond anything on the market with V1. Now you outperform even yourself. When will this insanity stop? 😂
Why are all these comments sound so artifical?
Goat 🐐
Just one question... HOW?
I HAVE A QUESTIONS FOR THEESE GUYS WHY HAVEN'T THEY USED THIS 2400 HP ENGINE IN THEIR JESKO IT ONLY HAS 1700 HP
6:15 ok, these are numbers 10 years i didnt imagiine i would  ever see them, 1500 hp from a v8 and 2300 hp total
The stats of this car are just mind boggling. Koenigsegg is way ahead of their competitors. They make me feel like they use some of kind of Alien Tech...... This CAR is FASCINATING.
SUV next ?
Calibra DTM style drivetrain, Nice!
What an insane car. Looks like a Porsche 918 Spyder, Cayman S and an AMG One had a lovechild. A lovechild with 2300HP!
cant wait for the configurator to go live so i can make the car i will never buy
Jesko twin turbo V8 + The new dark matter EV motor: huh nice  Heated + chilled cupholders: NOW WE HAVE REACHED THE PINNACLE OF AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING
WoW, this is f*cking insane...
amazing achievement, congratulations
We need to protect this man at all costs!
No way, they're lying… they using iron man technology or autobot technology. These guys make other manufacturers look like they have given up on making cars
That is now my favorite
🤯😍❤️ !!!
Awesome car, sounds like a flesh eating bacteria or maybe a STD.
The fact that it has cupholders is insane
A salute from all the speed demons and mad scientists. Hell freaking yes.
Christian operates on another level
One day… I will shake Mr. von Koenigsegg hand and take the keys.
So it’s a missile on wheels
Will be hard discussion with my wife to decide on which of our 3 children we'll have to give away :-)
I think this car comes with a 3D doremon pack, there’s no way they made it all fit together without a tangible storage 🤯
How long until the inevitable Koenigsegg SUV?
Have followed Christian since the very beginning,  he is a genius of note
Just wish I could afford one 😢
Ok, you sold me! I'll take 1 of each.
This is true engineering genius. We need more minds that solve problems and innovate.
This is the best car ever, no? It does the most amount of different things, and it does them better than anything else. Looks. Engine. Power output. Performance. 4 seats. Transmission, handling, build quality, top speed, EVERYTHING. better.
I’ve been waiting on this video for a few days now
Now no customer is going to want the 3 cylinder version. Almost all Will want the 8 cylinder version though probably cost a substantial bit more. I would go for the 8 WOW
1:38 - Looks like a TVR from the side, yikes!
I would love driving this to get a christmas tree and put it on the roof like a normal family car. But i thinking by the time you come home it lost all its needles😂
I'm still waiting for a video where you can hear the sound  of the TFG,if anyone has a link,please inform me.
This is the most outrageously insane production car I've ever seen. I love it
oh man
What the actual faaark...🤯 Are you guys trying to outrun the Millennium Falcon?   This is the car that will look at a Bugatti Chiron and say. 'Ahh, that's cute' 😁
Mind blowing
Looks great, I hope they'll build more units so both engine options get enough customers.  My guess: the follow up to the Jesko will have a v8 with 2 or more e-motors.  I just wished Koenigsegg stopped giving us horsepower ratings on E85 fuel. It's kind of misleading because it's not easy to get outside of scandinavia (no pump sells it, you'll have to find a dealer which sells drums or tanks of the stuff).  Quote the horsepower on 98 octane fuel would be more honest.
Next level 😮
I love Koenigsegg! 😍
Nice video
Outstanding!
Pogodny, łysy Szwed znowu rozwalił system. 2300KM 😮 Zbieram szczękę z podłogi
This is madness
Imagine, research create and sell. if only all the pHd research papers are implemented like keognigsegg
Holy mother of god
Surely Koenigsegg now have two cars capable of over 300mph…
Theres absolutely no way that you pulled this off. 1500HP V8 in a 4 seater 800HP of battery thats been scaled down 2300HP combined 4WD or 2WD  100L fuel tank 4 big suitcases that can fit in AND AN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IN THE BACK WITH NETFLIX CARPLAY ETC AND HEATED AND COLD CUP HOLDERS????  When they said that they didn't want to do any compromises they really meant that. MEGA job Koenigsegg.
Have your cake and eat it too. Love it....
The revolution has begun
I wanna see Mr JWW blogging all over the place with his future Gemera :o
i really think this guy got connections with the transformers from outer space 😅
Great car! Want one. V8 engine looks amazing, shiney
So excited, now I can watch this thing on YouTube lol  I'd have to sell all the houses I own and won't be enough 😂
This is one of the reasons that koenigsegg is much better than bugatti
Absolutely astonishing. Just when you think you’ve seen it all, and there’s nothing left to do but push numbers in various directions, then along comes Koenigsegg. This car was already remarkable 3 years ago…and now?? Other high end marques must be thinking, bloody hell…
Thanks for bending my mind 👏
Michelin must have come up with something special too to handle that kind of power!
Can you give me one?
This guy is from another planet. No one else is making this many new bespoke technologies than Koenigsegg🎉
I'm sure a lot of persons are going to love this! Jokes aside, an amazing acheivement of a car! Bravo!!
Amazing 🔥
❤❤❤
bro koenigsegg engineers are aliens i cant begin to understand how this machine works
Asså vilken bil! Den ögonblicken jag hörde hästkraften min mun gapade!  Du har aldrig slutat inponera mig!
They are changing the world
Once again Koenigsegg has shown the motor industry how it's done. The new Gemera is absolute masterclass in design and engineering.
Bugatti could never🤲Wow!!!
2300hp... I need!
This company is always ahead of its time , the engineers and designers did an incredible job, the car look and feels epic , well done guys !!!
Christian Von Koenigsegg could be selling me a toilet and I'll buy it....."This toilet, really pushed us to some technological extremes. We set out for for 0.23 seconds flush time but we couldn't unsee what we saw (which was a giant turd by the way)...so, we relased that we needed 0.18 seconds to flush that big stinking monster. Our flushing valve system produces 1800Nm of torque to enable this performance". A set of scenarios narrated by Christian Von Koenigsegg would be a joy to behold.
Like no other🔥
Glad that I'm still alive to witness this ❤
For me there are exactly 2 automobile manufacturers that will always catch my attention: Koenigsegg and Porsche
Why did they go overboard with this😅😅, other companies would feel dipressed
been waiting for this update on the gemera since forever
Where are the Bugtti lovers ??
The packaging on this is insane. They basically have portal axles on their side straddling the engine . Madness
😂 The AMG team that dropped the V8 is going to be kicking themselves after seeing this
It looks so good and don’t get me on the sound
Hope I can be part of the Ghost Squadron someday🤞🏻
Another model released and yet i still cant afford the first model 😅but i ain't going to stop working hard till i can❤
Can I buy 6 qwurty raxial flux dark matter emotors please?
Well I was looking at new Camry’s to fit the family, but I find this to be a little more appealing
It's not a hyper car it's a ultra car
I guess it's 50K or even 100K.  Its not "novel" or innovative at that price.  It's just bored humans (way too many now) that can afford this BS.    At that price, would you expect it to suck?  I'd expect it to be 0-60 in 10 seconds. ;)  Come on with this BS in limited quantities.   I could come up with this crap for that price.  Try reducing the price drastically and see how much money you'd lose.  What an icon at millions for a car.    1.7 million minimum plus service and wait for this POS.  Come on.  I'll take this to the local grocery store or airport.  4 seats.......very necessary.    Milkshake and a coffee on the school run in my nearly 2 million dollar car.  Of course.  All of these will be Ubers, or they will sit in a billionaires office on a trickle charge, as a look at who I screwed work of art.
the prototype looks better
How the fuck they fit a v8 under that car 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
#gemera  #cristianvonkoenigsegg
Sheer brilliance... 🦾
the kids will never be late to school EVER!!!
Wow very sexy🎉
Sheeeesh
The car was a 10/10 and now with more HP and a V8 they crushed it 15/10 🤤😩🤩
Wow! This is innovation at its best.
This car is designed to drive back and forth from Dubai to Doha
Every time I see a new Koenigsegg, I think, "There's no way they can top that! No way!"  Then......they top it! Aaaand I say it again.
Beautiful ❤
NU SÅ!!!
As someone who loves to go on drives my favorite part about this car is the cup holders
Driving this will spoil other cars after
WOW!
@autotelling "isso não é um super carro, isso é um megacar" kkkkkk
geniuses.
It's only 2300 hp?
Have been a huge koenigsegg since day one, and loved the idea of the Gemera but the 3 cylinder idea didnt care for. When i heard they are offering with the Jesko V8 ❤ definitely want one now.
Just blows my mind what these guys do.
"Enjoy the gemera"  Well i'll certainly do. From my couch.  In all seriousness though, if i had the money, i'd probably buy exclusively Koenigsegg. I love the philosophy behind the brand. Keep up the revolutionary work guys!!
Koenigsegg is truly living in the future. Amazing car!
This is undoubtedly the most insane car ever made. ❤❤❤
You guy should start a formula 1 team
Arabs are standing inline already to sandblast the body on the desert roads.!
So they made an auto transmission that can give you the full experience of a manual and now they made one where you can switch between fwd, rwd or 4wd?
Dude this is literally THE car. This is it, this is the peak of automobiles! Could I have one please Christian?
why it's a porsche
What the fcuk!!!!
is the front wheel bigger than the back one?
Koenigsegg is in a league of its own
V8 >>>
☠️ crazy
Every time u think they have moved the bar... they move it again...
rimac and tesla crap in your pants the rest of the year
3:46 Looks like a Pokéball
Masterpiece
Wtf
This man is a true visionary no BS just straight amazing engineering and vision. He has made a true in every sense of the word, world beater car.
Best Engineers on the planet easily....
This company is going places 🔥
Who can i talk to about making a body kit or aero parts for that? Like directly through Koenigsegg?
Christian you are the man! Thank you!
Absolutely insane
This thing is out of this world a 2300hp 🤯 4 seater this wil be a beast and in a leage of its own what a beatiful machine wherry curious what the topspeed wil be i'l think around 400 km/h mark
Are you serious!???  This is crazy!!!
...so when are you gonna enter le mans?
This is perfection. Koenigsegg is perfection.
why not 2 to 4 of those electric motors lol
Price is certainly justified here.
I’ve always wondered what it’s like from the inside driving with the window wipers bang centre of the windscreen ??
Wow, indeed mindboggling! Impressive how they were able to make room for that V8!  But replacing the plugs is a tiny bit more work than on a '67 Mustang, I imagine :)
Chariots of the Gods!
Amazing outstanding
Iv said it before and il say it again - Kristian has the passions for cars like Enzo and the passion for details and breaking the unknown like Breguet and now here in this he’s created a tourbillion gear box …… that’s car is phenomenal…hats off …… but alas I can’t afford one - could I at least borrow one ? I promise to give it back ……sort of
Best most innovative company in the world 👏🏻👏🏻 2300bhp is insane 300mph ??
Congratulations to the Koeninssag Team and Mr. Cristian Von Koeninssag. A V8 my  God!!! Koeninssag when from the Tiny Giant to the unknown of Giants. Sooo much hard work for so many years, the work of art that has a price tag of ? Millions well-deserved.
The Jesko V8 in the back of the Gemera? Are you crazy? What a machine. Smply a dream car.
It excites me to see such builds, makes me sad the Toroidion project was cancelled last year as it was built just a few kilometers away from my house
Gemera première : best GT ever. Koenigsegg : it's too eco, too GT 😂
I'll never be able to afford a Koenigsegg but I will always be curious, interested, and impressed by the things they're able to achieve.
They really made the ultimate all in one car.
...I knew it...!
Hmmmm.... a $3M cake?
Christian could walk on to that stage drunk, wearing a garbage bag, and that car wouldn't be any less reality altering.
Welp, now I cannot unsee that the camera operator probably left Autofocus on and got that nice big screen in the background in focus instead of the speaker.
One of the Greatest companys ever❤❤❤
Wow that’s got to be the best looking car you have created to date. And I can’t wait to see it in motion. Well done both to  your team and yourself. You  are  masters at what you do.
Officially the Best car in the world 🎉
First car i've really want to have.
The only company that believes their cars have a soul and is the best at innovation.
Koneigsegg is becoming best in less time.
The engineering at Koenigsegg is second to absolutely none. What???
I really hope this gets added to fh5
Yeah.. this is definitely my new dream car. I always loved Koenigsegg as a child but this is just ground breaking.
Can I plese have it for free
i'll give you 10$
Christian, thank you for sharing. What an absolute treat.
Ultimate Ring Taxi
How is this even possible?!? 😮😮
imagine fitting a V8 in the space a 3 cyl takes lol,  MENTAL
@4:35 please correct me if im wrong... this car can be a FWD or a RWD or a 4WD ? edit.... this man needs to be protected and preserved at all costs !!!!!!
Damn,i was so excited about Gemera  and now they blow my mind even more with this 2300hp version🤤
You make legacy automaker engineering look like child's play
That dark matter motor is crazy. Absolutely insane setup in the drivetrain!
enjoy  LOOKING at the Gemera.. lol
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
this is fucking insane
Amazingggggg, i'l buy one when i die 😂
Elon, get a pen and piece of paper ready. Here's a true visionary.
RIP EVERY HYPERCAR
you are the master of packaging!
a dream of every boy in the world. koenigsegg say hold my 10 liters beer mind blowing love
25 miljoner kronor?
V8! if it was not crazy enough without it!!
Looks like Koenigsegg CAN miss
So is all the EV stuff in-house now? Or does Rimac still help?
cant wait to see the inside better😂❤❤
Incredibile, the ultimate car
Koenigsegg should really wake up and get with the times, if it ain't an EV we don't want it!
I'm sorry, did he just say 2,000 horsepower? What in the holy fuck!
How the hell does this tiny company keep managing to (apparently) successfully come up with wildly innovative tech? It really is amazing.
At the cutting edge!!!
hypercar version of a porsche cayman
Koenigsegg is so cool
My favorite car company
holy fucking shit!!! beat that !!!
This is incredible. GG!
Koenigsegg cars ❤ Never die. I love you Koenigsegg cars 😊😍.
So little gap between the wheels and the arches. Is the ride comfortable enough?
Koenigsegg Are You INSANE
Aston Martin green ey?! ;) That is a beautiful colour anyhow! 😍
interesting that they ditched the mirrorcams. regional limitations perhaps?
Finally a super/hyper-car with decent luggage space and cup-holders that can actually hold real beverages. I'm sold just on that:)
To call a fuel tank that has a capacity of containing 100 liters the worlds biggest fuel tank is probably pretty far from the truth.
The original design seemed amazing. Big battery is heavy but punchy. 1400 hp electric is what it had? And decent EV range. But the 3 cylinder engine with just torque converter would struggle to keep the battery full enough for comfort and fun, probably. Less eco, more powerrrrr!
V8 in that small space? That's crazy. This company never fails to push the limits and surprise the whole industry. Hats off to Koenigsegg
I'll probably never even see this car in person... let alone own one. A true masterpiece
THis company is on another level ...
If Leonard Da Vinci was alive today, he wouls be patting Christian on the back, no bigger seal of approval would be needed and i truly believe Christian and what Koenigsegg is able to do time and time again, outdoing themselves let alone rhe rest of the car industry is nothing short of extraordinary.
Porsche is that you?
Unbelievable. This is pure genius !
Наконец то её выпускают в серийное производство!
Cristian imma kiss that bald head of yours with these amazing ideas u have towards Koenigsegg ❤
Please tell me again how Tesla and other manufacturers are changing the car industry... amuse me :D
When you think that Mate Rimac is best in this business, Christian says "hold my beer"...
Simply the greatest car designer on Earth. Koenigsegg
Wow! What an engineering masterpiece of an automobile. It's like they took a porsche panamera, pointed out everything they could make better,  and then did it to the max.  What an exciting vehicle. Can't wait to see numbers from the track!
This thing is hot.
thats shit is crazy broooo!!!!
@auto telling isso aq é simplesmente uma obra de arte
In a "presentation" they NEVER ONCE showed a 360 degree view or even a complete view of the car.  EPIC FAIL beyond words.
He can’t run out of ideas. Dude needs to do something with a V12. His engineering team puts everyone to shame.
FAMILY HYPERCAR💀💀💀💀💀
Very innovative indeed,but Taycan can do it far better and in a more elegant way
Am I the only one who thinks this needs a trailer hitch? 😉 I cant be the only one who would LOVE to see this towing a caravan across the alps for the perfect family vacation 😄
Thank you for never settling and keeping internal combustion still alive. Koenigsegg is truly something different.
this is so crazy, the engineers have ruined the competition, there is none now. The only problem is and always is, with these wonderful cars from this manufacturer, is PRICE!!
2300hp and lighter than a dodge challenger
MegaCar is just an understatement really
I love the word Engine, and lets keep the word Engine for a long long long long time!
2,300 horsepower ?????????
It's not a hypercar, it's not a megacar. It's a koenigsegg!
Congratulations! Your tech&taste are truly artisan.
The love I have for yall just keeps growing  And yall always coming up with amazing figures and I love it ❤Koenigsegg4ever❤
This is beyond hypercar.
Bro just has to have a drawer full of alien inventions in his engineering office and just pulls out a random innovation for every presentation
Future is arrived
amazing car 👏🏻👏🏻
i love koenigsegg
Wonderful in every way 😍
Okay. That's just insane.
OMG🤯
How much power has the Gemera?  Yes!  And I love it 🙌
Do love the front! Video could be better though can see barely any of the car!
Amazing innovations both the electric motor and the 3 cylinder engine. incredible that you were able to put the great V8 in it as well and make 2300HP. Will you try to create an electric only version with 4 of those motors (1 on each tyre), and see how it performs?
This got me so excited, and then more ! Ultimate car in the world, we've peaked...
@autotelling você me deve esse vídeo
I don't really care about the 2300hp and all the other performance attributes. I'm buying it for the heated and cooled cupholders.
Gemera🤟🤟🤟The best car!!!🔥🔥🔥
Этот автомобиль впечатляет!!! Слежу за ним с момента появления! Так держать!!! Нереально крутые технологии, дизайн и самое главное - аутентичность!!!💯
So:  You want a 4 seater sports car? Tick! You need an EV? Tick You need a V8? Tick You need it to be always hyper quick? Tick? You need to take your friends? Tick? You need to on holiday in a hyper car? Tick? You want a huge range? Tick You want a Panny Roof? Tick You need carbon fibre hot and cold cup holders? Tick  Christian Von Koenigsegg you are leading the most incredible car company in the world.  If you turned your attention next to the mass car market, we could see a company that would outsmart the Tesla stuff and surely it would be exciting! Can you look at this as a project? Thanks!
this car touches me in all the right places
Make mine a V8
I cannot fathom how you pack so much power in your engines. I don't believe any other automaker can reach similar performance in a production car
GT3 program when?
you are the best, koenigsegg solos
I'm not crying, you are!
Just wait for the “oh its not going to be reliable, of its never gonna work”. Kudos to you and your team. You are and always have been outside the box kind of man. Wonderful job
WTF
You are the Elon Musk of the road😎 I like you going from the first engine you build, your brain is a work of art,
Just Wow! A marvel in design and engineering!
You just did it again!
porche + lexses lfa + corvet
It just blows my mind how allllll of that fits in that car, Absolute masterpiece, To see this company grow from the very beginning from the cc8s, To now this absolute monster with over 2000hp AND fitting 4 people?! Just amazing! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Gemera or Nevera.....both are Monster !
Imagine if this company made regular road cars, this is one of the best car companies in automotive history
Artpiece, and the exhaust looks so cool now
Toyota Supra with a shooting brake. I jest.
The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.' Socrates.
first batch to the guys in the desert
I don't believe it. Prove me, @Koenigsegg, let me drive it.
I am just mind blown... Well done Koenigsegg, well done !!
They say F1 is the pinnacle of motorsport engineering. I say, F1 hasn't heard about Koenigsegg.
Koenigsegg is one of the greatest group of engineers on the planet.  I'd love to slap a free-valve system on my sedan.
Koenigsegg's innovation makes other auto makers look like they're in the Stone Age. Profoundly impressive. Mind blown. 🤯
Funderar på att komma klädd som Monopol-gubben så de tror att jag har råd att köpa den, endast för att få provaköra denna skapelse ;)
amazing!
best street car ever made.
Koenigsegg-Innovation Redefined. 'Nuff said.   Christian von Koenigsegg is a maniac and I meant it in a good way. Innovation like this keeps us petrolheads excited. Like the quark motor had 300 odd hp which was nuts, then it had a 2 motor version that put around 600hp which was even more crazy. Dark matter motor makes all motors looks useless. 800hp from a single motor! That motor is a maniac! If they are confident to do a two motor version they did with the quark, then it will produce 1600hp and 2500Nm of torque. That is madness and considering ethos of Koenigsegg, they will do that in the future.
I know you're going to sell so many. That was a world-class presentation
This is what I call true engineering
I always marvel at the minds of some people..Im happy when i can figure out how to operate 2 remotes 😄!!
Ayo wtf 2300 hp 😳😳
Think I'll wait for the SUV.
Wow wow wow wow
Hur börjar jag jobba hos Koenigsegg? 😢
A car that weighs substantially less than 2 metric tons and has 2300 HP. Let that sink in for a moment.  Sorry, but CvK makes the other niche car manufactures look like amateurs
Can your car do... YES, can your car go... YES..., is your car... YES. Car does evrything
Well done. People who push technology instead of milking it!
Now THAT'S a hybrid! Go destroy world records with this one :)
damn, Koenigsegg is HIM
Now were just waiting for bugatti to fail with their rival for this car
Simply the Number One.
Can we begin to imagine a Koenigsegg SUV 👀👀
You know what this is. The next car for Jason "the transporter"!
Sorry
i happy with the practical side of this new car, i cant imagine how fast i will be able to get my groceries
Looks mint😂😂😂
so we've had Supercars, Hypercars and Megacars. Now what should we call this? Nuclearcar?
Finally! :')
My pashms are in a curly style of the huge mind blowing technology and design of this piece of pure art on four wheels
This man is the true innovator of our generation
INSANE!!!!!!!!!! Superb masterpiece from them. Where else can they go next? It’s crazy to even think of it. Congratulations team !!!!!
Makes more sense than a RIMAC in terms of pricing, performance and overall look.
They just keep pushing the limits every single time.
Helt sinnsykt!!
the true cutting edge
I want to ask for the price but I know that only means I can never afford it
One thing I know this car is already sold out
Dougscore, it was an honor knowing you when your highest was 74.
The quick V8 will have an interesting 300-400 time, especially if no was battery used to get there. 0-400-0....braking will take longer being close to 2 tons.
The new Doug score champ
Koenigsegg is so Amazing and Celestial✨🔥!!
the size of a typical hypercar but with 9 speed lightspeed transmission, 5.0 jesko engine, brand new compact a powerfull e motor with 2300 of horsepower, all wheel drive with different drive modes, 100L fuel capacity, and space for 4 adult people with 4 big suitcases. Impresive isnt enough.
doing what they do best...impress
TWENTY THREE HUNDRED HORSEPOWER!?!?!?
Perfect daily 😍
What an amazing car company!! What a great a leader as well! Well done team!
I just want to see this 3 cyl in a tiny/light lotus type car.
They put what from the jesko in the engine bay!!!!!!!
Amazing work guys 🙏🙏
Christian and his team are just evil geniuses. So innovative. Just wish I could afford one now...
ΣΠΥΡΟΣ ΠΑΝΟΠΟΥΛΟΣ laughing at the corner
Beautiful car!
Koenigsegg > Bugatti
six phases is better sir. very good that we are seeing this advance. I fly drones that i build and program myself, we have been playing with multiplephases for a while and i hope to see 12 phase soon :)
Christian really just wants to make beauty. Thats all he cares about
Swedish are just different.
This car isn't bad, but the Model S Plaid stole some of its glory, especially for the price. I imagine that is why they added the V8 version.
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This guy is a genius
One of the great visionaries of our time. Can’t wait to see the records roll in
The egg graces us with his magical creation once again
I love the way you are always delivering products that was incredibly unique in the market.  Congrats on never thinking small.
Οne e-motor = 800 horsepower...... Now make that an AWD full BEV. 4X800=3200 horses on 4 wheels....
600hp out of a 3 cylinder was nuts enough, but fuck me sideways, a 2300hp 4 seater that weighs 2000kg, there is just no other way to describe that than motherfucking dog shit insane. What the fuck. For the first time, $2 mil almost seems like a bargain.
😶😶
Nuh this is actually insane. This is engineering. My God 😂😂😂
Damn! Wow!
Mind bending engineering. This is as cool as it gets!
Fitting for crazy people
I wonder how much smaller the battery got. EV range? 3 cylinder pull times intact?
Christian is s treasure
I just cannot wait to hear the: THIIIIISSSSSS  IS THE 2023 BRANDNEW KOENIGSEGG GEMERA!
This is why I love Christian V Koenigsegg. Absolute legendary mastermind!
This car is genuinely beautiful
Let bro cook 🍝🥣
I will surely buy it oneday
yeeeha Every one welcome to the future!!
Stunning 🤤
On a different level................
That feeling of being one of the initial watchers 😅😂
Bro said 2300?
ducaralho
Den där har man ju aldrig råd med, eller får hamna på en lista för att kunna få ha råd med. Men min fråga skulle vara, kan man öppna dörrarna på Gotlands Färjan utan några problem? 🤣😅
That’s just brain-melting stuff. It’s an engineering and packaging masterpiece, and they even took the time to make it beautiful. Stunning.
So there is the tfg (600+800hp 600+1250Nm) and the hv8 (1500+800hp 1600+1250Nm) 😮. Both 9speed lstt, under 2000kg and with 100lt tank.
My dream brand but the reliability 😖
Amazing 2 door sedan! Love everything about it.
Beyond Fantastic 🎉
What else do u need they'll provide ❤
Dear god...this car is going to literally DECIMATE EVERYTHING numbers wise when CvK starts unleashing this insane vehicle on the track.
the only man ELON would look up too
The opening video is inscredible but idk if it's youtube or you but the compression is so bad the quality is rlyrly bad even in 4K D:
They never disappoint but I'm mad that I'm too poor to even get a single finger on that specific car
Bone Chilling Numbers 🙌🏽  Salute To the one of most incredible mind in the history of automotive industry 🙌🏽❤️
Well well well, that is something I would be so glad and proud to own and drive in a daily fashion.
I knew Koenigsegg could do more and push more but i never knew they were this good.   I literally had goosebumps. Nobody can touch them in any way   they dont have a limit only a next level only they can reach
I'll buy it, thanks.
The proportions are not right unfortunately.  The front end is gorgeous and the sides are very nice.  It is a definite improvement over previous models but the proportions are off.  The roof line is way too long for the front of the car.
I was blown away and they hit me with V8, now Im in interstellar space
Aston looking at their shoes saying to themselves ‘yeah but our new DB12 car is a super GT :(‘. Epic fail
I hope we see @mrjww car with the v8 that 0-100 time will be insane
Over 2000 hp car with 4 seats! 😮
So a v8 with dense electric motor and huge tank damm
The DarkMatter Motor is a stunning Achivement! 816hp in such a small axial flux motor is revolutionary! I hope they sell those :)
Simply the best car brand atm  (actually of the last 10 years (and probably the next 10))
That’s a Automotive God talking ❤
Was letzte Preis? 🙃
Under 2 tons? 2000+ hp? 🎉
Absolutely insane you were able to fit the Jesko v8 in this thing. HOLY CRAP! 2300HP! MY GOD!
Can you give me this for free like not lying and fr
Just incredible, but I'm scared. What comes next?
What a disappointment!  Couldn't they fit a small electric car to get around the city and a small yacht in there? C'mon, Koenigsegg!
I just love how calmy and serenely he announces that he and his team has managed to create a 2300bhp car because 1400bhp was a bit mmhhhh. You can only applause Mr KOENIGSEGG   !
I love Koenigsegg for everything they do for the automotive community. Every release feels like it should be impossible.
This company delivered
this is batshit insane and I love it
Mate Rimac says the Nevera will have performance like no one has ever felt before… Then Christian turned his chair and said “hold my beer”. A few weeks later, using the out of production Regera smashes the record… He Jesko Absolute hasn’t even scratched the surface.  Koenigsegg has the formula to bend time and space… Hopefully this technology can trickle into the world of people who cannot afford an allocation.
Awsomeness, as usuall! But: Dark matter?? come on... Also 100L fuel tank as the "biggest in the world". I know i speak about a million dollar thing's  -what i know, i will never own-  marketing, but still!
pezda
Koenigsegg is already an ICON. PERIOD.
We can only say: What the Fuck ist the nice❤  You outdo yourself and everyone else.
Best car manufacturer in the world
Faster than the Jesko?
Simply amazing!!!
Being broke it’s a crime that’s a dream car right there 2300 hp now way
Impressive data for two-seaters not to mention four-seaters! Bravo Christian!!!!
Holymoly🙊🙊🙊 This really is something else... Certainly a dreamcar, well done 🤘🤘🤘
Your craftsmanship is sensational 🌩️🔥🌩️🔥🌩️
Can wait to buy one in a couple of years
They can fit a TT-V8 in that?! HOLY
I an lost for words i have head alot about this can but MY GOD WOW, I seriously need to see and get in one in person time to visit Mr JWW
Best!!!
I want this so much that I'm probably gonna start dealing cocain.
You had my full attention at 6 phases for the Dark Matter motor.  So what’s the ANSI color code for phases 4-6?
I lost it when he said hot and cold cup holders lol
My brain just explode in 8 minutes, CVK you're an automotive GOAT
the only real innovators !
Looks more like Tesla roadster from the side view
Since growing up loving cars and seeing the fist video of back then it's current car(ccx)  it's always been a a dream to own one. Sadly I'm just poor.
Koenigsegg is more innovative than big German brands.
How in the flying duck is this possible, legit just. What.
...this world just not make sense...
I love what they’ve done but with two of those Dark Matter electric motors it would’ve taken out so much complexity. Next car ditch the ice, add 3 Dark Matter motors and take down the Rimac Neverra!
The Gemera is now the king of the cars. 2850Nm of torque?! What supplants this?
❤ the ultimate mega car 🥶 absolutamente amazing
See you at the finish line Rimac..
He’s a pioneer of our era for sure!!!! The amount of accomplishment he has achieve in the last 1 decade alone surpasses all other automotive company combined. He deserves an award!!!
holy shit this is insane. AND it fits 4 full sized cabin sized suit cases?????????
2300 bhp!!!
Not much more to said really they don’t apologize for winning
Powered by Dark Matter...Fucking Quality
My jaw fall, I have hair bruises wow!!! This company is miles ahead!!!
This car really gives more
Can I have 1 Gemera please then I can say I've lived
Amazing man. Congratulaciones.
The real torch bearers of the Future Gen Automotive World!🙌🌟💯
1 of each please!
The fact you made the v8 model is a moment of pure bliss
AMAZING ENGINE !!
Insane packaging. Insane transmission. I wonder where the motor inverter or the BMS is.
this guy along with mr. pagani are pure genius'  to come up with these cars
Congrats and best wishes to your automotive family and for the success of the Gemera product
Take this, Mate !
When is Koenigsegg going to make a sub $100K car for us peasants???
KONIGSEGG IS UNREAL!!! AND THE SAY ICE IS DEAD?? 🤣🤣🤣
Can’t wait to see the future of cars in general
2400 HP 4 SEATER ..I WISH I WAS 15 AGAIN SO I CAN DREAM OF BUYING IT...because i dreamt of buying the M5 when i was 15,,now i have 2 of them
Whoooot 🎉 😮
This is the future ... The results are getting better and the size is getting smaller of the machines...
OMG so amazing. And how much does it cost? Nevermind, no one can afford it!
Bem loco...😮 V8 em um carro compacto com quatro lugares e bagageiro! E ainda o maior tanque de combustível do mundo!? Eu acho que devo estar confuso 🤔
This company is the goku of cars
supercars, hypercars... and there is the gemera
Mind boggling! They kill it again 2300hp wtf lol
This is the best thing since the invention of the wheel 😂
Christian with DAT VOICE... 😏 #KoenigseggIsKing
I'll take two
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
PERFECT  BY THE WAY MY FAVORITE IS CC850  WITH NEW GEARBOX
It's just a big honor being alive and to witness these out-of-this world innovations put into this car. It's not a small leap over its competitors. Amazing
This car is absolutely incredible, the two new engines,  the styling, the Cupholders! lol, we need driving tests pronto and Christian, plz make another first, to allow youe cars to be part of GRAN TURISMO!!! 😂👍Bravo sir...👏
They've done it again.. incredible!
koenigsegg is the best for a reason
I would like one, sadly I got no money
Christian von Koenigsegg is the Enzo Ferrari of our generation!!! This guy always over delivers!!! Thank god he comes in the industry before electrification took over!!!
i am in tears
They just won't be happy with less than 100 on the doug score, huh?
Impresive
I neeeeed iiiit
The coolest car ever made 👍🏻
Above 2000 HP has to be ultra car at this point 😅
The engineeering is absolutely stunning. I'd just like to have lunch with him and talk about it all.
koenigsegg never misses
One more reason why I would buy a koenigsegg over a Bugatti: the gemera
Wow 🤯
The DougScore is going to be through the roof
That is something not from this world. I wonder if any other car companies can match this like the M5. They really said no boundaries and no budget
That means soon we will see a real world test?
CIAO e liberi fino all'ultimo respiro ♾️ sveglia pecore 🐑 libertà ♾️
koenigsegg never falls short on any front my favorite automaker and my #1 inspiration to get into the auto industry. Mind blowing 2300 horsepower is insanity.
Så galet imponerande. Kom på mig själv med att överväga att spendera semestern åt att campa i Ängelholm i hopp om att få se skapelsen 👌
nice Aston martin
Unleashing future power, precision, and sheer beauty on wheels! This supercar epitomizes the pinnacle of automotive engineering. Every curve, every deatil, and every adrenaline-inducing moment captures the essence of automotive perfection. Truly a masterpiece that sets hearts racing and dreams soaring! 🏎️💨🔥"
Christian shouldn’t work as a narrator. That was corny, like a school project.
You guys are insane and we love it!!!!
Take my money!!
I'm glad they made the version everyone really wants
Car looks great, but holy compression batman on this video. The black parts are just blocks of grey :o
So you can take your entire family and destroy other hypercars?!
Holy Crap! I thought the CC850 was king, this thing is from another Galaxy. Congratulations Koenigsegg Team.
"Total of 1400hp" Me: Hey, not bad for a 4 seater and looking amazing "Then we put the V8 for a total of 2300 hp" Oh...
More than 20 years ago I reached out to Koenigsegg and someone there was kind enough to send over some high res press shots.  Unbelievable where they've been able to come since then, both from the delivery of their incredible engineering, and from their name recognition. Always amazing, ridiculous, and the absolute coolest stuff coming out of Koenigsegg. Here's to another 20 years!
So , they made the impossible car
These dudes can makes ANYTHING. Next they'll release a family friendly fighter jet
legend
New dream car❤
wow
Unbelievable.   Christian von Koenigsegg is absolutely an engineering genius.  Fantastic, beautiful car.  Honestly I never thought I could be fully impressed with a 4-seater hyper car.  I though, okay, it's always going to be a compromise.  But no compromise, just ground breaking innovation.  Like nothing seen before.  Bravo!
I know what four seater I’m getting 😏
Koenigsegg is an automotive technology invention centre
Great green color to show it off
God damn sir.. jesko engine on this thing.. woow.. speechless. thank you for pushing the industry forward..
fastest and beautiful - Koenigsegg
I don't like it.
The only car manufacturer that is exciting now.
The “Dark Matter” name on the electric motor goes so hard. This car is a frikkin marvel!
Genius. What an inspiration.
So excited for mine!
This gentleman and his company are the future of super mega and hypercars
Yes When I win the Lotto and Megabucks Jackpots I will Buy my Gemera in Herring Bone Carbon Weave with Pearl blue Lacquer with Dark Navy blue Interior and Silver stitching In a Quilt Diamond pattern , Carbon wheels in Silver
Waiting for the WhistlinDiesel video.
I think everyone will opt for the hot v8
Mind blown
My jaw was on the floor most of the presentation.
my only complaint, is that this video is too short!!!! what a masterpiece!!
Y'all realise how mental this thing is right ?
First buy after winning the lottery. No question about it. Cmon Powerball 🤞
a mastapiece
Grattis grattis Koenigsegg, snygg bil  får nog komma förbi och testa den 😉 💐☀️
Holy moly. That car is a work of art. 🤩
Christian should be awarded the Noble Peace Prize.
Wow... The colors on this model are just perfect... I mean the Gemera itself is just incredible but those colors are making it so beautifull...
I don't like the looks of the car but the tech behind is just unbelievable. This company never fails to deliver and no other brand, even giant automakers, ever come close to their pace of innovation.
Hi
Damn can't wait to see rewies on this
Well, that's mindblowing😶  You need to do a 0 - 400 - 0 in a Gemera now😏
Swedish engineering at its finest
What about reliability?
Looks like a SAAB
Hey....I am speechless.
I love looking at shit that I cant afford yet
Me please....I will slay The Nordschleife with 3 friends and beat the record
Koenigsegg is very innovative in modern automotive era
Koenigsegg engineering is on another planet. Impressed and in awe every single time they announce a car. Outstanding work from the genius that is Christian and the teams at the factory and in RD🔥
I love Koenigsegg Agera RS
I HOPE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THEY MAKE A TRACK ONLY CAR STRIPPED OF ITS COMFORT AND BUILT ONLY FOR THE EXPERIENCE.
how many calipers are on those rear brakes?! amazing as always from Koenigsegg
2300 bhp!!!..... Now that's how you build a real widow maker 😅
You guys are just insane ❤️
thank god it's not a shitty inline 3 only. not that I can afford it.
Can't wait to drive it around!     In Forza Horizon 5
My Head has actually exploded..but I went with a huge grin. No words.Congratulations to the Koenigsegg team.
The best car ever made
Love you Koenigsegg
4 hot and cold cup holders ? I'm sold 😁
I thought a company like this should never put out numbers they cannot meet and few mins later BANG! 2000+ HP. What a legend!
Wow this is insane! I just hope that one doesnt come into the garage with a gearbox problem 😅
😍🔥
By JUNE 2024
KOENIGSEGG never dissapoints.
Omg this car is perfeeeeeect !
Now only the tires are the limiting factor. 2300hp in a 4 seater car 🤯🤯
Wait, the V8 fits??? Still hybrid??
DEAR EVERYONE AT KOENIGSEGG,   HAPPY NEW YEAR.  🙏  GOD BLESS YOU MY FRIENDS.  I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU AND VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.   I HOPE ALL OF YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.  I HOPE YOU HAD THE BEST AND HAPPIEST CHRISTMAS OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. 🙏  I LOVE YOU SO VERY MUCH.  🙏  I LOVE MR. ESPARZA AND ALL OF MY BEAUTIFUL FRIENDS SO VERY MUCH.   🙏  I LOVE KOENIGSEGG. 🙏  OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🙏  IT IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING.  🙏  IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE AND A DREAM COME TRUE. WOW!!!!!!!!🙏  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BOTH GEMERAS.  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🙏  I ABSOLUTELY  LOVE THE JESCO AND SO MUCH MORE.  WOW!!!!!!!!!🙏  EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND A MIRACLE AND FAR BEYOND ANYTHING THAT I HAVE EVER IMAGINED.   WOW!!!!🙏   I ABSOLUTELY FEEL LIKE CRYING WITH COMPLETE GRATITUDE AND HAPPINESS. OH MY GOSH!!!!!!🙏  I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL.  I AM INDESCRIBABLY GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL. 🙏  SINCERELY PETER
They really are having their cake and eating it too! This should not be possible wth???
that is mindblowing in so many ways, congratz on another fully functional work of rolling art.
as a bugatti fan, i must say that koenigsegg is one of the most innovative companies on earth
Very different! I may need some time to be convinced it's really better than direct drive. Lighter, that I like. Seems a lot of e power was cut though, I did like that it was so powerful as mini range EV. 9 speed super gearbox sure helps the small engine and makes life easier for the EV side. Might this cruise more efficiently than the direct drive at most speeds?
I will be your biggest customer one day, I'm broke now. Watch out for me.
I aspire to be one day like my idol Viktor Von Koenigsegg <3             Edit, it was Christian Von Doom-igsegg, my bad <3
oneday
I don’t even know anymore  Mf has a 2300 hp 2800nm 4 seater that weighs under 2000kg and 9 gears  I don’t even know what to say
ذا بيست اوف ذا بيست 😂
I might have a new Dream Car 😮
I want to work at Koenigsegg 😢
Can i get one free? Would be the perfect first car!
Mate, I have absolutely no clue HOW on god's great Earth Koenigsegg has managed to engineer this masterpiece.  And I'm a really hard-to-please engineer myself. Calling this just a mere "innovation" would be a gross understatement!
you crazy man 2300 hp ..... thats insaneeeee
MEGA EGG ENERGY 🔋
Awesome as always :)
I was waiting for the 2 Litre 3Cylinder Twin Turbo. HV8 is massive exciting.
Τους ξέσκισε όλους πάλι ο καράφλας.
They just keep pushing the limits i love them❤
when art and passion meets engineering
It looks like a Porsche
The engineering these guys do, for these cars is absolutely absurd. Let alone the innovations and new technology. Id love if they made videos about the process of designing/engineering these beasts
Ogay
I email these guys once. Saying I loved & hope to own a Koenigsegg. They answered back. Cool peoples.
Un-fcking-beliveable! My jaw is on the floor ..
They're all long sold out though. 🥲
Koenigsegg is my all time favorite carbrand
They just made something crazy even crazier. This company never fails to impress me.
Koenigsegg is the best car company in the world
Finally the correct pronunciation. Gemera
An 800 hp motor, A 1500 hp screaming V8, A 100L fuel tank, A 9 speed gear box, And weighing less than 2 tons, All while comfortably fitting 4 full-grown adults AND their luggage. What a marvel!
Koenigsegg never ceases to impress
Bro this is literally the best car in the world
This looks like a Panamera on roids. Like properly on roids.
I really wonder how a koenigsegg would do at nurburgring, on the hands of misha :)
2300 hp hybrid 4 seater and its weighing under 2 tonnes?? mind blowing!
Christian should be a bond villain
Thanks christian, i was just looking for a 4 seat family car with 2300 hp 😁
Speechless...
Seriously???? 2300HP??? That exploded my mind for seconds tbh😮🥴
God bless Christian and the entire Koenigsegg enterprise and associates, they really know how to make amazing machines of art with soul and joy and fun
It somehow looks more futuristic than the concept version. Definitely worth the wait.
I'm a fan of both Bugatti and Koenigsegg brands but I'm speechless 👏👏🤯🤯💯✅✅
Yoo. V8 ? Is it placed on 4 th dimension? That's Wild. Man talks 2050 spec sheet. Such a great car
Christian Von Koenigsegg is a genius for putting a V8 from the jesko into the gemera there is a reason why he is my idol 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Omg they put the jesko engine it 😳 sweet mother of God this car is going to massacre every production car record possible.  2300hp????? Bugatti just shit they're goddamn pants 😂😂
another benchmark from Koenigsegg.
Koenigsegg, which is one of the four or five best hyper car manufacturing companies in the world (for me the no.1), can add two more people and four full size luggages to a hyper car and produce a car with so much power, what can they not do in this hyper car industry. Just WOW.💯
if Christian and the Koenigsegg team would want to re-invent the wheel they could get away with it!
but i just had the fastest response time when I saw this thumb nail!
Whaaaat
chat, is this real?
Please stop. I can only get so excited.
I knew Strad was going to be for something related to Koenigsegg when he said he was going to Sweden, and here we are!
Been waiting for this forever
A gdzie są napisy?
i'm calling it now, this guy is gonna cure cancer!  Hands down!   Amazing work of art and tech!
Finally, the best and fastest sedan and family car 😍😍😍😍😍
Is it just me or this company makes space from nowhere? I mean V8, 100L tank, 4 Full carry-on Suitcases, 4 Passengers, do I need to go on? AMAZING
This thing about to give gappelbbies a whole new defination 😂
now, this looks 10 times better than the concept wow
Amazing vehicle. Amazing company.
They cooked
After this success, there will possibly be a 7 seater suv made by keonigsegg called the Uvera, capable of doing 284mph with an insane 2,300hp engine straight out of the gemera, with the most efficient Aero dynamic flow possible😭😭💯
Gigacar.
Can it get better than this?  THE perfect car.
Now we need an lightweight focus car beating GT3"
💀💀💀
Stupendous from Koenigsegg💯🔥
@MrJWW James, please tell me you're getting the v8 version?!
I would be surprised if there is no surprise on a Koenigsegg Premiere. Always going further than promised, far beyond the expected. I love that amazing mentality and innovative mindset.
2300hp and hot/cold cup holders... I think we have reach the pinnacle of automotive engineering. Where does a car go from here?
Q pena no verlo en español😭😭😭
CvK: Jesko Absolute will be the fastest car we ever build. Also CvK: I lied.
Tropa do kalvo deixa o like 👍
You should let Edison Motors (electric semi truck company out of Canada) have a few of the dark matter electric motors for testing
Wow!
No other automaker comes close to the amount of different innovations Koenigsegg has created over the years to overcome problems. Just incredible.
Koenigsegg the Best 🤍🤍🤍
Amazing!!!🔥🔥🔥
Mind boggling numbers 🤯😅
I was just thinking they should have made a new regera with the jesko engine I guess this is the closest we will get for now lol 😆
Nice 3/10
that's actually insane.
The best car manufacturer. Mind boggling cars. Ahead of their time is an understatement of note.
The thing I really love with Koenigsegg is that you always push the boundries with fantastic and super innovative ideas and aren´t satisfied with "just" building a awesome looking luxury hypercar. That, to me, makes Koenigsegg really stand out and gives you an edge over all your competitors.
I wish i could take a ride in it
So many years of waiting... Now need to sell few kidneys and get set of wheels from this vehicle
How heavy trailers can it pull? #camperlife
She will be mine.
Pushing the boundaries over the most optimistic expectations! 💪
Wow, what a company , amazing..
I’m beyond blown away. 2,300bhp is insaaaane.
masterpiece
epic
Nice! Now we need Nordschleife "Rundenzeit" ;)
I want to hear this engine finally!
This is really mind blowing 😮
how the hell do you come up with more worlds firsts on a car that was already going to be made of them??
This is the most insane technological innovation in the world of automotive I’ve seen in my entire life.
I love this car brand since my childhood. Goated brand 🐐🤩
this company never fails to impress me🤩
I love that they went to a HV8
Beautiful ❤🎉
This guy and his company are pure geniuses. Amazing cars and automotive technology.
Christian just failed the Buggati and their designs fr...2300 HP gemera with 9speed gear transmission is just race to the other dimension fr...well done man well done
Unbelievable performance and design!! Amazing!! ow yea and I need to drive in this machine!! 😍😍😍
That conversation could surely cost another Rolls Royce or Lamborghini Revelto worth of money. OMG. What a brand. Always with new innovative technologies. One day I will definitely come.😊
The fact that they were able to put the V8 in it is just unimaginable!
The only dream
Gemera Green its beautiful
Herzlichen Glückwunsch
I can only afford the Hot Wheels version of it 😅😭
Otroligt🤑
This is the best car in the world. Congratulations to team koenigsegg!
Koenigsegg never let us down
from 3 cylinder to v8. WILD
Un. Real.
no but this car is actully too nice. we dont deserve such a beuty
A 2300hp 4 seater daily driver, this car is gonna deal some real damage in this market section.
Nice this looks big enough to carry my balls around
Please, start again factory tours :)
They made the ultimate all in one car. They are geniuses.
Never failing to making jaw dropping products
You WHAT?! I always knew the team had no limits to imagination but this is next level
Fuck me dead!!!!
😊👍🌹
release date?
Wow. That is a nice color. Love green.
Christian speaking himself! It really does "Give More" the name is perfection! The car is unbelievable!!!
Christian, you are genius.
A 4 seater with the engine of one of the world's fastest cars🫱🏻‍🫲🏽🫱🏻‍🫲🏽
Im early
One of my dreams is to see any Koenigsegg car in person and talk to Christian Von Koenigsegg.
😲
There is always a fascinating science behind our favorite car manufacturer and the best technology possible in this new era , already love jesko and now gemera baby on the roads , just can't explain this feelings of science   technology , space and cars 💫
Man, Its Amazing 4 seat car and Amazing Megacar Company ever made in Universe.
583 person: epic now i need the money
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Christian you are the best ❤❤❤
❤ I've been waiting for the video, 🎉
I love how Christian himself gets up and talks about his own cars and telling you everything you want to know instead of just making an overly-dramatic cinematic that only shows what it looks like.  Comment V0.0.2 Patch Notes: •Fixed the absolute galore of spelling errors caused by my fat fingers. •Added a word to improve sentence flow. •Added patch notes.
I Have No Words
The best 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🚀🇸🇪🇧🇷
Christian Von Koenigsegg is one of a kind man and innovator. Insane cars and If i could pick any car in the world, it would be one of his.
This is breathtaking Koenigsegg with another W once again!
Oh hell yeah. We've been waiting forever

Τhe main question is..... Are 2300 horses enough?  What will Rimac do to respond to this challenge?
COOL !
