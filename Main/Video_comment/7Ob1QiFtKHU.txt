Nice video but I can't see the lock
Back in the 80s I used to work at a locksmith supply company. Acme Wholesale Lock Supply. We all picked locks and practiced on safe manipulation in our free time in the warehouse. Quick question. I see you refer to a turner, do they no longer refer to these as tension wrenches?
Ich schmeiß mich weg. 🤣
Putting the idea out there once again mr. LPL I'd love for you to make a list of the best locks we could buy for Christmas. Could also do a naughty and nice list to make it thematic. Great video once again.
A cordless cut off wheel works every time. Locks only stop people who are not intent on stealing. A determined thief is going to get it opened every time.
Took him longer to plug Covert Instruments than it did to open the lock 🤣
I did an internship at Briggs and Stratton Technologies back in the early '90's.  They made the classic silver GM doorlock/ignition  set with the oval key and square key that is iconic.  During the first couple weeks we had to make a keyset by hand actually pulling all the tumblers out of bins and putting them in the correct order into the door locks and then staking the whole things in place.
I found your videos very useful. Master lock commercial grade pad locks ( most expensive) were even easier to pick. I had a harder time picking a pair of brass padlocks from Dollar tree store. Has made in USA become a total failure?
I thought there was going to be no lock honestly
When you spend all the in-game money for a cosmetic battlepass.
1.1 seconds.
LMAO
The metal should've Been camoflauged too
Since the basic of standard locks vulnerability is that the pins are not atomically equal in width, if a perfect lock with perfectly equal pin width could work as an unoickable lock.  Setting a pin wouldn't rotate the barrel slightly, thus making the pin fall back as soon as the pick moves on.    Alternatively, could a conic pin (like a stalagtite shape) prevent picking?
Legends say he is still laughing to this day... I hope he recovers.
An underrated part of Master Lock’s product line is you don’t have to worry about losing the key and not being able to open it.
If the goal was to make a lock equal to his skill then it makes sense that he would still be able to open it.
Funny, I'm sure you've been asked this before but have you ever considered putting your giant brain to the task of designing an actually un-pickable lock?
wheres the lock?
I think the people who sent you that lock had another intention.   The talk about how difficult it was was to encourage you to advertise this lock for them.  That lock is likely for sale on the market and is now better known due to your video.  Free advertising.   Nevertheless mate you are still the best there is when it comes to picking locks and your knowledge in this area.
LPL never loses his keys... he keeps them locked on the lock.
I know it was just a prank letter but imagine if it had turned out to be genuine one sent by the company in question. Definitely would be clever marketing.
Obviously fake, actual presidents never use the word "I" in the 2nd paragraph.  They always say "we" like it says in 3rd paragraph.
Why is he lockpicking air
wheres the lock
I laughed at "our finest engineers".   Probably some thieves from the street.
So, what is going on? All I see is him holding an arched piece of metal with pink tape on it, and a keyhole that he put his lockpicking instruments into, but there's nothing in between them, except the letter still on the table behind them.
The wave rake clearly works, but can't you also comb it, Bypass it, and slap it in the right direction to get it open?
*its
I’ve always wanted to pick locks.  Recently I bought a pick set on Amazon, really basic.  The clear “lock” was helpful and took a few seconds to pick.  I’ve watched your videos and notice you use different picks but always manage to select the right one.  Do you really need different picks and tension bars?  Side tracked…. Anyway, I’ve found that locks are an illusion or worse a challenge.  I wonder how many of your viewers are burglars.  Gotta go, it’s getting dark out and the night time is the right time 😉
I couldn't see the lock picking in action. All I could see was  pink tape..
The hardest thing to open about a master lock is the packaging
😂😂😂
The very first lock i ever picked was a Level 8 Master Lock (because that totaly means something). I literally picked it out of the plastic case it came in. I still have that case with the still attached keys.... no idea where that lock is.
This absolutely had to be a joke... I wonder why lock company doesn't hire lpl to help them design a top notch lock. I think that lock would sell like crazy.
Found it very hard to see the LPL picking the lock due to him wave raking nothing in mid air and just a floating bit of pink tape. 3/10
Found it very hard to the LPL picking the lock due to him wave taking nothing in mid air and just a floating bit of pink tape. 3/10
When LPL starts with the wave rake, you know its going to be over in seconds
Looks like masterlock can be compared to russian lada
*its weakest link
The letter is a cipher
should not have included a lock with the letter, hence "defeating" LPL
I already have a hammer and a brick. Thanks anyway.
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🔒💪
So you're saying the lock has a chance.
We couldn’t see anything that you did at all, dude all over you
Mocking the guy who mocks you. Classic 😂😎👍
😮 oh yo from Maryland nice
That was... Violently pathetic, MasterLock. I'm disappointed, yet unsurprised.
When I was 9 years old I used to pick master locks for fun
He reads a full letter in the beginning of the 3 minute video... Doesn't seem like this lock is going to hold up either
Just from watching your videos and explanations I was able to pick a lock on a drawer at my work. Wasnt much but I was impressed with myself. Think I might pick this up as a new hobby.
Shitposting loudly, the video. I love this ...
What do you think of a lock with two keys that need to be turned at the same time? Something to cause you to not have enough hands/fingers to hold/leverage/turn everything at the same time?
notice the incorrect "it's" when the correct usage is "its"
I saw you palm the key that time.
Now this is tough
your not funny
I defense of the lock, the point is to eke things locked by not knowing where the lock is, not being pick resistant.
Click baIt
I would have just used the keys.
Clever letter. But a better challenge would have been a child’s toy plastic lock.
Yes but most of the people making the locks are Chinese and they really don't care . 😖😖😖😖
When reading a text takes much more longer than the thing to be done. :)
I can jiggle for hours and I still can’t open anything!
2:04 obviously it’s not a Fluke, it’s a Master Lock. It doesn’t even look like a multimeter.
Why did you record a video of anything but picking a lock😢
A generous budget indeed
You know a lock is bad when nearly 3 minutes of the video is reading documentation and 10 seconds of actual picking
BRUHHHHHH Master Lock engineers were like: “lets put a cover on the lock orifice with camo paint on the lock and hope he never finds it”
Am I the only one that thought the challenge was to pick the lock on the door to the presidents office?
Masterlock likes have a bad reputation
I wonder if they will review this and send you a new and better one😂
U gotta give it to master lock if true lol
LPL is the de facto industry standard authority.   It's gonna be mandatory sending them over within a year or two.
This is some hitchhikers guide shit it's so fucking silly lol
THE KEY TO THE CITY!!!! LOL
J I G G L I N G
Ya know. I hope that lock companies actually watch your vids. Because they could learn a lot. Some locks are far too easy to pick.
I always open those master locks with a key from another one just wiggle it enough and bingo 🤣😎
some trailers got broken into on a job site recently. the guys they caught said they learned how to break into these particular locks because of your videos. super cool, dude.
I actually laughed out loud when the wave rake appeared
I was hoping it would of just been an empty envelope with no padlock so LPL “couldn’t see it due to their camouflage technology”
I miss picking with you!  (Jaeger, DC TOOOL)
To REALLY show it's not a fluke, you need to remove the pink tape and demonstrate that you can locate the lock consistently.
I'm still waiting for him to lock pick a Supreme Court case.
The fact that LPL took longer to read the letter than to pick the lock says everything you need to know about Master Lock.
Love it!
You are using a MasterLock, it can be opened using a MasterLock
You can look at a masterlock threateningly, then it'll sense your malice and open itself in submission.
You shouldn’t sell tools for criminal intent.
I can't imagine ML sending such a letter and then coming up with a piece of junk. Isn't this a fake email?
a master key is a key that can open any lock and a master lock is a lock that can be opened by any key
well if it is a viewer hoax ... then they did their research because Youn IS the pres and has been since 2020 ..
I would have written that letter and never sent him the lock
The need thumb print readers to stop my guy
USA for europe: Comedy ❤ thanks for the laugh
Him having the skills he should design and sell an actual unpickable lock
Great video.
If currently such a letter were to be submitted… it would be in 👉🏻 Spanish 🌵🌮
When the video is less than 3 minutes long and he reads for over 2 minutes.
In all seriousness, why do none of these companies have him as consultant before they start on a new design
yeah you know its really hard lock to open when reading lether is ending 1:30 out of under 3min video...
Sorry it took them a year to but a camo on the lock
The pink tape sent me 😂
i was expecting him to get his invisible picks out and proceed to pick the camouflaged lock with the invisible picks, in under a second.  perhaps before breathing on it to open it that way too
Haha the 'world headquarters' 8-)
Have you ever considered making a lock thats unpickable ? i mean you take down all the other locks, so with the knowledge you have, you could make a good lock right? Master lock would pay good money for a design that you cant defeat.
And, the president of Master Lock can't tell the difference between the word "its" and the contraction "it's," and can't find anybody to double check the letter before sending it?
LMAO!!!
Damascus,MD. 🤔 I know that town😂
Chino, California mentioned!!!
1:40 and then he has the lock in his hands.... this will be a bloodbath lol
I bet it took longer to open the envelope than the lock. 😁
Love it, no filler all content, faint taste of roasting.
Wait you live in Damascus MD? Holy shit I’ve been neighbors with u the whole time lmfao. I used to take woodfield road to work everyday, I’m closer by kemp town elementary if u know where that’s at.
Bought a master padlock, it say weather resistant. A week of heavy rain and it's now half usable
Locks work against stupid crooks the ones who couldn't pick a lock if their life depended on it.  For the most part locks work against stupid crooks...The smarter ones albeit the ones who can't pick a lock usually usually come to the job with a bolt cutter or a grinder because they are just too stupid to pick a lock.  Bolt cutters usually does the job and it is is not too noisy but grinders will wake up the neighborhood unless it is in a secluded place.  In conclusion if a thief wants to steal your stuff they usually can and will.  The best protection is Smith and Wesson.  it is loud and messy and works 100% of the time lol.  So all criminals are free to come to my house and try their picking or bolt cutting skills at their own risk. Smith and Wesson does not discriminate against any colors.
I have that lock and its so seized that it bends the key when it turn it. I believe one day the key will break off inside. I also believe it would bend your tool if you tried to turn it.
Hahaha, love it. I'm glad you made sure to point out that it is clearly not a real letter. As I was watching your video. I saw the bar part(shank, just googled it.) with the tape on it. But it was pretty cool to watch your pics disappear into nothingness. I'm sure it was an actual lock that the pics went into, but man, that "new" security feature is pretty amazing.
I think the letter was pretty funny but I don't see the lock? Is there a punchline to this?
And he used a wave rake to embarrass them further.
Alleged "corporate" letter troll level: 8 LPL troll level with the pink marking tape and Genesis Set: 10
Locks keep casual crap out any security is just going to slow down the intruder.
What exactly was he picking? There's nothing there.
I think the most pick resistant lock would be one that has 10 different keyholes all with functioning pins, but nine of them don’t have a latch / have an internal dummy latch instead of a real one. Basically, a padlock covered in dummy locks. And the real one is random for each lock.  The locks can be numbered, and then the key can have the number of the correct keyway engraved on it.  Did you almost have it? Or was that just a dummy lock?  I think it would work on at least 80% of lock pickers.

It's a "Master" lock. There's no way it was a fluke! McNally probably would've had it open in less than a second. 🤣
the sass is so hard here
When it said that there was a camouflage device and you wouldn't be able to find it, I thought the joke was that they sent the letter and nothing else, the padlock was "invisible".
NGL, that lock DOES kinda blend in with the table.
Yeh, this was a joke and a bit of fun.
It's not very intelligent to challenge LPL
How would the owner of the lock find it to open?
They need to make a lock with no keyhole, and no unlocking mechanism. Id like to see you pick that
I was expecting a silicone flap that would make it hard for picks to get in to, not fecking clammellolflage paintwork...
Masterlock has proven that you don’t need to be good at what you do to become a giant in the industry
The joke's on you, LPL: that Masterlock we sent you yesterday was dipped in anthrax.
Some say LPL still laughs at this challenge.
"As and a consequence"
I have followed your channel for years, even the one on the chastity belt your wife wore for Valentine's day, which you also were able to crack 😉, i assumed 😊.
A master lock camouflaged master lock can be easily found with another master lock camouflaged master lock.
Was this a joke from master lock
Well... that letter was clearly sent (and written) in gest... Pretty cool that you got their attention... but shouldn't they be paying attention to actually creating a lock which cannot be picked? Or at least one which isn't so easily pickable? I sure as shit won't be buying any "Master Lock" brand padlocks... at least until they make a more safe, reliably unpickable one. Maybe their combination locks fair slightly better?
Isnt this like defamation or libel lol
I hope this is a joke and not a real letter from ML. This would be so embarrassing.
it wouldve been way better if there just wasnt a lock
Master locks are too easy to pick. Bouvht a pick set to mess around with whenever I am bored at home. Had a master lock lying around and picked it open my first try really quickly. Had a roommate lock his keys in his room and I never tried to unlock a household door. He asked me to try and had it open in about 15 seconds. That terrified me and made me rethink upgrading the locks on the house. Don't buy cheap doorknobs or locks.
But to be fair. you have to add the time it took you to find it, to the time it took you to open it.
The Camouflage was so good that it hid the locks inability to be picked.
99 percent of all locks can be raked open just like that
Master Lock has developed a lock that is quicker to pick open than to use the keys.   Truly innovative.
Way happened, did you open anything ?? All I saw was you giggling a rake that seemed to partly disappear ???😆
I’ve never picked a lock in my life, but my dad found an old master lock in the back of his new truck he bought. So I messed with it and found out you can open it with a paperclip. I was in 7th grade so even a middle schooler can break into a master lock 😂
they are still scared of mcnally so they arent gonna send him any "challenges"
Good thing you put that pink tape on it!
man he really picked that pink strip attached to nothing real fast!
mmmh .. trolls, I HATE TROLLS!
And here I was expecting a lock so well camoflagued, it wasn't even there.
Before I continue watching... ...taking a look at the upload date. 🤔 Still not convinced this isn't some kind of early April fool from Master Lock. I mean it's Master Lock - *the* master troll in the lock industry, right? EDIT: 😄
Hearing my childhood city being mentioned by LPL was wild. I must go back and find the guy who mailed it and thank him 😂
there is always room for a bit of sarcasm from Master Locks
I half expected him to pick an “invisible” lock
Damn I was hoping the cement reference was going to have a pay off. Cant lock pick a concrete/cement incased camo lock.
I’ve watched an embarrassing amount of your videos… this one, hilarious. Love your work…
Thesis again
All you need is an aluminum can
🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂
We know the letter is fake because employee morale at Master Lock is at an all time high. Locks can only be that bad if it is the company intent to make easy to pick locks. Every time LPL picks a ML lock you prove that their easy-pick skills have been validated and they give three cheers to LPL. You are their hero.
Man that letter sure seems like you hurt their feelings, imagine how crushed they were watching this video as you tore through the lock like it wasnt locked
once i spend 90euro on a lock from these guys, i dont know what happen but something just broke like 2 weeks after normal use. i send the item to replace, took literally 6 month, got asked a lot of question. obfiusly bought a different lock, 20€ this time requested refund on item, didnt got refunded. another lock was offerd. bro, you have 90€ lock and its just trash. clown company  edit: the 20€ lock runs fine without any issures
The solution is very simple.  I'm suprised no one has figured this out.  All Master Lock has to do is include a "No Lockpicking Zone" sign with each lock.
It's only a matter of time before the company who makes the bathroom door locks that can be opened with a 16-penny nail that you stick in the hole sends a REAL challenge. Cocky lawyer will finally meet his match.
Equal to your Skill! Think about this!
when the intro is longer than the lock picking 🤣
bro where was the lock? Never saw it.
cant fix stupid
i really, really appreciate that you're a professional at heart, but still have a great sense of humor.
Ain’t no way LPL lives in Maryland😭🙏
Wow it was really pretty challenging...  not to laugh...
what did he do i dont see anything hes just picking air -_-
"Here i have box to lock. But since i can't find the lock, i cant ... well, lock the box. So this lock fails, as nobody is able to use it."
Like McNally said: you can see where they hid the DISSAPOINTMENT.
Crackup. Go LPL!
As you can see, the single sided jiggler can also open this lock. You just have to jiggle it.
I thought there would be no lock
(Sees a challenge, clicks to video) Video is 3 minute long, it should have been challenging Starts video by reading letter. . .  Oh, anyway . . .
this David Youn is very funny
Wow look at that. A major corporation being a good sport. If it was like apple, he’d have enough Cease and Desists to make a house.
😞 ... The employee moral
I was half expecting a locked box with a masterlock outside of it, hiding in plain sight or something, but no. It was even dumber than that.
its crazy to me how this motherfucker opened it in literally 2 seconds
Living in damascus is hard because given challenge to picking locks every year
What lock? All I saw was a floating piece of tape on a shackle...
what about mccally offical?
Him reading the letter took longer than him picking the lock😭
what would have made this better is if you missed the keyhole twice trying to pick it and/or missed the shackle trying to grab it
Maybe Master Lock can hire you to sue whoever sent this letter for defamation lol.
This guy is a legend. LMFAO
I love, how directors solve problems "I tasked our engineers...", real professional, ngl
LockPickingLawyer vs McNally bro this fight is like Goku Vs Saitama
The only way for Masterlock to be unpickable (at least on video) is to have an introduction letter longer to read than the youtube video length limit. Or is it?? .....at this point the LPL would get bored reading it and would pick the lock over and over while reading the letter just to make MasterLock feel misunderestimated (aka not underestimated enough). LOL
1:43 what lock? Theres just a pink tag
Btw the first pick took just under 3 seconds and the 2nd took just over 2. He spent 20+ times as long introducing the lock than it took to pick it twice.
McNally is still waiting for his lock
keys to open locks are like data, they arent protected against copying.
When it said that they have "applied a concealment coating which will make invisible to LPL"  I expected the letter to not come with any lock for the humor
It would be much funnier if there wasn't a lock included.
Your mailbox box should be flooded with offers to hire you as a consultant to help engineer their locks.
😂
I don't get it. It's just a lock.
Click bait title
No box
Seems like the joke went right past through you lol.
Wouldn’t be surprised if the cotton picking lock picking lawyer wrote that letter.
Within the letter there are two signatures of a fanatic, religious terorrist organization called Mark of Beast.   Be carefull with those fanatics, they are ready to sacrifice their lives to decieve humans and to push humanity to extinction.
David Youn is in fact the President of Master Lock.
When he first mentioned camouflage I assumed there just wouldn't be a lock in there.
This guy is helping burglary around the world... If u were a victim it's probably because he taught them how to pick locks. All we know is he himself is a thief too. Kinda strange he just so happen to think of this as a normal hobby. It is not!! Like at all normal and rather sus.
Great way to advertise a new product. Kinda
They spent all their time developing the camo but forgot to develop the lock
Note:   This lock was not actually picked at all.   Using a rake to open a lock requires nearly zero skill.  I have successfully used this on so many occasions it is not even a joke and I have never been able to actually pick a lock nor trained to do so or even bought the stuff to learn how.  This might be the most insulting and impressive failure of Master Lock I have ever seen.
you sent the letter to yourself, I figured it out in only 1 minute.
I was specting to see no lock, thus he winning the challenge you been unable to find it.
Was this an Aprils Fool Joke?
masterlock got their free ad
I am now used to the 2-3 second mechanical defeats. Now I get my jollies reading the comments from LPL's fan club. No doubt LPL could clean out the 50 safe deposit boxes at my bank in maybe 6 minuites. Ha! And no, it would not be a fluke, either!
I’m guessing it took LPL longer to apply the pink tape than to pick the lock
Masterlock should just send him a lock with no keyhole and say have at it.    Technically, you could lock something one time and never unlock it, so, still a lock!
to beat the lockpickinglawyer just dont give him a lock
Master lock in the title and a 3 min video with no cuts.
I've also learned from another channel that a Master padlock can be opened by ANOTHER Master padlock.
Cement and camouflage😂😂😂😂
Thank God for that pink tape!
Who knew only way to slow down this man.   A letter
I actually have picked a mast lock lock with another key to a different master lock
watching lock picking lawyer while playing beamng is straight FIREEE
You are the Chuck Norris of lock picking ,locks see you and start to tremble and open on there own .LOL.😂
This was a thinly veiled threat
In master locks defense, a lock is to keep an honest person, well, honest.  When I buy a lock and install it, the idea is to keep others from gaining unauthorized access.
Thank you for adding the pink tape, it was the only way I managed to spot where the lock was in the video! Very clever of them to make the lock invisible though
That is so funny
What lock?
Would've been funny if it was just the letter in the box to really sell it.
Would be funny if no lock was included.
When he takes out a wave rake I laughed my head off
When I hear Master lock I for once think about the fact that Im not my parents biggest dissappointment because Master Locks never fails to deliver on that
It would have yet more amusing if the package had been empty of said lock, but had been weighted to imply its existence therein. A perfectly camouflaged lock!  _Sigh. An opportunity missed._
I've never had to pick a lock in my life until I locked my keys in my shed  and pick the lock in less than 2 minutes how are burglaries not happening often if opening   locks is this easy
G'day from austrlia, always find your videos interesting and more to the point straight to the point and i was just wondering if you have ever come acroos a lock that you couldn't pick and if not what one was your most difficult and a link to the video if possible please
You know we’re all going to send you letters to mess with you now, right?
Would of been funnier to make the camo UCP
this one does require a seeing eye dog to pick, so clearly they're onto something
This channel never gets old 😂
I actually thought that they just had not sent a lock and it was just the letter.
Mcnally?
This is a good advertisement for their competitors.
Im so glad you put the tape there. With the luck being invisibile I couldn't see most of the action, but seeing the tape float around is why i believe you when you talk about managing to pick it
Those are 5th grade level paragraphs.
bro doxxed himself
You know you've done well when you embarrass an entire company
Has Master Lock actually done anything to address their shitty locks?
"Lets do it one more time to rub it in that smug presidents face."
alright that was hilarious
It's pretty funny that no matter how bad master locks are they still are the only convenient option in so many places where you are most likely to need one.
You are using a camoflaged Master Lock. You can open it using a camoflaged Master Lock.
U sell a lot of lock picking equipment,  but do you sell any locks?
All I see is a piece of tape, where's the lock?
😂
I saw a 3 min thinking he had some issue... nope he read a letter... then I  less than 10 seconds defeets the lock twice... ya can't say it's click bait.
I was full-heartedly expecting that there was no lock at all😂 "Good luck finding it'
What blows my mind is that someone got his address to even send a letter ...
The problem with locks is theyre man made..
I bet this guy unlocks doors for the government
As and a consequence
So…what was the “GENEROUS BUDGET” spent on? The cam cover? 🤣 🤣
I keep getting pop up and I know what it's about and I still watch it, cos I love it. Just so happens that today I've been on a bird photography mission and am in camo myself. Luckily I took my gloves of earlier to get a beer so I can see my finger's to respond.
it wouldve been far funnier if there just wasnt a lock because the camo was “that good”
Locks keep honest people honest. No more. No less
What a great letter congratulations to the author
LOL that was both funny and clever. Kudos to the viewer, or "master lock" themselves hehe, for sending that.
No problem! The lock was easily picked!
Please do not embarrass Fluke! They’re a great brand compared to master cr@p😅
Well I'm glad the finally got their best engineers on the problem.  Their average ones haven't been cutting it for quite some time.
🤣
can you pick a door lock that is turned half way and has a key inside? (on the opposite side)
A letter is much better composed, than a challenge. To match what skill?
I don't think master lock is worried about people picking any of their locks.  As we all know thief's will  just cut or break the lapse.
Has anyone ever seen proof he is even a lawyer? lol
😁
He popped it twice in a row in under five seconds, which means these locks are essentially instant picks for anyone with the bare minimum of know-how.
Funny letter from a viewer.  Master Lock is "embarrassed" all the way to the bank.  As long as people buy their junk they are not going to improve their products.
"just to make sure it was not a fluke"  Ok, this made sense after the first....million locks.  We all now know that it is not a fluke.
I was expecting LPL to open the package and there be nothing inside. Then LPL proceeds to pick an invisible lock.
The security key point of this lock is that it's hard to find. Can't find, can't pick open.
😅😅
This letter is a joke.
Nice
😅😅
😂😂😂😂
Yk if the video is only a couple minutes long he picked it in 30 seconds 😂
Well my question for both lockpicking lawyer & helpful lockpicker is what are their thoughts on lockpicking in video games? Such as thief simulator & thief series& Nancy Drew PC games & elder scrolls games & fallout & kingdom deliver rinse & tom clancy rainbow six & tom clancy splitter cell & other video games from the Google play store & the episodes from a TV show called hacking the system & my sister says that the criminal takes less than 30 seconds to pick lock a lock & pro criminal can pick lock under 15 seconds.
The simple truth is that Master Lock doesn't have to make good locks. Their brand strength is more important than their actual lock quality. Even the millions of LPL YouTube video views doesn't seem to make that much of a dent. Probably because most other locks are seriously flawed as well.
So, where's the lock? All I saw was a piece of Pink tape.
"Why do all these video game villans lock their doors with puzzles?" Because the weakest link of most gamers is brain cell count.
What locks do you like?
that lock ugly as h*ll
This would have been funny if Master had sent the letter in a completely empty box
I was expecting that there wouldn’t be a lock at all and the joke is he can’t find it
Maybe it was two flukes.
Bro made an entire years worth of "innovation" and shot it like a dog behind the shed in under 3 minutes... That's gonna hit them in the morale XD
McNally where are you?😂
Mcreamy gonna be like...u can open this lock with another master lock
Is this Chris Masters from WWE??
That's embarrassing.
The lock picking lawyer outside your hiding place: * Muffled *  "And there we go... Lets do it one more time to make sure it wasn't a fluke."
Lol. They know that their locks are so terrible that they don't even dare send him one. What a poor excuse for a company.
That was funny, well done to the originator of this joke.
You are basically Houdini without all that Jumping off of Bridges Handcuffed. Good Job.
Am I missing something? All I saw was a floating piece of pink tape...
I don't think the objective of the letter is to propose a challenge. It seems to me that they wanted to be passive aggressive and tell you "so you embarrass us? well... and you... and you... you have bad eyesight" I imagine the president with his engineers "also tell himhe hat fat handsand and his mamma is ugly. YO YO, send her a camouflage lock to see if he can see it, duuuuude (sip of beer)."
bad advertisment - good advertisment. Masterlock knows how to increase sales.
I couldn't see the lock. I could see your picks but they disappeared into the lock. They are super advanced over there in Maryland,Chino, California.
😂😂😂
Took him longer to open the letter.
Such a bold move to lock pick thin air and pretend he "found it". Almost fooled us, but a great sense of humour, LPL.
It may be said (by LPL) that this letter is a joke... but setting that idea aside & considering numerous Master Locks that LPL pick, doesn't anyone think it's amazing Master Lock has not yet sued LPL for damaging the company reputation!!!  SO, it may be concluded that the letter may really be true & was a proof that the reason they didn't bother bring LPL in court is that they treat LPL as a industry professional & consider his vlog as constructive criticism (based on inference from the letter's content)  😂😆🤪😜🤣  Let me end with a quote from some guy in the Donut Channel about car locks... Locks doesn't really prevent theft but quality locks helps deter/discourage thieves from stealing.
Yknow what wouldve been funnier, msterlock sending him a huge mirror-finished stainless steel lock,
Naa, to open a master lock you should use another master lock.
It would be funnier if they sent no lock at all. (get it, the camo is so good it's invisible? lol)
I thought the joke was, that they didnt actaully send a lock with the letter, therefore it was invisible, so he couldnt see it.
Masterlock? More like Master…chicken
Update: Master lock will no longer have keys for their locks. Included with each purchase will be a lock picking set.
They were trying to hide the disappointment
Pretty sure Master Lock would have made a tougher lock to pick. At work if I need to Get into a area or machine control there's always the grinder. But padlocks are getting expensive.
The president of Master Lock is Jigsaw
Can pick with a boot heal under 15 seconds
Damn bro. When you play fallout do max out points in lockpick or?
Thank you for putting the pink tape on the lock. Without it, I would have not seen the lock at all. Again, thank you so much for placing that tape so us viewers can see what we were looking at
The fact this dude actually thought up a contingency to the fake extra layer of defense (Camouflage) Shows that this is where his mind is constantly lol. Cool shit.
Send the lock to MCNALLY he is the fastest lock picker I know I mean he has lock picked a masterlock in less than 2 seconds
Wow, 6.9 million views on this video and 4.41 million subscribers... can I borrow 10% of each for a year? Heck, 1% and I'd be giddy! lol
I thought you would mimic picking an invisible lock. That would be hilarious too.
Thumbnail dox?
You see, the problem was that they didn't camouflage the drum! Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to see where to put the pick.
Where was the lock
So they sent a disembodied shackle, how do you even pick that? Is this like one of those Buddhist riddles?
all of the employees watching this video "damn"
You know it's gonna be a funny on the words "Master Lock" and "challenge" are in the same sentence
Hold on, I didn't see a damn thing.  Just some pink tape.  WTH!?
this guy took more time in reading the letter than picking the lock
Legend says, hes still laughing...
YOOOOO They used you just to advertise their camo skinned Masterlock. Smart on the marketing team -- They know they can't stump you, so might as well make money.
In your eyes, MasterLock is more LooseLock
Damn, he can even pick invisible locks, this guy is a monster at picking locks
Wait- Master Lock is out of OAK CREEK WI?!…  I’m sorry to the world that Wisconsin is the home of such an embarrassing lock.  *EDIT:* The worst part is that I’ve driven past it for years since I was little and never knew.
I feel like people with the skills to pick most of these locks aren't doing crime, at least at the level of such things these locks are protecting. Also most of these locks are rendered useless with the advent of cheap cordless power tools. No security measure is safe from a sufficiently motivated individual.  That's not to say LPLs work isn't both entertaining and valuable. Who wouldn't want better security?
For the last fucking time: Green Camo is not Colorless Green so stfu (Seriously? An antimemetic lock thats basically PANTED NEON PINK [likethatlittleslipyouputtherehehehehehe]? I call BS)      Jokes aside thiseans that master lock has a sense of humor so yeah :3
One of these days he's going to come on and just whack it a lock like Fonzie hitting the jukebox
Never a good sign when you hear “And this wave rake”
All that in a less than 3 minute video. And more entertaining in under 3 minutes than a 120 minute Disney movie. Great job.
A camo paperweight.
Im surprised companies arnt trying to make a lock that has a few of the notches as magnetic that the keys pull them towards them i feel it would be hard to simulate that in a lock pick
"security is only as good as it's weakest link," - tut tut... Master Lock needs to hire a new proofreader!  There should be no apostrophe in "its" there.
LPL:  I'm going to pick the lock on the door to your house, steal everything inside and replace it with exact replicas. LPL:  Then, later that same night, I am going to do it again, but replace the replicas with all the original stuff. LPL:  See if you can prove I didn't do it.
Poor folks at masterlock!
😂😂😂 brilliant.
It took longer for him to read the letter than to pick the lock 😂
I don’t get it. LPL is picking thin air.
The only truly ‘secure’ lock would be one that’s welded shut.  But even then… not too hard to cut it in half.
LPL definitely laughs in all lowercase
The team should be fired.........clearly MasterLock needs to hire better Lock Designers.  Sadly the truth is MasterLock just doesn't care........
be funny asf if master lock sued LPL for slander, like "that wasnt actually us who sent the letter"
That was great!
There's no lock in the video
Back to the drawing board with more embarrassments. Next version: invisible and weightless.
Probably Just a cammo NO 3 lol
I like that he tried it again...I can imagine a lock smith trying to unlock a door for someone and they do the same thing
aw you know its about to get fucking disrespectful when he takes out the wave rake
Sometimes you just have to feed the trolls. Sometimes its funny.
They KNOW the lock is weak enough that almost any average person can pick it. Yes, "locks keep out honest people". WHY NOT JUST MAKE LOCKS THAT A 3RD GRADER CANT PICK!? It blows my mind... i guess their bottom dollar as an industry leader is just in the brand and the image of a lock on something lol.
Damascus MD? I'm from Damascus.
The President of Master lock isn't going to send you a letter with that many mistakes in it. LPL is running out of material to post so he's just fraudulently signing names to letters now lol I think he's actually been doing this for a while if you start to look in to it. The handwriting is a big give away in some of the videos.
Either this is a prank as you say, or the CEO of Master Lock didn't proofread his own letter for typos.
As an ironwoker with no lock picking ability, I could open the lock just as quickly as the LPL. Although, not as covertly.
I dont know if a lot of you realize this but you can probably just mash a paperclip around while applying tension to open most masterlocks....
Real or not, designing a lock that makes the picker become the weakest link is a smart idea lol
It’s and its…like I’m reading a Microsoft virus pop-up message😒
Did he just add low skill 😂😂😂😂
I love how the letter said, “You’ll never pick it, we have concealed it,” and then after bringing it out, he brings out the wave rake. Almost an insult to the lock’s existence to bring out a wave rake as soon as he sees it
the thing is you make this look WAY easier than it actually is
holy shit
Wait what why'd LPL just fiddle with the air and his tools? There wasn't any lock in the video...?
Robber: "Great, we're in! Now we just need to-- WHY THE HELL ARE YOU CLOSING THE SAFE AGAIN???"  LockPickingLawyer: "I'm gonna do it one more time just to make sure it was not a fluke."
Nice acting for more views super click battie
Just the first phrase of the letter gave it away. No professional company would EVER write that. Come on, lol! Even if you think they might actually be embarrassed after these years, they would never write that. 😂 I guess the person did that to ensure that LPL would make a video with his lock.   Also I LOL'd at "Master Lock Challenge" because it used to be a thing in pro-wrestling, in the WWE. Except people tried to break Full Nelson holds, not actual locks. lol
After he pulled out the lock pick I looked at the time remaining in the video and verbally cried "Nooo!"
1:08 i thought the trap for the concealment thing was the lock did not exist and LPL cant pick it
A Master Lock didn't even make it to the 3rd minute after reading a wall of text on paper. Sadge.
Would be funnier if the guy didn't even send the lock and make it like it was so good that lpl couldn't find it
😂
the real challenge is to make the master lock actually useful
HAH!  U DA MAN!!!  U DA MAN!!!!
LPL sent to prison, escapes next day.
Your presentation is awesome 👍👍👍🥰
The ultimate conclusion of this series must be, "Today I will pick a competent lock designer".... and he picks one, successfully.
They really have a sense of humor we have to give that. :)
Hahaha!
What a joke 🤣
Did anyone see a lock😢?
Seeing eye dog 😂
The pink tape really got me
What lock? I just see pink tape
nahh when that letter goes to mcnally it will already be unlocked when he opens it
The MasterLock corpos watching this immediately fired those engies lol
My challenge for anyone is to get me from Mexico to Canada undetected, payment upon arrival not before
I wouldn't have put a lock in the box.... Talk about camo!
When he pulled out the wave rake I knew it was jover
A hoax indeed, but this letter was extremely well written, beyond typical grammar and word skills, making me wonder who would undertake such a prank.
Wow LPL really is the greatest picker on earth. He was able to pick a floating pink strap! What a genius.
Not me realising lpl is a local 👀👀
Has a client ever recognized you for having a pocketful of locks in the courtroom?
Imagine they sent that to mqnally
GENESIS SET: is it steel/titanium? Will they break if I force them too much? I don't have a sensitive hand. Please let me know. Thank you.
You are using a master lock camouflage lock, it can be opened with a master lock camouflage lock
Master Lock became a decoration at this point......
Mic drop and done
the funniest thing would be just to not send a lock because it would work so good with the joke
What lock?
🤣😂🤣😂
That sounds like it was even written with ChatGPT. Goofy
Letter is definitely not from Master Lock.
Master lock would not go out of their way to send a letter to him. They don’t have the balls
If I was responsible for this lock I'd be swinging from the rafters out of embarrassment ngl
Masterlock would never send one to mcnally, he violates them on an entirely different level that needs therapy.
It was only a challenge by name
Uhhhh your in MOCO? I need to buy better locks lol.
LPL is longstanding proof that solicitors do, in fact, have a sense of humour
At this point im sending this mad-lad a lock that only opens upon presentation of proof or disproof of P vs NP or Riemann Hypothesis.
why was LPL jiggling a pink ribbon guys ? I m so confused…
Yeah. For those of us whom know what a hook is, the guy who wrote that letter has it.
This would’ve been so much funnier if there was no lock in there😂
I wonder who damaged Master Lock´s morale more, LPL or the dude who opens Master Lock by smashing it with another Master Lock.
This video still cracks me up every time
I expected the lock to be painted purple
you can’t pick it if you can’t see it
Next time get a lock in Green Screen Green and key it out.
As a Master Lock employee I can confirm, that I am going into my third year of antidepressants. As many of my colleges do...
Imagine casually saying there isn't a lock he can't pick, by insulting his sense of sight
Masterlock: Dam it!!! Flips tables and destroys inventory  Lpl: 😂 bruh
They should’ve just put a John cena sticker on it
Why is there a pink piece of paper floating?
It's quite surprising they even inlcuded the keys in the package...
I had one of these locks… I lost the key and jammed a flathead screwdriver in the keyhole, and turned it till it opened… no locksmithing skills needed lol!
Can you do a spoof where a top notch lock company offers you a job to come up with a lock that you can't pick, heck not even God could pick
I sure hope Master Lock did not spend much on developing this lock.  I kinda think they may have just sent another lock they were already developing as the lock did not hardly challenge him at all.  If Master Lock is serious about developing an unpick-able lock they just need to hire this guy.
It took him longer to read the first line of the letter than it did to open the lock!!!
even though lpl cant see the lock he can still feel it
Not even the respect of picking it just a straight date raking
i was expecting the lock to be printed on the back of the letter.
I wish they sent one out to mcnally
You should work on your Tactical speed square training
I don't get it... Why were you using your tools on nothing and just jiggling a pink tag around? You said there was a lock, but there's very clearly nothing there.
I'm genuinely shocked there was a lock in there
I'm assuming this is not only having the right tools but lots of practice and skill as well...  The question I have for these guys, could they break into a bank vault as easily as they break into these locks?
The masterlock violator probably chuckled at this title.
I can't belive you could find that lock. Locating it was probably the hardest part of makind this video.
I think it would have been even funnier if there was just no luck. Lol.
If only you had a reaction video of the condescending bafoon that actually believed in the giant letter of dig crap he sent to you.
How about showing us unpick-able locks
I really hoped that was an April Fools video, but I digress :/
Lock with camo airpod case....   Noice~
Where is the goddamn lock?!
"Well, it did take a while for my seeing eye dog to find it" the delivery had me fucking dead LMFAO
WOW! LPL AFTER ALL THE YEARS OF LOCK PICKING YOUR INDEX FINGER HAS A BEND IN IT AND IS EXACTLY THE SAME SHAPE AS A STANDARD HOOK! THAT'S EVOLUTION RIGHT THERE. 🤯🤣
most secure master lock product be like
The blow is always already the video lenght
i thought this was a mcnally video at first
Good Job Master Lock Even I can pick that!
😂😂😂
😂
MasterLock literally kneel for mercy before God LockPicker LPL.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY. They should've just sent the letter without any lock and then the joke is that LPL can't find a lock because it's too well camouflaged and he has bad eyesight.
Guess I won't be buying this then
I love that 80% of this video is reading the note
What lock? Apologies I’m not a lock picker, I’ve lost my vision… some other way.
Great to see a company with a respectful sense of humour.
But LPL it’s not just from Master Lock it’s from 🫢The Office of the President of Master Lock.
The disrespect is immaculate 💀💀
master lock got some free promotion for their new tacticool camo lock.  Masterful troll!
You know im suprised it didnt get sent to McNally but its mostlikely because they didnt want to be embarassed twice as much  as LPL did
To everyone, he picked locked air
Master Lock: Dear LPL here is our most advanced lock ever LPL: This a video of my three year old picking your lock in 5seconds. Master Lock; Are we a joke to you LPL; Was that unclear?
LPL: let’s break into fort knox, *does a lot of jiggling* and let’s do it one more time to be sure
a masterlock can open a masterlock
I highly doubt that is a real letter...
How did he find the lock?
Yeah but they won't say shit to McNally cuz they know the fuckin deal
Thats so funny. What a complement.  And a cool viewer😂😂😂😂
IF there was a life time warranty, but all you found is D I S A P P O I N T M E N T
Bro took longer to read the letter than to pick the lock twice
is there a video where you explain your reasoning behind showing people how to pick locks while selling lock picks? why didnt you just start manufacturing better locks
Too bad they had no budget for hiring someone to check the grammar :)
I searched up how to open a lock because Im getting a locker and now here It is in the recommendations good vid tho
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Master Lock needs to stop using wave rakes as templates for the bitting in their locks.
Yea it's fack. 😂😂 who Braggs about where they are
Why was he jiggling his lockpicks in the air ?
When lock picking in oblivion is harder than in real life
Theyre just trying to get away without sending mcnally a master lock
You just made master lock stock fall great heights.  And all thieves decide to do things.
They made it too obvious by putting a cap on it
1:51 Took him longer to read the letter than to pick the lock
master lock: exists LPL: commence the jiggle!
Where is the lock?
you need to collab with McNallyOfficial
I wish it was real and that it was sent to McNally
BREH :D
Wait... Where is the lock?
I would have made a huge lock with like 30 keyholes, none of which actually opens the lock but is opened by a very conspicuously hidden and tiny button in what looks like a drain hole.  Stick a paperclip in a hole just the size of a paperclip and boop! it's open. Any thief would be like, "are you kidding me" and go find someone else to rob.🤣
They missed an opportunity to send an empty box with the letter.
The funniest part of the video was the letter head "The Office of the President". No bruh, "The Office of Crap Locks"
Not even 5 seconds 😂😂
what lock?
Well, someone is getting fired
Um... at what part does the lockpicking begin?.... I can't see it....
It's like they designed a new bulletproof vest, only to find out that it 'also' explodes when it get hit. Nice try sir, nice try.
could a lock with so many cylinders in so many directions be built, that it would be impossible to tension and click all at the same time with lockpicks?
It took more time to read the letter.
In all fairness this probably did greatly increase the time it took to pick the lock
It's never a fluke
My seeing eye dog, that’s just great
Playback speed: 1.5x  You're welcome
... Why is he wiggling that piece of metal in his fingers. Is this some kind of sex joke?
I'm so uncomfortable reading the letter as it was not in justified
The best protection is to make it difficult to access the lock. At least they have less chances if they can't position well their instruments..
I kinda doubt that was from Master Lock, because WHY would they?   Any verification?
took him longer to read the letter than to pick the lock
zoop zoop zoop!!!!!
People put too much faith in padlocks
Masterlock president resigned after seeing this video.
The 2nd attempt to "ensure its not a fluke" is just rubbing salt in the wound
They should have made it full camo
😂😂😂😂😂
lol
Damn. They got beaten by McNally. Now they Challange LPL? Stupid Moves I tell ya.
They should have just made the lock with a fake cylinder glued in place and a small hole on the side which opens the lock when pushing in a toothpick 😂
why not make a lock that need 4 diffrent keys to entre at same time and turn into diffrent directions , so it will have 1 key that has 4 keys and to open it you would need 4 people to help you picklock it
Damn that lock had an incredible camouflage, to this day i still don't see where the lock is
People misunderstand Master Lock. A lock doesn't need to be hard to pick, a lock just needs to be easier to cut than it is to pick. Most thieves in real life probably carry bolt cutters/grinder or some other brute-force device rather than a lockpicking set. Why make your lock harder to pick when the shackle can just be cut in seconds?
Mcnally would just hit it with another Masterlock,
Imagine LPL and McNally doing a Masterlock embarrassment video...
They should contract you for consultation on designs
McNally somehow just jiggles 6 different locks, knowingly with the wrong pick and gets them open. He makes just about every single lock look like scrap metal, could yall do some kind of collab? That'd be awesome.
Of course we obviously know that it’s a joke letter because if it was an actual letter from Master Lock, it would be a cease and desist.
Oh my, the camo does fail to hide the disappointment.
omg it's actually a camouflage lock 😂😂😂 also the way he just goes with the joke i can't
Smh its not that hard to make a pick-proof lock, just remove the keyhole and any moving parts. good luck picking open a brick of steel
HAHAHA WHAT A FUCKING JOKE OF A LOCK XD
That lock was the decoy the real one is still camouflaged.
LPL, do you realize that yesterday, I spent 30 minutes trying to find the key to my masterlock padlock?
I think they honestly don't care =P This seemed more like just a way for them to get a bit more attention and that's it.
rake
Took him longer to unwrap the package then it did to pick the lock. Truly impressed. Loads of respect for you, man.
What a plug for Master lock. The joke was in the fact you just advertised their camo lock to millions of people for free! Clever!
They should just hire you and pay you$10 million per year
You open the lock faster than you read the letter 😂
You know, I have been watching your videos for a while now. The more I watch, the more vulnerable I feel. I’m going to start replacing all locks with armed guards with K-9 patrols. I love your videos, great educational videos, a eye opener for sure. Keep on doin you sir!
No pliz no god....twice....
I haven’t finished the video, but if he doesn’t say absolutely nothing after putting the letter down, pick the lock quickly and end the video, he missed out on a comedic opportunity lmao  Edit: he didn’t, but perhaps consistency is king.
I could see the pink ribbon but I still could not see the lock! Excellent camouflage.
LPL picks his left nostril then picks his right nostril to make sure it wasn't a fluke
Master Lock 1:46     Master Lock 2:01    Master Lock  2:05
I’d like to know what type of lawyer you are!!????
I wish this is real. Cause that means the team spend thousands of dollars, ran out, then was like "let's add a 10 dollar disguise"
When he whiffs out the rake you know the lock is dogshit.
Dear master lock: You cant win. Accept your L
Masterlock: We innovate (Proceeds to make locks with camouflaged. LPL: I shall put a bright pink tape on your lock rendering it's innovation useless.  Yes, security is just as good as it's weakest link.
I feel bad for masterlock at this point but their quality is still their fault 💀
he really played with air and expects us to believe there is a lock
You're a good sport going along with the meem SuperVinlin
Next their innovation - transparent lock? 😅
Master Locks are junk! Bought a few disc style padlocks and could not even lock it, because the shackle did not go inside and just hit the body wall. Returned it the next day. Tried some other locks for the trailer and etc. All junk.
Not sure why but I thought Master Lock would have actually made something worth the challenge.
It’s never a fluke
That letter would have been much funnier if it was dated April 1st and they sent it FedEx overnight so you received it on April 1st.
Lmao he used the 2 most common lockpicking tools.
Cute but taught me nothing
I have a Lakeland trigger lock that I can't remember the combination for. I got it off the gun it was on, but I'd like to reset the combination. Can you help?
I know I'm late to the party, but you must tell me if you put the letter up on the wall in a frame??  😂😂 Yeah I know it's silly but still. I have a disconnection notice from PSNH over me owing $0.50.  this was before the age of electronic payments so I would have to mail a check 😂😂😂
They really made a whole ass camouflage joke
I have a buddy who is a master burglar and robs vending machine etc....he owes it all to you!!!! <3
"thanks for the laughs" if he laughed I have never heard it. I think he spends as much time on his deadpan humor as picking locks.
Sorry I see this a year later. Can u continue this joke by asking a random elementary school kids to open it with your instructions?
You are using a master lock-randomnumber it can be opened using a madterlock-random. Number
I have one question can you give lock to the world.  My father all research documents proof is stolen from my safe.  Letter was from United nations, about inquiry of IV injection.  Articles from jansatta.  Letter from Tata memorial hospital.   Letter from gamen co. Letter from many countries government departments.  Many documents is being stolen.  It was big loss.  I am really in search of safe lock. For home I know,  we must put key from inside and let it remain.  The chor  can't push the key.  My question is can you push the key from door if it is put form inside.  Jay shree ram.
I really appreciate your capabilities.  Jay shree ram.
I wish we had master lock then I would feel so good at picking 😅
Brilliant!
This just in: LPL is actually a woman. She hires a man to do the voice overs. That's why you never see HIS face.... We're on to you LPL.
Does he sell the pink tape? It's the first time I've seen him have to bust out the pink tape to pick a lock.
LPL: robs bank LPL: gets arrested LPL: defends himself in court as he is a lawyer LPL: purposely loses case LPL: breaks out of his jail cell LPL: releases video showing how to break out, tells us he did it for the views
>still laughing >same cadence and intonation as always
maybe they should offer him a contract to help them
realy master lock is so many times pulled down and the they deliver this
Are you blind for real?
Where is the lock in this video?
I still wait to see the "Lawyer" part of the LPL in action. Maybe if you got yourself into Fort Nox, took a video of it, left a calling card, got back out - lock safely shut again. And then got cought by accident.
Wow, that is literally garbage.
Do you have a list of locks that you haven't been able to pick? I want to see those videos for reference so that I know which ones are good enough.
Here is a copy of my Fort Knox Vault door prooven to be the most secure on the planet...LPL Picks it open in 0min37sec  LPL: Ok folks lets do it again just to make sure wasn't a fluke 💀
"Master Lock left the chat"
Like a fool I am,  I purchased Master Lock’s exclusive camouflaged wallet and I now found myself in Jail for not paying my debts. P.S. Hope I find it soon. P.P.S. I find it even funnier that all those people below thought Master Lock sent the camouflaged lock.
can someone send me a video where it was really a fluke?
"Industry innovator" my ass..
Clickbait, there were no locks in this video, you were just picking thin air!
They should of sent you one that was glued shut lol
Terrible engineering.
I feel like the letter was staged and therefore fake.  Funny video though for sure.
YOUR FUNNY, YOU WROTE THE LETTER, ALL IN GOOD FUN I'M SURE
😂😂😂
Rofl,  maybe they should hire you and fire all those fancy engineers with thier impressive PHDs. Wonder what that budget was, millions to get beat in seconds. Hey Master lock, since your throwing away money I'm always in need!
Question: where’s the lock?
Brahahaha
If that wasn’t a joke and they were serious, they would have put a master lock sticker on a Medeco and sent it to you! 😊
👍👊
😆😆😆 cute
Damn it, I was sure this time it would be a fluke.
I'm glad you put the pink tape on it. The camouflage really got me.
I honestly wonder if criminals use this channel as a Wikipedia I would If I was a burglar
pwned... lol
A smarter joke would have been to send that letter in an empty box.
All I see is a pink tag
LPL just got an entire engineering team fired lol.
BURN! To master lock. Your not the master anymore lol
All that letter gave me was oh know big companies can't fill landfills with crap anymore.
That makes zero sense camouflage is designed to blend into the outdoors lmao
McNally woulda impaled it with extreme prejudice
I never saw what you were opening. But I'm sure it was impressive, as usual!!!
COMEDY
Wait, there wasn't a lock to open though, only a floating piece of pink tape?
That is some very clever stuff. I have an alternative suggestion to ensure the safety of your belongings: Have a fabricator of metal components construct a custom sized box of thick steel: armor plate about one inch thick should do the trick. Place your treasured goods in the box. Weld the box shut. Any attempt to open said box would probably require explosives, which will likely result in the destruction of said treasures, depriving the thief of the hoped for result: he can't take your stuff. Perfect.
Guys is this a joke? He's just lock-picking the air I dont see any lock here
When the LPL pulls out the wave rake it's never a good sign for the makers of the lock.
Why would they do this?
Bro's so good he picks air 💀
Any padlock under $20 that you would recommend as being harder to pick? Would you suggest a number combination padlock over a key padlock?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
If there was a competition for picking the most locks in under 60 seconds, lpl would be the winner
I feel you cheated your supposed to factor in finding it in your time
Wait how, there wasn't a lock? Was he just unlocking the air?
It took LPL longer to open the envelope then most masterlocks
Camouflage was all the rage a few years ago, but I haven’t seem much lately.
I think this is the exact model used on Joke Biden's garage.
I have a couple of cheap brass padlocks that are so cheaply manufactures a rake doesn't work on them.
Modern engineering at it's finest, make it as gee-wizz as possible but completely useless at what it's actually supposed to do. Next time they should add a 4X ACOG with nigh vision and 2 laser pointers..maybe slap some depleted uranium on that bad boy make it anti-tank..but leave the exact same locking mechanism of course cause that's not the point of a lock.
It’s incredible how LPL just lockpicked air 🤯
It's obvious what your agenda is and it's obvious the manufacturers are in on it too.
Embarrassing
LOLOOOLOOOOLLLLLL .... if that was a challenge :D :D :D
Man that’s too savage.
Wow !!! A cheap paint job is how they improve their product…😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've picked a Master Lock using two paperclips after watching a youtube video.  Pretty embarrassing.
So much brilliance on both sides
If that was Really Masterlock I'd be Very Embarrassed at this poor 4 pin
Honestly, kinda cool if Masterlock designed a lock and sent it to you to try and open. Maybe they should work with you and learn what could be innovated to make locks more secure.
I finally can pick pad locks
Bruh 😂😂😂 Master Lock needs better employees 😂
dude reads like a 5yr old
Hahaha 🤣
Gotta love love master lock!!!
Oh god  i wish this was real hahah would be so funny and  kinda bad ass for them to joke about it tbh
Knowing these are being used by me and many others makes me a little uneasy.
Why didn't you show the lock?
LockPickingLawyer, have you seen the anime about you? "Handyman Saiutou in another world", it's about a handyman, who looses his job because his skill is so high people don't think the work he does is worth the price, and he suddenly gets transported to a new world, where his skills, ESPECIALLY his lockpicking skills are highly valued.
They missed a golden opportunity there. Based on the text of the letter, they should have cemented it so nothing (including the keys) could open it...
I was expecting a image of john cena on the lock
bad marketing
Masterlock didn’t send LPL a “challenge.” They sent him a free advertising campaign.
Violation lmaooo 💀
11msza 6.8klsza
i skip one time and the moment i skipped the lock was open 😂
Your so awesome
Lol LPL spent more time reading the note then opening the lock
I don’t understand why there aren’t locks with laser diodes to read the distance of each point on the key with arbitrary spacing so template lock picking tools couldn’t work
What lock?
lmao
😢🤣😢🤣😢🤣😢🤣
*I'm going to include a scroll about a bible length. Should take you about a year to pick my lock.*
*Oh, you found it quick! After a few months of searching, I still can't find the new Camouflage lock my lady bought for me.*
I just realized that you live in my area thats fricking cool
TBH the only time I've actually used a lock like this is on the locker at the gym.
Lol, Awesome Typo too!!!
Master lock don't have the balls. I just get products you recommend. Thanks for the work.
👍🆗
What the ML doing?
Im guessing this guy spent a while on oblivion back in the day for the xbox 360
Where is the lock? I can't see it!!!
MasterLock's Letter, Summarised: " So we've noticed a lot of our employees watch your videos. As an organisation that specialises in creating locks, we are embarrassed by how quickly you get it open in each of your reviews.  We're just going to assume that you have terrible eyesight based on zero evidence, and make a lock that you might have trouble seeing. Good luck with this lock that you can't find, because your eyesight is bad so you won't be able to find it. We have won this time. "  He then proceeded to pick the lock in two seconds.
Letter look so legit, i was expecting the lock picking battle to be at least half an hour.. as i type this i missed the lock picking moment.
It's never a fluke, not even once
to make a unpickable lock you just need to add an no lock then its an unpickable lock
Even though this was a joke, one would think that MasterLock execs would have come up with something better than what they are currently making. I will never buy another lock from them... ever.
Was this just an add for a camouflage lock???
When the wave rake comes up, you know it's gonna be embarrassing =P
What lock is he talking about?  He's just waving lockpicks around.
I’m just starting at lock picking, made my tools from the metal from the inside of a wiper blade
so my question is, is there a real decent lock you cant open or are they all pretty much the same?
Well, the camouflage helped.
I don't get it, where's the lock?
I wonder what the crazy hardest lock to pick would be I need a good one that you would have to be a pro to get it undone or cut off for that matter
LPL is based in the great state of Maryland? Based.
Wait LPL is a DMV native?! Another reason to my short list of why I love being from Maryland.
Took longer to read the letter and explain the lock than it did to pick ot.
It was more difficult opening the envelope
"Let's do it one more time, to make sure that this humiliation will stick with you forever, Master Lock" =)
Ngl, I thought that they were gonna send you a sease and desist order (I think that's what it's called? Can't remember)
>Read video name  >”Master Lock sent me a challenge” >Look at length  >Under 3 minutes
🤣
They might need to create a double 5 pin twin cylinder lock. Might need another pair of hands.
HAHAHAHAHA AHAHAHA! Amazing
i think its interesting that they really dont send you anything or response to stuff like that
RIP Masterlock
I do like the banter though
Bravo to Master lock for their sense of humor and to you sir for taking on the challenge of finding that lock!  the pink tape was genius.
yall remember the push-twist knob locks that had the small round hole in the middle you could unlock with a pen tube?
Do you have any vids of picking a master lock with a drop pin. I believe that is what it is called. Master lock rates then level 9 in security
I feel like he puts locks on his coffee maker because the real thing that wakes him up in the morning is a couple decent locks to pick
What lock would LPL recommend for a YMCA gym locker?
Your seeing eye dog has mad skills. I could only see the pink tape!
Haha haha I hope it was master locks president...bet he never admits who he works for...locks that require only the minimum effort to open...what could go wrong...master baters
Did Chris masters send the letter?
I still can't see what you did
what gameclan are you in?
@lockpickinglawyer i drive thru the oak creek master lock facility everyday to go to work i thought that building was a joke !
Next move: To improve morale they rename to "Lord Close"
Where the hell are they making these master locks ? Prison? 😂
What the hell did he pick?
"Dear lock picking lawyer, you busting these locks is really hurtful, please pretend to be worse."
WTF.. it unsubscribed me from your channel..... piece of shit youtube.
Master lock employees started crying as soon as he pulled out the rake lmao
Its kind of comical they watched your videos and decided to do this as a prank... like they think it's funny their locks are so easy to pick? I don't get it Master Lock 😅
A master key is a key that can open any lock A master lock is a lock that can be opened with any key
whoever is doing your thumbnails is making them look like total zillenial adhd crap
Can't see the lock
What would have been funny if there was nothing else in the envelope.
When I see the wave rake, I know that the lock is fcked.
Oh no not the wave rake!
2:08. Of course it’s not a Fluke. Fluke instruments have a distinctive yellow case.
There’s no way this dude hasnt contributed to helping thieves successfully steal shit from innocent civilians
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAhahaAHAHAHAH@!@!!!!@@!!@
Thats it?! Thats all the suprise? Cool luck btw
The lockpicking sets can't be shiped to Latvia.
Was anyone else expecting there to not even be a lock, can't pick a lock if there was never one in the first place.
Btw masterlocks hq is in wisconston
i know what's going to happen if LPL pull out the wave rake lol
LOL -  I love that it took longer to read the letter than to pick the lock open (twice).
Have we considered that the Master Lock executives have a humiliation fetish?
It is a federal crime to impersonate a CEO or corproation. Hope you turned this into the police so that scum bag can rot in prison. We must fight crime wherver it turns up.
You could make a lock that was literally a solid chunk of steel with no moving parts and this guy could still break it 100%.
The note just sounds like a joke
LPL, I have a stubborn disk Master lock on my storage unit. I have practiced successfully at home on similar models, but have not been able to pick this one. Note: I need it picked as I refuse to pay to cut it and managed to throw away the key. That is a whole other story… any advice would be appreciated.
He spent most of the video reading the letter.
Well, at least LPL doesn't absolutely obliterate Masterlock every video like a certain other lockpicker tends to do xD
well at least he needed a dog this time. most criminals probably won’t have dogs, and that’s a fact.
oh no master locks ego fell face first
really thought that the box was going to be empty
Oak Creek Wisconsin huh
1:46 he start unlocking
This is actually smart...    I locked a house once by driving damn near invisible screws all around the doors edges.
🤣🤣🤣
I love how it took him longer to read the letter and explain how he opened it than it actually took him to pick it.  What he should do is have a little box in the corner of the video with another video of him reputably opening the lock just so we can see how many times he can open it in the time it takes for the main video to end XD
so it's just a regular lock with a coat of paint, talk about a waste of R&D money lol.
Why i think Master Lock is some fan of him actualy
Reads letter saying hardest master lock. Reads video length.
I can't believe you found it so quickly!!
Lmfao this is amazing 😂
Nice letter, but where was the lock that they sent? I couldn't see it.
Finally a worthy opponent
Completely deconstructed master lock again in a matter of seconds  lol
Bro why he lock picking thin air? There's nothing there
Chino? Holy hell that's right next door to me.
Tey Can't change my mind that EVERY LOCK is unlockable ,, otherswise it's not a lock but's still openable
this was hilarious.
1:20 You misread the letter. What you said was, "and as a consequence" while what is written on the letter is CLEARLY "as and a consequence".  Your eyesight really is going bad, isn't it? Tsk, tsk, tsk.   Surf Wisely.
Question: would you say that employees at masterlock shouldn't feel demoralized at the performance of their product? As, locks are in fact only a deterrent to theft and ultimately are all susceptible to attacks. Locks are more so intended as security against honest people who would take advantage of a lack of security when a lock isn't present where they would otherwise not steal. In short, the primary value of locks is against mostly honest people and thus the performance of most locks demonstrated on this channel are ultimately sufficient, including MasterLock. Love these videos.
BROOOO after watching you for years i just noticed what a damn genius you are. 1: Make videos showcasing how to open locks, 2: Sell lock picking kits 3: Coustomer gets arrested but already knows a Lawyer... Thats just printing money at this point
Any master lock is beatable.  Doesn’t matter what it is.  Science defeats it, I won’t tell you how because I know they’re criminals on here. But I promise you, there is no padlock on earth that can stop me. I know this for a fact.  All you need is science.
Have you ever designed a replacement lock mechanism you could sell to masterlock?
I’ve lived here since I was born. And I never knew that master lock HQ is 13 mins from my house. Lol
Can you tell me what lock this is specifically so I never buy it?
Anyone else get a transphobic add in front of this video?
Bigger the pride, harder the fall.
If you can’t see it you can’t pick it - son zu (or whatever his name is)
No company would ever invest that much time with a youtuber.
This channel has made christmas shopping in my neighborhood easy this year.
Challenge is a strong word
With all these videos that he picks and talks about all the things to improve the locks, I would like to see him actually create a lock that would be unpickable.  Lets see you put your skills to the test and see if this is actually possible.
When is the McNally collab
Legends say that he's still laughing about it.
I want this guy in my heist crew.
He lock picked the air brooooo
I know it's a joke and all, but hiding things is actually a very good security measure.   Not necessarily by painting the lock in camo, but by hiding where things of value are.   It reminds me of some documentary I saw long ago regarding spy satellites and aerial recon. They had found that an obvious way to figure out which buildings were important were simply to see how many security measures were protecting it. If it was within three rings of fences, barbed wire, mine fields and armed guards, it was quite likely a place of high value.  Using this logic, but in reverse. If you HIDE the treasure or secret rather than try to secure it with a massive (pickable) lock, tall fence, or expensive safe it is less likely to be discovered at all. You can even have that overly secure place as a decoy and hide the real secret somewhere unassuming.  I guess the old-school idea of hiding a safe behind a painting isn't as silly as it might seem (although this is probably so cliche that everyone knows it by now)  You can't steal what you can't find.
Bro why is LPL picking thin air for 3 minutes?
Thisis all done on purpose. It wasn’t made to be a challenge for you, but rather take advantage of your platform for advertising. Any pr is good pr. I don’t know how you fell for this. 💀
Please tell me this was satire, because that letter from Master stating "good luck finding the lock" to only paint it in crappy camo is insulting to our species that such mediocrity exists and ALSO takes itself seriously.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Looks like a competitor send you a lock on behalf of the Master Lock company so as to nail them down.😁
"generous budget" gave it away for me 🤣
This man could probably give Sora and his keyblade from Kingdom Hearts a run for his money.
10/10!
Annndddd just like that the entire engineering team was fired
They still too scared to talk to mcnallyofficial
I don’t see a lock pick here. Clickbaited again I guess
The fact that the entirety of this video was just him reading the letter, then like 4 seconds of him picking the lock really shows this man’s skill
DOes LPL actually have bad vision or was it a random gag?
You should try design a lock, everyone who knows about how will buy it and you will be richhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh get that bag
"Let's do it one more time to make sure it was not a fluke"  My lockpicker in christ, You mashed the wave rake around the chamber. That's SUPPOSED to work through flukes
I didn’t see the lock where was it
That letter was awesome!
it'd be funnier if they didn't mail you any lock, so it seems as if it was perfectly camouflaged
LPL sent the letter to himself + the invisible Master Lock. Very clever move for 5.5 million clicks
i swear not one person on earth would find the lock but he found it i would have never found it
Well damn I just realized your in my county I might have to drop something off at your PO Box that’s cool
They wouldn't dare challenging MCNallyofficial
Morale 4
master lock or Gay lock?
The President of ML resigned after seeing this video
Definitely a joke but man if it was real you just cost some people their jobs 😅
The master lock company to the lockpickinglawyer is like apple to jerryrigeverything
why am i struggeling 5 hours long to open a regular padlock with 7 pins while you just wiggle it around and than it's open :(
Imagine the executive of master lock really sent this to express his embarrassment over his products and sees LPL in the video saying he thinks it is some kind of joke. I don’t think it is what happened, but imagine if that happened for real
When the letter said cement, I thought they filled the lock with cement, and honestly that might work.
:D
Why don't they put a chip that needs contact with the lock while inside the lock and only then it will open. This means the lock itself would need a battery...
They misspelled “its”, one way to tell it’s not from the HQ
I didn't see a lock, you were just holding some tools weirdly
He fiddles with the wave rake less than some people with keys.
Lol😂
my high school had a masterlock on the cabinet where the chemistry teacher kept all the, yknow, chemicals. I did not open that cabinet, but I did unlock a spare padlock of the same sort without much difficulty, and if I were just a little less scared of consequences I mighta grabbed a bottle of ethyl alcohol just to prove I could
lol
I couldn't see the lock but considering he jiggled the air I'm sure the lock wasn't that good
you are hilarious and the cause of deep depression to lock makers 😍😂
Masterlock might be dumb enough to make locks with no security but they're at least smart enough to not publicly Shane themselves with a challenge....
Half of the video was reading the letter 😂
Man drives my saying that “ nothings ever locked”
😂😂😂
Where is the lock? Why is there flying pink tape ???
Wdym, I can't see the lock
guys how is the pink tape floating
nice
me: he's gonna rake it isn't he? lpl: **rakes it**
LPL completely destroys the pride and morale of Master Lock in one of his shortest vids.
The pink tape was a nice touch :)
He took a longer time reading the letter than picking the lock
HOLY SHIT YOURE FROM DAMASCUS! IM FROM CLARKSBURG 🦀🦀🦀🦀
30 seconds in and I’m pretty sure ML just admitted defeat and that they might die as a company soon
I life a few blocks from master lock and work on the same street. I even met the real president on a college trip in high school
Wait where the lock. I could only see the top of it
LMAO
Look at this morty, the whole company turned themselves into a meme. Funniest thing i've ever seen
The relationship between MasterLock and LPL is just something else and it's beautiful
That's nice and all, but how do we know you actually opened the lock? All you did was jiggle your tools in the air a couple times!
where is the lock i only see pink tape
where's the lock
When I read "cement" i legit thought the lock would come with cement blocking the keyhole for "pick proofness"
I don't get it. He wiggled his tools in the air, twice. Did he unlock space or something?
I thought they would send you a safe covered in fake keyways
I wish they would have actually made the lock actually camouflage but no they made the key way quite easy to find
I'm sorry, but if Master Lock was to make a challenging lock. They would have to go bankrupt, just to make one 🤣
I reckon one way of innovating for larger scale locks would be an introduced electronic level for instance an electric circuit that becomes complete on the keys interaction with all each pin and thus releasing it thus once all four have established contacted the lock is released to then turn but that current is very specific meaning that the materials in the key also matter because something made od different materials may be either too conductive or not conductive enough meaning the pins won't release.
*its
Why does LPL pick a floating pink piece of tape?
I'm assuming pretending to represent a company fraudulently is not criminal as long as it's a parody without gain? Is there a lawyer that can answer this question?
This reminds me of all the joke cease and desist letters that tex of the black pants legion  got from GM  like "stop asking us about our portable fusion engines"
Am I the only one thinking the lock was going to have john Cena on it?
Somewhere in a storm-clouded castle far away:  My lord, he managed to pick it! Again! With relative ease!  A person in the shadows: Dammit! But I'll get you next time, LockPickingLaawyeeeer!!!
Where's the lock? All I see is pink tape.
It looks like a 5th grader made a fake letter head and then you used it to type up this letter
its never a fluke
where is the lock he is picking ?
another case won 👏👏👏🍻
🤣
That letter was clearly fake - The grammar was HORRIBLE and NO business letter would start with 'Here is the executive suite of...'.  I do get the joke (camouflaged standard lock, haha)
LOL
What about a lock that is a RDD?
This was such a high quality meme by master lock. FR.
third time watching this lol
well, no need to purchase from master lock.
That is so hilarious 😭🤣
Can you imagine the lock was just a solid chunk of metal.
I have a question, where is the lock?
LPL when they make a keyless lock: (put what you would have put in the replies)
He spent so much time reading the letter and 3 seconds opening the master lock. This guy is OG
What lock?
MasterLock seems kinda sad now
Where is the lock
Below I have typed out a very long and detailed response to your video, however, as I have also coated it in the patented Master Lock 'camo' you will not be able to see it!!!
In think it would have been funny if they simply didn't send the lock.
chances are i will actually buy that lock pick set
bro legit took more time reading the letter than picking the lock XD
What does LPL call people from Oklahoma?     "OK folks".
Nahhh Jit put camo tape over a normal one
I wonder if LPL accidentally re-locks stuff when he's working out of habit. Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke
*its weakest link
Master lock employee morale hits zero as 1 year of engineering wasted by a simple rake pick
Lockpicking Lawyer Heist Movie when?
Hide the lock? 😂
Has LPL ever designed a lock?  Anyway he should.
🤔where was the lock? I just saw some pink tape floating around
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that was quick, wasn't expecting it to be that easy
I gotta say... They're onto something
hi maybe you should have picked the lock with the camo tools.  It would be hard to disprove that you did not pick it if you cant see it or the tools.
LMAO
can't wait for the sequel where he opens with"this is the lockpickinglawyer and i just received a letter from the president of masterlock issuing me a cease and desist order"
Wish he wouldn't have covered the pink tape with his hands while picking. Makes it difficult to see where the lock went
yeah i think the joke would've been funnier if the opening of the lock was the "Master Lock" letter head on the paper not an actual lock
I thought there would just be no lock
they should have instead taken advantage of the fact that LPL is a lawyer and put a tiny contract on the lock, or even a "warranty void if lockpicked" sticker
"Master Lock" CEO: There is no level 0 in challenges. LPL: Done, yes there is... This challenge is level 0.
I wish I had access to one, but we used extremely heavy duty and NSA certified locks when I was in the military. I'd love to see you attempt picking one of those as when a key was damaged for one of the locks, the contracted locksmith had to use a plasma cutter to cut the lock off the cage.
this is clearly a joke, but imagine if master lock actually sent him this as a joke
You broke the rules by finding the lock. It doesn't count!
You know what I’m going to send you a lock which I tampered with and see how well you do
"this is the Lockpicking Lawyer, and i've just received a letter from Masterlock issuing me--" my dumb ass: "a cease and desist?"
Now that's funny. If it's a true response, or not,  it shows that someone has a good sense of humor.
As a young and curious kid "about 8 years old" I attempted to replicate what I've seen in movies when they pick locks. My target was a masterlock. I took one of my sisters Bobby pins and just raked it all around the keyway as a complete novice would do. It opened to my surprise.  So in a nutshell, even an 8 year old can pick a masterlock.
The only pick proof Masterlock is one that is filled with glue or molten solder 🤣
Dam master lock need to up your game
Black box combination locks real estate locks
Still hilarious that people think masterlock gaf.  They mass produce cheap ass locks and sell them so fast it doesn’t matter.  And it won’t stop anytime soon, if ever.
I thought he was gonna pick a lock this video was very disappointed to find none      Dammit someone beat me to it and it was better to just ig ore this comment
Why do the company keep using key anyway🤣 use finger print already🤣
What lock?!
I wonder how frustrating it must be to see some guy pick your masterfully crafted lock in three fucking seconds.
Silly Master Lock
It'd be kinda funny if LPL had The Skeleton Key from TESV.
Master Lock: Featuring our new, unpickable, state of the art, high class, can’t be beat Pad Lock  LPL: unpicka what now?
Destroyed in seconds 😂
At this point I'm just twisted paperclips around the thing I want to lock... just as secure...
Lol i really thought it was master lock who sent that
This man could break into literally fucking anything with a key hole
As soon as I saw LPL pulling out the rake, I knew they're done. XD
That was funny
Dear LockPickingLawyer: you don't have to do things twice to assure us that it's not a fluke, we are all quite confident in your abilities at this point, you could just say "I could totally pick this lock" and we would assume it's not a fluke, even if you don't pick it on camera
Thought this was the start of April
1 minute and 20 sec in and no picking. Enough said.
Home Depot should stop selling Master locks. They're a joke.
Good try, but we know you never found the lock and painted another one you already had. MasterLock just schooled you
There must have been a mass suicide at masterlock.
Ngl I am surprised that Master Lock hasn't tried to copyright strike your channel. Companies have very fragile egos and will often abuse the law in anyway to save face
This might be a joke, I'm sure people who want their stuff protected would hope Master Lock takes it seriously.. if this was really any attempt at making a better luck, they need to fire every r&d person. That and engineer Just does not make sense
It’s never a fluke with LPL…
Wtf? XD
Grabs a lock in thin air. And proceeds to pick it. What now masterlock?.
wait, what happened?? all i saw was a pink tape
I can’t even see it. Are you actually picking something?
When the note said "cement masterlock's reputation" I thought it would be a lock with a keyway filled with cement
I am really tired of the camp is actually invisible joke
😆😆
Brought to you by schlage
@lockpickinglawyer  can you please pick a fireproof (concrete file cabinet) I was told they are hard and weight hundred of pounds
If you had to design an “unpickable” lock. Or more accurately a freaking difficult one to pick. How would you go about doing it?
Well, if you encased the lock beneath 50 meters of cement, and various other heat resistant materials that are extremely difficult to break or destroy, well, and encased it within the planet's core... Gl
OK which one of you assholes sent him the letter
That security tape is impressive.
"This lock is Equal to your Skill"  LPL: Am i a joke to u?
I half wished they sent you a lock that just didn't have a keyhole at all and the plastic/metal wound run around the internals.
While I love watching you take 5 seconds to open a lock, my morale is substantially lowered knowing that I still take 5 minutes and break numerous picks just in the game Skyrim. It’s OK, I’ll be OK
I'm glad you pointed out the words as you spoke otherwise I don't think I could have kept up
So  Master lock runs their business like our government  Quick to waist money with nothing positive from it
“Master lock sent me a challenge” Video is 3 minutes long
Emotional damage!🧑‍🦯🧑‍🦯🧑‍🦯
Funny
I think that’s it’s not possible to build a lock secure enough for infinite time. Humans are some of the most persistent animals and if they want in they will find ways to do so. Locks are about making the job take too long in my opinion. Giving chances for them to be caught by you or others possibly. When there is NO risk of being caught or jail time, etc, and you have all the time possible, there aren’t engineers that live today that could make an “unpickable” lock before the money involved in the research and production of such a lock would then outweigh what’s inside. Take the most secure bank vault in the world right now, give all the humans that want to give it a crack try, giving them 0 time limit. I guarantee they’ll get it open eventually.
Lockpickinglawer picks the air. Wow
What did they hide? Nothing looks hidden on that thing.
I grew up in Chino in Cali, I can confirm that Chino is a host of amazing smartasses. Case in point, this video. xD
Master Lock has earned my respect, not for their locks but for not being a "company"
I've watched this dude a lot, like he could literally picklock the door to your house and br like that was a good joke
LPL: I just received a letter from the president of Masterlock issuing me a… Me: Cease and desist LPL: Challenge Me: *phew* thank God
Good ‘ol youtube algorithm 😂 thanks for the rec
I'm so sick of this camo joke. Oh it's InViSiBlE rIgHt GuYs?
Master Lock used this opportunity to advertise to over 4 million subscribers for free. LoL
😂
Wait is it a thing to make locks seem like they are one type of lock design but they are actually a different type??? Would that do anything?
Holy moly, Mater Lock was made in U.S.? I thought it was Chinese crap. Your key still has standard shape which means lock mechanism has not changed. It's not too hard to have cruciform or dimple key. Hire Japanese lock engineer to renovate your lock mechanism.
Master lock probably using you as free R&D product testing to improve their products lol
It’s in proper format!
I was expecting the lock to be welded shut 😂
Ha! I learned on master locks...
All you did was make the pins set themselves. Can you actually pick it one pin at a time.
"we made a great lock" "I'm going to use my rake"
Anyone knew that guy that one shot masterlocks?
Wait, where was the lock?
Picking leads to poor eyesight? I mean I’ve gotten my share of hand cramps and small slivers of debris in my fingers but I barely use my eyes at all. Mostly my finger tips (picking in freezing weather is very hard) and my ears to hear the click, but aside from seeing where to put the picks my eyes aren’t really involved. LPL, as a locksmith I must say you truly have legit skill. Master has been making garbage for decades but when they bought Dexter and then discontinued the product that made for many bad days at my job bc I couldn’t get parts and had to replace the locks much to the customers dissatisfaction.
When I seen the lock, I laughed. I've had the same lock on a storage shed for at least 20 years, although it's a wee bit faded.
What lock? I did not see any lock
Masterlock trying to make a good lock: Thelockpickinglawyer:
I wonder how a hydro dipped lock would look 🤔
Máster lock: daaaaaamn!!!!
"Ok folks, I hate to further damage Employee Morale" had me lol
Man how’s you find that thing
The Master lock vs 2 Legendary lock pickers LPL and McNally
Thanks for both providing the tools and the tutorials for unlocking locks so that criminals can keep on stealing my shit and pushing my business into bankruptcy.
Are there any locks that aren't picked in less than 60 seconds?
Can’t you just force LPL to give you lock picking lessons and you’ll be able to take down any lock
This video is clickbait, there wasn't even a lock.
Everybody's always hating on Master Lock. I use Master Lock locks to secure the ramp doors on my car trailer... Because they fall out and get lost less often than lynch pins. LOL
got to say a an almost 3 minute long video showing off a Master Lock  that has got to be a record.
This is how easy locks open with the right tools. Looks like ML needs to step it up
I used this lock, I can’t get in my shed though because I can’t see the many locks I needed because they’re master locks
dude 😂
Do you have a video with a lock that you would suggest is a decent buy, as it seems all of the locks you come across are just a waste of space and more of deterrent for opportunists over actual criminals
LOL! Next thing will be a lock coated with invisible ink. Vanishing cream. Paint remover.
That was a letter from Master Lock rivals to bring them down 😂😂😂😂
This guy could pick the gates of heaven lol
Took longer to read letter than the picking.
The garbage writing in this letter lmao.
Ooooh!!  MoCo!!
Master locks or trash I used 6 disks master log To lock up a $100000 worth of fireworks This past 4th of July And a crook overnight came by with a key from another master lock and open every single one that was on my door So I took it  Upon myself To go back to home depotAnd by several more disk blocksAnd upon investigationEach disclock key will open every single dislock even though they were in separate packagesI myself is taking it uponTo Sue masterlock For $500000  For product loss and loss of income  heed my warning do not buy master lock
This might be one of Master Lock's greatest creations. LPL had to use real lockpicking tools instead of improvised things made from stuff like ballpoint pens and LEGO pieces.
I got a challenge for you LPL. Install the game SCUM and try to pick the golden lock 😜
That letter was obviously satire and likely written by someone pretending to be a Masterlock spokesman.  Still funny though! 🤣
Thought they would have poured cement into ot
Hey, at least they are good sports about it.  I don't think anyone has ever bought a cheap Master Lock with the expectation that it was pickproof from someone who  knows what they are doing - they buy them only to slow down the casual thief.
Safest lock bicycle to buy ?
poor those at ML, they gonna go bankrupt with LPL ... hahaha
The pink tape is a great idea, glad you didn't lose it after!
When you write a letter to yourself but great skills dude
Locks are a waste of money my plasma cutter has destroyed locks from darpa there is nothing a human can build that we can't get through . Lasers thermite diamond cutters plasma even freezing with nitro nothing is truly protected
I think it would be hilarious if for April fools you just cut and edit your videos skipping the unlocking process.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend- masterlock
Shows a wave rake...  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME
MasterLock are clowns. I've been picking them since I was born. I can design a unpickable lock hmu
This dude face the final boss, while 100% clear in-game.
How did you put the tape on while the lock was closed? I think this video was clearly fake and this simply isnt even a padlock
Stuff made here did it better than master lock XD
*spends multi million dollars on a lock he cant beat* *also gets into the lock within seconds* “what? You cant do that :(“
I didn’t think there was gonna be a lock
I feel like Masterlock knew what they were doing and just did this to show off their new lock  Edit: lmao I didn't watch it all the way through
Has there ever been a Lock you couldn’t pick?
i didnt see him pick the lock ? where was it
Wow this was some cleverly disguised click bait.
I was kinda hoping there wouldn't be a lock in the package; so well camouflaged it's like it's not even there.
E M O T I O N A L   D A M A G E
That is just silliness... why would they send such trash?
Started watching thinking how did a master lock last long enough for a 2 minute video ended it with a smile on my face.
Looks like I can open that thing with a hard fart
4 pins? even a 5 dollar lock has 6 pins what the fuck?
“This is a very funny joke” he says with his emotionless lawyer voice
I only saw a pink tape and some floating lockpicking tools...
LPL is a beast!!! Killed them in less than 15 seconds
It would have been funny if he didn't include a lock
I hate to be 'that guy' but I don't for a minute believe that Master Lock sent this letter. If this channel's presenter really had damaged the morale of the company's employees, their response wouldn't look like this.
I think they are loosing sales because they make a junk lock I don’t know how much you charge for the tools but I’d say having never picked a lock I could do it now if I had two of your tools.
Master Lock probably did that to raise brand awareness, now a lot of people will remember this brand.
🤕 ouch
Took longer to read the well written letter than to pick the cheap Master lock!
Where’s the lock?
So apparently the lock picking lawyer lives in my area code
I thought it was a letter from Mr "End of quote" president
I’m surprised you didn’t just give a wow laugh cause not going to lie this video is funny
You make these letters yourself
😂😂😂
Lock picking lawyer here is a challange: find a lock that will take you 10 mins to open thus giving you a 10 min video
Wow
In today's Twitter complaint box world, you would think that Master Lock would be at least aware of this channel by now.
My daughter has a Master Lock combination lock that she didn't have the combo for.  You inspired me to learn how to figure out the combo and when I got it on the first try, her head nearly exploded. 😂😂
Lmao the level of trolling between the viewr and creater against master lock is just...everything
Hey LPL, Does Mrs LPL like that line "let's do it again to prove it wasn't a fluke"   too?
No need to pick it, they included 2 keys
Robbers : Subscribe this channel . Get the tools he use .
I thought the visibility coating was going to be about 4 inches of concrete all around.
That’s it I’m throwing all my master locks away and selling the stock. What a trash company.
Great commercial for master lock
I'm gonna have to take your word for it. All I saw was a piece of floating pink tape and you seemingly handling thin air...
WHY ARE YOU UPLOADING VIDEOS WITHOUT LOCKS IN THEM?!? just some tape? some kind of joke?!? i dont get it 😡😡😡😡
🤣🤣🤣  Dayummmm
You didn't even show the lock on screen. Probably fake.
This man is badass
The funny part is that letter was really from Master Lock
lololol this guys a beast
Phenomenal!
Ha Ha Ha I so enjoy you and your subs! Keep up the good work! Thanks for what you do!
Lol
Lol master locks don't work...they try so hard and fail
Thank you lockpicking lawyer. as the CEO of masterlock,u more people are buying master locks more than ever. Sales are through the roof due to free advertising. Our locks can only be opened by lockpicking lawyer and no one else!
😂😂Better luck next time Master Lock!
Omg! That’s my hometown and zip code! It’s Damascus md! I can assure you having lived there my entire life there is no master lock place anywhere near Damascus Maryland 😂😂😂
I watch LPL for the plot
Breaking News: Employees from Master Lock stage a massive walk-out. One employee states, "Whats the point on making these locks that some random dude can pick them in 3 seconds? I work overtime for this? I dont see my family for this?"
I guess I need to know what lock I should buy
i feel like they only half-committed to the gag
Top cover seems to me might hiding something more...
Bro they spent a lot of money to make this then you pick it in 5 seconds LOL
lol
This is the meaning of life 🙏🏻
Masterlocks finest, defeated by a lockpicking crackhead with a piece of pink tape...
*breaks into top secret government facility* "Let's do that again just to make sure it was not a fluke"
wait but where is the lock?? not very easy to follow when there is just a bar with tape but no lock :((((
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👌
Due to these videos, I don’t feel secure using any key lockxD
The challenge: open the lock -Goes ahead and open the lock in like 3 seconds- Bruh
After this video the self esteem at Master Lock can no longer be observed by scientific means.
As the flash once said. Why don't you mail him the bullet?!
Generous budget. What? They offered him 100 bucks?
Hi
Ha Ha
i can't see
Wow, I wonder if “Brinks” will write him next! I always bought Brinks locks.
F
that's so embarrassing.  it looks like Masterlock is from an era long gone.  they need to embrace nano manufacturing technologies
Wait, there was a lock in this video?
Master Lock would qualify for Ruzzian army IMO 😁
You know the lock is crap when more than half of the video is of LPL reading the letter 😂
WHAT IS WITH all of this "camouflage" business that has been around since about 2011 or so?  And WHY put it on a lock? It's kind of retarded. To me it's not concealed at all!! It would only be concealed if one was trying to lock something up in the woods or grass etc. But how often does that occur? Is this suppose to fool the crook initially and then they discover what they are trying to steal has a lock? I don't get it. Many people today are SO STRANGE AND WEIRD! That includes the heads of Master Lock.
I was hoping that you just went along with their letter and pretended to open an invisible lock.
🤣
Next up the Gordian Knot!
I'm with "Hidden", as I was expecting him to open and empty box with just a letter challenging him to find their lock. I don't think I'll buy from that company.
I just saw a pink piece of tape floating around.
They spent more time writing that letter then picking their “new innovation”. Terrible.
I had to play this video four times before I could finally see the lock... nice work Master Lock! 😁
I don't understand the relationship between eye sight and time spent picking locks.
Awesome  !!
Does the auto printed zip code on where the letter came from match where their hq is?
I was expecting there to be nothing in the box lol
Look at the title.  Look at the video length.  Laugh.
😂😂😂😂good job.
I've literally made a padlock shim out of a coke can...these locks are a joke
🤣
Maybe that lock was a decoy and the real lock is still hidden in the envelope.
I often see padlocks
At first I thought the camouflage was going to be Inside the lock :P
Hey I’m from chino ca. small world
Add More Camouflage... That's why 😂
1.5 seconds   That's a shitty lock.
All these letters you get are fake. Don’t fall for it ladies and gents
Wait; one can *legally* purchase lockpicks?  Sheesh, wish I had known that a couple weeks ago.  What a country!
How come you've never showed anybody how to pop off the back of a garage door opener and take the code and make your own?  My buddy has one that sends out a million codes every few seconds Garage doors just magically pop open for him
Nice to see that you can pick thin air
The only innovation here is in the free marketing they get from LPL for their camouflage lock.
I thought the joke was that it was sent in a normal envelope
Should have use john cena prints instead of camo which is too easy to find.
I used to live in Oak Creek, WI. Why I had to watch lol
They could have pranked him with a lock that does not unlock.. at all.  You can twist it,  jiggle it, pick at it.. does nothing. Then he would try and try and try..
The only way to make money as a locksmith is to become a YouTube famous locksmith.
What Padlock? I don't see no Padlock???????
What did he actually do? All I see is a pink tag floating around. Somebody explain please.
btw probably a terrible idea to show people how to open locks and sell the tools needed to do so. criminals must LOVE your channel
Tbh lpl should buy masterlock
almost as easy to get in as the back door of a gaybar afterhours on Friday
I’m sorry i miss it all i saw was a Where is the lock 🔒?
Honestly, If they really did put camo on this as an attempt to hide it on outdoor equipment, why wouldn't they make they make the shiny part black? Seems counter intuitive to cover something in camo and then have an extremely shiny part on it. I'm probably overthinking it. haha
Lol 😆
they didn't see the pink sticker coming.!
My locks have four legs, a collar and come to "sickem"...
Even I can easily open Masterlock's. They are a joke.
Hahahaha if i was the owner of master lock or any other lock company i would send a letter and ask you to join the company and check all our products
You taught me how to pick my first lock!
Took him longer to read the first sentence than it did to unlock the “craptastic” lock - they should change their name to “No Lock”  I’m pitching all of my master locks and putting fencing wire around my latch. It will take a person longer to cut the wire than to pick the lock. Hey Master Lock I think you should put LPL on retainer it’s obvious your engineers/developers have no clue what they are doing.
They slowed him down with a letter.
Master locks were advertised at one time to be able to take a bullet and remain locked...
It's like the ol man always said "a lock only keeps an honest person out"
Should've been wrapped in a paper with John cenas face on it too
Ummmmm how did you make the ends of those tools disappear and why were you holding just the metal piece of the lock.
Honestly it sounded like a legitimate letter until the last few sentences LOL
can you make a lock that even you can't pick?
Try to open the lock without having the pink tape and see if you can still open it. 😨
Hmmm  At this point i think a chinese puzzle box should be the outside husk.
Anybody else think this could just be a marketing ploy by Master Lock to get people looking at the newest lock that ummm well obviously doesn't work.
Where’s the lock? All I see is pink tape
All of these are extremely easy for a lock smith There's a much easier way.
Another great video
They are easiest to pick. But the cheap locke are harder to pick.
Good thing you were able to pick it open you would never have been able to use the keys they had locked them onto the shackle
The letter was obviously a joke.
one question, if you please....  the master lock i want to pick is inside of a 4" ID steel,  concrete reinforced cylinder with an OD of 24"  its only big enough to get one hand in,  i can not send a physical example as it would weigh approximately 140 pounds.    i love the gate and i want to keep it,  i just want to change the lock.   Can it be picked with one hand?
Bloody hell, all I saw was a pink strip of tape flapping around in the air. It's like he was picking the air when the ends of his tools disappeared into something not there at all!
That was a pretty good joke.
If they were real fans they would know the only thing that prevents LPL from getting into a lock is surrounding it in a few rolls of duct tape
HAHAHAHAHAHA
Lol way to go MASTER LOCK
why was this video  not put up on 1 april
is it weird I never had access to the tools you use but I was always able to pick locks? masterlock specifically all I used was paper clips and hair pins. I watched so much prawn lol aka my father thought a lock could keep me out of the stash Nope!.
If Master Lock was smart they'd make you their CEO.
ouch
Damn. That would suck if this was real.
Does EVERY clip have to have a totally non-covert product plug.
I am afraid Master Lock's employees' morale may down another notch after this incident. And their President is to blame.
It would have been funny to pan over the table and say you can't find it, then use a magnet to expose the weakness of such a design. Then you mark one of the keys with some tape. After picking it, you take the keys off, put down the lock, and lose the lock again.
Someone is going to be hearing from Master Lock's lawyers.
A nice reminder that locksport isn't just about the challenge but also about the fun. 🤣👍
Nice one :)
Next time try to pick a john cena lock
>Minute and a half left > oh boy gonna be good > calmly explains what  spec the tensioner is > holy shit he is taking his sweet time this is gonna be real good > brings out wave rake pick > this mans just destroyed master locks whole career.
Your voice reminds me of technoblade
I've been picking Master padlocks and some other brands and types for years. The ones that are spring loaded (the lock pops open) are the easiest. The ones that you have to pull down on are a little harder (combination locks are like that). In the first case you just have to hit the lock on the side with a hammer or other heavy object. It often takes several whacks to get it done. If it isn't spring loaded, you need to wrap a cord around the body of the lock and pull on it while you strike it with the hammer. The metal the locks are made of are hard enough that no dents are left in the lock when it's struck by the hammer.
LPL: Picks lock on nuclear control board from government, and launches rocket on putin.        Also LPL: let’s do that again to prove it wasn’t  a fluke…..
Dear LPL, Can you recommend a good lock?
I guess they don't know that lockpicking is more feel then sight.
Whew! For a second there I thought it might really be from Masterlock (there’s no such thing as _bad_ press) but then I saw them misuse “it’s” and thought “if it really came from Masterlock, dude needs a new secretary, or shouldn’t be a CEO.”
Doesn’t even bother picking the lock, just shakes it 😂
Picking it while wearing a pair of camo gloves would have been epic! We wouldn't even have been able to see your hands!
I am not totally sure if the picking now took 3,5 or 10 .... the most variance is due to the talking in between. can you pick it a third time so we can get the timing correct next time?
What lock? All I saw was a piece of pink tape floating around in midair.
This man be picking empty air like we wouldn't realize
LOCKS SEEM TO BE A JOKE. I WOULD HAVE LEARNT IF I DIDNT TONS OF OTHER PROJECTS.
You, sir, possess no flukeage ability.
The seeing eye dog and pink tape was cheating imo. There's no way you have those in your standard pick set.
Master Lock:  You can break it if you can't find it.  Gotcha.
To prove that the lock is easily picked, try using a knife and bobbypin.
Not gonna lie, when the letter said "thinking outside the box" and "cement our reputation" i was 100% sure it was a lock encased in cement, appended in a bag outside of the box.
hahaha thats was funny
Master Locks, in my opinion, are the easiest locks to pick after a warded lock.
So far I have only seen one lock this guy can't pick! And that is the Bowley lock.
Wait a sec, your blind?
Why did you choose the wave rake as opposed to any other tool?
I winder though does he try to open the locks without knowing what the insides look like
Funny good stuff!
oof.. :/ i feel embarrassed for master
After making hundreds of essays and a handful of thesis papers. That left justified letter hurts my soul.
I didn’t see a lock
What if they made a John Scena lock?
I bet I could make a one pin lock, and it would be more secure than a masterlock
The man can do Comedy as well
Awesome tools 🙂
That letter was hilarious, pure gold
😂
That's my exact sense of humour, very nice.
Only way I see is to make that particular lock pick proof would be to drop it on the forest floor and try to find it🤣🤣🤣
Lol 😂..
it's probably a rival lock company
I wonder if Master Lock exists at all
Man I am feeling embarrasment for them. So much it hurts.
Me, looking at 3 min video time: "this lock is already dead..."
i want a stream of you picking masterlock 1000 times, just like how mr. beast did those counting videos
How would a combination of number pad plus key lock work?  1st, the 4 digits on the pad and then the key lock.
If they were serious, they’d ask you…. So much for a Masters in BA…😂🤣😆
Where's the lock? I don't see it.
man imma get me a rake. i cant tell you how many times ive dispatched a piece of equipment only to be given the wrong key so we gotta play guessing games on which key set works.
The pink tape really added to the video. Bravo.
Fake
MasterLock's engineers: We've finished sir. Boss: So, where's the lock? Engineers: It's camoufladge somewhere, now payup
where's the lock? all I saw were the tools and some pink thing
I wonder how many storage containers got emptied out because of your channel....hmmm
I hear master lock is making a lock that teleports. Its been found that it leaves the premises with valuables unguarded but at least R&D has determined the lock is pick resistant.
WAS THIS WAS A JOKE OR ARE THE PEOPLE AT MASTER LOCK FUKIN IDIOTS, I SHOULD JUST BUY ONE AT THE DOLLAR STORE , I THINK THEY ARE A DOLLAR///
What an awful shame! Imagine the faces of Masterlock’s management watching this vid. Will they fire their engineers?
That is a masterpiece of a letter..
Would have been a lot funnier if they didn't include a lock on the package, then claim he couldn't pick the lock he didn't find.
How can you tell if a lock needs a jiggle stick think or needs to be picked with proper tools??
Wait I still can't seem to find the lock in this video, the camo is a little too good. Can anyone link me where I can see this lock?
Oh the master lock as a young kid around 10 I figured out while playing around at home with one trying to become a lock picker that it could be opened with the tooth pic and tweeser of a Swiss army knife. When  the lock opened and I could do it with the other master locks we had I thought I would grow up to be a bank safe robber. But the only thing that did happen is I was able to open the hockey warming house 30 min early. Also MacGyver was a top show so he probably realy showed or influenced the pick sadly I didn't become the safe breaker in a gang of bank robbers. Or did I 🥸
When I first saw this video, I thought the lock would be welded shut
Next MasterLock is going to send a lock that they state is for sure unpickable. LPL is going to try, only for the lock to electrocute him, as that is the only way MasterLock could think of stopping this guy.
Master lock got destroyed
I don't get it. You never showed us the lock.
I bought a master lock and the key that came with it opened 9 out of 10 other master locks I tried it on
Plot twist: it was actually send by the president of Master Locks 😭
LPL be careful. The real Master Lock is sending hitmen next
why is lpl trying to pick a random bit of tape
LPL uses video editing to make it seem like he can pick this lock much faster than is possible in a real life scenario.  For example, this lock uses camoflauge as a primary feature to make it hard to find, but he completely edits out all of the time spent searching for the lock with a seeing eye dog.  For all we know, it took him over 6 months to actually find the lock and begin the 2nd stage of the picking process with his tools.  Very misleading.
I love how the reading took way longer than the lockpicking
Master could sell the lock without a key quicker to just pick it open every time.
These countermeasures were insufficient. For the next iteration of the product I suggest wrapping it in several layers of tape and packaging.
I'm still awaiting a video where the waveraking ends up being a fluke and he has to resort to single pin picking.
that was pretty funny.
omfg thats a real thing i used to work at that masterlock doing their cnc
Im sorry, whats happening? It just looks like he's waving the picks around
At this point I suspect you could pour cement into a Master Lock and it'd find a way to open
“Let’s see if we can open this unbreakable lock”  *Video is less than 2 minutes long*
I thought they were going to "cement" the key hole.  Honestly. Would have been a nice move on their part.
LPL: accidentally stepped on a flute LPL: purposely stepped back on the flute to make sure it wasn't a fluke LPL: It wasn't a fluke, it was a flute
The Finest Engineers are so so fine :)))
dude, you are demoralizing Masterlock 😂. I was looking at their products in my country and found the Master Lock 1165D. Bought it and the product feels really good, in another level of product. Please, give them a chance to show they have something above garbage. I'd send one of these to you myself as these are surprisingly cheap in my country, however shipping cost is prohibitive. If freight from Canada to wherever you live is cheap I can arrange to send you a copy. And I don't even live in Canada at all: someone I know will be there in the next month, so depending of the costs I'd ask this person to take the product to Canada, and then ask a friend of mine who lives there to ship the Master 1165D to you. Yeah, that is how I am committed to make it happen
Thank god he put that pink piece of tape
you know, if it really would be a MasterLock President, i would for sure gave them a credit, for being absolutely hilarious and selfcritical this time, this "challenge" gave me a good laugh for sure))) an innovation of being invisible to a lockpicker - this is some heavy face punch )))
Entertaining 🤣
I did some research on Google maps with the address and found that your letter and lock is legitimate and indeed did come the master lock company president!!But still it is no excuse for not making an effort to improve on the design weaknesses and making the lock almost flawless and this just how much I am saying that you are right about them and what you said in your video about them!!
😂😂
What a joke! Thanks for sharing it with everyone!
Oh i get good one masterlock
Hats off to the jokester, very funny.
Embarassing engineering kids designing locks of a computer this is what happens when they don't get a lock master to design there locks. Locks just give the impression of security if someone wants in they will get in. MASTER LOCK your ceo an board need sit down an let this man develop a lock that's atleast somewhat difficult
It's never a fluke.
Hey, I couldn't see it. wtf?
They should've sent you a red plastic safety lock with camo tape on it.
was it a joke or real letter?
I think Ms. LPL found the camo lock for him
Clearly a joke🤣
The spelling error, spelled as "it's" instead of the correct "its" in the letter should have given it away immediately.
I hope you have an apprentice that you can pass your skills onto, you are a Lock Master.
I almost thought you were going to say "Cease and Desist" 😂
The moment they said that changes today I said shut up and I think I have the urge to find a paperclip now
You sir, just got finessed.  They succeeded as the lock you cannot see is located at the return address where the morale of their employees is located behind the pin code locked door using the phone number listed.  After entering through the door you will trigger a 90 second alarm in which you are to enter the first character of each sentence which spells out SORRYFORWASTINGYOURTIME
If it was a real letter from Master Lock it probably would’ve said “keep your picks out our fucking locks!”
Ah yes, the John Cena lock
Finest engineers huh 😆
It took more time to read the letter!!!!
I haven’t laughed this hard in my life, I mean a good can’t breathe boarder line black out laugh…… the G.O.A.T!!!!
the sad thing is that most people still think there great locks. i was at my local hardware store and I was looking at locks and there was a woman shopping for a new lock for her door and she had a kwickset in her hands and you could see the keys so I told her that's not a good choice then someone that works there came up and asked if she needed any help she asked about the lock and he replied that brand is on about 80% of homes in the US so she bought it
Fantastic ! I do appreciate your skills .
You rock lol.  This made my day haha
if that really was from Master lock, then they just seriously embarrassed themselves. 😂
I was half expecting they poured epoxy down the shake to permanently disable the lock.
Master lock is gonna release the master lock invisible which is invisible
imagine making millions of dollars on a lock that can be picked with 2 pieces of thin metal. and calling your company "master lock". and being proud of your product.
The moment when picking the lock isn't even 10% of the video
I'd love to see someone send LPL a block of steel
How is he picking a floating key way?
LPL needs to start putting quotation marks around the word “lock” in his title
The hardest part of the challenge was probably finding the lock.
LOL
Where's the lock?
Even though this was just a fan, that doesn't really devalue this video, for me at least. It's still a good joke at the very least. I'd think that Master Lock would sooner try to sue you for defamation or something because you 'aren't accurately representing the strength of our locks' or something along those lines. Then you'd have the 50 most petty bike thieves be witnesses and have them pick the 'strongest' Master Lock easily and you'd win the case.
So I couldn't find the key to my little MasterLock 20mm lock. Knowing that ML is usually sh*t thanks to LPL, I figured I'd try picking it. I of course don't have any picking tools, so I put a few bends into a straightened paperclip to make a rake and used a mini flathead screwdriver to tension the thing, and sure enough it worked after several rakes.
How is Masterlock still in business? 🤣😂
I was about to say I would have been very surprised if master lock actually did that. But honestly I thought master lock was the best until I found this channel.
Realized Master Lock is ALL GARBAGE, RUBBISH, JUNK, INFERIOR, PILE OF SHIZZLE, NOT WORTHY of purchase.
The pink tape, the nemesis of master locks And the joke would have been 10/10 if they sent just a shackle in the box
This was BRUTAL.
Makes ya wonder if there’s even a point in using locks lol
Camouflage locks tripp me out as much as camouflage cell phone cases, camouflage pocket knives and camouflage keys. It's like "let's make something that when dropped on anything but concrete, becomes extremely difficult to find again" 👍🤣 I guess if you drop it you could use your camouflage flashlight and your camouflage metal detector to find it
I don’t get it. Why is he picking at the air?
they say hes still laughing at it
You got to pick it three times, it establishes a pattern. One is a fluke, two is a coincidence, and three is a pattern.
This video has a post credits scene
MasterLock is just a marketing front isn't it?
Tough love
How to beat Lockpicking lawyer: weld the entire house door, windows, any hole in the house have and make it vacuum then hide the house on another dimension with 9000 dungeons to protect it also set a lot of decoy house to make sure the real house never found
The tumbnail had an emoji in it so I think I must dislike out of princable
he just wiggled the picks around in the air above a pink strip.
😆 what
Go to random street and pick the random lock u see first as a challenge
It's that something extra that keeps me coming back to the LockPickingLawyer, you do not disappoint.
If it's a camofllock I can't see it being opened.
🤪😂😂😂
In reality Masterlock is just getting free testing on their products to learn what to do to make it harder for picking locks
Used “Dear intruder” it was very affective +90 second set back
i want to see their reactions when he opened it
This guy picks locks faster than I use the key.
its, not it's
Man if only Masterlock actually reached out to LPL, I was so excited that this was an actual interaction for a minute.
But how long did it take you to find the lock?
🤣🤣🤣
They could be right about the bad eyesight....as LPL needs to use his fingers to read the letter........
I found some Master locks in a abandoned storage unit. Located my old lock picking set and raked them open in seconds. Your YouTube videos inspired me to start practicing again. Master locks isn't much for practicing but they sure put a smile on my face when I pop it open
Sometimes I feel like he is "One punch man" for lock companies 😂😂🙏🙏
Several years ago I locked my keys in the storage room I had. Wish I would have heard how easy it is ( I would not have had time to order on) I had to walk a couple of miles, get a pal to give me a ride (gas $$) and go purchase a side -grinder.and a new lock. Ended up destroying the 1st lock by cutting it off. It was a bummer of an afternoon.  I am not good at breaking in places. If you pull it shut, it just as well be a bank vault --I am not going to get in . I would not even try. Maybe I am too honest. I try to be! If others were like me, there would not be a reason for locks at all. But your videos sure do open my eyes.  What can a person do about the salt air making a lock hard to turn? I live at the beach and my work requires me to get in rentals often to repair something or another.  This is a common problem.
That’s a pretty good joke
Great job mate, and love the joking matter
Clearly a joke, if that letter had been an official communication from Master Lock it would have utilised the Master Lock corporate font, Comic Sans.
So camo is not the best way to hide something???
Sure could use some Jimmie cone !!
I've got a good suggestion for a video. You should try 3d modelling your own pick proof lock. Or even.. have it manufactured.   I think it would be a fun video just to give masterlock some 'inspiration'
You know it's gonna be embarrassing when he pulls out the rake
They tired of you lol
Master Lock : *Spends more than 1.000$ on a lock* LPL : *Unlocks it in 7 seconds*
Lmao wtf Master Lock didn't even send that? Would have been so cool if they did
Master Lock Marketing Department:  "We have a new camouflaged lock that we want to bring to market". VP of Marketing:  Your advertising budget is $10. Intern:  "My college professor said there's no such thing as bad publicity.  How about sending one to the Lock Picking Lawyer?"
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
this man dropped an april fools video in February
Typical MasterLock detection avoidance mechanism: Can be defeated with a piece of bright colored paper.
I feel like this guy could lockpick a brick wall.
LPL unlock the stargate, then lock it back up and show us how he did. LPL:"Nothing on first sign, two is binding, three is set, back to one and its open."
This is the fastest KO I've watched till now...omg!!!
LOL
lmao
I honestly thought that the joke would have been perfect if no lock had been included lol.
That is devastating for Master Lock. Perhaps they have to go to start again.
nice
Plot twist: it was a elaborate fan idea to get into a video
"as and a consequence"  lol
Masterlock knew sending any kind of special lock would only end in embarrassment so they instead make a joke of it for some free advertisement.
It didn't open very quickly, it open immediately
Okay that's pretty funny
Lol
LOL! What a fantastic joke!
I love how he jokingly went along that he's blind by saying he had to "have his seeing eye dog find it and then put on hot pink tape so he wouldn't lose it again"
Wait, you’re in Maryland? Hell yea
Master Lock gets snarky LPL doubles down on the snarky  😆
This Channel Should Be Banned For Security Purpose’s
when it said cement I thought for sure the lock would be in cement.
As the old saying goes;"locks only keep out honest people."  Humorous fan letter, and I'm glad he played along.
Would asking the LPL to create a lock he could not pick be like asking God to make a stone so big He could not lift it?
Right on bro... lol... That was great to see. You da man brother.
Lol
LMAO THIS IS HILARIOUS
Locks are just to keep honest people out.
it's
Picked faster than the length of the ad before the video.
Could you recommend some good locks (strong/hard pick) to use uk? 🇬🇧
this guy unstoppable. . .
From the Bloons community I can say that wearing red wristbands help with seeing camo.
A city named Damascus? Only in America... no wait...
The fact that they’ve taken all of your ribbing in such good spirits makes me respect that company
What lock are you picking? I see no lock at all! Isn’t he just picking air?
I thought that they filled it with cement
Ok, security measures against Locking picking lawyer  First, a note, so he can read and be slowed down Second, duct tape Third, the best lock! (he will open in 10 seconds)  This will slow him down in 1 to 2 minutes at least, depending on the amount of duct tape and the size of the note
I thought the joke was going to be that there was no actual lock in the package, so you couldn't find it, meaning it had been sufficiently camouflaged
You know it's a weak lock when he chooses a rake to open the lock.
You're awesome!! Made me grin. 👍🏆
LPL is just seeing a floating core and shackle XD
The Cena line of padlocks is finally here. 😮
They really did well with that John Cena lock.
It would be way funnier if there actually wouldn't be a lock in the letter.
Actually....there are lock companies either fly the locksmith out to their headquarters for multiple locks or safes in progress or ship a lock to them and ask them defeat it, how they did it, and their personal feedback about the lock in question. I got the privilege to talk with a Master Safe Technician and CML that made a nice living doing basically what LPL is doing here.
"opportunity to cement Master Lock" I was expecting a lock covered in cement
hahaha good one
there is no lock, just a floating shackle! where can i buy it?
Almost made me unsubscribe. Terrible joke and commentary
Poor guys. They get humiliated every single time 😭
Honestly I was expecting them to just not even send a lock
What is he doing? There’s nothing there
Why not make it harder with A weak piece of glass like a safe from some movies where if broken, will never open unless Heavy tools are used.
How did he get that pink tape to float in the air like that????
LPL "just received a from the president of master lock, but I'm pretty sure it's a joke from one of you" Master Lock president  " hehe...yeah... " * sobs *
My daughter had a Master Lock padlock for her bike that didn't need an LPL to defeat it. She had lost the key. I just used an eighteen-inch pair of bolt cutters to cut the chain. Snip snap and her was loose. A lock is no better than the chain it's on.
Shit... I almost didn't see the lock... Thank god for that pink tape!
Hahahaha
Wait, where was the lock?
Love how they can have fun with the public.
My friends Smith & Wesson haven't found a lock they can't open.
18 inch long johnsen
ROFLMFAO 😂😂😂
It wasn't a fluke. I repeat, it wasn't a fluke...
The enganers:hmmmmm he has to be blind so let's make it the exact same but make it camaflarged
I love imagining this person's motivation for making this joke. Imagine walking through the hardware aisle, glancing at the locks, and seeing a "camo" lock on the "higher security" end of the aisle. Hilarious.
Just curious. What type of law do you practice?
Really thought they did sum😂
This is hilarious... I'm not sure if this is great marketing or what
Your videos definitely inspires future burglaries
A padlock with an internal mechnisun designed like a Chubb Detector Lock  now that would be intresting , , even a tiny amount of tampering and the lock jams , alerting the owner to a tampering attempt and requiring a special key to release the anti tamper trap ..
He was just wiggling the tools in the air, where’s the lock?
They should've just not sent a lock
i skipped over the letter reading part, so i thought this was an actual lock they made just so he couldnt pick it, and he still picked it immediately XD XDXDXD  I thought this guy had a third eye for lockpicking XD after reading the comments i am now in on the joke XDXDXD  "ive added the pink tape so we dont lose it" confused me so much XDXDXD
''Seeing eye dog'' 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂🤣😭
lmao
I didn't see any lock
Technically they slowed you by a year because of production.
U gotta kill this lock 😂🔒
What’s the point of these videos
Soon they gon be making locks for the locks
Honestly after seeing your channel I don’t think there is a lock that isn’t pickable
“Told them to think outside the box” Didnt tell them to think outside the locks
I'm surprised it wasn't spray-painted the grey of his work surface ;P
You are such a clown dude. Your videos are bringing me so much joy especially while I was just trapped on the runway for an hour in Coach because the airport was backed up. I know first world problems but keep up the good work
The most disrespectful thing on this video is he had taken a longer time to read the letter than lockpicking the lock itself. 🤣🤣💀💀
Would’ve been great if they took all the pins out of the core before sending it.
....could it have been Bosnian Bill as the sender I wonder
That was embarassing.
I enjoy your videos even though I am not a lock picker myself. Kudos to the supposed subscriber who sent you this “challenge”. Humour is always enlivening.
Bro just ended a years work and think outside the monke brain work in 5 seconds....RESPECT BRUV
It would have been funny if they sent the letter and just not included a lock
Lockpicking lawyer, legit heister, must have a dlc character in pd2 haha
If it was a elaborate joke then they really went all out by using the real president of masterlock's name at the end
"Dear LPL,  [Insert Epic of Gilgamesh]"  Ive created lock that can sustain an attack from LPL for a long time.
Fake defamation lawsuit coming at you from master lock
Guys I can’t see the lock  What’s he doing ?
Excellent letter!!
Congrats on picking the decoy lock, now find the real lock the challenge was issued on....
Thats cute haha
It’s a camouflage design so lock pickers might not see it. If that is what they are hoping for
Ngl when it said they'd be taking advantage of bad eyesight I thought it was going to be a teeeensy tiny lock
Shit! Why didn't we consider the pink tape trick!?
😂😂😂😂
This man literally got every single view on his channel
The fact that they still call themselves "master lock" after countless videos is embarrassing
Just grabs some tools and starts waving them about in the air?  You can't just claim your pink tape is a lock you know.
What if you didn’t have the seeing eye dog though?
Yeah it's a fake letter. I can write a letter better than that
I hope LPL does not reach the gate of hell and unlocks it...
So, where was the lock you were picking? I didn't see anything.
Somebody followed LPL closely ...
Hmmmm
LMAOOOOOO
wow pro camoflauge
Wow i almost cant see it
Master lock eat your arrogance, that's what happens when you don't know how to manage projects! Myself as a manager I would invite this content creator as an expertise and hire him for a new project to help making a better product! After this video your brand is going to lose even more prestige! Next time think twice.
Master lock be like: "listen here you little sh!t"
It would be funny if it didn't come with a lock
The fact that it takes longer for LPL to tell you what tools he’s using than it takes him to actually pick the lock is so entertaining.
They should have just included an empty box that actually had no lock in it.
I mean, I bought a $30 lock picking kit that came with 3 locks to pick. The masterwork I have was just as easy as the trainers. I have 0 trust in locks now.
this would be brilliant and freaking hilarious (more so than it already is) if that actually *was* the president of Master Lock sending it out knowing it to be a joke (even more hilarious if it was legit through and through XD)
So you picked a set of floating keys and pink tape? such a grifter...
Next episode is gonna be a a Masterlock coated in Lead And then the episode after that is a Masterlock coated in "Fortified-Ceramic"
OMG, THAT’S WHERE I’M FROM!!!
Master Lock, you tried… :)
Honestly these lockpicking videos have me thinking of buying a wave rake and turner just to see for myself how easily a guy with no skill like me can pick some locks
It would be a lot of fun to learn how to pick for the fun of it but I feel like if I order some stuff online the police will be at my door before the package arrives
Lol love it
I kinda expected them to not include a lock at all. that wouldve been way more funny
LOL Best way to make fun of a camouflaged lock.
Idk whats worse, that I knew that it was the Master Lock address, or the fact I cant tell if its fake or not
the pink tape so you will be sure to find the lock again!    thank you for the laughs
Masterlock can better sell bread or something else, locks are the worst they ever made
Does anyone else see a lock? Because I don't.
Can you do one on gun safes that have a key secondary lock top of the line safe but the lock or key only has two notches in key and looks super eas6 to pick after spending 3500 on a safe I’m not digging the lock part
Well played.  Pretty funny letter and response.
It’s to hide there insecurity’s
Wait a second, seeing eye dog,skilled at picking locks, he's a lawyer??? YOU'RE DAREDEVIL
I thought the joke was going to be that there was no lock included with the letter!
Can we get  "Its never a fluke" merch?
That was super funny man props on that letter
all i seen was a floating pink tag on a chrome  u shape bar an the LockPickingLawyer hands
Unjustified paragraphs 🤢
Sora: "I've opened the door to the next world!" LPL: "That's cute."
ROFLMFAO, master lock should really consider hiring LPL and have him on their team
such an entertaining man.
that was hilarious tyvm!
Shane at stuff made here gave more of a challenge
LAF
Here I just thought they sent you a letter without a lock.
Is that a comedy letter and lock?  Based on your description, there was nothing new about the lock, much less old tricks like security pins and difficult to access key slots.
Master lock self-own
Instant glue may already provide more security... just saying..
😄😄😄
Elsewhere, John Cena's bike has gone missing...
the irony that the camo makes the keyhole easier to see
very impresive but ,can you open the key of her heart ?
I bet you can't pick my brain 🤣😂...
Another industrious innovation by Master Lock. Bravo
It is so secure that it seems you can piss on it, and it will open.
Lol man I just had to laugh. Your great
Shame on you for destroying moral at Master Lock ... You are an evil person ... Lol you are a scream ... I love your videos 👍😎
They violated the first rule of security, which is “security by obscurity is no security at all”. Thanks for the chuckle to start my day.
Mrs. LPL probably located and tagged the lock for him.
I start giggling when the wave rake comes a-jiggling
When you fail an exam and LPL turns up and hands you a second one  "let's do it again to prove it wasn't a fluke"
Someone should just invent a lock that detects "shakes," and he'd be done for.
I have a couple locks I lost the keys for and just use a rake😁
what lock?
The note is longer than the lock picking 💀💀
You make lock picking look as easy as a bethesda game,... HOW YOU DO THAT?!
Funny 😀😀😀
Why was there a floating piece of pink tape?
I wish this guy wasn’t so mean it would make him a lot more appealing
The funny thing is iv got a master lock and even with the correct key you have to jiggle it about for it to open, this leads me to think the suppled keys aren’t actually real key but key shaped wave rakes.
I had no Idea that the master lock head quarters was in my city just thought it was a warehouse to smth
It would be interesting to hear your take on what is actually difficult to pick instead of you lock-picking the same locks many many times.
I heard thst Master Lock have changed their name to Faster Lock
LOL
the way you were explaining the lock. I thought it didn't have a key but was controlled by a app like everything else this generation has forked rights over to. Welp
lockpickinglawyer passes the vibe check
Ooh that burn!
😆😆😆😆😆
why is he lock picking the air?
Cheered me up
Would of laughed harder if someone sent him the not a lock pad lock for this
2:53 "and as always..." AUGH, AS ALWAYS WHAT?!
For people who wonder , this lock is a Master Lock model 317DSPT.
Thanks for pointing to the words. I gave me less AIDS
great advert
I really hope that the letter is fake.  Because otherwise someone might be in a lot of trouble.
I think this company wants a free advertisement 😉
LPL, ur a savage XDDD
Wait LPL is blind?
Would have been extra funny if there were no lock included in the parcel.
🤣🤣🤣🤣💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I only saw a pink label move a little
Ill be honest ive only seen a few of ur videos and u make locks a joke lol, ngl kinda scary
Oh boy when the letter takes up 60% of the video
How about a patented cloaking device by toyota, literally fall over it to find...how musing. Cheers
Cheesehead lock!!! LMAO
The world of enlightenment knows NO bounds.  Or love.  *CLICK*
Maybe they need to offer you a job lol
There are no words to think the host of this channel enough using the knowledge that he's given me I've honed my thieving skills so much that I've more than quadrupled my money that I can easily make in one day.. thank you from the bottom of my heart. Do you have any tips on how I can launder the money that I have been accumulating much faster due to the skills that you've helped me obtain? I would like to start spending some of the money but I'm worried about drawing the tension of the IRS so any tips and hence that you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Forever in your debt.
This is why you need additional layers of security. Cameras, alarms, dogs, moats, and gators!
Missed opportunity to not include any lock in the box
The ultra thistle ultrasonographically glue because substance erroneously regret notwithstanding a thirsty thrill. lamentable, violent pruner
0:11 if not that totally wouldve been 4d chess
An asymmetric key design would be harder. I.E. car keys but each side has a unique tumbler set.
Me: oh cool, maybe this time hes gonna find it hard t-  *the videos 3 mins long.*
They need to send him a job invite to there r and d team
It took him more time to read the letter than to actually pick the lock
I love it...
What did you do? I didn't see any lock but just a pink tape.
Bad publicity is good publicity
It took him longer to read the letter then to pick the lock 2 times.    Hope it took in longer to find the lock should of spay paint it in flat black do to the fact most theft is at night. The only thing that camo is hiding is the fact it’s going to hold water in the inside of it 🤣😂🤣
LUL
Haha
I thought they were going to tell you pick the lock to the Oval Office or something.
Apparently we are starting a new tradition here. February Fools Day.
I expected there to be no lock at all, because it's camouflaged 😂
"This guy" is HOW high in the chain and can't correctly use ITS? Lol, try again, buddy!
This is Master Lock mock.
Is this real or a troll?
They know they’re locks aren’t special… this was simply a free ad for their new “camo” locks. There you go hunters, you can get camp locks to match the rest of your camp gear.
LPL: Oh? You’re approaching me? Instead of running away, you’re coming right to me?  Masterlock: I can’t beat the shit out of you without getting closer.  LPL: Oh ho! Then come as close as you like.
Ow no not the wave rake
Lol we who even doesn't live in the US consider master lock a joke, just from watching videos. and we don't even have those locks in our country lol
So, am i saying this right? this guy can lock pick anything... Why is it so easy to do :')
The time spent reading the letter counts - Master Lock did better than average!
at first i thought the joke was gonna be the camo means no lock was send only a letter so you cant see it
I'm new to lockpicking. I bought a practice set of three locks, picked them, then went to my Master Lock for what I thought would be a challenge but it was like 100x easier than the practice locks lol
When it said cement in the letter, I really thought it was gunna be a cement block with something inside
Looks sus.
Oh snap - another swarmin' hornet????  Moved here a few years ago in the "country" part - love it!
Didn’t come from us brother must have been real
It took you longer to read the note than it did to pick the lock
Come on Master Lock! There's no apostrophe in the possessive "its"! Please fire the employee who drafted this letter.
Impressive, but what can you do on a Master Level enchanted lock? This would be the true test, LPL
A lot of quality was packed into that 2 minutes and 54 seconds
Oh sure, get our hopes up that they finally are taking you seriously...
Ha....that's awesome
I was lowkey expecting there to just be nothing included in the package but the letter and that would be the only way there could be a lock that the LPL couldn’t pick, is if it was imaginary.
The only goal was to increase the average LPL video length for Master Lock locks.
Just shows how smart Shane from stuffmadehere is, that his lock was better than whatever Master lock could come up with..
Imagine if they only sent the letter.
this was actually the most entertaining video i’ve watched all week if not all day
I gotta say your views: subscriber ratio is pretty on point. I don’t think I’ve ever seen quite as many views per subscriber count in such a quick time. It's like most of your subscribers immediately watch your videos.
I don't understand, where is the lock? Why is pink tape floating in the air?
So, you bite your nails I guess
LPL's dog carried the team on this one..
Not much of a challenge for a master of this craft
Never a good sign when he only needs a wave rake
Being honest, i thought they would just the letter and the "lock" was imaginary
That letter was great 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
He should've sent a lock that is impossible to pick, like one that is welded / disabled. Now THAT would be comedy.   I'm sorry but who prints out a letter posing as Master Lock and sends a walmart $5 lock.  I mean  HAHHAHAA HAA HA    OHH HHA HA ha hooo hoo haa. no.
Maybe they should hire this guy to help them make better locks !
it would’ve been funnier if they only included the packaging without a lock
What a stupid joke from Master Lock? They should said most of their locks still strong and good enough for general security protection. No locks can't pick is true.
is there any lock you cant break open?
Master lock is a joke
I feel like this video is minutes away from a defamation suit.
I can't see the lock, dunno what LPL found and picked, this cammo is effective
Took more time to read the letter then opening the locker 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤭👍👍👍
Assuming your PO Box is anywhere near you, you and I are not far from each other.  Not stalking, just thought it was cool.
Groovy.
Hilarious
I was expecting a lock with a John Cena decal, I'm disappointed
I legitimately thought the joke would be that there is no lock because it's so well camouflaged
No Masterlock could survive this preposterous amount of jiggling!
hella fake.... letter
I've watched three times but I can't see it, just some green tape
I’ve been saying locks only keep the honest people honest and I keep getting proven right.
Added a camouflaged coating so you cant find the lock LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wish I could enjoy this video but honestly I couldn't see what LPL was doing, just waving his tools in the air and then proclaimed victory.
actually the real lock is still hidden, this one is obviously a decoy
Took longer to read the note then open the lock
HA
"Low skill raking attack" lmao.
I never saw a lock...
hahahahaha
I would like you to design the lock for them.
Good work from the comedy team in their PR department
When it said 'cement our reputation' I thought the lock was going to be filled with cement.
Master lock might as well commission you to design them a lock..
Plot twist: LPL is the president of Master Lock.
Are we straight up mimicking Grand Theft Auto by destroying a company's reputation to buy their Stock It Low?
Jokes on you, master locks employees are all in Mexico and China since 1993 they can't understand your videos to have their moral hurt. Checkmate lockpickinglawyer checkmate.   * Nothing against Chinese or Mexican factory workers or engineers they are working with the designs and specifications MasterLock gives them.
It's been long known that master locks are easy to pick. This is funny.
I see the pink tape and the shackle, but where is the lock? :)
Flukes be like:  O_O am i a joke to you
lmfaoooo
Master lock has a good sense of humor. Lol
What!? I couldn't even see the lock he was picking! It was like it was invisible!
They didn’t do anything different
Not since the letter from Harvey Rowe to the guy digging up doll-head fossils in his backyard has there been such a brilliant fake letter.
Is there even a lock he struggled with?
How will Master lock ever recover from this loss
Must be part of the John Cena collection of locks you can't see.
How is master lock not bankrupt from being sued? Because i dont believe for one second that they are that clueless as to the flaws and weaknesses inherent to their products. But i do think they are greedy, lazy, and banking on peoples stupidity in order to take their money and get away with it. Like the real crooks. And they do. How sickeningly ironic
Hahahahah
those guys should not feel bad bcuz picking a lock is 1000x easier than designing a secure one
These use to be interesting, now their just commercials so you can hock your products.
You SELL tools for thieves?
Damage is done! 😂
Your skill with this challenge lock was almost as impressive as your ability to find the cunningly disguised and camouflaged thing in the first place.
The reason he could identify this was a joke, is because they wrote "as and a consequence" instead of "and as a consequence"
They forgot to camouflage the top of the lock, it's a clear silver lmao
Very funny!
No regular user would send 1st class mail
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Would have been a solid 10/10 joke if they didn’t include a lock whatsoever, then claimed that it was included and he couldn’t find it because it was so well-camouflaged. Can’t pick a lock to embarrass your company if you don’t include one lol
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Hahahahahahahahahaha Hahahahahahahahahaha
This is our toughest lock with a generous….  *opens lock*  … budget
Huh
That was amazing. All I have to say.
Lol, even I know disaster locks are the worst.
If only a sizable budget was used for the rest of the master lock, locks 😏
"You can't see me, so you can't pick me."  John Cena
The best lock is better prisons.
Does this mean ML just fired all of its Chinese engineers?
LPL has become master locks supervillain
This mans speaks the same way as NileRed, same flow same cadence
I feel sick. HOW COULD THEY DO THIS
camo joke really gets me everytime..wtf
For a moment, I really thought Masterlock sent the formal letter to LPL lol
Lmfao camo pins lol
Ha
Me: not the rake, not the rake LPL: gets the rake Me: BOOOOOUM!
How are they allowed to call themself "Master" "Lock"?
this letter had a little bit of jumbled up words 'and as a' was in the wrong sequence - probably to make sure that everyone is in on the joke and doesn't think this came from masterlock themselves
locks should have pins on both top and bottom of the lock
HAHHAAHAHAH
My father said it years ago, “locks only keep honest people honest” it’s obvious they don’t Prevent theft by professionals or semi professionals
You should be sent to prison for having burglary school on YouTube.
masterlock has to be one of the biggest jokes of a company in the world, they literally sell the appearance of security and not actual security
Hope they invite you to the head office for a chat like NewEgg did for thar tech YouTuber!
How long did you take to find it? Did it add enough time to set a record?
My first thought was that no lock was included.
LPL you live in my town!!! i saw the P.o. box and i was shocked!
We would love you share with us their followup
Someone is definitely getting fired or has been fired and the company took a jab at him for this creation.
I couldn’t see the lock how did you find it haha
Can I get your tools in the UK?
🤣🤣🤣
Incredible
im to lazy to look im sure he has but fk would he be abill to design one hell of a good lock. like design it break it patch and repeat till you have some frankin monster thats near unbreakable.
How does he get the shackle to just hover like that?
They really need to invest time in inventing new locks.
LOL
I'm going to design a lock with a tazer inside. If you use the correct key, you're safe. I'll make sure the key is shaped unique so it's not confused for house/car/file cabinet keys. But if you stick anything in that lock that reaches places the right shaped key would not get to. Well you're going to need both a lawyer and a hospital.
I have a question, how did you make parts of your pick tools disappear and float in the air?
The problem with locks is no matter how secure they are made to be, they’ll always need to make it possible for the key to open them.
Thanks. Been wanting to go after John Cena for awhile!
Why is LPL waving lockpicks in the air?
LOL
i dont understand, he just waved tools around in the air, where was the lock he was picking?
I think you should pick a lock at least 10 consecutive times in a video, this way you might reach the 3 minutes mark...
Ok wait so does using lock picks on locks actuslly damage the lock? Can it?
LUL
I thought the joke would be that he didn't include a lock, so the camouflage is so good, LPL couldn't find it haha
what!!! "Low Skill Raking Attack"??? Geez, you don't care bout your viewers moral, do you???? haha
Master lock changing to mastered lock.
The “president of MasterLock” knew he fucked up as soon as he saw LPL reading the small font of the letter 😂
I got an ad about the “biometric gun safe” he absolutely embarrassed previously
why is this u shape metal floating in his hand?!
Dear master lock. Shoot me an email and I’ll design you a lock that can’t be picked traditionally
PWND
What’s worse than an attorney..... one who picks locks with such brazenness.... let me guess... you are short
It would be an embarrassment if it were real considering the video was only 3 minutes long and just over half of that was spend reading the note.
Chino, CA 🤣🤣🤣
That moment when you realize that LPL has developed echolocation skills to see the lock.
What lock???
Wait. There was a lock in the video? I could only see a flying piece of pink tape and the paper
Did he just leak his address
Just wait until the patent is done on my new lock that can only be opened by closing it.
Master Lock, replace your engineers...
I would just send a lock that’s been cncd from a block of aluminum just made to look like a lock
How to delay a thief:  Make a door with 20 locks along its edge. Lock only one or two.
What lock? He's lockpicking the air!
Great letter!
Lpl took more time for reading a letter than picking a lock 😂
They should have super glued it closed
The only thing missing is a John Cena face on the lock
HAHAHAHAHA!
i saw the same speed and gesture in a certain video in a certain website for adult content. but the tools were 2 finger in another type of hole. Great mastery here sir. congratz
I have a storage bay with a master lock, the lock isn't there to stop anyone breaking in, it is there to stop people from accidentally opening my bay instead of their own
Brilliant
Bet you can't do it without the pink tape -masterlock 😂😂😂😂
Who ever played this prank did a great job.. well done and research.. master lock headquarters is in oak well Wisconsin.. good stuff..
Lol props to whomever wrote/sent the letter, cuz its really funny! Thanks for the video
An obvious fake letter.  The language shows it is NOT from any executive in a major company.  "...can't find the lock"  Really?    Oh, I see that lock is sold at the local Gun Store.  Guess the lock is not an "industry-leading innovation".
The way the lock picking master could be my neighbor 😭😭
lol
I hope that this was just a camo joke from master lock.
Have you ever been to or invited to a penetration party?
You know its pathetic when you can pick it faster than you count to ten
They literally gave them a budget and they took the money and spent nothing in actually making a workable new lock
i was really hoping the lock would be a piece of wood with a latch.
Master Lock should start selling letters cause those take longer to read than to unlock the locks
They should have sent no lock
The clickbait lawyer
I guess, What's the point of having an invisible lock🤔
Little did you know. The impersonator was sued for 50 million dollars in fraud charges
I thought they were about to straight up not send the lock lmao
Would have been funny if they didn't actually provide the lock and just claimed it was 'camouflaged'. Either way, this was pretty fun. I hope it inspires people to send LPL similar things. I'm honestly amazed at the fact that over such a simple/niche thing, a channel can maintain such an active community. I've seen far more "interesting" channels die, so I guess sometimes simple really is best.
Wait you live in damascus md??? So do I what the heck!!!
...and I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids...
Master Lock should feel ashamed. Not only did they send a terrible challenge, they're based in California!
*spends over half the video reading a letter out loud*  Well this lock is sweating its ass off
Master Lock:You can’t defeat me I took advantage of you weakness  LPL: done
master lock we put john cena's DNA in the lock. you can't open what you don't see.   i admit he looked pretty stupid waving around in the air
Is it bad that I know the exact time it takes lpl to rake open a master lock and was able to say click the instant he opened it each time
I love how you read that with your finger haha!
an effective lock, if he had been told he wouldve never searched for it or found it.
LPL: “Omiwae-mo”  ML: “Nani?!?” LPL: “Mo Shinderu!!!!!”
Damn near spit out my drink how fast that was
I don’t get it, it’s just a shackle with pink tape. Where’s the lock?
I always laugh seeing padlocks picked. They aren’t made to be super secure, just a deterrent. If someone really wants to get in they can just cut it in seconds. I think that’s what this joke is getting at, maybe hide the lock as well to make it harder to find to cut.
My first thought was to check the date this video was uploaded. After finding out it was not uploaded on the 1st of April I was very very confused. Then I just bursted out laughing so damn hard 🤣
Locks have to be bypassed in case you lose the key. All this channel does is increase the crime rate
The one thing I love about you man, is that you spend 3/4 of the video taking the challenge and only 1/4 actually completing it . Marvelous
LPL literally shutting people down. Unreal.
....i still didn't see the lock...
LMAO!!!!
Emotional Damage
So what was the challenge? I didn't get that.
Who sends letters these days?
What lock was he talking about guys i can't see any lock
Dear LPL,  please do something to support the Ukrainian people who are now in hiding. Morally very sickening, say that you are with us)
Ultimate LPL troll: A fake lock that doesn't actually open.  XD
Ha I live in Chino Hills, CA. Right next door to the Impersonator.. Nice!!!👍👌🏼
Chinese junk lol! LPL rocks!
So, from this, I have discerned that it is safer to wrap my house on camoflauge tape than use a Masterlock lock.
Nice spoof letter from a fan, but probably not too far from the truth the guys at Masterlock must be thinking daily. I think it'd be a safe bet they have dart board with his pic on it in the breakroom to help take out what must be their constant frustration of failures!!!!🤣
Is there any lock you were not able to pick?
Huh so this is why the locks at my school always get broken open
Wait master lock the one that got solved in two seconds by most people I really hope this is official even though it isn’t
Reading a letter is longer than lockpicking
He didn't even pick anything in this video smh
lmfao i love this channel
Lol
I don't see the point of camo on a Master Lock.  It's already disguised as a lock.
The problem with this lock is, although it’s nearly invisible to LPL, it’s an easy pick to anyone who hasn’t got their vision impaired
That was awesome you made my wife laugh…. That doesn’t happen very often.
Phone the number lol
90 seconds to read the letter and 4 seconds to pick the lock.
I went to high school with the presidents son near oak creek Wisconsin. We hung out a few times. His house was huge , and they had locks everywhere.
Master Lock should have put a sock over the lock, so when LPL went to pick up all he got was sock
Thats my city!!!!!
Click bait title
There employees moral is already at an all time low they manufacture in China
The actual company is equally as funny
Masterlock on suicide watch now lol.
Props to master lock 😂 That camouflage joke was hilarious The same lock but invisible. I almost missed it if it didn't have the pink tape.
Some lock company: disses LPL LPL: nice opinion, one small problem, your locks suck.
Anybody else expect the lock to be welded shut?
Clever way for advertising 🤣
stop biting your finger nails
whoever sent this in should have literally cemented the inside of the lock so that the internals couldn't even move.
Master Lock: Challenge from the companies president himself LPL: Im about to end this mans whole career
I'd love to see what u wb to them lol ,they made a fool out of them self ,
A small claw hammer opens all master locks 🤣
"it's"
What did u open? I didn’t see anything
Master lock emplyies watching this video: LPL: As you can see this low skill raping attack... Master lock emplyies: *Leaves company
You from Damascus?
Those engineers are getting fired....
so i was thinking,  what if a lock was made in such  way that only a key made out of a magnetic material could turn the lock? or if there was a hidden in plain sight thing on the lock youd need to slide or turn thats magnetic that would allow a regular key to function.
You should have pretended to pick an invisible lock. Would have been hilarious
A generous budget of 6 dollars 50 cents
Where is the lock?? Maybe I should watch twice….  Thank you to the person in CA for taking the time. Super funny.
As he read the letter I honestly thought the only way any lock could be pickproof would be if it didn't have a keyhole in the first place 🤣
the video title scared me for a second
putting locks out of business Lmao
A fluke on Masterlock? That'd be if you accidentally couldn't open it...
i really don't think a lock can be designed that LPL can't pick.🤔   good thing he's a good guy!😃
F in the chat for Master Lock's finest engineers.
"It took a while for my seeing eye dog to locate the lock" :D
Employees at master lock are killing themselves
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was hilarious! Haha what lock, I don’t see no lock.
is this real?
I've never seen someone pick the lock on a small piece of pink tape, TWICE, in 30 seconds, quite like the LPL can.
First time I laughed at corporate meme
I almost died laughing when he attempted to pick the air with a rake  honestly it almost felt like there was a lock there for a second 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Years of developing skill : push the pin in and wiggle it 😂😂😂
Half of the video is reading the letter instead of picking the lock :D
Free ad for them.
It is never a fluke
I love that he starts actually picking this lock 2/3's of the way into this almost 3 minute video.  Then he proceeds to open the lock twice in 25 seconds while being "slowed down" because he's talking about it and doing it all on camera.  I have to think that if he was actually trying he could have probably opened it in about 3 seconds, and that might be an over estimate.
And if you look close enough you can actually see the disappointment
-We heard your vision isn't what it used to be. So we camouflaged the lock. Lmfao -Shout out to my seeing eye dog.  -Yea the camouflage was too good so I put pink tape on my hunting lock so I could find it later.   I love this video.
LPL I knew you were local to me. Just not that local! Cheers 🍻
I'd say when ever LPL pulls out the Wave Rake it's probably the highest level of disrespect possible 😂😂😂
I'm sorry but where is the lock he's picking? All i see is him just shaking his hands and tools on the air
1:57, what are you picking? I don’t see anything
Master Lock: where every day is April Fool's designing top class locks
Your bloody good at what you do mate.
*reads title* Me: Uh huh- *Looks at video length* Me:ah expected
That's hilarious, that would make a great April fools joke "Hey, you keep beating our puzzles because your too smart, not fair! So we're gonna not fix anything, just make things slightly inconvenient for 5 more seconds"  If a robber was breaking into this and shown a flashlight on the lock, wouldn't the camo suddenly reflect different then the metal, immediately foiling the gimmick?
They should be honored. This video lasted longer than most videos.
Anyone else think there wouldn’t be a lock included?
oh shit it's barely 3 minutes
Wait this guy is blind?
Haha, funny. I'll tell you a story about Master Lock and their "dedication to security". I contacted them with a lock design that is miles ahead of anything they currently do. They said that any ideas/inventions that come from outside of their company are subject to them taking 100% ownership of them, and the inventor getting zero. This attitude has never been repeated in my dealings with many, many other lock companies, they are unique in this aspect.  That tells you everything you need to know, they'd rather have their engineers design a piece of turd, over taking anything better from outside, because of $$. I understand that they're a company, and profit is what that is all about, but it's not all or nothing.
As my father always says: a lock just keeps an honest man honest.
Video ended so soon after taking out the wave rake that it might as well have ended there :D
You know there's a bunch of engineers at master lock who hate LPL. They are lurking in here somewhere...
That was just too cool :)
That is the most condescending, passive aggressive, "Pls stop, fefes hurt" letter I've seen a company send to someone. That was fucking hilarious.  EDIT: Oh. It was a joke sent in by a fan. Still, fucking hilarious joke, mate. Loved it!
A master key opens all locks, but a master lock opens to all keys
Tomorrow they will send you a letter offering you a job worth millions of dollars a year, as long as you don't massacre them :)
3 seconds! So far for the generous budget, time all this took to develop and write such a stupid letter… well Mister Youn, if this is your perception of management, you might be thinking about retiring soon?
I couldn't see what you were working with, but it sounded secure.
McNally official still waiting for a challenge
For “think outside the box” i was expecting something else
😂😂😂
The moment I busted out laughing a little was at 1:55 lol. This is too funny.
Master lock...... this is even more embarrassing.... didn't you hire a lock picker to test and see if your locks are pick resistant before shipping?
I thought this was gonna be a "Try not opening this on the first wiggle try" challenge or smth
Lol since when did breaking a lock count as picking it?
Lol since when did breaking a lock count as picking it?
Fake
Imagine if Master Lock sends him a letter "yo, that was real. Not a fan making a joke. Why you gotta be so mean?"
By seeing the video is only 3 minutes long I was sure, ok this is going to be short and quick one! Wasnt disappointed.
i still dont see any lock, can anyone else see it?
That is one expensive camoflage then.....
Master Lock doesn't care how fast you pick their locks. They are cheaply made, and when they make a profit they are happy.
I got some lock picking tools the other day its really easy to pick a standard padlock like this
Thanks for the laughs and have a nice day!
Ayy shoutout to my neighboring town of Chino!
wow i wouldn't even notice the lock if there wasn't a pink tape.
They set everything on the camo - Card in hopes you cant find it
The improvement to the lock is you can't see it because it's camouflaged - the letter is an added delay ~
Always the wave rake
1:40 all I have to say is 🤣
🤣
So what lock is best that is similar in size t I that masterlock
I have that exact lock! I can use a half diamond and just jam it in their once and pop it instantly!
Admit it, you wrote that letter yourself as an excuse to make a video on the camo lock and plug your website 🤔
Is this a joke?
That's some good camouflage.  For about 2 seconds, I thought it was a lock. :)
Wait where was the lock?
Why don't you design us a lock? You are the master at picking lock. Lock that you design should be the best.
I'm so disappointed they're still ignoring my work and not providing the "good" locks to everyone. Don't let them fool you L.P.L they can't keep rebuying the patent I gave them years ago. Honestly I'm mad
ill give you if official maby a secret my fishing box ok  may be
Haha, I got a good giggle out of this.... lol  Thanks for that!!
Holy Crap, Damascus, MD.  I used to work behind Weis.  I grew up in Ijamsville.
If you're going to send a fake letter claiming to be a company spell out  LockPickingLawyer. Not LPL.
cool channel, great delivery.
There isn’t any lock out there that the Lock Picking Layer can’t make a took to picked open, he the king 🤴 of lock picking period.
Dear LPL,    Your videos have been informative as well as greatly entertaining. Some years ago, in my late teens, I took it upon myself, with my best friend, to fashion picks from windshield wiper blades and some other junk.     While hanging out, usually watching a dvd or tending bar, we would take turns picking extra dead bolt locks we had access to. Always mostly blind, we would look just enough to place our “tensioner,” then feel for the pins.    I noticed you called it a turner, the library book that got me into this, initially referred to this as a “tensioner.”    I am wondering now which is the correct term?    But in either case you videos have be a great source of nostalgia as myself and my friend Paul were the only ones (among the people we knew back then) who could pick a lock with relative ease.    Saved many a neighbor, friend’s mom or “pretty girl in distress” who having locked themselves out were saved the ridiculous bill of an “all night rapist locksmith.”    Your skill makes mine look feeble in comparison but it has been a very useful. Best, R. C. Christian
this satisfied me.
If only those thieves who grinded my master lock off my container doors knew
I saw the purple tape, I didn’t see any lock. So confusing.
FWIW, that's Master Lock's address, on the south side of Milwaukee.
Hehehehe
Would a been funny if they didn’t send a lock with the note
I am always watching Wrestling Video and i thought this Video was about Chris Master Master Lock Challange 😂😂😂😂
Well done
As a famous lawyer once said, and often repeated it: The biggest Truths often begin with a majority of one. The CEO letter is hilarious - a testament to the power of one man speaking the truth against all odds and Goliath corporations
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wonder what kind of health insurance policy he has on his hands. Permanent injury resulting in a 3 million dollar payout or some shit
That pink tape would have been more useful if you'd used it to secure the shed/bicycle/ladders/gate, compared to the padlock.
The master 3 opens as soon as you penetrate it with a fucking pine needle
I love that the header is "The Office Of the President". lol Good job whoever sent that!
double fluke, rake it again
I don't get it, what were you doing with all those weird hand gestures?
Poor poor Master Lock. It appears your lock is extremely easy to pick. Good luck next time I guess lmao
That's bloody hilarious.  Well played, whoever sent that in.
"Made in china.."
This man’s videos should be illegal
Hilarious.
Either a fan or a genius way for master lock to get free advertising
the pink tape 😂
I love how he embraced and added to the joke himself XD
They have to be trolling 😂
This site is weird.  I mean, is this dude actually a lawyer?  Is he showing crims how to pick locks so that the rest of us have a more difficult time protecting our stuff?  Just weird.
1st of April in February
When the sales pitch on the tools takes longer than the lock
I was going to go sleep, but i saw the title and knew it was going to be short and sweet one. Thanks for the great content, as always. Now it's off to bed for me.
Stop biting your fingernails. It is a sign of OCD And clears up a lot of questions I had about why a lawyer would be picking locks.
This has to be a joke written by someone else…right?
They should have just sent an empty box. What were they thinking?
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ LMFAO 90% Of these comments don't realize this is a *JOKE....*
Imma do what’s called a pro gamer move here: Can’t pick lock if there is no lock.
I bet the package that lock and letter come in were harder to open than the lock itself  😂
LPL: I put a piece of pink tape on it so I don't lose it in the future  ML: wait that's illegal
I guess master lock is going out of business. Can't keep our stuff safe anymore.
1:41 and he just picks the lock of a 2:54 video, oh this is gonna be good
Where is the lock though?
Lol, the guys who worked on that project just lost their jobs 🤣, jk.  They must be extra hurt though 💀
I guess you are realizing they are joking on you and they don't even care.. They are talking about camouflaging and they mean just the cap the hides the key hole... :)
Where is the lock? He said he picked it, yet never showed him doing so
this was the sadest use of the word "Master" ive seen in a while...
This wasn’t a challenge, as clearly shown in the video you just held a shackle giggled some tools around and moved the shackle. Stay woke folks 😂
It would've been so much better if they had just send the letter :)
No new locks, sends himself a camo lock and blames a fan just to give content. He may not be the lawyer we want,  or the hero we need. But he is the grifter we deserve.
Did you just pick a u shaped metal bar?
Clickbait
I heard a saying once, locks keep honest people out
Next week: lpl picks a solid cube of steel containing no locking mechanism at all.
It's called a grenade buddy, resign from your job....
LMAO🤣
It’s funny how that person was thinking you couldn’t open that lock!.. 😂🤣😂🤣😂. Or it was just a joke!
Good stuff
Alls I see is pink tape.  WTF….
They should have put a lock on the weather cover of this lock.
What’s the point of camouflaged lock?
I thought sure they'd sent the letter in a otherwise empty box, thereby proving that LPL could not see the lock...
LOL i thought for a second they were claiming they sent you an invisible lock :)  As I have learned from you. The only lock that cannot be picked simply is one that does not exist.
Kudos to the writer of the letter. good job! :-)
All the *effort* was definitely put into the camouflage.
I think you got punked.
lol...😅
You just have to wonder what they really think at Master Lock headquarters.  I bet LPL is a very taboo thing..
Definitely a fake letter but that was pretty obvious.
i just watched "Planet of the Dead" on netflix in it there is a super safe that is legendary for its difficulty at being picked and some safe crackers covet it as such. do you know of real life examples as this safe?
That one was the decoy covered in peanut butter, you still have not found the true lock.
Pure goat🔥
Master Locks marketing department must be literaly on fire right now 😅🤣
Lmao. That was a pretty good joke.
Hahahah does it twice lol
LMAO
MasterLock should have called this lock the G-spot. Men could fumble around all day and never find it!
Is your Dog also invisible?
Putting camouflage on your lock implies that most people do not pick locks to steal an item they secure, but instead they compulsively pick locks on sight, and do not care about what they are attached to
Chino California? Putting us on the map
Considering YT keeps dropping shorts for some guy who speed cracks ML padlocks (can't stand him, he's obnoxious, LPL all the way) I can't tell wether this "challenge" is a troll or someone trying to do guerilla marketing
It appears the joker spent more time on the letterhead than the company did on innovating the lock.
The silicon cover is there to also provide an additional layer of pick resistance.  It's a lot harder to get picking tools inside the keyway with the cover in place.  I'm kind of surprised that Masterlock hasn't tried to market this as such.
*its   Sorry.
I do want to know and see some locks that LPL really had difficulty opening up. if there is such a lock that LPL had to spend a long time on opening.
What a Slap in the face to the CEO Of Master Lock!
can already imagine an employee of masterlock sitting at his desk looking at his computer getting a pop-up from LPL reading the title out loud to his colleges **fuckkk**
You know it’s bad when he pulls out a wave rake
Hey! I grew up in Damascus MD... tiny little town.
Give LPL a retina scan lock.
Brutal
Hmm. You sure it's not Jerry rig?
Someone sends a challenge Me: Sees the video is under 3 minutes *Hehehehehe*
You sir, have been trolled lol
🤣🤣🤣
Amateur. Shouldve just packed no lock and claimed success.
I like the chanel but i have to say that lpl is cheating a bit to show off his skills . It's obvious that he trains before and checks out what works best . He should not prepare the right tool and try different things so we can really see how long it takes to open it .... I'm sure he can do it quick but it's a bit boring always set up ... Also has to much informations about the mechanisms inside wich normal people won't have ( it's for example a bit silly that he says safe boxes are easy to open because thiefs are stupid and don't have these Infos  or they wouldn't be thief's and have a proper job like lock smith  ). I sell security systems and i always tell my clients that " if someone really wants to get in somewhere there is always a way , and i can't stop people i only might be able to slow them down so much that the police arrives before they get in " ... Most effective protection is a camera dummy and a alarm sticker at the door because intruders are not willing to gamble that it might be fake and skip your door and break in the neighbors house instead
I still can't find the lock... how possibly you could pick the invisible lock. amazing.
hahah
next time instead of hiding the lock don't send it at all, so you can be sure he can't pick it
It’s never a fluke
Funny guy. Lol.
Would've been a much better joke if the lock just wasn't there
Its * weakest link
The joke would almost make sense if the bolt wasn't steel
Damn, LPL. I was hoping for there to be a challenge. However, once I heard the bit about camo. It was pretty clear that it's wasn't going to be difficult. Lol the letter was funny. And I would defiantly have to agree with you that it was, a form of comical relief, a brief but of humor, and also that it must certainly not from, David S. Youn. Thanks for another great video, and the well executed content.
Huh ... They really did it, they make LPL have to make a long video, what a Chad
Would have been alot funnier of they didnt actually include the lock with the letter.
I never saw the lock.  Did anyone else see it?
Don't knock the effectiveness of camouflage. A former colleague who joined the TA (UK equivalent of the National Guard) bought himself a Parker Jotter ballpoint pen with the camo pattern plastic barrel (still had the nice and shiny chrome top and clip). Out on weekend manoeuvres he put it down on the grass and then couldn't find it again! We wondered if somebody might not have simply stolen it . . . . . .
Whoever sent that letter is kicking themselves on account of their "as and" typo.
Just your average Master Lock video from LPL: There's a joke and we all came out laughing in the end
Shouldve wrapped it in a picture of John Cena
LOL
Or you could just take a hammer and hit the top of the lock a few times and it will open
MasterLock is punching air right now
When they said "cement" i figured they had sent a lock that had been cemented in and couldnt open.
Which legend did this 😂
Free ads for Master Lock
I’m sorry, can you do that again. I did not see the lock. It just looks like you were waving a lock picking mid air.
Ah yes, the lowest common denominator- security through obscurity.
Did anybody else expect actual cement in the lock?
I couldn't hold it in when he pulled out the wave rake.
This bruh got level 100 and all the perks in lockpicking
"I hate to further damage morale at masterlock." I love this guy.
what lock? I can't see it...
You know the lock meh when LPL is reading a letter for 2/3 of the video
If you sell something as a lock it should be at the very least be able to resist this technique
They could've just sent him an empty box and say there is something, if you can't see it it's because it's hidden so well
After playing Dying light for 8 hours. I can also pick every Very Hard Chest with lockpock. But you are doing this IRL. Lol beast.
Downvoted for pretending to pick a lock when there clearly wasn't one
I don't get it. I didn't see any lock in the video...
Why is he wobling that thing in the air? I can't see any lock there , am I missing something ?
Joe
*emotional damage*
Ouch, there are some layoffs at Master Lock this week, go figure.. :(
Why am I glad that these videos have "been devastating to the morale of employees" at Masterlock?
That was the first lock I ever picked lol.
i love these vids....keep them coming LPL.......we all need to laugh more these days...
Imagine he made the letter and picked a random lock just to advertise the lock picking set. He's not just picking locks, he's picking our brains and wallets. *insert law and order music*
Locks are just a simple deterrent - morale of the story if someone wants it they gotta put the effort, which vast majority of thieves won’t go over the top.
Ez.
You pulling out the wave rake already made me realise the high security of the lock.
the letter is real 2
Would be nice to see an actual challenge from a lock producer. Have none of them ever contacted you in that regard?
To paraphrase Elon Musk the best part is no part. Therefore the best MasterLock is no lock. No lock will result is less being stolen*  *any lock that can be opened this easily will also be stolen, since the thieves already have a rake to open it and don't need keys
this mean slap it own face(master lock)?
A let go débarre tout mon homme comme sa les flots vont continué a débarré les garage pour nous volé!! Désolé pour premier message mon celle a bugué..lol
Trumafieucisme!! Continue 🤣🤣🤧🤥🤫🤑🤑🤑🤓😇
What if what he picked was just a decoy and the real lock was never found?
May be they should of upped their budget
Ultimate play would have been to put no lock in the box.
ES IST GRATIS WERBUNG FÜR MASTER LOCK..Die machen sicher eine Camouflage Serie..wie man sieht..und wiso viel Geld für ein Schloss ausgeben.  Das man dann eh nicht Produziert ^^ wenn es zu teuer in der Produktion wäre.
I cant believe they only camouflaged the casing lmao another great oversight from Masterlock
It would have been even funnier if they didn't include a lock in the package.
Oh god the pink tag killed me
Made me smile! Do like that you pick twice with a rake, prove it wasn't just luck.
*Masterlock's Engineers watching this video* Engineer: FUCK! We forgot about the waverake!!!! Fuck!
Rofl
I dont even know how i found this channel and why im watching some guy opening a locks... but I enjoy it! :P
Locks can be shaken open “Yeah, this is quality lock”
I'm working on a lock right now that you will not be able to pick. Now where did i put that bottle of gorilla glue. Bawahaha
Im glad you put the pink thing there, I almost didnt see it
$$$$$
You know your lock is bad when LPL decides to use a rake.
I'm kind of surprised he didn't use the letter to pick it
Her: Be gentle, it's my 1st time. Him: 2:02
🤣
Reading the letter took longer  than picking the lock
Thought this was from Chris Masters
I don't understand what happened on the video. Why is he holding a pink ribbon on his hand while he shakes the racking tool?
He could of spent hours picking this and then when he figured it out decided to film it.......who knows.......who fucking cares........
Would be nice to see a video about your toughest challenges. Are there locks that are tough for you? And ones that you cant pick.
funny letter
I’ve picklocked master locks in seconds with paperclips. Now to be fair I’ve picked some other locks with paper clips too, but none were as easy as the master lock. It’s like if you’ve picked before you know how to feel for the pins, and press one at a time to see the reaction from the pin but with master lock you just feel what side they’re on and push them all and it pops open. It’s simply a deterrent, not a lock.
This is amazing
🤣
What if its just welded shut
Master locks thought process: Step 1: How do we make locks better? Step 2: think outside the box. Step 3: Don't make locks better. Step 4: BOOM! New product.
I love it, ( LMAO )
Since lock picking tools have a certain length, wouldn't an effective alternative be a larger lock? So long as the lock itself is hard to break, then your only option would be to have the key or invent a new pick for the lock. Hiding the lock mechanism would also work wonders, though I sorta understand that lock-pickers would simply buy the lock, break it apart, then see what's inside... wait... break it apart? What if... it was simply too hard to break apart? Then hide the mechanism that makes the lock work and make it too deep for current lock-picking tools to reach. That way, the only way to counter it is to buy it yourself and try to invent tools to pick it or get your hands on some internal docs about how it's made and/or how the key works. I guess that's kinda... a lot of work. Probably not worth the effort unless your lock is protecting a bank vault or something.
How can you pick that what you cannot see?...
HAHAHAh
dude you really kill their morale..
I'm just flabergasted that he fiddle with his tool in the air and claim that he unlock something...  And how does he did to make that pink piece of tape float in the air??
Yeah thats actually pretty amusing.
Amazing skills and presentation :)
It's just sad how many locks can be defeated with two simple tools that you can improvise fairly easily.
All I saw was your hands juggling around and pick tape. What lock?
If LPL hasn't designed and developed a lock by now I'm going to be disappointed.  "Here are all the common tricks and some of the not so common ones I use, here's a lock that ignores all of them."
Why was he just jiggling picks around
I wonder how good a lock with 8 pins would handle 4 top 4 bottom. Maybe a security pin or 2
I'm a Master Lock employee and I can guarantee you that is a fake letter. And we know how secure our locks are. If you need more security, buy a more secure lock. Cheap locks aren't meant to protect your diamond collection.
What exactly was camouflaged?
What I was wondered was why not make a lock with a keychip inside where you’ll need a chip nearby it to unlock the mechanism where you put your key so that way lock-picking it impossible. Kinda like how the cars nowadays have the smart key that is programmed into the ignition so wiring it up is impossible, same case here with the lock. 🧐
Stuff made here - ima geek and i made a lock thanks to pathreon support, it works and it proven to be secure and even LPL had non-so confy times with it Master lock - we hawe shit ton of cash and we funded insane lock, we sendet it to LPL and now someone will get fired
They should have just not put anything else in the box. Good luck finding the lock lol
Turns out it actually was from Master Lock and now they’re ripping their hair out
I literally thought it was going to be an invisible lock a.k.a they just didn't send you a lock but claimed they sent one with camouflage and so it was impossible to see, and then you actually pulled out a lock and I didn't know whether to feel smart or really stupid lmfao
Bro at first I thought it was like a cease and desist order and this was where the lawyer side of lpl comes in
Nice joke, how did you keep all the tools in place while faking having in your hands a lock?
I’d love to spend a week training under your watch. I’ve had locksmithing on my career possibilities list for decades.  Worldwide possibilities.
A fluke is the most common fish in the sea.
I still don’t understand why he hasn’t designed and marketed a line of locks himself?
It's nice to see that the president of master lock has a sense of humor. Generally locks are just a way of keeping honest people honest anyway.
He really just picked a dang lock in 0.97
I was kind of hoping that it would have only been a letter and nothing else. Just ending without showing any lock since he lost it.
"...as and a consequence" I'm pretty sure that letter didn't come from the president of Master Lock lol
bro cheesed these guys
Thank God Master Lock is not a Japanese company. The entire company would seppuk
I thought the letter was the joke. As in "he can't find it if we don't send it", Its invisible.
Love how he picks the lock twice in half the time he spent reading the letter.
took him WAY longer to read the letter than open the lock. OF COURSE
You should do a collab with fellow lockpicker and Master Lock hater, McNallyOfficial
Hah funny.
That would have been even funnier Master Lock had really sent that letter as a april fools joke.
Locks are only for honest people.
LPL opened it before I could even understand what the counter measure was
High five for living in the Peoples Communist Republic of Maryland
Master lock punching the air rn
R A K I N G  A T T A C K
could you try and do a snapon flank key lock? id love to see thay
He has done the impossible
That was hilarious!  I wasn't expecting there to actually be a lock in the box with the letter.
It proofed that still there is executive guy stupid enough to put a generous budget to let someone snap his face in 15 sec.....
We are innovative leaders in the lock industry. LPL uses a rake pick to open lock in under 5 seconds.    5 S E C O N D S.
If master lock ever sold those, I would buy them
To be absolutely fair to the camouflage approach, it DOES regularly take LPL longer to find most locks than to pick them.
LOL!
I'm still waiting to find out how he got into the Pentagon with just a chicken.
Lives right near me!!! GO WISCONSIN
Thats not even real camo 🤣
LPL loses virginity: "Let's do it one more time to prove that it wasn't a fluke"
I can’t tell if this was a joke or if this was an actual attempt by Master Lock
It has to be staged, why would a Company ruin thier rep like this
Kudos to Master Lock for playing along and getting some serious PR. I love it, really.
He missed the opportunity to pour cement in the keyway
LPL: Gets caught sleeping with your wife LPL: Let's do it one more time to make sure it wasn't a fluke.  edit: I forgot "time" in one more time
I understand this is the lock picking lawyer, but what lock was he picking? I didn’t see one on screen.
Wheres the lock theres just some pink tape and keys.
I like how most of the video was him just reading the paper and not even showing himself picking the lock
Someone in that board room definitely said, "He can't pick it if he can't see it" while tapping his temple.
The wave rake?, oh c'mon, at least ask it out to dinner first before you insert that big tool in there.
Before I watch you reveal the walk I just want to say that I am hoping that instead of like camouflage or whatever it is actually just John Cena on the lock.
MasterLock should put a lock in bumcfuck nowhere, send a letter to LPL and tell him that he can't pick what he can't see. I'd expect 4chan to find it though and blow it up with a .50cal...
McNally be like: FUUUUUCK
That moment you notice LPL has more subs than Pat McAfee. An audience this big is making me wish for actual invisible locks
Could've sworn it was going to be the envelope and by opening it you failed ;)
Locks only keep honest people out. LPL proves this. Glad he seems honest, lol.
Why are you jiggling the wave rake in air?... I came to see a picked lock, not picking air...
There are no unpickable locks. The only way you're gonna get closer is by slowing down the lock-picking process.
haha I love your skills.
Master lock "challenges" god.
Lmaooooo😂😂😂😂
Masterlock is out of business because of embarrassment                                                                      ----                                                                    LPL
I had to watch this video 5 times ... i mean .. i see the pink tape .. but where is the lock?
Oh shit I didnt know you lived in MD. Granted the boonies of the Frederick area
Oh yeah... That letter was written by a fan, for sure... Given Master Lock's build "quality," one would assume it's a Chinese company, and the Engrish was too comprehensible.
It's good that some people are thinking outside the lock
The possible thought process of the team 1. We were given generous amount of budget 2. We probably still wouldn't beat LPL 3. The president seemed to care about our morale 4. We were told to think outside the box 5. We spent $10 on a lock cover (in hope LPL would get skin allergy from touching it) 6. We spent the rest on parties.
"... And a wave rake"  It's over as soon as you hear those words.
Meanwhile at executive suite of Masterlocks...  CEO : You IDIOTS!
Lol I live right by them in Chino hills ca.
imagine falling for it  me too.
Everyone is a bad ass till he pulls out the wave rake.
you can pick that faster than i could unlock it with the key!!!
Haha, embarrassing locks have been like this since they started the brand.. I remember when I was a little ass wipe, we broke small master locks with simple tools.. (we opened doors to motorized equipment to have fun with) we didn't steal anything or broke in to rob anyone, but we was 19-13 years old and wanted to joyride some lawnmowers and tractors...
Yeah, that's some bs. A company doesn't care about morale. They would talk about how their product sucks when issuing this challenge.
Wtf?? Only thing I was able to see was a chrome rod. Where the hell was the lock at? I’ve watched the video 20 times even in slow mo and no where do I see a lock body
That final callout at the end was golden
It honestly woulda been funnier if you forewent the pick and just cut it open with one of you... larger... tools XD
Making a lock hard to find actually seems like a good idea, imo. Like imagine if a door lock was built into the door frame so it couldn't be seen from certain angles, painted white and everything. A more discreet lock or one in an unusual spot probably would deter pickers that don't know what to look for
Oh. I didn't know you're from Maryland. I'm like 45 minutes from you in St. Marys County.   Time to put all these videos I've watched on your channel to practice on your front door.        Did I say that out loud?
My morale has shot up
New padlocks unable to be picked by the lockpickinglawyer ALONE brought you by masterlock.
Did anyone else see what he was doing? I just saw his hands shaking about and some floating pink tape
a blind lawyer? hmm mr.murdock?
Liked the video very much… So strange that they don't do it a little bit harder to open. They can only watch one of your videos, and you tell them what to do, to make them much better. Maybe it is so bad, so anyone can open them, with out much practice; If they lost the key… 🤓😀
They had to add a letter to make the video more than 15 seconds.  Good PR Master Lock!
Good Vid ! this is very sad 😞 that a lock can be just jiggled open with a piece of wiggly metal. not much of a lock ! Master lock my derrière - More like " disaster lock "
Some One will be fired in California...
HA HA HA!!!! 😂🤣😝😜😂
There is a padlock that was made by a madman not very long ago that was declared unpickable by any means and can only be opened by the key made for it. What made it unpickable? The heavy duty padlock uses a circuit inside that is powed by the key itself when inserted. There are no tumblers to pick, grooves nor anything to turn to open it. The locking mechanism is activated by a servo and is only exposed when the cylindrical key with 8 tiny slots all around is inserted. Once inserted, it automatically unlocks the padlock, nothing to turn. When you remove the key and lock it, that's it. It was taken all over the world to be picked by the best of the best, and all of them failed. Wouldn't you like to take a shot of cracking something like that huh?
Next Master Lock letter will be a glitter bomb disguised as a lock :p
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳Amazing!
Hello everyone this is the lock picking lawyer to further prove my point we're gonna break into the master lock president's house and hold his family hostage
👀Lol this is gold!🤣 The letter is even more embarassing  than the lock after that display.💀👌🏾
It took him longer to read the letter than pick the lock. Conclusion - for future tests, include longer letters as to increase the overall time it takes him to show that the lock was picked.
I think this video is fake, I don't see the lock 🔐
Oh man... they should have hide the lock with concrete
Ah, so they're now using camouflage to hide their flaws.
I don't know why people even try to beat this guy anymore. He is a god.
LMAO Short and sweet! Loved the clip, but I can't wait for the video. 😂
The only way they could keep you from picking it is to get rid of the keyway.
This was just astonishing. I can't believe you'd cheat by using a seeing eye dog! I am so disappointed in you LPL. You've lost a follower, and I'm burning all your merch. PHONY ALERT!!!
LOL they're just using you for free advertisement haha
Lpl have you seen the guy who does this wirh cattle castration bands lmao
It seems, against all odds, that it was not, I repeat, IT WAS NOT a fluke.
You should have used a hammer, works just as fast!
Now this is creative marketing. Send the famous lockpicker a cheeky letter and what's probably at best newer visual design.
only one question... WHO DID THIS??? Make yourself known!
someone just lost their job
They must’ve written that one while laughing, this is a great joke… It’s a joke right ?
I was like, 2.5 minutes they got quite the time then. I mean nothing good but still 2 mi-- he proceeds to read the whole letter...
$12 bolt cutters opens all locks. Grinders opens a safe cutting from the side not the front. Locks and safes were made for the honest person. Never but a safe you can carry.
The boob picking lawyer
It is enough to look at the length of the clip to realise how good the lock was. In this situation, reading the letter is slightly misleading, as it takes longer than opening the lock itself.
Gotta say, in a real life scenario Camouflage makes sense, maybe the picker is only specialised on certain lock models, or actually can't find where the lock is located (some barn door with high grass all around)
It's been 5 days, and you're still laughing?
Problem at headquarters, i sad think out side the box.
you probably just got a guy fired
🤣🤣🤣nice one
I love that the humour has always been excellent, the opinions honest and that the length of these videos haven't increased despite LPL managing to advertise his tools while opening the lock in the same amount of time. It's beautiful to watch
Master lock offered me a job but I decided to go into validation.  Although it is right near my home.  It was fun, however, to learn how they manufacture their locks while I was in the application process
what lock?
Hahah, go cowtown, good one Chino resident!  --Chino Hills, CA Escapee
I thought it would be a brick of cement with a lock ring sticking out the top.  "Thinking outside the box"
I honestly I would have found it better if there simply was no lock attached
Student Lock
🤣😂🤣😂🤣👌🏼🤘🏼👍🏼
Hey guys, where's the lock at? I can't see it
2.6M views in 5 days, all of them well deserved. I've been binging this channel lately and I love every bit of it.
Dude you live like 40 mins away from me, used to work in Damascus lol
Can’t wait for 2022 April fools, they get better each year
Very cleverly written, love it.
😂🤣😭
They should have made the lock grey so the dog couldn't find it
Their top shelf engineers?  They'd better start putting in their resumes elsewhere
lol
I sent it :)~
At least they have a sense of humor!  😁
Omg lmfao
That was a good PR stunt by Master 😁
This was the longest time to pick a ML lock. Was the letter.... A success?
"This is our best lock, give it a shot" Opened within 10 seconds by a tool a 10-year old could manage to use.
you should desing lock with any big company
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
This is just a mid tier troll and somewhat clever marketing tactic by master lock... They got 2.5million sets of eyes on their product for next to nothing.
hahahahaha you cant pick what you cant find, love that logic. Probably the only way to stop this man.
It wouldve been funnier if the package was empty and the only thing that was inside, was the letter.
you know you've made it when one of the biggest lock manufacturers is trolling you :D
Too bad it isn’t really getting picked. Clearly unlocked during the who video
At this point its just you doing the product testing for them
Chino!! Thats my town! Wonder if I know him?? 😂
It's never a Fluke, afaik they don't make lock. Kind of unfortunate; I'd love to see LPL do a play on words with it...
A lot of effort for a weak joke...
I thought he at least took three minutes to pick it, but no - most of the time gets spent reading the letter 😄
Given the way the letter is worded, I was literally expecting it to be a block of cement.
kinda easy to pick pink tape. i didn't see anything else but that you still went through the motions you typically use to pick a MasterLock
I was actually able to help a girl get into her locker last night when she locked her keys in it. Took like three seconds. Step up your game Master Lock.
*its
I'd send him a ca glues lock as a challenge if I'd live in the states. 😂
The Kingdom of God is at Hand  John 3:16 King James Version 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Here, the president of a company uses possessive it's.
If it was actually Master Lock who sent it, I think there's even another layer to it - they realize that there isn't a lock that LPL (or any sufficiently skilled picker) would not be able to pick using some type of tool or method so to genuinely have an unpickable lock it would have to be invisible
Lol daaaaamn. This guy is good
I have a feeling it took more time to get the pink tape on than it was to pick the lock.
Where is the lock?
HAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA
Wait there was no lock when he claimed to be picking the lock!
I was honestly just expecting there to be no lock in there at all.
Wait, what was the pink tape attached to? All I saw was a small shrub.
I rescued the last payphone that was in service in our area, from the dumpster. I need to open the lock in order to restore it and convert it to a standard phone. Can you help with any videos about these locks?
Emotional Damage
Spoiler: When LPL says "let's do it again to prove it wasn't a fluke", it's never a fluke.  Ever.
I can imagine the masterlock workers crowding around all LPL updates😂😂
Reading the letter took longer than describing and picking the lock, TWICE. Quick, everyone send lengthy letters with your challenge locks, maybe we can get a video longer than 5 minutes.
at first i thought they just didnt include a lock
Someone help the lawyer he can't stop laughing 😢
Wow, EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I laughed when he brought out the wave rake
Clever!
Sad how many people actually thought that MasterLock sent that letter, lol. This was an entertaining video. Thanks for the laugh!
That made me smile :)
i think master lock won here??? free advertising just look how big it reads Master Lock! 2.5m views... ye not bad well done!
Hilarious!!
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
You knew it wasn't an actual Master Lock letter when they used "it's" instead of "its"
I think it would have been funnier if they sent this letter in an empty box
Quite a few grammatical errors in that letter. Punctuation-marks don't go into quotes, for one :-o
They should send you a paycheck for doing all their quality control work
for a minute i thought that he would send just the letter
funny
3 seconds from insertion of the rake to removal. Possibly the fastest?
I’ve watched so many aggressive funny YouTubers that I honestly thought he was going to say to the writer “I’m coming for you.” Not “thanks for the laughs”
so basically he said: "'as not to dmg the morale any further, I'll pick it again so you see it's no fluke"'
CEO with popcorn invites engineer to watch LPL. Loud crashes are heard. Engineer leaves with popcorn bucket on head while dripping of butter and failure sauce.
I just want an episode where he fully reads the paper then pull out a glock to open the lock
Master: We issue a challenge. *HAAAHAHAHAHAA-* oh you’re serious?
Lol
😂😂
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Actually got a picking kit that was my great uncle's from when he worked as a locksmith and I tried raking a similar master lock, mine was the black rubber casing with a hexagonal shackle. First try was successful with a similar time as yours so "low skilled" is an overstatement. Took about a minute with a crowd in real world conditions and the cylinder needed high tension even with the key because of all the gunk in it.
It took him longer to open the weather flap…
@ LPL , someone wants you to solve the 3 houses/3 utilities puzzle . i know the answer and some have changed the rules of it but it is very simple
😂😂😂😂👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I really hope that's a joke by master lock
The lock was so masterfully camouflaged that the visual of the LPL was all an illusion. I think Master Lock was so embarrassed of their poor performance, they covered the lock to conceal their Brand Name!
I don't think he got that it was a camo joke
What would it take to make a lock unpickable? Could they make a lock that needs more than two hands to pick? Double keys? What would it take? :o
Trying to imagine LPL playing Fallout 4 and he has to pick a lock! One bobby pin left!
The lengths we will go to for a good laugh.
This is stupid
I wish you would've kept a red circle around the lock, I lost view of the lock when the tape wasnt in view
Sigma rule. Locks are made to be unlocked.
I’ve always had a theory in life that has been well served.... Locks only keep honest people out!
Had no idea MasterLock was in Oak Creek.  And that was a masterful gag. Well played, Chino!
You got me, I LOLed.
I wonder if LPL ever wondered this: since all locks in the market are equally weak, those being featured in LPL’s videos probably sell more than locks no one ever heard about, because if someone is going shopping for them, they’ll see a shelf with many brands and, being unsure about which to buy, would end up buying a familiar one. LPL’s videos are probably HELPING the sales for those lock makers, hence the effort in trying to make them a featured lock…. I myself thought this camouflaged lock was pretty neat and desirable, giving little thought to its weakness…. Something to think about… ah, also, this video already has 2.5 million views. Running an ad to have this much impressions costs a lot of money and LPL is doing it for free for those companies….. you’re probably being played, LPL…
is there even a singleone that you cant lockpick? crazy.
Reads entire letter to pad length of video Still less than 3 minutes runtime
You would be more useful scratching your arse
I always ponder about the length of these video. Then he pulls out the waverake and I say 'oh.'
Oh hey, greetings from Maryland! I live super close to damascus!
LPL: *pulls out waverake*  Lock: "Am I a joke to you?"
Which one of you wrote that? Lol
I would have put a little dab of superglue on the lock. Can`t open that, ha!
The most ironic thing about this whole video to me is that whomever sent in that joke letter committed a felony by impersonating an officer of a publicly-traded company (the signature), as well as forging the letterhead of same. If Master Lock chose to pursue, there could be real trouble over that. :/
Wow. Good lock camo! I had to adjust the monitor contrast and play with the settings to see it.  I'm buying one of those!
I can remember as a kid picking Master locks with the tweesers and toothpic from a small Swiss army knife
The best way to beat the LockPickLawyer is to make him use more hands than he has, Make the lock have two keys that have to turned at the same time or something along those lines.
There is a point at which just taping what ever you want to secure together is probably an alternative that takes longer to "pick" than a padlock. Let that sink.
If you look down the key hole, you can see the disappointment
I really do love how even with the short length of these videos, theres still so much charisma and entertainment. Thanks for being one of my all time favorite channels and people here, even though the closest I've ever gotten to lockpicking is a paperclip to turn the lights off in my school lunchroom in 5th grade
Ain't even started the video but come on Master, you can't call this man out you had to know that was just gonna make your life harder.
I was half expecting it to be a lock with a highly polished mirror finish that LPL couldn’t show on camera as it would reveal his face
This gotta be a joke. They probably just poisened the out layer or something...
I am a boat mechanic and Have what they call a gas cap key out of a snap on lock out kit from my tow truck days,years ago. This single key is double sided spring steel and will open 75 percent of pad locks, operate 90 percent of ignitions and unlock all cabin. doors. Didn't take long before everyone I work with wanted one. Will even open all locked tool boxes that don't have,for obvious reasons, the round key tamper proof locks. It is everybody's favorite tool
I laughed so hard XD
Witty video 😊
Interesting... 🤔
master lock reputation be like : 💩💩💩
Ok, the letter itself raised my opinion about Masterlock.
Woulda been so much more funny if they sent an invisible lock
Lol
It was me
Took more time to read the letter than to pick the lock
They tried to hide the disappointment
I'm rolling here. They exclusively use masterlock in my work.
Im waiting for "Fluke" multimiter company to send their product... Lets see LPL saying its not a fluke!
If your seeing eye dog found it, you still didn't!
Eufy Smart Lock? Round unique keys are unpickable because if you find a way to open the lock the system will alert the homeowner.  I beleive you might have this on your home along with a secondary lock with customized pins. Not phishing for information, I don't really want to know.  Let me know if I can send you this and hopefully get it back and I will.
Ngl lost too many keys I just use this method to open everything now, I’ve gotten into the alien base in Area 51.
Saw a huge pit bull on a chain which was attached to his collar by a large padlock....    Yea, I thought about you.
I thought this was real.... Oh my gosh
Consider the possibility that if LPL didn’t have a seeing-eye dog, he wouldn’t have been able to find the lock and therefore pick it.
Loved this video just hilarious 😆😆😆
Chino in da houuuuse
I actually have thought about a lock that may pose some difficulty in picking. And that is a lock that requires two keys to be simultaneously turned to unlock.  I don't know if such lock exists or can be made,  the fact is that you need to pick each key area separately and then turn it at the same time would at least increase the time it took LPL in picking it.
obvious self plug
Oh hey the video is 3 minutes maybe this one is a slight challenge. "I am going to read the letter."  Nevermind..
Classic "BRUH" moment
I don't believe it could it master locks competitor forging a letter and lock to further humiliate them?
Make sure to save that letter and the persons address that sent it in case the real David Youn decides to sue them for impersonation and signing his name on a document. Identity theft is real.
Took longer to read the note and introduce the lock then it did to pick it
God tier troll.
Master Lock: "told the team to think outside the box" Team: Let's put a cheap plastic cover on it and camouflage it. (High five each other)
its*
LOL. I've been to their factory to pick up files before. Their factory is deep in the hood.
To make this even funnier, the person who sent this in should have written in the letter that he asked his employees to 'think outside the locks'...
YOOOO REPPING CHINO, CA
They should rebrand To faster lock
🤣😂
wowie, one of their best locks yet!
The budget must be really low
That just shows Master Lock really don't care
LockPickingLawyer I just want to say thank you so much for all of your videos. I learned so much about lockpicking and without you I don't think I could have started my robbing career! You have helped me deal with all sorts of security, and I was even able to rob a bank at one point! Thank you for all the information about locks, I couldn't have done it without you.
Why do you never answer questions you ask for?
Still laughing that you haven’t picked Tim Hutts lock 😂😂😂
Based on the wording in the letter, I thought they were going to send a lock that was literally cemented in place on the inside. Now that would have been funny.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!
why is there a floating piece of pink tape?
Weird that I just learnt that I live like 5 minutes from their headquarters
I wouldn't put it past Masterlock if they were to write such a letter given their locks are such a joke.
I’m just curious, does the LPL actually practice opening the lock before filming it? I wanna see him lockpick everything on first attempt rather than already figuring out the solution before showing us. Because if the lock takes a bit of time to figure out, I consider it effective against the LPL lol
Wow. I did not expect that
When half the video's already gone by and he's still reading the letter, you know its gonna be a quick pick lol
This might be the most brilliantly clever thing I've ever seen.
I had an idea, a lock with a internal battery and vibration device when it detects something in the key way it vibrates making it impossible to feel the tumblers.
Cool. We should be honest.  Locks 🔒 are cool, but they are only for looks.
I once "picked" a padlock with a pair of Vise Grips and a ball peen hammer.  Surprisingly the hammer was just fine afterward.
I love how he knew it was probably a joke, but still went along with it anyway.
Too funking funny!
Nothing is more disrespectful than using the rake
Ain't lock picking done mostly by ear?
That is literally as fast as a key!
🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Plot twist: It really was Master Locks newest highest security lock
Master lock engineers on suicide watch!
🤣 Too good. Kudos to whoever wrote this letter.
😂😂😂😂😂
Can't believe they used both spaced out  paragraphs and indented first lines.
They'll never financially recover from this
This got to be a joke, it is impossible to get clapped so hard in so little time
Masterlock did a big brain move there. It took him 100 seconds!
What lock?🤔
my first experience picking a master lock was at an old job, i picked the lock with my homemade half ball pick and tension wrench in a matter of a second... i put the pick in, dragged it out, and it popped.... multiple times.... in a row... glad to see they're trying to up their game lol
Lol!
Someone has a good sense of humor. :-)
To be fair LPL could probably pick most locks blindfolded
Really there budget was shit I bet !
Is it possible to relock a lock with picks?
I haven't laughed that hard in a while!
I was REALLLLLY hoping that there wasnt a lock. Glad there wasnt 10/10 joke theres literally no lock to find.
Nice ad for Master
It's never a fluke.
Master lock, keep's kid's and idiots honest. No pick's required just 2 ball peen hammer's.
I half expected there to be no pins in that lock
Hope you enjoyed it as much as we did man.
I've been called a know it all in derogatory terms by several people that have focused on one skill or trade, when I tend to learn as much as I can about everything I can. I see these arrogant locksmiths saying you are BS. Keep on doing what you do. I love lockpicking as a hobby. I will be ordering some of your items soon. Thank you for your videos. Love em'.
LOL.
When are you gonna make the best lock on the planet?
LPL, you're always amazing and NEVER surprising! It's hard to believe a wave rake can open that Master Lock, you make it look so effortless! Cheers!
L.P.L. - reminding the world that locks are for honest people, and bad/lazy criminals.  Proving why spending more money on a better lock is a waste of money.
Anybody got a light? Can't see anything through all this shade.
I dont get it why did you act like there was a lock in you hand there is clearly no lock present in this video and I am very confused
Lol that letter was great
when the video is over 3/4s of the way over, and he hasn't started picking, you know who is gonna win.
Good grief!
In all fairness you didn't include the amount of time needed to find that lock. That should be factored in to the total defeat time
Well played by that letter writer.
Typo in the letter: it is "its", not "it's."
I consider this a warming up to April 1st. Looking forward to it:))))
Its weakest link.  It's = it is.  Find It is weakest link?
evidently a prank because they'd use a higher quality paper and printer
Dear Masterlock, I pick your locks in lieu of a fidget toy.  Warm reguards, Mana.
LPL sending Master Lock employees to therapy
Oh no!  Here comes the rake!
The best approach is to put a lot of tape around the lock, include some nails to further slow down the cutting.  The lock it self should probably open and close like a ballpoint when you hold a magnet next to it and have a fake key hole that looks very much like a real lock.
In summation: “This is a joke letter sent by a fan and isn’t actually from Masterlock, but allow me to continue just a bit longer and further humiliate and embarrass them in front of millions of viewers for the millionth time anyway.” 😂
Have you noticed how the language in the letter mimics exactly that of Mister LPL? What a coincidence.
I think LPL's passion for opening things started when his wife wore chastity belts :D
lol wtf I never knew you were a MD local.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!
That letter was indeed from David Youn CEO of Master lock inc make no mistake about it that letterhead was also from his office...so yep its safe to say he tried (and sadly failed) to challenge you the Lock picking lawyer to a Professional Duel of which he lost..oops sorry dave lol guess that "cement" cracked  in the process
i guess they had a bone to pick with you for awhile.  [*crickets* ... *cough*]
Wow that sucks as a lock!
😂
😂👏👏👏   just don't answer the phone or messages from China or Russia please☝️
Get ready for copycat letters, looking to get in a video.
To be fair, it's always going to be possible to pick a lock as long as standard locking mechanisms are used. It'll be a lot harder when locks start transitioning to electronic locks. Still possible, but now it requires a whole different skill set a lot of people don't have.
Good joke .
"The Office of the President" lol
So real question. If master lock came to you and asked for input on a more secure and better designed lock that could be massively produced affordably would you offer opinions and help?
The only locks he can't pick are those at Chuck Norris's House
Lmao. "The post mark from chino CA." Thats funny
Ahahahah
He had to get his "seeing-eye dog to find it for him" lmgdao then he put the pink tape on it so he wouldn't lose it again I can't
I have always heard that locks only keep out honest people lol
Ok, but whoever thought about making a fake master lock note is very clever
dude they were trolling you.    mommy says I'm kinda smart.
Doesn't matter how big a lock is if someone wants something bad enough no lock will work I asked my dad one time why he didn't lock his car doors he said because if someone wants something bad enough they're going to break into it no matter what and I just saved myself a window.
all I saw was your lockpicks.
Skipped 10 sec just to hear him say "we got it open the second time" 😂
LOL
Anytime LPL takes out the wave rake you might as well just move on.  By the time you get your mouse hand in position, he'll be done.
that type of content it's verry dangerousto show this like that be carefull and don't think every body have good intention honnestly i don't think that have a place on youtube
yeah! funny. I really enjoyed this to watch. but 3,8 m subscribers of yours and "JUST" 2.3m clicks of 'em against the MYRIARDS of blind buyers of master locks are not worth the comment you've taken. i am shure. except i like it. GO ON! YOU'RE breathtaking simple. i like!
Where is the lock
At least Master Lock has balls to challenge LPL.
Can LPL please find an easier way to open those super annoying zip-top bags for THC edibles???  I mean, besides ‘my method’ - which is to rip off the entire top off the doggone thing, shove some in my face to counteract the frustration incurred by the package, then just use a NORMAL zipper bag.😆
Just make a lock with 30 fake locks and one real lock.
What happens if a lock has had its safety pins activated or deadbolt activated?. How would you go about picking this? Or point me to a video where this has been the case?!
*president of Master lock stumbles into lock picking lawyers workshop*   "Why do I hear boss music?!?!"
So dumb question but what if you made the pins default going up and had a thin magnetic key to pull them down to unlock the lock. Basically invert the pins to be pulled down instead of pushed up.
XD the pink tape is hilarious
I really expected a  lock with reflective surfaces. That would have slowed him down (at least while filing)
I'll find him. I'm down the block from Chino 🤣
That signature though! Lol!
LPL can do it!!! Love him for his educational...education. 😅😅
I was expecting a padlock COVERED With keyholes only one of which opened the lock
You always show locks that you picked why you don’t put an umpickable lock. We need to believe in something hahaha
Forget Ford vs Ferrari, I want to see Master Lock vs Lock Picking Lawyer as a movie
Should've set your camera to thermal, couldn't see the lock!
Imagine: You, sitting at your desk. You suddenly hear LPL's voice behind you, "Let's see if we can't get past this lock." "Click on 3, little bit on 4..." You now hear his voice from inside your head. "Let's do that again to prove it wasn't a fluke..."
He should’ve taken off the pink tape and then edited the video to make it disappear.
Master Lock punching the air right now 😭
its* weakest link in that mail.
Sadly, MasterLock, you can't do security through obscurity. :)
That letter alone felt like some hoaxy gag from a fan; if, by any small chance, it actually DID come from the Master Lock company, they need a better editor (and maybe reword their challenges to not sound so silly, as steep of a task as that may be)...!
My dad aways said lock are for honest people the criminals will go steal bolt cutters
you had to wiggle the pick? Man, Master HAS gotten better. No more instant bumps and done, huh? XD
The only lock LPL can't pick is not locked in the first place
Nice.
LPL has hands down the best fan base.
Oof…their BEST engineers huh? that’s pretty embarrassing alright.
Next time they will send a 100% pick proof unlockable lock.
So tell me why you not making locks better for manufacturers
Much love from 21001
u open it faster without a key i think...?
This was hilarious!!
Can someone explain to me what happened, it never showed the padlock, and I don't know what I was doing with the tools🤣
'seeing eye dog' absolutely lost it
I think you missed the point it's camouflage... You can't pick a lock you can't see. Camouflage=invisible 🤣
All the padlock company need to unite to create one true padlock that can defy LP sama
I'm wondering  about an Alboy protect 2  lock.. I would be impressed if you could pick that
that must be humiliating as shit for them, if the previous videos were not, god I just feel bad for them, this was their best attempt?
Master lock? More like not a lock
He destroyed their entire morale within seconds.
Tfw he pulls out the wave rake
I certainly thought there was going to be no lock in there, presuming that it's invisible.
"innovation" *Proceeds to use a regular lock core*
So its a john cena lock...gotcha 😆
Alright which one of you hilarious bastards wrote that?! 10/10 comedy.
I figured the joke was there was no lock, because there is no lock you cannot pick.
Love the humor on this channel.
So this is how you unlock a strip of pink tape
"A three minutes video?!?" Oh he reads a letter lol
Does LPL laugh out loud? Or does he just smile and nod
This is some funny shit!
Me: Sits up in bed at 2:37am Me: Hears "This is the LockPickingLawyer and today we are going to attempt to pick a..." Me again: Looks at my computer across room and sees it is still in standby.. Me: Realizes it is coming from outside.... Burglar: Realizes his bluetooth earbuds didn't connect to his phone and turns phone down and runs off..
Can factory make (termocoating) black coating rhis shine "U" ring too or someting else (+camoflage paint)?
At least they have a sense of humor about it.
LPL, how about the "generous budget"? would you recommend the president of masterlock to give a little bit more of a generousity?
wait but wheres the lock
I don't get it. All you did was place some tools next to a piece of pink tape.  🤷‍♂
I heard the word cement and had really hoped it was a lock that was in a block of cement with just the shackle sticking out
That was a well thought of joke 😆 👏  Think outside the box.. 😂
Seems like, "all talk and no action", with master lock. Sadly, this is the common theme nowadays 😞
Master lock, we are not masters and we don't make locks, we make toys.
He's arrogantly laughing now but the poison has already soaked in.
Wonder what he would rank as his hardest lock to pick
IT FINALLY HAPPENED HE LOCKPICKED AIR
I thought there would be no lock in the package.
Yo it's not long till April fools, can't wait.
I thought there would be no lock to make sure it is impossible to find
i laughed when i read the title and saw the video duration. then i laughed even harder when more than half time of video he was reading the message 😂
LPL :Easy Master lock engineer: back to drawing board
I love how the reading part takes way longer than the picking part
I didnt see any lock i dont get it??
Those modern lock can be easily  pick by paper clip.  You can't pick an old fashioned  Indian lock, without  physically breaking it.... one type key like a Cork screw...n the other 6 or 7 lever keys.
🤣🤣🤣 I leave all my doors opened. No hope with LockPickingLawyer!
“Thinks outside of box” okay here you go!!! Lock picker: it’s easier  Them: but it wasn’t in the box when you opened it 😉😉😉😉 I need to go to sleep
i didnt expect there to actually be a lock, because of the whole its camouflaged and you wont be able to see it thing
masterlock knows their locks are shit they're just having fun at this point
Hilarious! I very very much enjoyed the pink tape. And as always your dry sense of humor. No puns here, no BS. I just enjoy your videos.
“as and a consequence”
A pretty much unpickable lock you say? Just upscale it, meld a long tube in front of the keyway and use a long and reinforced key that doesn't break. :P
Wait, I can see a pink tape, but where's the lockpad?
*There's gotta be an LPL Lock Company*
I comment to help
Title: I cannot stop laughing  Video: not a single 'ha' was hawed.
I would have not added a lock with the letter.... just saying
Master Lock should be genuinely appalled at how easily their products are defeated. Do they actually care that they appear to be selling rubbish to the public?
i don't get it. all i see is a bit of pink tape.
Dude your like gladiator.  Lol!
If you're a true blue lawyer why don't you guys never answer your phone?
At first I was impressed with how long the video was. And then he spent over half the video reading a letter.
Just like a master key a key that can open all locks, a master lock is a lock that can be opened by all key
You know they fucked up once he pulled out the wave rake
Immagine if they actually did manage to slow down LPL that would be a massive boost in the sales lol
If we take the letter reading into account, it did increase the total unlocking time, but I doubt people would read it.
Zack is just ruining these manufacturers
that was sad, is this now a feud?
Where's the lock?
For a lawyer he reads painfully slowly.
Damascus? Capital of Syria?
Holy shit I had no idea you lived so close to me 😂 Damascus, MD is only a quick trip up 70 for me! Half an hour and I’m there
Good video but, hear me out ok 😳
That’s metal, in ya lungs
All I saw was a pink slip of paper floating around
He dealt the company morale EMOTIONAL DAMAGE.
wow If it wasnt for the pink tap I'd have thought you're just jiggling tools in the air.
Still waiting to see the lock.
100 Lockpick skill.
Where's the lock?
They should have sent it a month and a half later.
Wow I just realized that your mailing address is right down the road from me!
Plot Twist: LPL is a real-life Matt Murdock
But, But....   The PRESIDENT!!
All I know about "Master Lock" is that I actually pass their world headquarters nearly every weekend when I go out for my fun Saturday night drives around town in Oak Creek. 🙂
Geez. XD
Plot twist: That letter really *was* from David Youn, and he now has to console his engineers more than ever after that humiliating defeat.
They sent you a lock personally and didn’t add security pins! Lmao.
lock picking lawyer is located near Damascus MD??? what an interesting way for my small hometown to be attached to a niche internet celebrity
I get the impression that his laughter is accompanied by its own friendly and patiently toned explanation and instructional video
When someone presents a “challenge” and the video is less than three minutes long…
I was hoping for better camouflage - maybe a dial on the front, or a different brand name.
Whoever wrote that letter better stick to his day job because his “joke” is painfully bad.
never seen a man lock picks air with a pink piece of tape this fast!
That was meeeeeeeee!!
“It took a while for my seeing eye dog to find the lock” had me fucking dead
Puh it was really hard to find. I think they designed it for some super apocalypse preppers.
I didn't see him pick anything. Was this not a lock pick video?
fake letter...
When he starts picking the lock and there is less than a minute left in the video, you know the lock doesn't stand a chance
It's a little early for april fools
Locks like windows only keep honest people out.
I still have not found the lock in this video
It took more time to read the letter than to pick the lock 🤣
I entirely expected there to be nothing else with the letter and the joke is that the best master lock is none at all.
just straight shit on masterlock. Rip
Confused. I only saw some floating pink tape and a keyway.
ML: You may have fooled use at first but here's our lock just for you. LPL: You're on!!! ML: 😀😁😅😐😔
I thought the box was empty
I have a MasterLock 5423D that won't budge.  New design?
I can only imagine the executive leader eagerly clicking on this video, only to watch his high budget project unfold in less than a second.
Cant pick a lock you can’t see was master locks logic there
The lock is just a virgin, it will last longer with time.
4s in the video and I stop to see the total video duration about 2:54. Ok not so much of a challenge as always
lol, what if it really was from the president of master lock?.
I thought they just didn't include a lock so he would never find it and thus never be able to pick it.
Hey the master lock company should be adding a letter note attached to the lock so they can be slowed down🤣🤣
Breaking News: Masterlock president was seen jumping off a building roof this morning.
It woulda been great if it didn’t even come with a lock
Hahaha...excellent fun.
"as and a consequence" bruh lol
Master Lock employees: 👁️👄👁️
Today I learned LPL is from my small hometown...
Camo skin was suppose to make it harder for you to see it
I love it!!!
Yes, a joke letter. I get it. I think the real Master Lock company would send an email these days! 🙄
I'm not convinced this wasn't a fluke. Take the pink tape off and try finding it again.
Until the second half of the letter, I was sure it was going to be a lock without a keyway i.e. unopenable therefore unpickable.
I expected a camouflage patterned lock, but was hoping for a John Cena patterned lock :(  Kudos to the person who put the effort into this.
Dang....he jiggled it in 1 second and finished !  Quicker than 2 pump chump.
heheeh you can tell there are some digs in that letter heheh.  It sounded like it was not being mean just friendly ribbing.   I hope I'm not wrong and this was not meant to be a mean spirited.
Absolutely hilarious!
[02/22/22]  With 3.8M subs I have a difficult time believing that there aren't any Master Lock employees among them. Where are all their comments in these comment sections??
Master L for MasterLock
Masterlock-Keeping Honest People Honest for 100 years.
It took longer to read the letter 😂
+
This is why I use 5 Pitbulls as a door lock! (Just don't tell anyone that they will lick the intruder to death)
That letter was comedic gold.
"... Our designers took the opportunity to cement Master Lock's reputation...."  Next time, send him a lock encased in cement.
Wait where was the lock?
Free advertising for master lock. 2m views
I keep expecting Master to come out with something where LPL gets halfway through saying which rake he's gonna use, and the thing opens just from the torque on the wrench.
bruh hes so good he didnt even need to see the lock to picked it. must have be the pink tape sheeese
I remember this joke from McNally (I think his name spelled like that?) channel's comment section. "Only criminal cant see this camouflage lock"
Missed opportunity to include an empty box with the letter 😅
I'm surprisingly infuriating by the incorrect use of "it's" instead of "its" in the letter... (In "it's weakest link)
why did i just watch LPL pick the air?
The pink piece of tape had me rolling, great video as always
Very funny, uploading a video where u pretend to pick a not existing lock...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LPL takes more time reading the letter than lockpicking the lock...
Thanks, LPL... If you please: How would one hold the lock if raking with the left hand?
Wait when does he open the lock? All I see is him fiddling around with a few tools and pink tape
Pranker: This is my masterpiece. I've written a convincing letter with full company information from their HQ in Wisconsin, hell, I even forged the president's signature.  LPL: Post mark is from California.  Pranker: Curses.
A little disappointed it wasnt a lock encased in cement
Plot twist: the real lock is hidden in the mailbox. Cemented of course.
HOW do you manage to not laugh at that, Mr. Lockpicker? That ability to hold a pokerface through anything is as amazing as the ability to pick any lock.
This by far is the best video. Master lock is gunk as normal.   *laughing hard “er”
I don't get it, the pink tape isn't attached to anything, there's nothing there at all
2:08 - Ah yes, the I turned the plug and the lock opened fluke...   actually. Master Lock is a little known for that... hmm. Funny joke and sad truth melding...
Brutality.
If that's a challenge, I could only beat your time by shopping out my massive bolt cutters and popping off the lock the old school way... Good work Juris Doctor!
hahahahaha
I think the only way to make a "pick-proof" lock would be to just make it start screaming if any amount of pins less than "all of them" are set for more than two seconds. Like sure it can still be picked, but it's going to be drawing a lot of attention to itself.
Hah, just drove past Masterlock HQ this morning. Let me know if you want me to stop in ever for anything :-) Went to the Tesla supercharger down the street at the Meijer Grocery Store.
should've stuck a pick of john Cena instead to make it actually invisible 😤
I thought the person poured cement into the lock when he used the "cement" phrase in the letter.
The next level Master Lock will come out with is the lockless lock, so there will be no chance of picking a lock when there is none. How the skilled engineers will design that one, is beyond me. But it will be out, so it can restore morale at Master Lock.
damn chino, cA strikes again
"They concluded that anyone who spent as much time as you developing picking skills, probably has also developed terrible vision". What the fuck? Not only do they send you a crappy lock they insult you?
I’m surprised they don’t contact you to help them design a better lock
He opened it with a rake. The absolute disrespect. 😂
This is a joke right?
Ahaha best click bate ever! Thanks for the laugh.
I had to check the calendar, not near April 1 yet.
Epic!!
Anyone else expecting a somewhat challenging lock and then just die when  he busts out the wave rake?
Yikes.  They spent a high budget on this? Oh dear. This has to be a joke.
I thought it would be just the letter with no actual lock. . .
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol whoever made it is hilarious
I’m the 1,999,998th viewer!
Security through obscurity, highly recommended in software as well!
Pffft… fluked it 🙄 🔒
What about picking weatherguard tool boxes? Have you done that before?
Nothing can stop him
LPL be like: Im’ma bouta end this man’s whole career 😂
im shouldn't be laughing this hard of a 3min video
Gotta give Master Lock some credit, this is the hardest I've heard the Lock Picking Lawyer laugh.
Maybe master lock can come up with a lock it’s shareholders can’t open. This way at the next stockholders meeting they can literally keep them as a captive audience.
I didn’t see a lock being picked
I know this was a joke, but if I were a lock company, I would hire the LPL to help design and test a pick-proof lock.  I have to think that something analogous to a lock with no keys requiring a block chain sequence only accessible through a bio-authenticator is what it would take.
Started dying as soon as I saw the wave rake 💀
As you were reading that Letter, I thought that it's a lock without opening mechanism. You can't pick a lock, if It doesn't have a point, where you can Pick it.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I was hoping they sent no lock and just claimed you couldn't find it
Sure, LPL opened it in seconds ... but that doesn't include the time he needed to actually find the lock!
yeah I agree with you.. it is a prank..
This guy can open that lock faster than if I tried it with the actual key...
I thought the joke would be that they didn't include any lock with the letter. That it was so well camouflaged that it was invisible.
That was a delightful prank, well played by all
Jason from Maryland here....Germantown to be exact and im related to the Moxley family of Damascus. Subscribed and bell hit! Glad to help support a local!!
They shouldn’t have included a lock at all!
Not for nothing is this one of the best channels on YT - long may it continue!
What lock were you picking?  I couldn't see anything.  :P
April 1st arrived early this year!  Very entertaining video, I just admit.  The letter from "Master Lock" was a devious... and, admittedly, successful attempt to push this LPL video past the two minute mark. Quite a feat for a Master Lock!
It was the postmark that gave it way, wasn't it? You can't fake that, folks!
Masterlock actually has supreme-tier engineers working on those locks. They implemented a weather cover to slow down the picker.
For a second I thought they just didn’t send a lock. THAT would’ve been the ultimate troll.
you should have waited until april fools day lol
Mfw lockpicking lawyer loses his mind and becomes lockcutting lawyer
It should have had a John Cena certification of real invisibility instead of camouflage.
Very amusing!  Well done to the instigator, a thorough job!
do you accept locks from the UK i have one il send you i have spent hours on ?
Bwaaaaahaaaaaa!
Nice letter MasterLock. One small issue;  *wave rake pick attack *
Wait hold on, he didn’t even pick anything wtf…
I couldn't see it, could you make it a bit easier to see?
Great joke lmao
Approved by director, but is the director as good as LPL?
Master Lock… more like Master Joke
Their website says; "High security, rekeyable 5-pin cylinder with spool pins is virtually impossible to pick". Maybe they should hire someone who has watched an LPL video to pick it for them
An empty box would have been funnier.
when you sell those tools i hope you require from people some proof that they are in locksmith business, otherwise you just help the thieves.
The good thing about Master locks is that you don't have to throw them away if you lose the keys. Because they are step one in the raking tutorial.
oh no, thats so sad to see
hidden? challenge? BS
where is the lock??
Ha! Gotcha! That was just a 'fake bait' lock. The real camouflaged lock is still in the box, you just haven't found it yet.
I wonder why won't some actual lock producer get in contact with you to get some recommendations, paid of course, by you to build real secure locks. You already gave recommendations for free in prior videos and showed up the weaknesses of some locks. Often, you told, that improvement won't be as hard as it seems. Sure, improvement will cost money and the already produced locks are then worthless, bit it will never change, if no one takes the first step. I like your videos with your explanations and really see forward to the next one.
I can't open my master lock that fast with a key.
After watching a few of LPL's picking vids I conclude that locks are 'just a suggestion' to keep the casual snooper/opportunist out of stuff. That said, I know lock picking is a skill that takes time and tools to make it look easy.
Please create a kit with tutorial, tools and lockers and the level so we can buy
Do you ever pick any that is locked up to a door, chain on a piece of equipment,boat trailer, anything real world that would be locked up.
Im sure the one guy spend the budget on something alse 🤣
I dont know how he does it! He picked an invisible lock! Simply incredible work this man does!
Top tier shitpost
Well, to be fair.... LPL did not pick this lock. He raked it.
Wait what are you picking? I can’t see it
I was thinking to myself "3 minute video? Must be a challenge." Then proceeded to watch him read the letter for 2 and a half minutes
Too bad they didn't included a lock. Looked funny to watch you pick thin air, though!
I'd be a funny camouflage if the lock was the color of LPL's desk😅
Reading that letter I was fully expecting a shackle that was sticking out of a ball of cement
I don't think there was an impersonator.  I think LPL sent the letter himself.
Seeing eye dog?? Have I missed something here?!
Good night and stay away from master lock. ;)
How did you pick a freestanding shackle? There's not even a cylinder....???
“Let’s make sure it’s not a fluke”  … no one thinks it’s a fluke 😂
Sad day for master lock
Masterlock locks are a joke. I teach people to pick, and we start with those, and in about 15 minutes someone who's never tried picking a lock before can get them open
Try picking your nose
I have been a lock picker for like 1 year maybe a mite more I pick all of master locks and I now use them to rain others before we move to harder locks like abus
Lmao it would've been funny if they just sent the letter with an empty box
as an engineer there's no lock i can build that’s LPL proof!
It would've been more funny to include no lock at all and pretend that it was still included... but just really good camo!
I don't understand. There was no lock in this video.
Still don't see no padlock. What to do?
I thought they were just going to send the letter with no lock.
High marks to whomever penned that letter… apparently one of my neighbors here in the IE. 🥇
Too funny
Pink tape was a good idea.
Wait, did he pick a lock this video? I couldn't see it.
Would be cool if it was an invisible lock... That was not included in the package.  Or "as strong as the weakest link"... Maybe a chain that goes in a loop. Very high security!
It would have been even funnier if it was just a regular Model 3
Wow, challenge took less time than reading the letter...
should have sent nothing. you cant pick it, if you cant see it.
Why'd they even put a lock in the letter? Just put nothing in there and say it's invisible.
Left your channel on for my parents, ruined em. lol.
Master Lock: We challenge you!  LPL: Oh no...  Also LPL: Anyways
Yeah, you may say you've picked it. But I didn't actually see a lock, so.
I half-expected John Cena picture on the lock.
That was hilarious! I have new found respect for Master Lock. They should have sent you a pair of reading glass for your now bad eyesight!
That's the real life equivalent to the internet's "You must be 18 to access this website".
I was expecting it to not include a lock... thus, being "impossible" to find.
Savage
LOL WOW
Where the fuck is the lock? All I see is pink sticker floating in the air.
that pink tape made me laugh so hard ... oh god
Masterlock's sense of humor is.... interesting.
great and clever joke. And a really well written corporate type letter-
Your gonna get alot more of these joke locks now
I was expecting him to accidentally tear the pink tape from it and lose it somewhere under the desk :D
I like to think masterlock uses a different company's locks on the doors to their buildings and headquarters.
That was interesting, fun.
master lock on suicide watch
What lock?
It would have been funny if they sent someone else’s lock with the name crossed out and master lock written on it.
Wow! You are just up the road from us in Rockville. Love the content - keep it up!! Do you think you could do Maryland proud and pick a nice crab for us?
Now that's security by obscurity!
Misleading title and thumbnail
Master Lock : " ... hahahaha , we , at Master Lock Company challenge you to op ...  ?!? "
I really like that LPL reads with his finger. Absolutely legend no doubt, and there's no shame in using a finger, but I still like the humanising result.
So you do read your snail mails..... hmmm....... 🤔
😊🤣😂😋😉🤫
aww, i was so hoping that letter was from a legit company rep being funny for april fools or whatever
HA!! Love it!
I imagine they intended this to be posted a month from now on April 1st
It wasn't even from master lock watch till the end
–wow he finally took more than two minutes for a video –spends 2 minutes reading and 30 seconds with the lock
Shute ive been using a paperclip on masterlocks since i was 12.
Shamless advertising for masterlock
Master Lock: *Issues a challenge* LPL: "I'm gonna ruin this man's whole career."
Like my dad always said. "Locks are for keeping honest people honest." If  a thief really wants to get into your shed or steel your bicycle or whatever it is. They really are gonna do it.
Idk if its funny that they know their locks are bad or if it's sad they don't care about fixing it
Master Lock President: There is no way he'll pick our lock now. LPL: I'm about to destroy this man's whole career.  Edit: after seeing the length of the letter and the length of the video I also honestly thought LPL was gonna look at it funny and have it open itself.
maybe they should send him a lock without a cylinder. then it's unpickable!
This is my favorite video thus far! Lpl is so fucking cool!!!
The John Cena of padlocks
hahahahahah great share
What are Cover Tin Struments, anyway?
I’m starting to think layers of duct tape are safer than locks
Ooooh my God, this is brilliant.  roooofl
I fully expected an empty box. "Camouflage!"
Master Lock is the Joe Biden of the lock world.
New kind of skill? Air picking?
They could at least have fitted special pins for this one 😅 ... At least they're honest
I thought that he will get "invisible" lock. :)
Masterlock Stonks plummet
A novice first timer using a raking attack can open a Master Lock.  That was the first thing I did when my son gave me a pick set for Christmas.
I was half expecting there to not actually be a lock with the letter because of it being "invisible." Can't pick what doesn't exist, oOoOoOoo
😆 Good laugh. 👍🏻
Your laugh is infectious! 😂
Most of the budget was spent on beer I guess.
The high that guy must be on what wrote that letter...
If your going to try to fool someone with letterhead, at least use a 90GSM paper or higher lol :D
What is he picking? Looks like he is holding air
At the Master Lock vault where they keep their profits: "click on one, click on two..."
Reading the long a$$ intro letter took longer than the challenge...someone pls give this guy a proper lock to pick😂😂😂
Wait until he finds the Mastur-Lock Chastity Belt
Picklocker : A good picklocking is fast. Master lock : Lets add a long letter to slow them down.
Master lock has left the chat
Plot twist: it was a legitimate challenge
Ñ
immagine how much locks he has in his toolshed. It's robably ridiculous
All I could see was a piece of pink tape floating around in mid air. Impressive conceelment measures from master lock!
Plot twist, it’s actually from the desk of the CEO
I really want to know what kind of locks he uses in his house so I could buy the same
Master lock is the bomb Aint nobody bustin that lock
You should have saved this for April 1st!
Ayyyyyy chino California gang
You should add a stopwatch in post that counts how long it takes to pick. Like a counter pops up and starts counting as soon as you start raking, and stops when the tumbler tumbles. [03.59s] Or something
personally, I would've made the camouflage joke, and then just not include the actual lock in the box
The funniest implication here is that this team of “finest engineers” pulled one over on their “OuTsIdE tHe BoX” CEO - they took their “generous budget” and went to Cabo for a year, after slapping a cheap camo coating on there!! So many layers to this joke! The pink tape probably was the icing on the cake though.
I legit thought that there just wasn't even a lock included in the letter because it was so well camouflaged
Click bait.
I still don't see a lock.. Just see a metal hook that the LPL is moving around and opening and closing it..
I'm thoroughly disappointed in the lack of jokes about security through obscurity.
Am I the only one that thought this was that guy who would pick master locks really fast then make fun of master lock
I have to admit that after you read the letter about the innovative "camouflage", I was hoping there just was no lock in the package.
Didn't know you were in Damascus! I'm in Monrovia.
That's the way I would pick my door lock as a child.
That was hilarious
I would’ve just attached a mirror to the lock so he wouldn’t of been able to pick it on camera lol
This man spent more time opening the letter than he did opening the lock :D
Where is the lock? I couldn't see it.
Hello Mr LPL, If Fluke made a locking AVO meter, how would you explain opening it a second time...it´s a Fluke..😂😂 Cordialement,
What is a security pin
Why is the letter sent to Damascus?is it my eyes or wha?
Unbelievable. No comments today
Best thing now is a single use self welding lock so you have to break/cut the lock.  That's the only way I can think of deterring the LPL.
That letter can’t be real, some 14 year old with too much time on their hands 😂
I've got a hell of an innovation, in that my master lock is so rusted that I have trouble opening it with the actual key, so best of luck with that one
I think we learned a long time ago that LPL is a savage.
I thought this was real until he showed the lock
Great fun 😄
Yeah that letter is too long. Corporate don't care that much
Ah yes, Masterlock: when you want to secure something and a stick of half-melted butter is not an option.
Isn't this technically forgery of some sort?
I can always tell how difficult each lock will be based on the video time and on this i was laughing before i even saw the lock 😂
3min video for opening the lock within seconds 😂
time for the digital lock with eye ball recognition and detonation security explosive
I can't say I searched, but, is a turn dial combination master lock better than the keyed counterpart?
LPL: so anyway I started picking and in 10 sec opened it XD love it
Dang. Woulda been even funnier if they hadn't included a lock XD
You just like saying the word fluke
DID THEY USE THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION DEFINITION OF "generous budget "? Which for us veterans is a swift kick in the nutz
I was sure that there was not going to be a lock at all lol
Love it👌🏾
damascus? thats awesome! I'm also a lawyer from damascus! great videos!
"You can't pick it if you can't find it." - Genius
But, what if they had put some superglue into the keyhole?... Missed opportunity to troll lpl.  Lol
I was expecting they didn't put a lock. I mean, it's camouflaged, you can never know where it is...
I'd like to see a lock you can't pick
I was expecting the old punk trick of filling the lock with superglue thus forcing the owner to cut it off
This is absolutely hilarious
This seems like a poorly executed publicity stunt by master lock but ended up making them look bad.
I expected to see you pick a lock.  All I saw was a couple stainless steel tools moving around.  I mean, where was the lock??  You are silly.
Next they will send you a video of the president jumping off a building because you picked that lock so fast.  😂
WOW! And it’s not even April first…
This was a magnificently sassy video to start my morning with hehehe
“Emotional Damage”
That was great!!
Was this for real???
You should try to pick a rusty Master Lock. A key won't even open them
They should have printed the text "This is not a lock" on the lock. Would have totally worked.
We need to update his status to lock picking president.
While funny, I'm most worried that you maybe outed (without any detail but at least with a paper trail) someone whom Master Lock might try to sue.
that is such good parody writing, its so believable haha
just free advertisment
😂😂🔐🔓
There's an address and phone number on that letter. I wonder if it really was them or not.  Either way, might as well be a joke with that epic fail of a lock.
"Let's do it one more time just to make sure it was not a fluke" STOP HE'S ALREADY DEAD!!!
You're in Damascus, Maryland!?  Really sound more like New Jersey or Philly.
It ain't even April
His vision is based on challenges.
And no, it's not a fluke!
Rebranding required.  "Might be a Lock"
I'm starting to be annoyed at the video length.  As soon as I start a video it's over.  Good portrayal of LLPs skill, but not very entertaining.
I wonder what's lpl gonna come up with on april fools
Master Lock stole my idea! I actually already invented an entirely invisible padlock over five years ago. Now this next bit is a little embarrassing...
I was hoping for Predator style camouflage :D
I have a lock you can't pick (It is covered in cement)
1 year to produce that lock that is not a lock
One year of work by Master Lock’s finest engineer for 60 seconds worth of content in this YT channel
Master locks challenge, please try to cease AND desist
"Sent me a challenge" Video isnt even 3 minutes long.  Oops and oof.
Thats hilarius
I’m confused, all I saw was a pink piece of tape. Where was the lock? Can someone explain what’s going on?
Lol I love these videos
i love you attitude. and i love you not can be bride to say what the industry just want you to tell us. thanks from denmark, we pay about 150$ for 10 min work if he have to come, but not any more in my family.  i have some questions, where can i get some answers from you for that? i will pay for the time you use on me..
It took 4x longer to read the letter than picking the lock haha
LockPickingLawyer is that guy in Dyinglight who is using the same lock pick from the start of the game…un-upgraded.
I wish the video was just 30 minutes of LPL trying to find the lock before giving up 😂
I expected a lock wrapped in layers and layers of duck tape.
I love how he followed it with his finger like he was getting us to read it with him 😂😂
Should have saved the video for April Fools day.  Thumbs up anyway.  Hope you actually have something better for April Fools.
The pink tape on the padlock was comedy genius. Thanks!
Hope is not a strategy.
I was hoping they just never sent a lock with the letter at all 😂😂
Nice, the spam bots have learned to copy comments now.
There are Two types of People in the world, ones who thought the Lock was going to be covered in Cement, and others that thought there would be no lock.  *Or rather, a see-through lock where they forgot to make the insides See-through too.*
I was expecting an empty box. Haha
See the challenge should have been "find a master lock that can't be picked"  Still looking...
I guess if MasterLock can keep selling their isht, then they don't care how easy their locks are to pick. It's just a number$ game in the end.
shit most of the time you dont even have to pick a masterlock...just kick it off or swing at it with a hard object
I lived in a suburb with the 8th highest rate of burglary in the country for about 10 years. We never got robbed. My secret defences?. I left the front door unlocked at all times when nobody was home. People think its a setup so bail lol. Especially when its hidden from the street due to a courtyard. All of the back fences were quite high though which meant you had to leave via the front yard. We did have a hairdresser at the end of the street enter our house, looks at the work and emergency contacts board as you enter the house, called me on the home phone to say the dog was out and about on the road so they have placed her inside the house lol. Funny times!
Kudos to the cockroachie who wrote this fake letter 😁
This gives me an idea- attach a letter to the lock so that the picker is tempted to read it doubling or even tripling how long it takes to pick the lock!
Plot twist: master lock just sent this to him to fix any vulnerabilities with their new product without having to pay someone
You just destroyed masterlock. Ill give them 1 year before they file bancrupcy😂
What we learned today. LPL can pick locks with astounding ease, and in crazy short amounts of time.  He also still has to follow words with his finger to read.
A camouflage body with a bright chrome shackle so you can see it if it drops to the ground outside. 😂
I love how it was more of a roast than a challenge
Those employees are suffering, you MONSTER!!!
It's bad when it took him 3x longer to read the fake challenge than to pick the real lock.
It's like this. Locks keep honest men honest. Nothing will stop a determined and experienced thief.
LPL, natural resistance to garter belts
Why is there a pink sticker floating in the air?
Do you answer the questions we put below?
WARNING, there's a tracking device in the lock. It was a trojan horse, theyre coming for you! RUN
This was hilarious! Whoever sent the letter is quite funny
XDDDD
Just realized he is from my town, or at least the PO box is.  Wonder if I know the LPL!
I think I know the tiktoker who would do this lol
I really don't understand why do they bother. :)) There is clear that THERE IS NO SHAME in selling this type of products to the mass public. "take their money!" they said
Thats why i have no locks on my doors. If they cant find a lock to pick, the cant break in. Big brain
Until I saw the lock I was expecting that LPL was shipped a box filled with peanuts and nothing more... just to see if they could make him look twice  ;)
ahem ... sorry for Master Lock, really. Hope it was a disguised joke. Altough i don't think it was.
"innovation", they just painted the lock !
I needed that laugh today. 👍
Modern locks today dont even have the options to picklock. I'd never buy a lock where you use a key lol
I wonder if Master Lock is watching this ? and if they dare to send you a "specially made" lock for you
You can't pick it if you can't find it! Total Joke! Really sad that the Master Lock company which so many trust with their valuables has not improved their locks after all these years. Especially after all your demonstrations of accessibility. I hope a real employee sees this video and takes some action.
I get the letter is a joke, but is this an actual lock somebody sells or some fan art?
Next time send big letter 😂 , longest thing about video was latter reading
Not sure if you're the best lock picker in the world, but you're certainly the best lock picker on any social media platform.
_"[...]and a wave rake[...]"_ You really like utterly humiliating locks, don't you?
The challange with masterlock is NOT accidentally opening it with random stuff found on ground
Why were you faking a pick on that bare shackle?
Rekt.
Master is the brand of lock I look for when I want to secure my shitty lawnmower in my flimsy tin backyard shed. Their reputation is safe.
This is great lol
Trolled by the video length 😂
I would love if this was actually from Master 😂 Whoever did this, brilliant 👏
security through obscurity does not mean camouflage.
and with a rake
Man you are awesome
Sent a month and a week too early.
What about the 3d printed unpickable lock?
I think he is slipping trying to convince us that that U shaped piece of metal is a lock.
All I'm saying is, if this is truly from masterlock I'd support them for the troll alone lol
Plot twist: The letter was actually legit
Lock Picking Lawyer is savage maybe Master Lock should hire you as a consultant to advise them on making a more pick resistant product.
They sent you 2 locks, you haven’t found the other one yet 😂
😂
"Now, let's see if my seeing-eye dog can pick this Master Lock. _jiggle jiggle click!_ And he's done it."
Imagine oicking an invisible lock. Next level content
LPL could rake is way into my girlfriend's dms
all I see is a piece of pink tape floating in the air and he  kind of points at it with the wave rake.
Perhaps you could invite yourself in to Master Lock's headquaters and return the lock.
WWAAAAAAVVVEEEEE RRAAAAKKKKEEE
"it's weakest link" Apparently, 1st grade grammar isn't their strong suit either.
Clever advertising
This would have been even funnier if they didn’t actually send a lock.
I wish the real master lock company would create something to try to challenge him....it would be hilarious to see a real challenge so we could see them embarrass themselves when they're actually trying to make something strong 😂
I'm incredibly disappointed, with a year of time and considerable budget they managed to coat a normal lock in camouflage. This is just disappointing, a company that specializes in making locks has this as their best, a cumulation of a year's work, meanwhile a random youtuber with next to no knowledge about locks manages to make a completely new design that actually causes some trouble in far less time than it took masterlock to camouflage a lock.
95 seconds after starting, and he just finished reading the letter. This is gonna be DEVASTATING
Am I the only person who Googled the address, only to find it is actually the Master Lock headquarters?
I still can't find the lock
As far as I can tell the only people that watched your videos were there legal team.   No one in the team meetings ever brought you up.
I’m willing to believe it’s not a fluke the first time but I always laugh every time you say it.
this lock only work in nature XD
I've always wondered if adding additional sets of pins to make a 3 or even 4 sided key would make picking it harder? Would that be feasible? Would it work? Or would it be a significant cost and complexity increase for a trivial increase in difficulty?
They thought outside the PO box and slowed you down drastically with their letter :)
Maybe if the cemented it.
It literally took you longer to read the letter than it did you open the lock.
He might have picked the lock, but i believe due to the high camouflage of it, it took him 2 to 12 days to find it just in the box. So no thieve could pick it in time at all. This is indeed a masterpiece.
Just curious, how would you design a lock that would be hard to pick?
With just three tools I can pick any lock flawlessly  Tool 1: oxyacetylene cutting torch  Tool 2: sledge hammer   Tool 3: 12 gauge
LPL inserted the wave rake, I looked down to take a bite of my toast, looked up, and the lock was open. No joke. Just that fast.
Waiting for the cease and desist letter from Master Lock stating that this satire gives the impression that they care about the morale of their employees and you must therefore take the video down.
I was expecting a lock with no keyway, just a block of metal with a shackle.
I'm confused.  Why is there a piece of pink tape floating above those lock picks the LPL was waving about?
I guess someone got inspired by Jorel's brother camo shorts XD
In case this is a real Master Lock letter I guess some of those "engineers" will be fired quickly!!
Bwahahahahahahahahahaha
I opened a padlock with a bobby pin when I was a kid , because there was bobby pins everywherein the 70s. I found that a boby pin would open lots of padlocks , even Masterlock.
Where is the lock ? I don’t see it
Rather than wasting time reading the entire letter out, just invite people to pause the video and read it themselves. I expect most of your viewers can read.
Engaging comment
This has to be a joke. Wrong form of it's... Christ, still sad.
...when reading the letter took longer than picking the lock...well done Master Lock.
Free advertising, and we get a chuckle out of it. Win-win.
Clickbait
is there a lock you cannot open?
He can't keep getting away with it !
My favorite part of LPL videos is looking at the video length to judge just how garbage a lock is. It's usually pretty accurate.
That was great. Do you think that there might be a cypher in the letter? Seemed like some of the sentence structure .
I’m not too happy with that misleading title. Kinda disappointing to see that from you, actually.
honestly, when you read the part with the camouflaged lock, i thought they  (i also thought it's actually from the MasterLock) didn't sent anything so you could not pick it.
I want more tongue-in-cheek humorous letters from the fan who sent you this posing as various other titans of industry to troll niche YouTubers. So much. I would watch TF outta that channel.
for christ sake can we get one video where theres a challenge in picking the lock :( so unsatisfying where every lock is the same aka a breeze.
That letter accomplished more than Masterlock ever could, it increased the time it took LPL to pick the lock, if uou include the time it took him letter.
Hahahahahaaaaaaa!
They thought if the lock had camouflage design on it you wouldn't see it
I see   LPL is more gentle with picking masterlocks  Mcnally just tries to shank them
is there a lock that you cannot pick, and why have you not created a lock that cannot be picked. In my understanding, the best products usually come from people who have the best knowledge on how to break such products.
Lmfao
This was hilarious! Funny letter!
😂🤣😂🤣😂👌
How can he see the lock I can only see the pink sticker the lock is too properly disguised
I have a kryptonite lock on one of my bikes, locked to a rafter in my garage. it's a blade key not a cylinder. what do I need to open it? (Besides a key)
Ok, I see the pink ribbon, but where is the lock?
Clearly the problem is that the cylinder wasnt camouflaged.
i don't think that anyone at all thinks it was "just luck" when you raked opened a masterlock.  no one at all needed that second opening to believe what they were seeing.
You know Mcnally mad as hell rn lol
I am very confused I didn’t see him pick anything
This guy must either be related to leslie neilson or be a huge fan because he has a way of delivering every line with absolute seriousness and dry wit of sorts.  “Seeing eye dog” i lost my sides with that one
The letter used the wrong “it’s”
😂😂😂😂😂
LPL: "we're gonna be using the wave rake" Me:  Ok so this lock is shit then.
Why do I love these videos so much?????????
Sorry, but... Why was that bit of pink floating around? I think your camera's broken.
can we take a moment to appreciate the person who sent this!
I was expecting a pinless lock so that you can't pick it
Gives a whole new meaning to 'security by obscurity'.
What the heck even is this lock
The fact that the letter wasn't with the text aligned bothered me so much lol what an amateur mistake
He just raked that lock with no hesitation and we are sitting here letting it just happen. Are we part of the problem?
I was hoping they had just sent a letter and an invisible lock :D
I thought the joke was going to be that it's so perfectly camoflaged that you can't see it, and in actuality they just didn't send a lock
This is probably the longest master lock video on the channel !
On a serious note - and I'd love a reply, how have they and other companies note just thrown money at you to either A, shut you up, or B, get you on or leading the RnD team - seriously if I was a CEO for these mobs you'd be in my office, willingly or via black vans.
I would've expected "no" lock, as in, the lock is completely invisible. But then LPL saying it isn't an issue and as you can "not" see, the lock has already been opened. Then demonstrates the empty table.
Would genuinely slow him down more to secure something with a bit of rope and a knot rather than these low end locks lol.
at this point just hire him as a security specialist,we could have better security with people like our lovely lockpicking lawyer
Ok so camo to defend against burglars. But what if i dont find my locks anymore...🤔
You have a seeing-eye dog? SHOW US THE PUPPY!!!
Just give him a loop of thick steel, the keys being an angle grinder and a welding machine
It's a shame this wasn't received on April 1st 😂 😂
It took you not even 2 seconds, that is so sad for the Master Lock company...
If only there was a way to make a pin-timer, where one any one pin is secured you only have about 1 second to secure all pins before the lock fails/resets... cuz who takes longer than a 1 second to insert a key?  After that just need some rake protection and a way to hide the timer.
You should have made the pink tape get lose and as soon as the tape is off the lock the lock vanishes 😂
LOL I thought the joke was gonna be that there was no lock in the letter. So LPL actually couldn’t find it.
The best of this channel... the comments section... best community EVER
This just seems beyond stupid
disc detainer locks (eg. abloy etc) is still best as it takes significantly more time and skill to open those :) cant rake em open in 1 sec...
Next time they send a lock that is welded shut 😂
This has to be a joke.... they would send you a letter and a piece of junk like that.
And that's another Hornets...First Down!!!
i am so embarrassed and i don't even work for masterlock
Everyone knows LPL's ONLY weakness is Ninjas.  Anything less and he's getting in.
Outstandingly well-handled. Any lock that LPL breaks out a rake for is going to be DOA, but at least this one managed to be amusing in the process, rather than merely being a sad example of locksmithing. I can appreciate a joke of a lock a lot more when a joke made with it.
Would have been even better with a pink zip-tie on the shackle, then letting it fall off when you opened it, then dropping the lock and exclaim that you suddenly lost it.
1 min left; "alright let's try to pick the lock"  'this isn't going to be good for them' lol
Lol letter was addressed from Wisconsin and postmarked California. Nice attempt whoever impersonating Master Lock’s president. Still funny though.
FUNNY
"I tasked our finest engineers with designing a lock that would be equal to your skill."  So they're tactfully saying your skill level is low. Joke's on you 😂
Damn ur fun to watch!!!
The second he found the lock it was wraps.
...employees at Master lock most definitely thought outside the box since they surely didn't upgrade the lock mechanism...xD
"as and a consequence..." I like how the human brain just sorts that one out, subconsciously.
"over a year ago" took a whole year to put camo on a lock I love this XD
That letter gave me a nice little chuckle.
LOOOL
All I see is pink tape 🤷
With all this concealment talk I half expected there to be no lock
That was a good laugh :D
man the comment section of LPL really is full of dad jokes... i fucking love it!!!
What you didn't know it both the paper and the lock have locks haha or well that's how i would of done it. Years ago i had the opportunity to do some old hand made puzzle pieces inlc a cabinet and the obvious was not always as it seemed
For a bit I was expecting there to be no actual lock lol
That letter was hilarious in so many ways! I honestly think Master Lock would be better off if LPL couldn’t see their locks at all.
They just liked your video and sent you a nice letter, no need to humiliate them like that
Security by obscurity. LOL
*LPL... What if there is really a lock in the letter??? He may have used invisible ink to draw a lock. Use UV light and if it doesn't work, then put the letter over a heat source to see if he used lemon juice or something like that. Who knows?*
The Wave Rake of Shame.
god I wouldnt want to work in Master lock's PR department. I cannot imagine the crisis management meetings over a lockpicking lawyer who constantly shats on ML's locks, under 3 minutes every time. Lol
LOL one of your best videos. Thanks to you and the "impersonator". Well done!
I really wish the writer of the letter had taken the opportunity to use the term "think outside the locks."
That is about what I would expect if it was real
WTF WERE THEY SERIOUS?
Master locks are rather ironically named
The line "as and a consequence" should have been a tip off
Ups !!! Master Lock moral its going down .... 👍😂
when you're seeing the wave rake and you already knew that this lock is done :D
Cement? Das conkreeet baybeeeee
Jerry needs that camo on his hummer
I noticed "Master Lock" spelled the possessive "its" wrong, by using an apostrophe even though there should not be. Therefore, the Master Lock president must have been on a business trip in Chico when he mailed the letter.
"This coating will ensure that you can't find the lock, as and a consequence, can't pick it": I don't think the writer graduated with sentence construction from college or wherever.🤯
*WAIT! He never showed us an actual LOCK! He just jiggled his tools in mid-air, without holding anything else... or, at least, I couldn't tell from all the foliage!*
After this, Masterlock is Mastergone
I couldn't see anything. WTH was he picking at?!?!?!
your remembering that the first of april is still a bit away right? I get a feeling it was supposed to be for that.
So next time just tape a letter to your door so it took a little longer to break in.
jokes aside disguised locks do work, if you can't find the lock how do you defeat the lock?
Nice self sent fake mails.
would have been better using a roll of duct tape. LPL struggles to get that sort of security open! ;o)
I have a feeling there's a lock inside the lock.
This is NOT Masterlock.
MS word letter head.  Ha basic scam/trick attempt I did better in high school for sure.
It took LPL longer to read that letter than picking the lock 🤣🤣
Also funny would have been the box being empty.
I can see Masterlock HQ right now mouthing along to "just to make sure it was not a fluke"
I honestly think just wrapping a lock in layers duct tape so itd be hard to cut would take more time to pick
When the rake comes out, the lock only has mere seconds before being forced to surrender.
I had a master lock for use on a boat hatch. It was very old and janky to open it you just had to yank hard whatever no matter the combo.
Mmm not Aprils fools day??? Mmm I'm confused hahaha
lol lol 😄
Keys in Car Car Locked LPL: Opens Car LPL: Closes Car LPL: Let's do it again to see it's not a fluke LPL: Opens Car
Sigh...it's never a fluke.
Nice video, what were you picking there though? I saw some floating piece of pink tape, but I didn’t understand what else was going on 🤔
Masterlock should have made a lock that's just a piece of metal block shaped like a lock. No cylinders, no pins, no keys, nothing. Can't open something that doesn't meant to be opened.....
0:52 lowkey expected literal cement in the lock
But seriously, where is the comment saying 'this was me' lol? This guy must be playing the long game
Fake letter
When he said it took his seeing eye dog a while to find it, I Lost. My. Mind.
Dear President of Master Lock®, *its With dearest love and respect, The Grammar Police
whats up with the floating shackle and core?
So you mean to tell me my letter box is not safe?
LPL should have a grading scale like Michelin stars, that way good locks could resurface and lpl will even get paid for it
Id still like to think was from an employee thats disgruntled with their employer that sent this.
Is that actually as easy as he makes it look or is it just because he's really good at what he does?
When I was learning to read as a child I used my finger to help me read. That stopped at the age of 7 😂😁👍👍👍
Next week, master lock sends a offer letter to lpl to help them build an industry leading lock for a significant sum of money
Master Lockpick, Lawyer, and allegedly not very good at seeing things. Guys I think this man is daredevil...
A one sentence horror story  Your inside your home sipping a nice cup of coffee, when suddenly from outside you hear "nothing on one, 2 is binding-"
tbh I thought the lock was going to be painted the same grey as his table thus "Camoflaging" it
i thought it will be no lock at all - so to say the lock is "invisible"
I think it would've been more funny if there was no lock sent with the letter
Oh wow even with a pink tape it took me a while to actualy see it
When LPL was reading the letter, I was hoping he would actually have to try
It sounds like the engineers at master lock are dead fishes.
did he just rake open the air??
What lock? All I saw was a floating piece of pink tape!
why was I half expecting just a ball of duct tape while reading that letter.
How did you lock pick pink tape
"a generous budget" it seems only a photocopy machine and a silicone mold because there's no difference with other models except that silicone casing
this guy is awesome
Can't wait for April 1st!
What the heck where's the lock?
To make LPL videos last almost 3 minutes, include a letter he needs to read out.
When the rake comes out, you know there is gonna be devastation.
Wow! I grew up in Oak Creek Wisconsin.   I know exactly where that is.
Insert "Cease fire, stay back!" meme
Hello this is the lock picking lawyer and today we're gonna unlock a master lock with 20 different keys you'd normally keep on you.
the wave rake was disrespectful
Woulda been better if there where no lock to pick.  Due to its extreme camo.  Its completly invisible to the naked eye.  Ergo.  It didnt exist in the first place.  Lol
When i saw it was under 3min, I knew this is gonna be a slaughter.
You should start a comedy channel 😀👏
Just discovered your channel. Love it.  p.s pls don’t break into my house
I would have super glued the lock shut.   Lol
i though maybe its a lock without a keyhole :D
Master lock headquarters is 20 min from my house......
Best idea would've been not packaging a lock at all
PINK!
Any chance Masterlock would chime in on this thread?!? Lol
Somebody really knows what they're doing and some people who just decide to rake really quick can pick locks with relative ease.
LMFAO 🤣
Master lock ceo : “have £5, now use that to improve our lock” Employee: “5? Is that it? 🤷🏻‍♂️ get what ya pay for then. Just slap a camo rubber round it” Ceo: “wow! So innovative! This will surely stop any lockpicker seeing it in urban territory’s! Excellent work. This is why we’re the world leaders in overpriced padlocks and underpaid staff!”  P.s not an employee.
Most other companies and I'd 100% praise this, but some things are not to joke about when it comes to their effectiveness... like imagine a parachute company, or a fire alarm company, or a brakes manufacturer joking about this.  the effectiveness of a lock could possibly jeopardize the safety of you and your loved ones, or the security of your valuables and priceless sentimental belongings.  I like what they were going for, but as a lock company it seems slightly in bad taste.
Imagine the lock picking lawyer is so wholesome of a locksmith, he even picks the locks for the guy who god may refuse to let into heaven. Because he is the lock picking lawyer fears almost no lock and is an expert. But humble locksmith that is up to almost any challenge well except mrs lock picking lawyer every man’s pride, respect and biggest fear is sometimes the ones you never think, love does work in mysterious ways a mystery best left locked if I do say so myself.
When the wave rake comes out you know the lock’s got 5 seconds tops
With a wave rake no less. Masterlock will never financially recover from this.
It took him longer to read the letter than to open the actual lock.
hilarious
😂
All I saw was a letter, hands, and a floating pink tag.
This is a nice gag lock
I'd love to know if who sent the letter actually included a lock or if they leaned into the "It's so hard to spot that you literally can't see it" (cuz its not there.)
The only time the "sponsored" part is longer than the video and I don't mind
At this point, a camouflage + childproof lid is more of a deterrent than the actual lock for LPL
LMFAO! HAHAHA
How did you find the key hole under the lid? It is camouflaged 😳
He keeps mentioning a lock but all I see is a half shackle with a piece of tape on it…  This man is even able to pick imaginary locks… no one is safe..
A good gag might have been a cardboard box with a false bottom, so you could feel the lock rattling around in the box but couldn't see it
I really could help them make a better lock than that it's simple really 4 key design the first 2 remove parts to expose 4 key holes that need to be filled and turned in set orders that is a resettable lock as well so you could change it if wanted
Thanks. Now I can finally find the missing camo lock my brother and pick it open to get back my stuff
Heads are gonna roll!
Man these companies should be ashamed..
Try Granit locks, bet you can't pick that
Tomatoanus viewers also watch this
as he pulls out the tiny camouflaged lock Im saying to myself "hes gonna rake it isnt he" as he pulled out the rake
"Think outside the lock" would've been great
598 Masterlock employees disliked this video.
This was terrible.
i think this is the longest video featuring a masterlock, they most be doing some thing new
🤣🤣🤣LPL you made my day thank you !
The pink tape itself is millions miles more innovative than Master lock's lock itself
BURN!
Man, I am SO looking forward to LPL on April 01, 2022 !
Anyone heard any updates or know anything about Bosnian Bill n lock lab?
FAKE!!!!! I never even saw a lock. The camo was too good
Those master locks are extremely pick resistant! Why pick it when you can rake it open
So all these locks are basically useless...
I’m going to buy a master lock!
The G.O.A.T.
Reports says Several Master Lock Employees Spontaneously Combusted while watching a YouTube video.
Master Lock must be on something. That was the worst challenge ever.
Oof.... Dear Master Lock Employee... *You need to apply water to burned area*
Brilliant
90% reading the letter 5% advertisement for covert instruments 1% picking the lock 1% picking it again 3% outro
LPL just destroyed master locks in their final form... savage
camo lock with shiny steel shackle. good dezzin
Hilarious
i stopped buying Master locks a long time ago, lol
I know you say you're picking a lock.... but where is it . All i see is pink ribbon and picks.
*Master Lock CEO is a literal manchild*
I expected a duct tape joke hehe
Ambush marketing lessons.
NGL I expected this to go to the other Lockpicking youtuber that is known for hating Masterlock
McNulty WAS THIS YOU!?!?? LoL
Hiden mesege?
They did their homework. That is the address of Masterlock World HQ.
Lol
I see 2 people who have a sense of humour, as a Brit I appreciate that 🤣👍
You know, I imagined that MasterLock would not really be fond of communicating with LPL due to his. um. colorful reviews. However, its nice to see that they're taking it REALLY well on a corporate level and lean into the fun! Impressive :) Edit: 2:50 o lmfao
So was there any lock at all, because video ends without showing the lock...
Some say he is still laughing
All they needed was to ask Stuff Made Here smh
So what have we learned? Master lock is the  master of shitty products, not locks
That's how we used to open the lockers at school
Yeah, thanks for the laugh. I laughed to the point of tears when it said "find the lock". lol
“Now let’s do that one more time to make sure it was not a fluke” It was not a fluke, it’s NEVER a fluke.
There is no bad publicity
That military grade lock stood no chance
That one might have stumped the blind among us if they had thought to camouflage it in braille.
Really thought this was just going to be an "invisible" lock
This letter is most likely legit, considering the twisted perspective of Masterlock company.
Still waiting to see a good lock and chain setup for bicycles. What if you have one of these newfangled electric bikes that cost stupid amounts of money, is there something to keep it safer?
As someone who knew a few Masterlock employees back when I lived in Oak Creek, the level of security on that lock is no surprise to me 🤣
The pink tape killed me 🤣. This guy has a great sense of humor.
I so wish this were real. My estimation of Masterlock would go up if they actually did such a thing.
Oh no!! Not the wave rake.
I appreciate the fact that someone committed identity theft for this joke.  That's commitment.
NGL, was hoping for some wet paper wrapped around a chain
Masterlock is probably joking with you. That lock sucks.
I used to live a mile away from them and I would still never buy their locks for anything important
It took more time to read the letter, takeaway, instead of lock use letter
what lock did he open? i only saw the metal bit...
should've kept this one for April fools day XD
Really hoping you read this comment as I see you haven’t made a video on the subject. Is it truly possible to open a lock with a match? How does it work? I’d love to see you do a detailed video on this.
200 IQ Advertisement strats
Why is LPL just giggling his lock-picks near a pick bit of pink tape?
bodied
Where is the lock? Why you picking at air?
in other words, master lock isn't changing anything about their locks.  LOL
Lol 😂 don’t use a pick use it pretty smart to me lol 😂
I came here for lock picking video, not letter reading video, which this is.
:)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
This guy is seriously a Matrix character. He can break into any system.
How interesting I live in Chino CA. I wonder if it’s anyone I know 🤔
LPL: picks into the white house LPL: gets sentenced to 5 years in prison LPL: picks his way out of prison LPL: gets sentenced to one more year in prison for trying to break out LPL: picks out again
Master lock needs to change their name
Wait, LPL is from Damascus? Small world.
Why isn't lock picking in video games this easy? XD
LOL I thought they would have just not sent you a lock just to mess with you.
i’m not entirely sure how you managed to pick open a floating piece of pink tape but i’m not gonna question it
Note: The Genesis lockpick set is sold out. Matter of fact, a lot of the supplies on the website are sold out. Must be a COVID thing and people are bored having turned to picking locks to pass the lonely hours of COVID-19 isolation. That said, when are the products going to be back IN STOCK?
Does anyone know if he has tried picking a KnoxBox?
That was pretty good kudos to the LPL fan that thought this up
At least they are game….sort of…
_MIGHT the Letter is a joke ....._ _Locks from MATER are sure a joke_
Does Masterlock exist for any other reason than to be humiliated by this guy anymore?
Cheapest product placement ever! 😐
a MasterKey is a key that opens every lock while a MasterLock...
Next venture for Master Lock slash resistant bags
Oh boy can't trust Master Lock anymore, as their "letter paper" is not even locked away properly
Master lock is awesome.
it still comes down to locks are just there to keep honest people honest
"This is the LockpickingLawyer, and I've just received a letter from the president." For some reason this didn't surprise me at all even before he said "of Master Lock."
The name "Master Lock" comes from the history of any and everyone being able to easily "Master" picking them. So if any of you reading this wish to become good at picking, by all means start with a Master Lock. Consider it the Kindergarten of your lock picking education.
So FUNNY!!!!
Lol!  LPL picked the lock TWICE in less time than it took to read the fake letter!  MY MAN!👍
Man I was thinking of sending you my girlfriend, see how you do with her belt buckle I've had no luck. But after going on a watching spree with your videos, I know it will be no match for your skills and I might end up girlfriend less.
Guys I don't get it he just stabbed air next to a floating piece of pink tape, can someone explain.
This lock is amazing. The video is less than 3 minutes long, and the Lawyer manages to read a full letter, find the almost invisible lock, make a joke about not losing it anymore with the pink tape, plug the genesis set on his shop, and then pick it TWICE before the outro. Truly a master lock.
Are they trying to look bad?
😂🤣😂 absolute quality!
I 100% expected it to just be the metal locking coupling without the body at all 🤣
Ouch!!!
This would have been 100x funnier if they didn't include a lock at all
Hey, you just stole that lock from John Cena!
Does it matter if you pick from the top or bottom
Emotional damage
Someone is about to get fired...
Next time, they need to send you binders with a 400 page letter, then they can claim it took days before you could pick it
My genisis set will be here tmmrw! Woohoo!!!
I don't even understand what they tried to do?? like what did they really expect? lmao
I hope you don't visit my Lock's 😅
Those knucklehead viewers 😂
I thought it was just gonna be a lock with the shackle welded shut
😅😅😅
This was a well done spoof and an amazing video :D Thank you, mystery person AND LPL HAHAHAHA
Until master lock comes up with a product that requires the special tool that Bosnian Bill and LPL came up with, master lock will never be worth their weight in steel, aluminum, or brass
It seems like a wire bread-tie would provide more security.
"let me tell you a joke... Master lock" "lmao"
Gotta love how LPL takes a joke hahaaha
"Please state the nature of the Medical Emergency." I don't know about everyone else but every time I watch one of these videos I expect to hear that phrase somewhere along the way.
it would be funnier if they just sent the paper without even a padlock
An embarrassment to Milwaukee… 🙈
How was it a improvement exactly?
Interesting timing of this letter. David Youn was put in place as new CEO of masterlock in mid 2020. He specializes in turning companies around.
100% a Troll.  87.2% the way to god-tier Troll.  What gave it away was the last paragraph, went downhill from there....
Not even close to lpl lvl🤣😂🤣
Omg this is cold!
Quit using your finger to read.  👎.  We stop doing that in second grade
When the letter slows you down more than the lock itself…
OH NO NOT THE WAVE RAKE
they should have printed a john cina picture on it
When the letter said "Cement", I quite agree that would be the way to prevent or slow down LPL picking. Pour Cement in to the lock or put the lock in to Cement.
you only opened it cause you found it. you're not supposed to find it.
This is so sad.
The guy that sent you the falsified letter should be investigating for fraud and impersonating a multi million dollar company….
The letter was funny and all but did he manage to pick it in the end? I didn't see it
he wasted too much time reading the letter, so he just skipped the hard part to instant open 😂😂😂
💞💖☝️😂😂😂
would buy a Master Lock just to own a piece of comedy
perhaps a twist for your traditional master lock challenge would be to open lock that has has been exposed all week to below freezing temperatures (while still cold) without leaving any marks on it from violence.  Gotta love engineering tolerances.
Looks like someone's getting fired for sending you this lock
Whenever he pulls out a rake I know it's over
When he read out the line "our designers took the opportunity to cement Master Lock's reputation as an industry innovator", I was expecting a lock encased in cement!
Plot twist:  The packaging material was the true lock.
Just watched a video on YouTube on how metal pipes are clean very informative pretty interesting and it has 9 million views yet only 44,000 likes yet this annoying garbage video has only 1 million views and 70 something thousand likes which just proves the state we are in, people would rather watch and like bullshit cringy videos then actual informative videos about how our world works
You know the quality of lock when it takes the LPL more time to grab his tools than it does to actually open the lock....
If you buy a lock pack to a Fluke multimeter, then LPL can say it wasn't a fluke!
I'm about 40 seconds in why are you pointing at the words as you're reading, just read the f***** paper do 12-year-olds really need this? Fucking christ.. and the way you read it too it's like you're reading some super complicated situation to someone very slowly and methodically so they can understand everything you're saying but you're just reading a letter that everyone can see what it says anyways so don't point or read really slowly or like you're reading to a 5 year old
It's a pity the writer wasn't listening at elementary school when it came to the difference between 'its' and 'it's'.
That's so unfunny attempted at making this elaborate joke. It would be funny if he didn't send any locks, so he can't pick it. But of course he included "invisible" lock with camo skin just to ruined it.
Bro, they probably spent weeks on this, LPL spent 5 seconds on it and it's open. Funnily enough, the first lock I ever picked was a masterlock, 10/10 for beginners, 5/10 for home security.
that was a weird joke tbh
Is it... well... legal?
Oh shit. You're on MD. Nice. I am too. Severn area for me. Near Glen Burnie.
What locks do you recommend?  any trailer locks that you recommend?
The extra security was in the camouflage, you didn't show how your dog found it. Probably a fluke.
Well there's 2 locksmiths in town well was 2.
Maa Chod Diye bhaiya ji... 🔥🔥
wtf XD  emotional damage Xd
What lock, did he find it?
Shouldn’t have included that lock. The best way to counter LPL is to use no locks. He can’t pick it open if there’s nothing to pick to begin with. 5head.
I'm sorry could you please re-record this? I spend a lot of time reading wich has unfortunately damaged my sight a little bit and for the life of me I couldn't spot the lock. Perhaps zoom in a little more?
Wait, where's the lock? Why did he wiggle metal tools in thin air, and why was there just a floating pink tape?
Once the rake is out we know it’s game over….
I thought the end of the prank is going to be that there is no actual lock included - it is so well camouflaged that it cannot be found and thus cannot be picked :D
LPL, you're good!  Next Fall please come to my home and help me rake.
@LockPickingLawyer what will you say about McNallyOfficial?
masterlock impersonator? thats kind to be expected. i found its impossible for masterlocks to be offended by lpl because developers already know what they are doing.
LPL, can you directs me (us?) to one of your vids where it was a fluke?
Is that actually a Masterlock padlock? Looks more like a cheap Indian junk.
hahahha nice.
This is just hilarious
I don't get it. He was just clutching his hand and pretending to pick a lock. Is this an Early April Fools joke?
🤣🤣
lpl: (gets challenged by master lock) lpl: (laughs in inexcusable design flaw)
When he read out the line "our designers took the opportunity to cement Master Lock's reputation as an industry innovator", I was expecting a lock encased in cement!
You know it is going to be bad when he pulls out a wave rake...
"Master Lock" watching this video: "WAIT HE HAS A DOG? F****K!!!!"
if you see a less than 3 mins video you already know that this lock is not the best, especially when the first 2 mins is just reading
L.P.L.....L.P.L.....L.P.L.  STRAIGHT HARD HITTING THE GAME...LOL....KEEP IT UP
What he just put a rake in the air. Wheres the lock?
What a luck for Master Lock that the dog didn't open the thing.
I've been a fan of LPL for years but this was one of the most entertaining videos so far!
This is pretty funny lol
I just noticed yesterday that the masterlock products in the grocery store all say 'shim proof'  Somehow I doubt it.
Dude last time u couldn't pick a lock u just ended up cutting through a safe.. that's not lock picking buddy
Little does he know that this really was a letter from masterlock and there really is an invisible lock sitting on his desk.
So MasterLock is not secured from a lockpicker.
That lock is a fluke
The little piece of pink tape was a nice touch, that lock was hard to see
This is really funny LMFAO
Thumbs down
They should have painted the lock the color of his table.
I recently watched a ton of your videos. I was always told that locks only keep honest people honest.
took longer to read lol
The fact that half of this video is just reading the note cracks me up. by the time he's done reading the note I check the time and there's only 90 sec left in the video
Where was the lock?! All I saw was floating pink tape!
"The Office of The President" - Sounds so much like Trump, who doesn't want to lose that prefix for eternity... Or, is it from some disgruntled, former staff of one of Trump's residences, who flicked a lock for, maybe a side door...?
i have picked this lock before  confirm that it is this easy
Video 1419:  LPL: “Today, we are going to be breaking into the most secure vault in the US. Putting the wrench in, turn 1 , turn 2, there!”
I am imagining a product: Master Lock Pick Proof; Cementing our reputation.    It would be a bottle of CA glue.
Very confused here, I can't seem to find a lock anywhere in this video.
they trolled you for free advertisement.
So I just finished watching Mulholland Falls (1996 movie).  There's a scene where the 4 cops need to get past the locked padlock on a fence.  One wants to shoot it right away.  But, no,  the 2nd one has his rakes, picks, liche, etc and gives it a go at picking it.  Clearly it wasn't a Master Lock as he couldn't pick it and they were in a hurry. Nick Nolte gets his gun out and shoots it. Next you see them all driving down the road.
Padlock ?  What Padlock ?   I don't see any padlocks here.
Yeah, I'm with LPL, this was just some weird troll.
You need to have a fair test with the lock mounted to a stationary surface so that it would be in countered in the “wild”
Please make a video on converting traditional pins into security pins on cheaper locks to make it more secure. (At home, using files.) Thank you.
Mass resignation at MasterLock. Thanks to LPL. 🤣😂
In my head I thought you some how had to reveal the opening for the key on the lock.....
You are so good, I bet you don't worry about forgetting your keys to anything! Do you open your P.O. box with a key just to act like a normal person?! 😉
You got to admit - they do have humor.
Master locks prime market was the hunters that will buy anything camo. The hunters couldn't care less about security, if it's camo I gotta buy it for my hunting gear.
Well they literally thought outside the box
*If you can't see it, you can't pick it.* The only way masterlock could make a lock that LPL couldn't pick is if it was actually invisible 😂
Let's give Master Lock some credit here, without your seeing eye dog their ruse would have worked!
Great for PR
Whomever sent the letter..... Troll level up, to you sir.
FEBRUARY 20, 2022  I BRING YOU TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY,  IT WASN'T ALIENS, IT WAS JESUS CHRIST. BE NOT DECIEVED.  THE PRE-TRIBULATION RAPTURE WILL OCUR ON FEBRUARY 21 & 22, 2022, AD THE YEAR OF OUR LORD. IT WILL INCLUDING THE 144,000, CHILDREN AND GRAVES WILL BURST OPEN.   IT WILL HAPPEN ON FEBRUARY 21 & 22 2022, AD, THE YEAR OF OUR LORD.   THE GREAT TRIBULATION WILL BEGIN AFTER THE PRE-TRIBULATION RAPTURE WHICH IS GOING TO HAPPEN EARLY THIS WEEK.  "AND I SAW ANOTHER ANGEL FLY IN THE MIDST OF HEAVEN, HAVING THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL TO PREACH UNTO THEM THAT DWELL ON THE EARTH, AND TO EVERY NATION, AND KINDRED, AND TONGUE, AND PEOPLE, SAYING WITH A LOUD VOICE, FEAR GOD, AND GIVE GLORY TO HIM; FOR THE HOUR OF HIS JUDGMENT IS COME: AND WORSHIP HIM THAT MADE HEAVEN, AND EARTH, AND THE SEA, AND THE FOUNTAINS OF WATERS." - REVELATION 14:7
Not even close to funny
That's not a real letter, btw. Wouldn't be surprised if you get sued for impersonation now. Or at the very least defamation.  Also it's a lock that's been around for over a decade, btw. So if this was your thing for satire or whatever. It didn't work.
You dog found it because it smelled like bologna.
Master lock gotta send new locks
Honestly thought from the wording at first it was going to be inside a concrete block :P
was this like a joke by them or something?? has to be.
0:00 - 0:07 - <laughter!>  <runs to make popcorn>  This is gonna be good.  1:39 - I am not disappointed.  :)
I love the LPL’s shade
Ok this was glorious! Well done mystery viewer in making this "challenge" up and very well done LPL for taking the idea and running with it!
I don’t know why this channel was recommended to me but I get a kick out of seeing this guy pick these locks.
Is anyone ever gona make a lock with two key holes that need to be open at the same time? This would a gard challenge i guess.
Could you lockpick into my brain and open up some IQ?
“A wave rake…”
Reading the letter took up more than a third of the video.
Oh, BROTHER! The ends people go. LOL
Thief
I'll be putting a cover letter in front of my door as it seems to be more effective
LPL: robs bank LPL: puts all the money back LPL: let’s do it again to prove it wasn’t a fluke…
Jim Browning & LPL would be the most dangerous duo in the world.   JB: "That's a nice shirt. I'm outside your house." LPL: "Now let's see if we can't get past this lock."
wave rake is too good
LMFAOO😭
The letter slowed him down
Master Lock employees: 😞
it takes more time to lock it than to unlock it somehow
I love all the videos that you do is there a lock that I can put on my trailer that is  harder to pick because it looks like you just break into anything
I got the solution on how to build a unpickable lock. You put 6 keyholes on it, and you have 1 try to get it right, if you try to pick a wrong keyhole or try to cut the shackle the lock will explode... :D :D
*Can you test or explain people opening some locks with very strong magnets?*  there are some videos
I think it would have been funnier with no lock in the package at all. :P
Absolutely hilarious.  I do have to wonder what the actual Master Lock company thinks about this channel, particularly since the name Master is at this point a joke that can produce laughter if you say it to any amateur lockpicker.
That was sad to watch lol
When the wave rake comes out, the lock is toast.
Blasts them on main
Stop using just one key type, make a 🔑 with an barrel style colar.
The fact that it takes less time to pick Master Locks then to use the actual key shows just how much their locks are based on the honor system
Haaaaa 😄 Awesome !  😃👍
what pick set would you recommend for someone just starting
Most people don't have pink tape, though, so at least this requires specialized tools.
Lmfao!!
Took you 13 seconds, Advertisements included....
to be honest with the word cement in the letter I expected the lock to have been encased in concrete
LOL
Holy shit i have an idea for a less pickable lock. Lets just make the lip so long that his tools cant reach in to pick it
the wave rake was the exclamation mark on the punchline
The next upgrade from Master Lock will include two additional layers of camouflage. A picture of John Cena wrapped around a picture of Drax standing very still. He'll never find that one!
Big meme. Appreciate whoever sent this 🤣
What lock? I didn't see no lock! You're a fraud, LPL!
Seriously, you are crushing their morale.
I’ll say this again: you want to design some walks and sell them because it’s obvious. You have a gift and the attitude plus the stamina to deal with these locks. So what’s stopping you from designing your own lock and selling it?
😩😩😂😂
camera is way too close
What lock?
Ah, the rake. They're doomed.
Hi, have a question, can a Lishi 2 in 1 pick a Ruko 600 or 1200 system? and if yes what model can do it?
well doesn't matter doing illegal things will get you in jail in the long run so go ahead pick my lock see you in jail mfs
Haha yeah.. that was a good one 🤣
Phhh almost got me there, was thinking it must be april 1st 🤔😂
I would’ve laughed so hard if he went to pick the lock and there were no pins
I don’t get it, why was he stabbing the air
I wonder who sent him this, congrats on such a good idea XD
Halfway through the video and the lock hasn’t even appeared. This should be quick.
Why was I expecting it to be wrapped in john Cena faces?
He is the Lock Master
Wow, it took jiggling the rake? Master Lock really put their best in this!
LOL "it's"
I knew the second it was a Master Lock that the rake was coming out. Wasn't disappointed.
The mistake was engineering a lock equal to your skill rather than greater than your skill.
For many years, I thought that the 'seeing-eye' dog in Alice's Restaurant was a 'senile' dog ('guide dog' is the British version). This reminds me of that. Also, I love a camouflage joke.
That lock is to laugh at not secure anything. Maybe because it's camouflaged you won't be able to see it hence not pick it so easy
LPL: robs bank LPL: puts all the money back LPL: let’s do it again to prove it wasn’t a fluke…
Imagine if they didn't include the lock at all. You'd still be looking for it months later, thinking that you can't see it and it fell out of the package.
One year development they said.
as a beginner with the covert companion, thank you master lock for keeping my morale high. combing and raking are the only things i can do so far.
✅✅✅✅✅
Ill pick the locks with a pop can.... so easy
Who knew the secret of life was so simple?  Amos 5:4  This is what the LORD says to Israel: “Seek me and live;
I wonder how the president of masterlock is going to respond to this.
At this point you just destroy the keys that come with locks you buy for personal use because its faster to just pick the, huh?
Also... I expect a flurry of letters will now begin arriving to overload TLPLs postbox. All filled with witty bollocks.
When they said 'cement Master Locks reputation', I expected the key way to be superglued.
If this man was a criminal, it would be scary…
I love how expertly you discuss these locks and the processes used to open them. Could you show an example of what the security or spool pins do, and how they prevent the use of low skill attacks? It would be interesting to see how raking fails where single pin picking doesn't. Thanks! I love your videos!
They say you can find anything on YouTube...it's true! You came up on my homepage the other day for the first time. I never thought I would become obsessed / fascinated by lock picking videos. You are AWESOME! Very humble too! Thank for the content
I thought it would've been filled with cement or something :D
At this point,now I'm certain their brand is just a side contract to a larger conglomerate. Jokes aside,at least 4 pining chambers are way easier for pin swapping if you want to put others than standarts.
Riiiiight...  Now take the pink tape off, tough guy!!
Hahahaha.... this was definitely a prank.
I’m curious to how “generous” that budget was 🤔
i love how he pickes it in under 3 seconds 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh no, it's the wave rake :'D
He cannot be stopped and will not be silenced!
Oh noooo, he found it
The signature is interesting. You might say the person who sent this letter is a real dick.
I wonder if that lock was actually included with the letter or if the lpl just bought it to go along with the gag.
😛
Master Lock is total shit I'd never buy their products nor recommend them to anyone the company is a joke tbh.
If somebody would do a  bet with me and say who is going to Pick this lock the fasrest i would bet my lifesavings on u man i love your Videos btw
My brain does not like that pattern. lol I can clearly see that the lock is there but I have a very hard time focusing on it. Maybe it is just fatigue.
Why's he waving a shackle with pink tape on and raking at thin air?
Master Crock.
It probably took him more time to find the lock than to pick it
In Italy for that we sing: Parapparà parapparà paraparappappà, figura di merda!
I have an easy way to confuse the average lock picker. Make it so the lock turns the other way
LPL maybe you could show how easy it is to open a master lock using a bobby pin (hair pin) like they use as a staple of the 80's and 90's tv shows
LPL: robs bank LPL: puts all the money back LPL: let’s do it again to prove it wasn’t a fluke…
Hands down he is the Mister Rogers of lock picking.  It's a beautiful day in the lock picking neighborhood.  Can you open mine?  Will you open mine?
Keys: In car Car: Locked  This man: So you want to play this game, huh?
You might need to record this all I saw was a piece of floating pink tape
Took him longer to read the letter than open the lock LMAO
Putin has a lock on Ukraine.  Can you free them?
An “unpickable” lock clearly doesn’t exist
What Lock do you use for the safety of your belongings and property?
God damn it, he did it again.
Can you make one how unlock a chest lock type? If you dont know how are these tipe of lock just call me somewere to i  send you a photo
Secure disappointment
Thanks for making me sleep even better now that you have showed all the nitwits out there how to open locks. So much for protection of my personal property. It people like you who should be jailed for negligence.
Oh shit. You are in damascus MD 😂 that’s pretty close to my parents house.
He spend 2 min reading and explaining and 15 second to open the lock
This would have been a good video to post on 4/1/22
*Should a known LPL had Pink Tape handy* *His emasculated voice gives it away*
Not having your skills I've several times used a power saw to remove locks for female friends who have misplaced the key.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
I suppose the general take on using any over the counter padlock is that they're intrusion resistant but not really capable or intended to resist a determined attack particularly by a professional lock pick.
noticed grammatical error in the letter, not needed to know the letter is fake, but it adds to the "dead giveaway" attempt to impersonate.
Locking Picking Lawyer come to Wisconsin and visit the Master Lock Industry Factory with that Camouflage Lock that they sent to you and do it in "PERSON" and show them how easy it is. Seeing is believing and not seeing is not believing.
That was funny 😄
What is this pink tape moving in the aire like this??
I recently started learning to pick a few months ago and can reliably open standard locks. But for Christmas my brother in law found some brinks disk locks and a ton of keys which none work. Was super excited to have new locks to practice on but I've hit a brick wall. Any advice? Also love your channel and how much you explain what you're doing.
“We will be using a wave rake-“ *devastation ensues*
LockPickingLawyer, I never understand why these people send you challenges.  All they are doing is helping you to open up the tin so you can give them some whoop ass!  With your videos that last for a few minutes (if we are lucky) is, its binding on 2, binding on 3 and now the lock is open 😂😂😂!
No wonder you talk so slow, you're a finger reader
They could have just polished it to a mirror finish, to scare away LPL ;)
Master Lock is pretty trash, shouldn't be challenging anyone
Wow master lock is really lack in the creativity pool. He told them to think outside the box so they put a camo case over a 10 dollar lock. This makes me want to never buy a master lock again. No faith in their product at all anymore.
Fake videos. He always unlocks the locks the same ways. Blocked on all medias. 🖕😂
Stay away from my bike shed at work LPL!! lol
Where was the lock?
It took him longer to read the letter
Can you do locks on vehicles??
A Wiseman once told me. The only think a lock can keep out, is honest people, some honest people need a really rowdy lock.
Oi vet. LPL... Don't read with your finger. 3rd graders do that. Not lawyers. Lol
float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, your rakes can't open what your eyes can't see!
You say you picked the lock but you were just miming with your hands and tools? Good joke
LOL   You know its bad.. when he rakes it, and not picks it.
You are basically a neighbor, I used to shop my parts at Gladhill on Rt 27.  I watch your channel as I was a locksmith about 45 to 50 years ago.
All I saw was LPL's tools and a pink tape.  Did he get it open?
one of this days it’s going to be a fluke, im sure.
Imagine issuing a challenge to the LPL and sending him a lock vulnerable to a simple raking attack
This video missed the April Fool's Day release date.  I almost thought Master Lock had a chance at LPL with that letter.
Wait why was he picking air? and why did it work?
The fact that they used it’s instead of its in the letter backs up his theory that it’s not actually from master lock.
One rake to rake them all      Or one lawyer to rule them all
There are some display cabinets at my work that can still be opened even if you put the key in upside down, it just takes a little more jiggling.
Lol Chino? I live in Chino!
Aw, i had hoped you would talk a bit about security by obscurity xD
man should have put super glue in the joke lock
Wow! Master lock engineers are a joke.
Come on. Don't..ever put some gay sh!t emoji in the thumbnail
Man I really wanted him to peel off the camo coating to ensure it was actually a master lock because if I was them I would have sent a competitors lock in it lol
Good meme
You make a LOCK Smart GUY .
Well, if you are gonna cheat and use brightly coloured tape, what chance have they got? :D
They must super hate you spot on10/10
Aa
Haha they must hate you.
I'm actually surprised a lock was included. I was expecting the joke to be an "invisible lock". The cammo tape was a great visual gag and I'm glad they went that route rather than my lazy gag expectations.
missed opportunity.  "Let's do it one more time to make sure that wasn't a senior moment"  ;)
I’m sold now. I’m getting the genesis set
Any executive would have had an someone else type this letter. In order to be considered for this position, the person would have extensive knowledge of (at least) the English language. This person would NEVER have allowed "security is only as good as it's weakest link" to fall through the cracks. "It's" is FREQUENTLY misused in place of the word "its." This person would have immediately corrected this to "security is only as good as its weakest link."
This was genuinely funny. 😂
You should have put a little orange hunting hat on the lock...............
I've watched my dad take a small hammer and tap the top of the Masterlock and it popped open pretty as you please without damaging it.
Someone sent that as a joke.
All I can say is whoever the engineer is trying to improve the core, "You gotta do better than that!"
4 seconds 😅😅
If it wasn't for ad blocker I wouldn't figure out its just self promotion or something. You almost got me there. :)
You could have used the standard pick, wave rake 😂 rubbing it in huh
I'm glad he has mastered the ability to sit comfortably and open brand new locks not attached to anything.
Can you test the Urban Alps StealthKey g2?
Reading that latter takes more efford than openning the actual lock. Lol
Not a valid test!!! You cheated and used your seeing eye dog to locate the lock that otherwise would have been safely hidden from your superior skillz 🤣😂
Included a sample of the new lock with the pair of keys.
I really wanna read a comment from the ceo of master locks down here apologizing and saying that they already fired the “design engineer(s)” and put the company on sale for free!
LPL has really fallen downhill. He used to be a master lockpick able to pick any lock in 1 sec but now he just picks air. But on the bright side, He had John Cena and Drax as a guest so it cancels I think
That's one of the best uses of the Internet in my books!
Master Lock doesn't care.  More people know the legend and when the legend becomes this well known for most people it is the truth.  It is brilliant marketing.  Master Lock is content to leave the real lock market to real lock manufacturers, mostly from Europe.
🤣
This is hilarious! Another gem of pure comedic genius from LPL, it gave me a good laugh. If you're like me, and often struggle with depression, sometimes just finding something like this can be all it takes to lift my spirits a bit and give me a reason to smile.  Thank you. :)
A long letter will do to slow him down
🤣
It’s not often that you see a Masterlock video go for more than a minute and a half.
Gags that I expected at the end of the letter: *) lock lying on the desk covered in camouflage cloth *) Mrs. hid the lock in advance, mounting it to the e.g. white garage door  *) some mirror coated lock, that tries to blend in its environment *) a whole set of locks in camouflage looks for common uses, like wooden doors, garage doors in frequently used colors and patterns, ... *) a lock shaped like something you might expect/not be surprised hanging on a door handle, like a small bag of groceries.
LPL out here jiggling his jiggler in thin air and trying to make us believe he's actually picking a lock. SMH.
I'm almost embarrassed to think there was a time I thought masterlocks were good locks. Sure glad I found lpl.
Gold.
Dang, I really thought that Master Lock's "Skunk Works" had scored a win!
They didn't really think outside the box, or inside.
For once I would love you to leave the tools in the box and use paper clips, swizzle sticks, tooth picks. Maybe challenge yourself to only use what your local Starbucks offers to pick that same lock.
Lmao. Whoever made this up is a frickin genius (I know it's you LPL)
This is great marketing by masterlock. they don't have to be the best, they just have to be good enough. turning the fact that you're the laughing stock of the internet around into good PR.
When you read the letter longer than it takes you to open the lock.
That Is Amazing
It's really disappointing that they don't take their product seriously. If they had any amount of pride they would offer you a ridiculous amount of money to have you consult for them on a lock design that would set a standard. Even if it was a premium product that was less consumer driven and more innovation driven. LPL clearly has the experience needed to identify which lock designs are the top of their class. Why can't a million dollar corporation achieve what one lone hobbyist has? It's honestly pathetic that Master Lock doesn't care enough to take their work seriously.
It's never a fluke..
Master lock leave the chat...
🤣
what a fail. they forgot to camouflage the shackle as well, so LPL cant pick it, because he cant see it!
This is a joke, you think you can sit there and pretend to open a lock. We can clearly see there is no lock anywhere in this video
If it was real, I'd have mad respect for the confidence.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why are they called Master Lock?
Excellent entertainment value. Thanks to both of you for creating and sharing the fun spoof.
nah...that letter is only a bluff.
IS IT EVER A FLUKE?!
Dear LPL. Please try the Eufy SmartDrop lock :)
Thank you "Master Lock" for the comedy.
I wonder, has there never been a lock that even gave you even a little challenge?  I love your videos and I think it's a great way to show the issues that current lock producers should address. But I still need to lock my stuff somehow with locks available on the market right now.  So, how about the idea of making a top 10 video with the least shitty locks that you've tried until now?
"your videos are embarasing us and devastate our morale" *Sends a lock "equal to your skill"* The moral: *yeet*  Very fun tho, good job masterlock
Well, engineers mistake was to choose "forest" camo, he should'we use "urban" instead!
When I see a wave rake, I pray the lock would hold ground for more than 5 seconds.
Why dont Masterlock didn't engage LPL for developpement of real new "out of the box" locks??? Lots of blablabla Mr Youn, stop talking  start acting!!!
How about trying to pick an Abloy Protec2 lock?
Master lock has chosen death..
I got it: Cover a lock in reflective surfaces. He won't be able to pick it on camera!
It would be really cool if you could describe the process you go through to decide while tools will most easily open the lock. What made you choose that particular pry bar, why the wave rake instead of single pin picking, etc. Might add 30s to the video but seems worth it.
For anyone wondering, the lock is camouflaged so well that it doesn't exist therefore he cannot pick it. Master Lock coming at him with 300 iq, amazing:D
What lock?  All I saw was a damn piece of pink tape.  It looked like he was doing the lock picking version of air guitar.
Hey L P L, what about safes, I know locks are no match…
So... Question: if i want to send a lock for the LPL to pick it open, where do i send it? To what address?
They knew what they were doing.
I for sure thought there wasn't going to be a lock at all included with the letter
When the letter takes more time stalling lpl than a lock lol
I wonder if any of the master lock employees actually see these videos 🤣
Is LPL vision impaired? It makes his skills even more impressive!
I hope that "generous" budget was relative to a cent.
Should've said it had cloaking technology and not sent a lock
As Effie (Mary Coustas) from Acropolis Now would say:  "How embarrasment"
Hahaha this is fuckin' hilarious😂
should have said outside the lock
It took LPL longer to read the letter than to open the lock 😂🤣. I haven't laughed this much since Russell Peters said "son, somebody's gonna get hurt". Omg, that was brilliant!
where's the lock tho?
“Let’s do that again to show that it wasn’t a fluke” … it’s never a fluke.
Master lock company seeing this video be like: 😐🤬
🤣🤣🤣👍🏻
Ooooh masterlock must be fuming now
At what date did you receive the letter?
Lmao there’s no way master lock came at LPL with that POS
Silly question,but why aren't all pins security pins?
Looking at all of the comments, I think antagonising MasterLock here is completely uncalled for. I agree that their locks aren’t top-quality, however at least we have to respect that they take criticism on the head, which is not something that many huge corporations can boast about.
Early April Fools?
LPL: "Master Lock sent me a challenge..." Me: "Oh no!"  <sees less than 3 minute run time> Me: "Hehehe this is gonna be good!"
There is NEVER a fluke with master lock. It opens consistently with the lightest jiggle.
Let's try it one more time to make sure it wasn't a fluke..    Has it ever been a fluke with a master lock?
I came looking for locks and found gold.
It's never lupus and it's never a fluke.
Using that pink tape would be more effective than locking with a Masterlock.
Now we know there brand for sure it's all for show.
its* weakest link.
Trending video nicely done as always
😂
But has it ever been a fluke?
i really want to have those skills that you have, that way i can get a lot of free stuff
Bully maguire
Read a whole letter, picked it twice, and continued the commentary after the pick all under 3 minutes. 😂
Would have been funnier if there was a chinese finger trap as the lock!
I bought a similar Master Lock for the purpose of trying my hand at raking. It took me longer than this, but it was still easier than getting it open with the included keys because -- and I'm not joking here -- they kept getting stuck.
#14 on trending 😀
Took 95 seconds to read the letter and 2 seconds to pick the lock, what a joke 😂
"Please say wave rake, please say wave rake, ha!"
LPL should make an unpickable lock
I may have a lock you can't pick.  If I run across it I will send it in. It's a master lock pulse code lock. No keyway or access to the lock.  I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to own one. I haven't seen anything really on the market.
Ah...John Cena's lock.
As someone well outside of the security industry, I have to ask -- how can Master Lock design locks that can be defeated so easily?  Is it just ineptitude and incompetence (they don't have the knowledge to design more secure locks)?  Is it that they flood the market with their products and hope that psychology plays a leading role (making people think "if their products are so popular, they MUST be good")?  I know greed is all-consuming, but you would think the company's employees (and especially its executives) would be ashamed of how incomprehensibly easy it is to open their locks with the absolute bare-minimum skill level and rudimentary tools..
Don't lie, you got this 3 weeks ago and just recently found it.  Wp disaster lock
I think they are on the right track, just offer mutiple skins like „old timber“ or „rusty gate“ and it is well hidden.
Haha master lock. You got put down even further. 😂😂😂😂😂
Can you make a video on the kwikset powerbolt 2
The real CEO of Master Lock should write a letter to LPL:  We decided on a generous budget if you come over for a year and help us make our locks better.
LoL Poor Master Lock!!! 😅
Hahaha master Lock may as well shutdown or employ you as their chief engineer hahaha. Surprised none of these place pay you to consult hahaha.
At this point, I’m convinced that the LPL could open all the Masterlocks within his vicinity just by putting out a thought signal like Aquaman used to summon fish in those 1970s cartoons.
The marvelous forecast genotypically glue because argentina greely tire atop a knowledgeable lobster. abrupt, murky accordion
I don't know you, but why LPL is picking his own hand with a pink tape on it? I cannot see any lock...
The Lock they sent you is a total fluke.
lol this is funny~
A lot of times youtubers in their videos talk a while before they get to the point. If LPL did not do the introduction part, his videos would be 10 seconds in average.
Holy Crap, not trying to creep your address or anything but I grew up in Damascus! I was just there visiting family! Small world man
Hey there LPL, so I started getting ads for this MaxSafe vein-scanning pistol lockbox. Thought of you opening it in 20 seconds or less almost immediately, lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This vid cracks me up, I am wondering if Master Lock would ever put up a law suit against LPL. But since LPL is a laywer too, maybe the law suit would be opened and dropped within 2 seconds also.
You guys should start making this a thing, see who can write the best letters.
It probably took LPL longer to open the package containing the lock and letter than it did to pick the lock.
omg - this was clever if it was legit
💀outmastered the master(lock)
Master Lock's President was just joking.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Master Lock is being brilliant here. It's like The Men in Black. Their greatest security is their secrecy. No one can break in, because no one knows where to break in. Geniuses!
As soon as i saw the rake i didn't need to see anything further haha.
Is this a joke? All you did was hold and wave the pick around in the air, there wasn't even a lock in this video. I will admit, it was impressive how you had that piece of pink tape float in the air like that though.
wait where's the lock?
*glances at video length after reading the letter* oh. This isint going to end well.
A better camouflage would be to name their lock 'John Cena'... the moment they stamp that in the side, it will become invisible to everyone. Kind of hard to sell though... since the packaging will look empty.
This is cute. Lol
That was hilarious
LPL with this Enovation finally a worthy opponent LPL opens it in like 10 secs master lock ok this time lets just make one out of glass he cant see that!
If you want the LPL to notice you, wear pink.
Thanks for the laugh.
LPL key notes @ SAINT CON "Security through obscurity"
I wonder if replacing the pins inside with a fluid dampened pin retainer that might deter lock-picking then again it's probably a expensive lock and would not be a very good experiment just to see if it works
LOL
EMOTIONAAAL DAAMAGE! 😆
I thought the camo style lock would evoke some PTSD from LPL's military combat tours.  The person who created the fake letter could be sued and prosecuted for identity theft and forgery, defamation, etc.
LPL: I challenge you to pick a master lock with a paper clip. May use normal tensioner or fashion one out of a paperclip as well but think it would be an interesting test of skill to see you use a macgyver type setup.
LPL, for the video, please go a bit slower, show the rake for a few seconds and explain what you are doing as you pick the lock.
"Cement Master Lock's reputation" Really thought this was gonna be a Master Lock with the core replaced with cement, lol.
Haha that wave rake mean no fs given about hurting any feelings lol
I hit like, but you probably didn't notice.
It took him longer to read the letter than pick the lock... Brutal... To be fair my grandfather once told me.  Locks only keep an honest man out. Which has always been my go-to logic.
The Master Lock President when he sees this video: "Yes, just a joke from an impersonator...Hahaha! Um, that's right. We would never be foolish enough to believe that would've worked.... hehe....    :("
i do wonder why people are just not using a "wireless Lock" it would have to feature three to five buttons labeled "1,2,3, etc" and THOSE buttons are just in cast you lose your wireless "key" button meant to specifically unlock the lock with a specially designed frequency. Unless it had been proven as not workable.
*chilling on your crib* *you hear a muffled voice saying: "this is the lock picking lawyer and today we are going to test out peoples locks"* *you hide under your bed* *your door lock opens* *you hear a voice getting closer and closer saying: "now this user may be terrified of the quality of his lock, thats why i wanted to check if he wants his knife sharpened in recompensate for the broken lock" *he is getting closer to you* *he says: "who seems to be hiding under this bed this time?"* *you quickly get out and lock your room* *he is running through the corridor with a knife* *you are terrified* *you hear a soft voice saying: "now this is not the lock you should be using in your house, they are vulnerable to almost every person with any lockpicking skills"* *he breaks the lock but until he opened the door he noticed a safe on the other side of the corridor* *you flee from your room backwards watching him open the safe with a paper plane* *he says: "thanks for your support, this was the lock picking lawyer and we will see you in the next video when we will see if the quality of locks in this house improves"* *he sees you* *you turn around and you fall down* *you wake up in his basement* *he comes down and says: "this is the lock picking lawyer and im sorry that the plans may have changed, but i noticed a lockable diary, which should be locked at all costs to protect yourself from revealing your secrets, we will check if its properly locked and also try to open it"* *he gets a gun* *you hear: "oh fuck the safety is off"* *he pulls the trigger* *the last thing you see is his chainsaw and your diary with all your passwords* *you bleed out to death*
I would actually love to see Master Lock officially challenge LPL on a new lock.
@lockpickinglawer you should check out this mod for minecraft that adds a decent locking mechanic to minecraft and any lock can be opened with a book in you hand lmao
Be honest you send that lock to yourself
Only needs lockpicking level 60 for this one.
just send him duct tape ball
The kingdom of the Lord is at hand humble yourselves, renounce the sin that clings so closely & repent and believe in the name of  yeshua for the remission of your sins christ died for us so live for him. even if you don’t believe give him a try no matter what he will accept you even if you’ve never believed since birth.. confess with your mouth and believe with your heart truly believe and you shall be save it takes nothing but faith Trust Me you will feel him id rather die believing and there not be life after then there be life after and not believing Jesus knew he would be the most hated but despite that still gave up his life for us believe in that and ye shall be saved. the blood of Jesus poured for our sins so you don’t have to go to hell. God can work wonders if you let him just a little of your time
Too early for April Fools huh?
LPL: Picks the lock ML Employee: damaged morale :/ LDL: Does it again to make sure it wasn't a fluke...  ML Employee: EMOTIONAL DaMaGe!!!!
Sad, some people fail to learn from others
Plot twist : The letter is the real lock, it distracting LPL from opening the second lock, so LPL need more time to open the lock because he need to read the letter first
Plot twist : The letter is the lock, it distracting LPL from opening the lock, so LPL need more time to open the lock because he need to read the letter first
As a former Damascus resident, Go Hornets.
Lol that was sent by me
half their budget was spent on deciding the camo.
Early April Fool eh ?
LMAO
I worked for a Master Lock distributor for nearly a decade. We never once had a customer call saying that a lock had been picked. I'm not saying anything good or bad about the company, just that in every case I dealt with the lock mechanism was never the weakest link.
If LPL shows a rake, the lock is doomed
They could have at least attempted to glue the cover shut to buy themselves another 30 seconds.
Plot twist: the letter is legit
I was expecting a John Cena face on the lock. Slightly disappointed...
Your skill set is FAR above most folks because you have a very tuned sense of touch.  Every time I've tried picking, I always put too much tension and it rarely works.
Anyone else look at the calendar to make sure it wasnt April 1st?
WHat, do we have pre-April Fools vidoes now ? Haha
i saw you raking the pink tape....so where's the lock?
Isn't that Goofy on the lock when it is first shown? Brown camouflage paint is in the shape of Goofy 😋
Dis anyone made hybryd lock what is both mechanical and electrical? I mean lock what does not rotate till the key fits.
When he put emphasis on the word "concrete" in the letter, I was beginning to believe they coated the lock in concrete.
I was expecting a lock w/o a core. You lock it and it is forever closed :)
After the introduction of cordless cut off grinders I don’t believe there is any lock that can’t be cut off in less than a minute … just saying …
I have already decided to keep padlocks in The plastic clam shell from. Costco.    Those things are so hard to open.     Just trying to figure out how to reseal them.......
Don't even look back at the ludicrous amounts of wreckage.
Plot twist: Master Lock really sent the letter and lock🤦
Is the camouflage removable to identify the model?
Bruh moment
The first HALF of the video is literally talking about the letter. Wow.
Playing along with the joke and even improving it.  Total class.  Thoroughly enjoyed.
LPL starts "trying" to pick this inovative lock at 1:50, 15 seconds later, after explaining the tools used, the lock is open, the second time it only takes 5 seconds to open as he doesnt need to explain the method used to pick. Yes, he picked it twice in less time than u need t read my comment, nothing new here lol.
Maybe we should put something distracting on our locks to slow the picker. I am beginning to wonder if I should leave the door unlocked to confuse the crook, or maybe it will make them think I am still there.
ML President watching video: "Shit! I really thought that would work...'
Almost 1 million views at 14 hours after post & #14 on trending, wow it’s great to see how much this content has grown. Glad to have been here for one heck of a ride and continue on. Cheers to everyone that see’s this.
2:53 video 1% of the time devoted to picking the lock. Thank you so much LPL I get the biggest kick out of your vids.
It would’ve been hilarious if they sent the letter with no lock. 😂
Lmao anyone can pick there locks
You can return address something whatever you want, but the postmark is always the nearest postal logistical center
probably faster with the rake than the key
for april fools, you should unlock a master lock 200 or something times, however many times it takes to make the video over 5 minutes, then make the title something synonymous to "i spent 5 minutes unlocking this Master Lock lock". that way, people watch the video thinking Master Lock finally made a good lock, when in reality you just unlocked the same lock over and over for 5 minutes
This was hilarious. After having binge watched so many of his videos and seeing that virtually every lock is pickable, the main question I have is what is the most secure lock? Better yet, what brand of lock does LPL have on his own house?
Less than 3 second pick, lolz.
I was half-expecting a "lock" with no keyhole, just a body and a hasp. LPL would still be able to open it, of course, it's MasterLock.
When I saw the title, I expected it to be 2 1/2 minutes of LPL laughing, and 13 seconds picking it. I got that wrong, it only took LPL  7 seconds (2nd time, the 1st one he stopped to talk about the devices), sorry LPL.
No, no. You found the DECOY camouflage lock. They learned security through obscurity. The real camo lock was white with black MAster Lock lettering (and Office of the President below that.). You set the hasp and pick on it at the end of the video. Good luck finding it again!  🔒 🔑 📍
...What did, did you just pretend to jiggle a lock? Are you going to actually pick the lock in the future? I'm confused, am I missing the joke?
This time we've covered the lock in manure. I'll bet he won't pick it this time! Gloves? Damn. Back to the drawing board.
This is stupid. Click bait.
Gotta love this guy! What a howl!!  That's the same lock they use on our social security lockbox!!
What lock? All I see is some pink tape.
I still can't see the lock, I only see a bit of pink ribbon!
LPL, with your covert companion harpoon could it also “lock pick” the actual lock saying you “temporarily “locked” the lock/pad lock” could you just insert the harpoon and then use the removal key for the harpoon since it does lift all of the pins?
I mean I don't know how wiggling a rake next to a conspicuously floating piece of tape constitutes a "picked lock" but ok
Well, Masterlock will always hold a special place in my heart as the first lock I ever picked. I used broken glasses and a paper clip. This new one is beyond my skills without glasses.
Anytime I see a wave rake I know that it’s going to get ugly.  Hilarious letter from “master lock”.
I thought there would be no lock.
What’s the best padlock you’ve found?
I would have just sent the the note without the lock good luck finding it 😂
I feel bad for master Lock at this point
“Well… they forgot to send the lock. It’s just some curved metal.”
Whoever did that 👏👏👏
Anotter notch on the belt !!
It only took a while for the seeing-eye dog to find this product because LPL asked it to "find the lock"... and the dog wasn't sure this qualified.
LPL: its open Manufacturer: 😭😭
Just puts anyone to shame
Was this supposed to be released on April 1st?
Pretty sure this isn't from Master Lock, but whatever, clicks are clicks.
i dunno, that seemed really hard to find, much less lock pick
Somebody needs to do a similar letter but send a lock that's covered in mirrors.
Wait until they develop a truly invisible lock! Then you’ll be stumped! 😂😂😂
Lol... I almost died coughing and laughing at this...
Haha! Master Lock sucks! I was there at the world headquarters. Incompetent buffoons!!!
Locks like this make me think I could actually be good at lockpicking. xD As soon as I saw it (through it's high tech camouflage, of course!)I knew you would just rake it.
What an odd lock, no real protection and a shiny shackle l with camo body
lol "it took a while for my seeing eye dog to find it" had me dying
Dude what padlock do you recommend lol Jesus you’re unstoppable
Thank goodness for that pink tape. Really helps
The lock 9 months later 🤰
If I was the president of Master Lock, I would have told the design team : make a lock that will take LPL more than one minute to open, then you will be promoted, otherwise fired.
April 1st is about a month and a half away.   Trying to get more viewership early?
With the wording of the text I kinda expected the key way to be filled with some kind of cement.
🤣🤣🤣
you're about to be inundated with copycats
What lock ?
I'm just not going to use locks anymore I'm just going to start welding things closed.
Seems like you spend more time picking locks than lawyering. I mean, you're great at picking locks and everything, but what about your legal accomplishments?
One thing that I've learned with the Lawyer is, be happy with whatever lock you have... 'cause all of them can be picked or forced open... in other words, if you're a target, you're fuuuuuuuuuuuuu.... xD . Cheers!
This isnt the Lock what they send u Fake u still not found the Real Lock .
It took longer to read that note than to pick that lock
Damn how’d he find it tho
Ok, whoever sent that is the king of the LPL fans.
😆
I would pay to see the LPL do an entire two hour show picking locks on stage Las Vegas.  This one could be his closing act.
Best wishes
So there was no lock included after all.
Luckily, most thieves don't have access to seeing eye dogs.
Hello! So your videos give me a lot of motivation and I recently got into lockpicking. I received a standard set to introduce me to it like 4 weeks ago. How long do you think it should take to pick a random lock. No brand or anything. Just to see if I am doing well at this.
I wonder what Master Lock[If it WAS from Master Lock] was thinking by sending this lock, it seemed like Master Lock forgot to test the lock if the lock was resistant from wave rake lmao
>laser printed with toner so weak it crumbles on first fold >"it's" where "its" is correct >lock not booby-trapped with heavily corrosive-to-skin chemicals or explosive The last one confirms it's not from ML
Deer lock picking lawyer I'm having issues picking padlocks that you cannot remove the key when it is open and only when you lock it again you can remove the key any suggestions on this would muchly be appreciative thank you for all that you do you're the reason why I started lock picking..... That and my doctor said I have to start doing something with my fingers so my my disease would not take over so he said play an instrument lock picking is so much more funner... Thanks again
ROTFLMAO!
He is by far, my favorite contributor/channel on YouTube.
With Chino postmark ... lol ...
Shit you'd be better off using a string and a piece of chewing gum for a lock.
COVID 19 VACCINES ARE NOT VACCINES!. I AM BEING SHADOW BANNED BY COMMUNIST YOUTUBE TO SILENCE THE TRUTH TO KEEP THE MASS AT BAY UNTO SUBMISSION OF THERE AGENDA OF ECONOMIC RESET THAT IS COMING FROM ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED COVID 19. THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. ANSWER. JESUS CHRIST
Some Master Idiots. It took longer to read this letter, $500/hr of company lawyer to write it, along with the whole company morale than to pick this lock open. Point proved. It's easier to admit one's short fall than corporate long shadows.
🤣😂🔥
lol!  that’s hilarious.
Lacking the skill set of LPL, I resort to a really big set of bolt cutters, an angle grinder with cut off disc and 30.06 M2 AP Black Tip. I used to include thermite but I kept setting crap on fire.  In the way of a disclaimer...Nothing above is true, don't try it at home and this statement is for entertainment purposes only and any resemblance to activities of persons living or dead is purely coincidental. (The last part is not the lock picking stuff...It is the lawyer stuff). 🤪
🤣
🤣
*yawn*
But… where’s the lock?
Theres secretly a second lock he never found.
Whup-It Good Brother ! ! ! .............
I'm betting the LPL doesn't actually say "security is only as good as it's weakest link". The LPL seems like a pretty careful guy and I'm almost certain he instead says "security is only as good as its weakest link".
That's a good letter 😂
As the President and CEO of Master Lock I can confirm that letter is the real deal.
The weakest link in the lock industry is lock makers.🤭
In the sword enthusiast community, there's a term, "sword-like object", used to describe things that are sold as "swords" but are good for little more than decoration. I feel like Master lock sells lock-like objects.
I've never seen a camouflaged lock. Wow, it must work!!!
The real masterlock execs don’t care,  because they make cheap locks on China for pennies, mark them up 100x, and they still sell millions more than anything LPL sells.  Because they know the real secret:  Most people are dumb and don’t care about high-security locks.  And those execs make a lot of money as a result.     Sometimes making the best product doesn’t make you the most money.   Understanding the market the best, will.
Genius on Master Locks part. That’s what we call cheap advertising. A little letter and a cheap camouflage lock just got them almost a million views.
Should have saved this one for april 1st
It's its, not it's, if you mean it's its. It's is not, it isn't ain't, and it's it's, not its, if you mean it is. If you don't, it's its. Then too, it's hers. It isn't her's. It isn't our's either. It's ours, and likewise yours and theirs.
Has he ever not been able to pick a lock?
I grew up in Damascus, I remember Red Rooster, the Druid Theater, and Jimmie Cone 😎😎
Wow, that camouflage coating was really top notch. without the pink tape attached to it I would have had a hard time locating the lock. Good job, MasterLock.
You gonna need better camouflage than that.
Preventing crime with psyops next letter
This video needs a HAH button!
Masterlocks are so bad T.T I'm a total scrub and I was able to rake a Masterlock open in a single wrist movement.
They killed the Jiggler, man. They killed the Jiggler!
I was waiting for the rickroll there
masterfart
I was expecting it to be a "cement" joke and just be a brick with the shackle on it
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
😜🤣
"Americanos, with blue jeans and chinos, from Pepsi Anolito. Americanos!" Great upload thx!
Hahahahaha...got me laughing today. That letter was funny as Hell :)
am i the only one that noticed the typo in the letter?
lmao
Spoiler alert: it's never a fluke.
LPL will eventually become the corporate head for all padlock designers and builders 😋
I use to live in Clarksburg , thats wild i know damacus lol
The unpickable lock is a lock that melts itself shut after locking  It’s not really practical, but I doubt it’s “unpickability” can be questioned
I laughed as soon as the letter was finished. I knew what was coming and I still enjoyed it!
I think the looks i used a work which was an advertisement present with a chasing made from bent sheet metal would be safer than this. A least you’d have a harder time finding the core.
Plot twist: After the video, LPL removes the tape and reveals that it's a Yale
I'm sure that's not from master lock if it was it would be better if they close down. Perhaps making locks is not they best trade.
Fans are fun
I had to check my calendar to make sure it wasn't April already....nope still February.
Just put the lock inside hard clear plastic clam shell packaging like batteries and many products now come in.  You know, the ones that are plastic welded all around the edge.  Nobody can get into those.  I heard a comedian point that out and also wonder why very fragile light bulbs came in the flimsiest of paper-like cardboard packaging - that was open on the ends.
This was pretty funny.
plot twist, this was 100% a legitimate letter and lock design from MasterLock...
The only way the letter could have been funnier would be if there was no lock included.
It took longer to read the letter than it did to pick the lock...  lol  It would be funnny if LPL did an escape room and got to use his lock picks.  lol  LPL speed run escape rooms :D
Yeah it's definitely a joke.
You know it's a low tier lock when he pulls out the wave take
Dude, i was expecting a lock covered with glass or something that can reflect your face xD
i thought it was going to be a lock with a bunch of false keyholes
😂🤣😂🤣 That was hilarious!! Great job! 👏👏 Thank you for the laugh!
it would be more funny if they didn't send you a lock in the first place
well done!
Whoa! What a great idea to put pink tape on your lock! I saw nothing until you had done that, then Presto! There was the lock. I hope your seeing eye dog is able to read my comment to you 😄. You're awesome!
Let's do it again,,,,put that on a shirt.
That was brilliant lol
Only way to stop LPL is to weld the lock shut....and then drop it in the Mariana Trench  Just sayin
I didnt see any lock in this video
And here I hoped it was a serious challenge like before where he was ominously silent.
What about that other dude who makes Shorts by single-stab of MasterLocks, then shares his disappointment?
Sometimes trolls can do some awesome stuff, like this. The rest of the time they're just committing treason against the human race...  👾👾👾
Should have saved this one for April Fools Day.  Funny stuff!  The author should write for a comedy club.
Terrible vision? ... wut?
whoever sent the lock should have just sent the letter and an empty box
😂😂 great video!
Isn't impersonation in mail a punishable offense in the US?
Ah, missed opportunity. Should've included no lock!
You already know you're gonna laugh when he takes out the wave rake
From now on, I'll include a horrendously long cease and desist letter with all my locks. As a lawyer, he would be unable to go past without reading thoroughly, giving me enough time to replace his lock picks with tooth picks.
Getting pretty good with video manipulation LPL!  Made the tip of that rake disappear like that and picking air!
Whoever sent this should have re-pinned it with security pins
Imagine if there wasn't actually a lock in the package.
Once he whipped out the wave rake, I knew this was gonna be an embarrassment.
When he read out the line "our designers took the opportunity to cement Master Lock's reputation as an industry innovator", I was expecting a lock encased in cement!
Alright, whomever wrote that letter come forward... lol
My challenge to LPL.  Pick with your opposite hands next time. That should slow you down by a second or less.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Alright, who sent him this joke?  "The Office of the President"  seriously?
Whoever sent this gag in, you should have only sent the shackle
I was really hoping that, when told to think outside the box, one of those employees bought a PAC Lock, scratched out the label, and put "Master Lock" on it with a Sharpie.
if you want "LPL camouflage" you need to cover every mm of the lock in the shiniest chrome ever so no matter how you hold it, you can always see your reflection in it.
You have an amazing sense of humor 🤣
Wait, did he actually pick a lock or was that a joke? All I saw was a piece of pink tape floating in midair
I picked a master lock the other day with a lock picking set from eBay that I ordered when I lost the key to my trailer lock, took me maybe 10 seconds to pick it!
Someday, someone will place a piezoelectric zapper in the lock, ...  just for you.    :)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhahahahahahahahahaha :D
Actually got my first lock picks this Christmas thanks to your influence.  After mastering the see through plastic practice lock in the set, I wanted something nice and easy to pick for my first real locks.  I immediately thought of your videos, and got 4 different Master Locks.  Had them all open within 20 minutes - felt great.
This company out here really throwing memes at LPL huh
Next time, pick the lock left-handed while wearing a blindfold.
LPL read a letter and picked a lock in just under 3 mins, either the letter is really long or the lock was hard to pick......hmmmmm
A missed opportunity for a truly impossible lock for him to pick: one that's entirely covered in mirrored surfaces
lol always easy when its a master :P
What do you know. I live by Master Lock's headquarters.
Hay LPL You should make your Owen lock that can't be picked by any one.
Legitimately, that "not a lock" thing is more useful than "master lock" locks.
I was expecting a lock with the keyway and shackle holes filled with JB Weld. Definately 'pick proof'!
LPL Once again destroying a man pride.
Plot twist: it was actually sent by a masterlock employee as a joke at their own expense.   Seriously, awesome letter lol!
Camo to “hide the disappointment” 😝
I wish I had found your channel years ago. My sister, who was living with me at the time, had accidentally locked me out of my apartment. The landlady wasn't able to do anything about it and gave me two options: pay for a locksmith, or kick the door open and buy a new one. Went with the latter option because doors were super cheap at the Home Depot and because kicking a door open is super fun. Had I the knowledge and skill to pick it, though, I'd have done that and blown my landlady's mind.
F
Yuup! Made them look like clowns again. 😂
Shouldn’t a lock always be pickable as a safety feature in case you lose the key? (This is a genuine question)
Dam that camo is just as powerful as ballons in btd
He made his seeing eye dog find the lock twice, just to make sure it wasn’t a fluke.
i don't understand what you did at the end of this video? I saw you holding a piece of pink tape and wiggling a rake tool around while holding a tension bar, then moved the pink tape around. I don't get it?
I can't be the only one that was expecting the letter to come with a truly "invisible lock" Ie: nothing
providing innovation so viewers can also picking it with less effort.
He knew it wasn't sent by master lock, put in his description Master Lock Sent Me a Challenge... Why would I want to watch a video of a lock a toddler can pick?
The genesis set is out of stock :c
Clever
To make such a lock truly pick proof, wouldn't it be better to simple make it unable to be picked, by removing the lock all together?
what were you picking?
The letter head is off. It would be interesting to know where that parcel was shipped from. Usually you can glean that information but maybe you have some fans close enough to Oak Creek, Wi
Your audience members are the best
Masterlock must laugh at this like: so What do we do now?
Took him longer to read the letter than pick the lock...twice
Oh this is completely real. I was the paper
See the issue is they should've printed a picture of John Cena on the lock.
can you pick the military lock?
at this point, slowing LPL down will means locksmiths must create one which is resistant against each and every tool LPL has in his toolshed.  I wonder how much it will cost, though.
I don't see a lock.  Anyone else see a lock?   LPL seems to be able to pick thin air and I suddenly hear a lock open.
ahhhh hahaha,the master is you lawyer,i love you man,i work as a locksmith in brazil,your videos are the best,screww master lock,multlock is the best 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣  That letter was hilarious!  I love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!!  This channel is just so awesome!
LMFAOOO
I really expected the lock to be absolutely covered in camo duct tape, which has been the best at slowing down the LPL
The letter took longer to read than the picking of the lock, a great security feature right there that TRIPLED picking time.
The fact that it took you longer to read the letter than it did to pick the lock says it all...
Faster than using the key that came with the lock.
Is this a joke?
I would like to thank The Office of The President for sending LPL this fine security presentation.  It made my day 👍😎
Bro, how did that man pick that lock? All i saw air, a rake shaking in the air, and a piece of tape
You should check out McNally  He's also a lock picker channel that's very bitter towards Masterlock, but is also very fast and dexterous
🤣
XD the letter tho
Just proves that locks only keep honest people out😁 I really do hope they sent that as a joke. If not, I can only imagine the conversation the president will have with his engineers😐
LPL : Inserts tension tool Me : *Checks remaining time on the video* Ha, exactly as expected
Can someone please send him a lock covered in small mirrors so he can't pick it without doing an accidental face reveal? That would easily be a lock he can't pick...
It’s never a fluke…even when you can’t see it!!!
Masterlock should just commit sedoku.
That took a while jajaja
That padlock seems to be hilariously bad.
ok i sent them master lock a link to this video. i wonder if theyill watch it.
how did he find the lock?
Why is LPL messing around with his hands and that wave rake? It's like he's holding something but i don't see anything.
Master Lock put a firewall on its employees’ computers to block LPL’s channel. Apparently they can bypass it by flashing a wave rake in front of their monitors.
That's funny lmao thanks for sharing!
🤣
I was expecting a nonchalant jab with the wave rake to open it.
Master lock employees darn not again there goes our bonus
Lmao the camo bit killed me
That is hilarious!!!
*Emotional Damage!
Master lock in shambles again.
I believe laughter is a facade of how men with ego issues handle the lost face.  U should have just leveled with me.  Lol.  I mean really.   I didn't need linzers fly swatter to step on a ant.
We already knew it wasn’t a fluke.
they couldnt wait till april ...
bit early for an april fools video
Wyd for a living  LPL: i put people to shame by lockpicking locks
I think you worked for master lock 🔐 🤔
Since watching your channel,  I no longer use master locks.  There are much more superior locks on the market.  Master lock took a hard nose dive when a Chinese company bought them out. Hence why I do not buy Chinese products.  Thank you for all that you do.
Hahaha so nice, greetings from germany.
Too early for April fools, isn't it? !
great company
Ouch
If this isn’t almost certainly a joke I can just imagine this.  El prez:I’m gonna send him a…. Marketing:NOOOOOOOO!
When he read the bit "opportunity to cement Master Lock's reputation", I was expecting that the lock would have been filled with super glue to prevent picking.   ...or opening at all.
Lmao
i only realised he had the lock in his hand when he pointed out the tape. Really cool.
More like a slave lock not master 🤣
Well played .
Wow I saw a 3min long video for a master lock... I thought this was going to be something impressive lol
You shouldve waited until April to upload this video
yeah; i got a Master Lock, i pick for practice/fun - and it's absolutely not a challenge.  this pseudo letter-challenge was meant to embarrass Master Lock.  but, it's CEO is MIA.
Master Lock: "We have this new lock that will surly be a struggle for u"  LPL: "I'm bout to end this man's whole career"
If Master Lock was going to send an actual challenge, it would likely have simply said "Please stop humiliating us!" That would be a tough challenge. On that note, wrapping something up in a ball of duct tape would keep LPL out for longer than a Master lock.
Yep, still 5 second.
Tsk tsk tsk its*
I’m trying to get my dad to get me a lock pick ket and after I showed him this video he said all right.
The irony is that Masterlock probably do watch these videos, but clearly don't give a sh1te 🤣🤣🤣
ADVANCED APRIL FOOLS!!! :D lol
-  👍 👍 🔧  -
It should have been covered in Desert Camo... then you'd have been completely screwed, LPL!   🤣👍
I don’t know if any of us are still wondering if a three-second opening might be a fluke.
I just hope Master Lock sends in another one
That was great.
If u didn't read the letter it would have been a shorter video. Keep up the good work
i ordered a Lock picking set last week and its scary how fast and without any real knowladge you can pick a lock!! i dont mean locks like on the door, but the locks that were sent in the set are pretty easy, you can pick on in just a second, which is making me scared about how unsecure locks actually are!
🤣
You know it’s gonna be good if there’s a letter he has to read and it’s still under 3mins lol
I guess Masterlock also doesn't understand commas.
Omg I didn't see the lock, only the pink tape WTF
When he picks it faster than he reads the letter🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have a challenge for you. My garage door is locked and the key can‘t open it anymore. Now i don‘t know how to park my car in it again.  The only problem, the lock is in germany. ;-)
It sounded pretty legit for a minute there lol
I don't know if it's still the same, but Chino, CA is/was home to many cow pastures.
LMAO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Good one
Mr President you've been humiliated again
It took him longer to plug the website name than it took to pick the lock.  This channel has almost limitless monitaztion potential because the actual "content" is only about 1% of the time to begin with.
See, now I would have sent the letter without any lock so he would have spent hours looking for it….😜
Why LPL keeps proving that "it is not a fluke" with any Master lock is beyond me... Unless it's to stab them twice for the price of one. Every darn time.
I'm going to write you 50 pages letter so it will definitely slow you down
😄😄😄😄😄
Not a fluke duke.
At 40 seconds, me;  "Saw that episode of Star Trek the next Gen.  Jordi asked computer to make an opponent that can beat Data (he ment to say Prof Moriarty)
Nice
Thanks for doing it twice! The camouflage is so good that it is hard to see that you even have something in your hands other than your pick :)
I lost it when he said camouflage, lmfao
I thought that was a good letter. According to Google, David Youn is the president of Master Lock. I don't know what his signature looks like but I bet the letter is genuine. I'm not going to hate on Master Lock. They are not hard to pick, but I don't buy their locks for something that needs high security (obviously). I think Mr. Youn and his company have a targeted use case that they address well. My dad has a Master Lock on his shed that has lasted about 40 years. If anyone was serious about breaking in they would just pry the hasp so strong pick resistance isn't a requirement. The lock does the job to keep neighborhood kids out and to help keep the wind from blowing the doors open. If dad put a $200 lock on the shed, he would be more worried about someone stealing the lock than anything it guards. I put their locks on ammo dry boxes to keep curious nephews and nieces out and on our backyard fence's gate. I think their company offers a cheap solution that is ideal for use cases where an deterrent is warranted but bypassing the lock is not difficult.   Kudos to Master Lock for not taking themselves too seriously. Thanks for sharing. I really enjoy your videos.
Which one of y’all is funny as hell?!
Don't lock pickers think outside the lockbox?
🤣🤣🤣
The Drax Lock
Cheated with seeing eye dog.  Unacceptable
Cute
Now Master Lock HAS to come up with an actual challenge for LPL to undo this mischievous impostors work of ridiculing them even more 😂
When he doesn't even bother to pull out the pick and just goes straight for the rake :D
Wait, where is the lock, I didn't see it, cleverly disguised no doubt.
When the letter talked about a camouflage coating my brain immediately thought of a stretched jpeg of john cena printed out and taped to the lock body…
Muahah
It's faster for lpl to open the lock by picking it than just using a key lmao.
Excellent both the sender and LPL 🤣
Damn I couldn’t see how he picked it can someone tell me cause I can’t see it man.
A turning tool AND a wave rake? So it takes TWO tools to pick this lock? Wow, MasterLock really did up their security on this one...
Is this what all the younguns are talkin about when they say security through obscurity?
Wait is he bilnd or color blind?
notice how the vision problems were not adressed.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
How do you know that was not a decoy lock?
The only camouflage from Master Lock is that they think they are innovative.
This is no. 15 trending
I'd love to know what LPL uses to secure his home. Or even his tool shed. Wouldn't you?
It's interesting that they mention failing vision. If you think about that a moment, you realize that lock picking is done without the benefit of seeing what you're doing and should probably be doable even when blind.
I spotted a typo / Grammatical error in the letter; 'it's weakest link' should have been 'its weakest link'. Note my daring use of a semi colon, there. I might be infringing the rules myself
lol
Nice one
Wait LPL is a Maryland land too. Oh crap he's too close lol gotta change all my locks.
He raked the friggin thing? Savage! Low skill attacked that crap.
"This is the LPL and I put a piece of tape on a Masterlock and it opened. Thanks for watching."
Master lock : Here is a challenge from us! LPL : O kawai koto...
I honestly think I could make a lock that is unpickable or at least very hard
👍👍👍♥️
Yes I think the letter was a joke it doesn't seem that they're locked are going to improve and I wouldn't purchase them to be honest
Could've been a good April fools joke.
I was expecting a lock inside a massive ball of duct tape :|
I totally lost it when the wave rake entered in view
Thanks
Double slam on master lock. 🤣 That letter was a masterly takedown!
It took me longer to say Master Lock than for him to pick the lock open 🤣
I am so confused!!! What the hell did you pick. I couldn’t see anything.  Just you shaking your tools.  Incredible
The use of “it’s” vs the right “its” really irks me lol
The pink tape bit killed me!
🤣🤣
Mr. "President of Master Lock" - April's fool's day is still more than a month away.
omg so funny
Bitter sweet when the rake comes out, you know the video only has seconds lefts.
Sorry, I couldn't find the pink tape at Covert Instruments, link please?
to me that letter and the ease at which the lock was opened just embarrassed Master Lock further.  They must not take their company seriously.
LOL
This says a lot about their talent who engineer the locks, and those who manage or give directives 🤣
That is funny!  Thanks for running with it.... :P
Ooooh, too bad…somehow I have hoped that this letter is not a joke. Same thing for the lock that came with it.
Took longer to (find and) remove the weather cap than to rake the lock. Good gag!
🤣🤣
Thank god you put that pink tape on it, I would have never seen it
I would say it was a gag. Mastercrock would not pull a stunt like this as it is bad publicity.
"Commence the jigglin'!" - Jigglebillie, ATHF
Masterless Lock.
What lock?  I don’t see any lock.
The problem is how DO you make a lock that's tough to pick but must open simply with a key?
I half expected that there would be no lock at all.
When it takes you longer to list the tool and website you're using to pick the lock vs. the act of picking the lock itself....twice!
Ya but I don't want to put my expensive locks where I know they'll just get grinded off anyway lol long live affordable master lock 🙏 hahaha ❤ 🍻
I was honestly sort of expecting there to be no lock included lol. Hidden so well even the universe doesn't know it exists
I really hope the letter is real.
This is #16 on trending lol
Little known fact, it's called a wave rake because you wave your stuff goodbye when you use one of these locks.
Man, the comment section of your videos is as awesome as your videos. Love your work and the community you build here
That was better saved for April Fools day; but it was fun. Turning to the REAL MasterLock ... What's ya goona do? MasterLock:  We're goona call Ghostbusters 'cuse there no ghost of a chance we would have sent that!
Is there any lock in the Master Lock catalog that is actually good?
Oh lord, they did not send our man a rakeable lock!?
I love the "generous budget" and "tasking their most skilled engineers" resulted in "what if we paint it camo?"  This was a fun one though lol. You gave me a good laugh random person from California 🤣
Did BosnianBill send you this?
The letter had a grammar error. "It's"
That just made my day! More than that, it made my last almost 3 years' worth it. Thank you <3 <3 <3
"...our 'finest' engineers..."  Moral drops even lower for the "not as fine" engineers.
Did you keep the envelope? Where was it mailed from?
🤣
I would like to think they will send you a new lock with marked improvements soon.
I have to admit, this is very suitable for an April Fool's event...
How do you have guns in MD? They're tyrants...
lmao this is the best
Misspelled its* in the letter. All that work and couldn't get an editor. :(
I dunno, maybe this tactic actually works. Pretty sure this is the longest single-masterlock video he's ever made.
My mom used to load the UPS truck that went to Master Lock's headquarters. They're located in Milwaukee.
Gotta love these jokes, though it'd be funny if Master Lock actually tried to challenge LPL.
Next video a vault.
Lpl fr just hung a piece of tape on a string and picked the air as if there was a lock there 🙄
🤣🤣🤣
To whomever out there that wrote & sent this letter:  Thank you! 😆🤣😂
Lockpickinglawyer did you really think you could trick us? There is clearly no lock in your hand, only a piece of metal with a pink piece of tape around it.
Lol has got to be a joke! :)
Can you make a video on how you made the core float while picking it?
Is there *ANY* lock manufactured by this company that gets any respect from you?
Instead pretending.. they should fired the engineer who design this lock
I was totally thinking the box would be empty.  i.e. the lock has an invisibility cloak.
I love that it's always "We".
April fools day came early this year?
When he busted out the rake I felt real bad for Master Lock
This has got be a joke on Master Lock sender part
I think, at this point, the best thing Master Lock can do is print "As Featured on the Lockpicking Lawyer" on all their packaging.
The letter's obviously fake. I know Master Lock's bad at making locks, but I'd like to imagine they at least know the difference between its and it's
The reading with his finger made me wonder if he actually had vision troubles 😳
Challenge? That looks so easy anyone with 0 to a little skill in lockpicking could open. I am almost certain LockPickingLawyer will agree when I unpause within a few seconds after he have raked it again after two minutes and fourteen seconds in this video. Edit: Do I even need to state that I was 100% right???🤣
1:15 Typo in letter: "...as and a...". Therefore, must be fake since Masterlock *never* mistakes a make. ;-)
👍 für den Algorithmus
A master lock video that lasted more than 30 seconds I'd consider that a win!
This was absolutely amazing lol. I would love for a company to do something like this and I really hope it happens sometime in the future!
It took longer for the intro , everyone at master lock should quit
How sad 😔
This guy finds exquisite delight in shitting on Masterlock
What exactly were you trying to pick? I couldn’t see anything but your hands haphazardly moving around. ???
😂BAAAWAAAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAA!  I love it.  Thanks to the contributor.
The Master lock company seems intent on baiting you. In a  way they are Master baiters
I bet it took him longer to open that letter than it did to pick that lock.  Come to think of it, that raking tool does kinda look like a letter opener🤔
But what was he even picking? Please film in infrared next time.
What I’ve learned is I should trust a camouflage blanket thrown over my shed before I trust a Master Lock
They spelled "its" wrong.
Well played whoever sent that.
I'm confused. What is he picking?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 picked in seconds. LPL FTW! It's never a fluke.
That was a GREAT letter!  Whoever composed it has their Corporatese down pat, it may even be their native language.
The best way to get keys separated from lock!
The good old days of trashing Masterlock are back. Yaaayy😂
I am not interested in locks…. Nor am I a locksmith. Yet as a business owner I like to purchase the best locks out their for my company…. I read, reread, compare locks etc… you understand. I’m a subscriber because your website and you are extremely truthful and honest…. And as a truthful Quebec, Canadian, always wondered if somewhere you are a lawyer and this is your most enjoyable art form. I wish you good health and thanks for your videos…..
This would have been a lot funnier if the lock had been epoxyed shut. Like, really obviously.
Executives at Master Lock: Quick make a new pink series. And state for the exclusive use of the PINK community!  LPL you made my day!
Maybe a Master Lock employed Crazy Glue
But how could you make a lock not that picable?
You should of said the truth, il pick this again to make this video a bit longer
Very funny!!  Cracked me up.
hahaha
I'm pretty sure that's a real letter from Masterlock judging by the quality of their locks.
The letter was the real distraction.
LMFAO
Kinda early for April Fools.
I was expecting a look in the exact colour tone of his desk, so it's "invisible" to him 😆
LPL is too overpowered. He took on a lock infused with Jhon Cena cells. Legend
To lower the morale would require personnel to have any 😅😅 I don't think they even know what it feels like to have a morale 😅
Maybe this letter send by other lock company .
It would be even funnier if it turns out to be an actual official challenge from Master Lock.
Food for algorithm ;-)
Mcnallyofficial faster than this opening this lock.
That Cena lock lasted linger than I thought it would.
"has been devastating to our employees"  That line right there makes me believe this is legitimate. I'm pretty confident in saying the vast majority of employees don't care at all.  EDIT: That's what I get trying to comment before finishing the video. Oops!
If I had to choose between a Master lock and a Rookie lock, I would buy the Rookie lock without hesitation.
The top engineers?  Where, China?  Budget, 1,000 Chinese Juan.
Best video I've seen in a while.  Reading letter slowed you down considerably. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
As soon as he chose a wave rake, I laughed, as if he is intentionally adding insult to Master Lock by using a wave rake!
Great video
so if it was a fan, masterlock might make a lawsuit, who knows. i mean they did impersonate someone and they probably don't like that
When the letter takes longer to read than the  lock takes to pick 😂
Security by obscurity!
lol
I believe falsifying letterhead is actually considered fraud, so uh, hopefully masterlock finds this joke funny too 😬😬😬
That is very well done,  I think the LPL dry sense of humour sells it  almost too well. 😁
Why does it say Damascus
It's a joke how easy locks can be picked. My question is will there ever be a lock that LPL can't pick open? My other concern is showing the world how to pick open locks can't be a good thing,what about those of us that use locks to secure our worldly possessions? This is basically an instructional manual for theives isn't it?
Next time they send the same letter, but without a lock. xD
It took longer to read the letter than to pick the actual lock.
Good giggle, well written and well read!
Better give that seeing eye dog extra biscuits!
I didn't see any lock, only a pink piece of tape!
I think a lock that looks like John Cena would have been more of a camouflage
Oh no, not the rake
I think I know what the flaw was - they forgot to camouflage the shackle.
"I found it by groping at the place where the lock should be hanging about"
“Let’s do it one more time, just to make sure it’s still there…”
Ha!
The letter arrived 6 weeks (-1 day) too early.
I liked it.
Oh no, a camo lock, we need to put a 0-2-0 village in range to the picker monkey!
It was from John Cena
Master Lock always gets the last laugh, because the great majority of reviews on Home Depot or Amazon are done by people who have recently purchased their locks, which have not yet faced a theft attempt. Thus those reviews are all about ease of use or weather resistance, and Master Lock does great at those things. Security's rarely a consideration.
ah yes time for the wave rake XD
The misuse of "it's" really sells the idea that it came from a Master Lock higher-up.
Ha!  You feel for it!!  The honey pot lock!!!  There's a second lock, and you didn't pick it.  Looks like it pick'd you.  Classic diversion, turn, prestige.
This was great
Thinking outside the box would be coming to the realization that spending a penny per lock to add security pins would be a lot cheaper than the value of sales they undoubtedly lose to this channel.
Lol 😆 🤣
Was it the error in the letter in the 3rd paragraph that gave it away?  🤦‍♂
You know it's bad when he takes out the rake
how do i lockpick?? its for a... project in south america
😂
Won't lie, I was half expecting this lock to be one of the "not a lock" locks when he was like "we pride ourselves on being innovators" so I present you the only lock that 100% can't be picked... because it's not a lock!
Would have been so much better if John cena was wrapped around the lock.
Someone send him a lock with loctite in the pins so he can’t actually open it, because no one can.
I'm dying 🤣
Master Lock tell you what. Just ban your employees from accessing LPL channel. Problem solved👍🏼
Damn that was fast. These so called best Engineers must has shat themselves a.dozen times.
I still cant see the lock..?
lol wave rake
Ahhhh ha ha😂🤣😅🤣🤣 Due to Master locks recent rake attack the employees of Master Lock are now eligible for PTSD counseling😉
as soon as he palmed the pink tape I lost the lock... where did it go ???
😀😃😄😁😆😅
That was the decoy lock they sent you with the hidden lock, for you to pick the wrong lock... You still have not picked up the coated one...😏
a almost 3 min masterlock video? i also had to double check for the date to see if its april first :D
They were not serious, just kidding. But got a free advertisement for an interesting product to any hunter. Not bad and pretty wise! 😄
Break into master lock and break into the CEOs office
This was a really good idea by them. They obviously know how many locks of theirs have been torn to shreds so might as well ingratiate yourself to the community with humility and humor. Good marketing move.
This would be hilarious if it was actually masterlock that sent this.
To be fair, if LPL hadn't had the seeing eye dog, the challenge would've been successful.
I’m convinced he makes these himself for content lol.
Would been funnier if there was no lock in the box .
LPL clearly cheated here by using a pink strip of tape. Without this he could not have located the lock to pick it :D
Well most company CEO, are really that stupid, you never know if it's fake.
when they mentioned "you can't pick it if you can't find it" i thought they didn't send a lock at all, like it was just that well camouflaged
Lol, I hope someone from Master Lock actually sent it
I have enjoyed these videos for many years, but Heh guy- Didn't your Mom tell you pointing to each word as you read slows you down hugely? Or is it even worse- Perhaps some of your viewers can NOT read??
I 3d printed a wave rake at work to open a master lock that they had lost the key for. Took me all of 15 seconds to get it open with ZERO lockpicking experience. Just knowledge gained watching LPL.
Lol
Master lock should make a lock with solid pins with detents but no shear line and send it to him.
should try and get a lock from the mission impossible team....this lock will self destruct in 15 seconds
I was hoping there would be no lock. Or more like he would think that there is no lock but he just would not be able to see it because of its excellent camouflage.
Absolute Gold
The problem was they didn't camouflage the top part.
Hahahahahahahaha. Well played... seems like something PACLOCK would have a part in, but I can assure everyone (and you too MLC) that we're completely innocent here!  Now that I think about it, though, maybe I need to have a talk with our pesky laser that seems to have a mind of its own and tends to do things like this. Could be a chance it really went rogue and partnered up with someone willing to take things a step further!!! Pretty sure I cut off internet access for the laser after it's last stunt though. But I didn't check its pockets for a cell phone...
Chad with the mad corporate writing skills
Guy makes picking locks in real life easier than in Skyrim.
If a rake can open your 🔐 you are fucked
I was 90% expecting LPL to set the letter aside (with the lock laying on the table underneath it) and then say something like “Well, I’m not sure if they simply forgot to include the lock, but the only thing I found in the package was this letter.”
Hahaha  This is actually so well written, i love it
*wave rake comes out* ... Audience: Oh no, don't ... this is brutal! I can't watch that.
Imagine only having to take a hairpin and a paperclip with you. I’d be able to stop stabbing my leg everyday with my 44 keys!
I rather want to believe someone used Master Lock's name for prank... What a joke lool
I do genuinely wonder what the higher ups at masterlock think of your videos, cuz you know some cheeky bastard has sent your vids to them at some point
I’ve never heard LPL lie before but “I hate to further damage employee morale at master lock” was a flat out lie and we all know it
[1418] Master Lock's Best Lock?
"masterlock HQ": blast! thwarted again!  perhaps next time, we'll camouflage the shackle as well.  50% more hidden.
wery nice letter
Would've been funnier if they didn't put a lock in there at all
5 seconds with a wave rake - definitely an authentic Masterlock
He even bypassed the "camouflage" with a piece of tape 😂
Definitely a joke letter, but still funny
By the way, I love your channel, keep up the great work 🤠
And now I thought they "cemented" the lock...
When you see the wave rake, you know its gg.
Free advertising 🙌 👏 Nice one Master Lock
Bam!! Amazing as always.
The only thing more humiliating is if you picked the locks one handed. Behind your back while watching a master lock commercial or with your feet ?
They should use the technique developed in the shivering isles - don't disguise the lock as other things, just include a million identical locks, with no indication of which (if indeed any!) are the correct lock.  That way, a lock picking wizard will go physically insane desiring the treasure inside the cage but so many locks, which one's the right one?  Utter madness awaits any who make the attempt!  Oh you picked that one?  Aha!  Maybe it was the right one, maybe it wasn't - I'm not going to tell.  I'm locked in a room up in the corner that you can't see.  Better keep going, then!  Wouldn't want to fail the challenge!  Mowouhahahaha!
THIS WAS SO FUNNY.....thanks to the one that did this great prank!!!!!!!
3 minute vid master lock takin L’s
LPL: robs bank LPL: puts all the money back LPL: let’s do it again to prove it wasn’t a fluke…
Gag
The masterlock assassins are coming, but they cannot get the lock off the door.
Don't love how official they made the letter look, but either way a great goof
Can someone drop a time stamp for when the lock appears I can’t see it
oh boy... :D I don't know what to say. :D
LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is probably the best master lock video yet. You actually got them to write you!
If this was real I'd buy me a Master lock.
Master lock would’ve had better luck sending you their newest invisible lock. That’s actually what I thought this was going to be, just a letter.
Sorry I just seen you jiggling a pick about no lock seen
Funny🤣
Haha! Yeah, no flukes found: a parasitic flatworm, some flatfish, broad triangular plate on an anchor, lobes of a whale's tail. But especially liver flukes - those are nasty. Just kidding...nice, fun letter and video. Cheers!
Why is he holding a shackle like that. as if there is a lock body attached to it
I didn't see the lock you picked. Fake news
So the trick is to tape a letter to your lock. Turns a 3 second lock to a three minute lock
🤣😆😂😝
Funny video LPL pretending to opening a Master lock. Some great video skills letting half of the rake disappear. Not sure i get it but amusing.
Haha nice
That was a brilliant troll. Breaking out the wave rake, you know its over.
What lock?
They should have put a piece of tape over the keyway. Would have added 20% to the pick time.
LPL tested to verify that this was not a FLUKE-branded lock, and he is indeed correct. It was just a Master Lock disguised as trying to pass off as a FLUKE, albeit unsuccessfully.
Masterlock - Generous Budget and a Camo Design Padlock  LPL: Rake
I still hope one day you'll make the master key for master lock - a master lock blank cut down into a rake
I'm wondering if that's even a Masterlock under that cover :D
That wasn’t a raking attack. That was a low skill jiggle.
Like my dad always said “ locks just keep honest people honest “. 😁
If Master would really like to make their locks invisible, may I suggest they paint them ultraviolet.
LMFAO😄 Best humor of the week!
Is there a lock you can't pick?
I think blister packing slows LPL down the most.
think outside the lock
Already started feeling bad(for the impersonator,) once I noticed the video was half way through..lol
The low skill raking attack opened what?!  All I see is a shackle!
This is only made more hilarious by the fact that there is actually a camo Masterlock... and that means they seriously considered the paint job as a security feature that would make the lock more hard to find.
🤣👌
Almost thought the letter was legit but this was definitely a fan letter. Still funny.
Arent all of their locks vulnerable to a shim?
Yuo**
🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious that it took LPL longer to tell viewers where to buy the picking tools from than to actually pick the lock.
It only took a while for the seeing-eye dog to find this product because LPL asked it to "find the lock"... and the dog wasn't sure this qualified.
Took longer to read the letter. 😄
They forgot to make the keyway camo then he would have never been able to find it
A lock I had a long time in my military days well it looked like it.
Oh hell all I seen was the letter that lock was really camouflaged when you brought it out all I seen was a piece of pink tape how the hell do you open something you can't see wow good job anyway if we can't see it how do we know you even opened it that's for you to prove LOL keep up the good work
It took longer to say that you can buy the wave rake on his site than it took to open the lock.
I know someone who pretended to be the CEO of a major U.S. company. It cost him 6-months in Federal prison.
The only way to beat LPL is to send him a brick
Really weird watching an LPL video without a lock.
What lock? I can't see one.
I needed the laugh today.   Thanks to whoever thought of this challenge for LPL!
Hey if one time you are unable to pick a lock, you can't use the ending phrase 'in any case' anymore agreed?
Good thing it had a generous budget
You could have just stared at it and popped it open.
Obviously the budget wasent high enough
Should have saved this for April first!
But what about the other 12 locks he included in the package?
These are almost boring, the LPL is the most entertaining aprt
Why are you shaking your tools at nothing?
Master lock issued a challenge? I wonder what it could be, perhaps something like "Find a lock from us, you won't open in under a minute!" ?
"wave rake" ----welp this video is over.
Haha 😅
To the one who sent it: I don't know who you are, but you're a goddamn genius lmao
I'm actually surprised a lock was included. I was expecting the joke to be an "invisible lock". The cammo tape was a great visual gag and I'm glad they went that route rather than my lazy gag expectations.
Took longer to read the letter than pick the lock LOL
My joke would be super gluing the lock closed.
me as president of that business I'd pay a consultancy for you to fix all that unsafe crap
I took him longer to read the letter... I have no words for how devastating that must be for master lock employees XD
If you were blind, you could feel the padlock to find the keyhole.
I won’t get an reply but if I send you a diebold and a lagard safety deposit box lock can you try and pick it?
Should they be renamed to "Rookie Lock"?
All very well ridiculing Master lock and showing how to pick easy stuff, Why not try a real challenge like Evva 4KS or Abloy Protec, the answer is you are just not up to it !!!
too funny!
The pink tape is the only thing that is visible. Such a good camouflage!
That's why you're the best. Thanks for all you do.
would you please do a review on the lock pick tools from aliexpress?
I just had to check if the publishing date wasn't 1. April 🤣
The way you raked that lock, it reminded me of how I used to open locks when I was in high school. A clay knife from art class make the best tool. Stick it in the lock, jiggle it and presto, opened like magic.
Locks are for honest ppl
Should have used the vinyl(?) covering his desk to camouflage it 😼
Oof
Thats pretty funny.
Thanks LPL
This was a joke on master lock's part, right?
This is gold! I don't know who sent that letter but, props to you! XD
Where is the lock he picked all I saw was pink tape???!!!!!!
Pick-time has to be as magical as there is a  shadow on the lock of a genie flying a carpet. 1:43
i cant wait for april fools day
I was honestly expecting it to be the same color as the table, so when you put it on the table it disappears
Its very weird to watch someone somehow manage to pick thin air but I gotta give you props for being able to do it.
Post mark was Chino California?  Probably from an inmate at CIM - Chino.  (CIM = California Institution for Men).  Probably got caught using his “Covert Companion” on a lock he shouldn’t have been toying with!
Our best engineers designed this: Proceeds to get picked in less than 10 seconds.
Great video!
You rock just amazing video and amazing Master Lock for such a elegant letter again reiterating you are amazingly awesome can't wait to start a band too have a great day love your videos they are the best hands down in this sector of life
Missed opportunity here. When he read "cement" on the letter, I thought the lock would have its keyway literally cemented so it can't be picked
*READ WITH YOUR EYES, NOT YOUR FINGER!*
I wonder how many people have used LPL to commit a crime 😂😂😂obviously the companies need better locks
Is there a lock that he failed to pick
This is one of the greatest trolls in history. Thank you for playing along, it makes it so much more enjoyable to watch
Sure, but now try to pick the lock WITHOUT the piece of pink tape!
Well ya learn something new every day. I didn't know they watched LPL videos in China 😂
I thought it was just gonna be an empty box.
"I have just a received a-"  Cease and desist? "Letter." Oh
This has to be a joke its no different from any other
Once the wave rake came out, that camo lock was a goner.
This video was hilarious.  Considering that you use the same table for each video, might have been impressive if they'd actually camouflaged it.  Having said that, the "forest camo" was a cute touch.  Reminds me of a shirt my nephew had a few years ago that was completely camouflaged in "forest camo" and had white letters that said, "You can't see me." lol
*its weakest link
Every time LPL brings out the wave rake you know the lock is going to get stomped on!
A missed opportunity for a truly impossible lock for him to pick: one that's entirely covered in mirrored surfaces
Lpl could you please do a score on each lock you pick, because it’s fun to watch your videos, but now choosing a lock is like going down a rabbit hole
best video ever
I was seriously expecting that there was nothing else included with the letter.
uhhh i didnt see any lock there, just a flying pink tape, wth?
Me:Sees video is 2:54 .... Maybe he was stumped.  LPL: Proceeds to read letter for over half the video  Me: that explains it
LPL should have shaken the envelope and overlaid a metal clunk sound as if an invisible lock had fallen on his desktop.
I was feeling bad for Master Lock but at the end... 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Note to self, leave reading material near locks, thieves will read the letters before attempting the pick.
When I was a kid, I heard the phrase as, "locks are only for honest people". For years I thought it meant that criminals didn't secure their stuff, and that's why things came up missing. Duh. I mean, I eventually found out that it's "locks are only for keeping out honest people" and watching these things fail in seconds make that seem just so true.
A shackle without a body?
Facepalm
Ee
12 year old with a word processor
Lmao thats so fake rip poser
Great title. Sweet burn on Master Lock.
Wow a video over 2 minutes long? Must be decent. Oh wait, there's a letter.
That’s so crazy that you were able to open it without being able to see the lock
Woah he picked the air and a click happend
LPL is kinda like goku "I heard your lock is said to be unpickable, let me pick it!"
All I saw was LPL pull out a metal hook with a pink tab on it and say it was a lock. Am I being fooled here?
Amazing how you can pick an invisible lock.
Humor. The universal language. Thanks to all the participants. Loved it.
Good fun :)
Thanks for the laugh!
так се юмор...
Nice lol
Ironically I noticed the camouflage first before the pink tape.
LPL read that letter way longer than picking the lock XD
"Shit, we became a meme..." - Masterlock, probably.
I was expecting a lock made from bubble wrap and tape. It usually takes you longer to open the package than open the lock most of the time. ;)
What lock took him the longest to pick?
At least I didn't spot any spelling errors on the paper, and it looked decent enough.
Had to put lock in a baggie in case it pissed its self.
MasterLock is the Yugo of physical security…
Hey LPL, I am in need of a motorcycle lock... but unsure what i should get... Any suggestions? price doesnt matter
LPL, we can all see this is a Master lock and not a Flute....Oh, my bad... You said Fluke. Great video as always. Good day to all from Reynosa, Mexico.
XD
I thought it was still February. April 1st is way off.
LPL distracted for about 90 seconds on a letter.... LPL pulls out wave rake and i literally start laughing because I knew it was all over within 2 seconds or less.
shouldve included no lock and said there was one anyways
Isn't impersonation of this degree illegal?
hillarious!
Under 3 minuet video with letter reading and picking the lock twice. What a shame Masterlock.
LPL Sigma Grindset - Starts video - Reads Letter - Picks lock - Leaves
They should have taken out all pins.  :)   why would you need pins in a lock that you cant find to pick anyway?
This guy's website is where Dexter bought his lockpicks
Gg
We did it! Our record now is increased by 0.69 second! Lets took another year to improve our generous budget project
Thanks to the LockpickingLabrador for sniffing out the lock for LPL , otherwise this video would have been much more difficult.
This is a lock? I thought he was lock-picking grass.
hahahahahahahah
LPL is master every lock in the world .. Hahaha..
Terrible vision?! Lmao, they underestimated LPL and that's where they were wrong. LPL is a god.
Kinda disappointed it didn't end with "if you can't find the lock in a parcel you already lost".
Lmao
R&D? Sounds more like marketing.
Talking of laughs .....can't wait for April 😉
I don't usually laugh out loud at your videos but that pink tape line got me.
Woah! How did you make the tools float like that?!
dude that is faster than using the actual key..
I thought that they just didn't include one and said it was invisible.
I thought the lock was going to be the same grey as the table :p
I had no idea you lived in maryland! You’re only a little over an hour from me, I live in greater annapolis
The wave-rake... the master lock master key.
"...wave rake..." Welp, this one will be short
As soon as he took out the wave rake I said to myself "Ouch, that is brutal!" Glad he did not open it with a piece of the soda can aluminium... although that could have been possible.
It takes longer to read the letter ... Sigh
well that was a let down I thought maybe they developed something good! the letter leading up to the rake attack was pretty inspirational!
"The Office of the President" oh golly
Does MasterLock still have engineers? I figured they were all marketing executives and MBAs.
reading the letter was slower than picking the lock
In your face Masterlock!
I thought it was going to be the packaging that slowed you down but nope it was the reading of the letter that made video longer then 20 seconds 😂
WOW!?!  How embarrassing.
Its clear the supervisor of the project kept the money.
This is without dout master locks best lock 😭🤣🤣
Just imagine the poor "engineer" watching this knowing Monday he's getting chewed out or fired.
Chino!!!
That letter definetly slowed him down.  They won. 😂😂😂
What a waste of time.
Silly masterlock, you're supposed to camouflage the cylinder, too!
heheheee
i give it 100% that the Camo-Lock was in LPL's stash and the letter came in a standard letter envelope without a padlock
Delicious!
Someone has a both a great sense of humor,  and far too much free time, lol.  Loved the Vid,  and whoever thought this up, well done!
I don't know which is the bigger joke, the fake Master Lock letter, or the lock itself.
I have to unlock and lock back like 130 containers each day at my job .. I swear it's faster to rake them open than to put the key in
You have some good viewers
Those employees and the CEO are now probably jobless....
I've been watching LPL since he started the channel. It has *never* been a fluke.
Yeah that's what they WANT you to think. In reality they made this lock and thought "Huh, how can we get someone to test this for free? I know, let's send it to LPL disguised as a joke."
U alr kn if lpl pulls out the rake that lock is done for 💀🚫🧢
I swear to god if this guy was robbing a house, he'd relock the door on his way in to pick it again "just to make sure it wasn't a fluke"
😂😂
You are a high class internet troll. Cheers. 😂
Was that lock really included in the letter, or you just picked (pun intended) one of your own? It would have been awesome if there was no lock and you just did the same movements on a invisible non-existent  pretend-lock.
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍
I thought the lock was going to be in a block of cement.
I feel like if you use master locks you should just carry the tension and rake instead of keys. Damn near faster 😂
How to create a viral add on a 20$ budget
Enjoyed the laugh. Thanks.
And just how did you pick open a piece of pink tape?
They got me, I couldn't see the lock
“Innovation” my foot! 🤣
Hint: It's never a fluke
OhCoolImma1st
You missed the main feature of this lock. Given the right background this lock is completely invisible. 🤣
Master Lock should not laugh or cry here 💥🤠 But actually call up LPL…
Whoever send you that letter and lock definitely knows their memes and probably uses Reddit
If it was a genuine letter from Master Lock, they would have forgotten to seal the envelope.
This guy is the Bob Ross of lock picking.
And if you look very closely down the barell you can see the disappointment
I still think the best defense against LPL is that security plastic that electronics come in.
i wonder if this one will stand up.... oh the wave rake.
I don’t get it.
LOOOOOOOOL
Security through obscurity
HAHA - thx chino guy, I needed a laugh today :)
02:10 It is definitely not a Fluke®.  They make fine instruments.
I'll bet you hear from the Real company now! If they aren't too embarrassed!
That was entertaining. Not as much as when LPL got into his ex-girlfriend’s back door, but still amusing.
Lol....
Master Lock executive: What are these security pins you speak of?
apply moisture to the burned surface
They should've put an abus lock and a master lock sticker over it
Haha, That really brightened up my morning. Thank you
is  it April already
They should invent a lock with no keyway. Then at least they'd be able to have a rake-resistant lock :D
i thought they were gonna really cement the lock
The sick burn is... that's not a Master Lock under the camo skin, it's a Yale!
"Master Lock" just lost more of its reputation due to that letter. ;) That post mark is "genuine" for sure.
After "as for the Masterlock inpersonator", I almost expected something along the lines "you've violated 18 USC § ... and will find a subpoena in your mailbox shortly"...  He is a lawyer, after all..
HAHAHAHAHAHAH
How is Master lock still trading ????
It is difficult to watch this video, I can't see what LPL is picking.  I can only assume when he says he's opened it, that he has.  **dislike**
Just imagine the human tragedies: Invisible locks would mean burglars who cannot enter and who cannot understand what is happening. Most of them are less skilled than our LPL. Careers will be ruined, families will suffer the consequences. Crime rates will go down and the entire security industry will see so many bankruptcies. Masterlock should not so badly rock the boat and suddenly produce good locks!
Master lock should just substitute a Subaru lock into its products to improve security.
"I tasked our engineers with developing a lock that would be equal to your skill.  Enclosed you will find a Master Lock which has been welded shut."
KEKW
SO well done!
Is this an out of date April's fool?
comedy at its finest :D
😂
Has it ever been a fluke the first time?
Rake pick, hurray! It is best sign that lock is a garbage.
99% of the comments section are proof that nobody watches the video right till the very last second!
This was very clever, someone out there was very clever. :)
High quality trolling. I approve.
my buddy and a couple family members actually work at MasterLock HQ here in Oak Creek; gonna send them this and see what they think lol.
With the wave take, the jiggle - is the up and down? Or back and forth?
When you see the wave rake, you know it  will be done in a second
Hahaha
LPL, I recently got a flexible shackle gun lock from my uncle and I easily bypassed it with a screwdriver I was wondering if you could try that with some similar locks and see if it was just a fluke
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When the wave rake comes out you know red faces pop up.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣Great video!!!
The president of a large company would never write "it's" for "its" in professional correspondence.  Clearly it's a hoax.
Well at least they have a sense of humor lol!
Should give them more budget
Fair play you just shat on the whole of master lock in a couple of seconds. Bravo sir
you still didn't receive the 3d printed unpickable lock from Tim Hutt ?
I was expecting a lone shackle.
I liked the bit where you picked the lock
Master Lock was SO close to making the most advanced lock... but they forgot to camouflage the shackle 😂
Taking "security through obscurity" to new levels.
What? It's just a shackle no lock body? That's not very secure~
I'm confused, LPL talks about a lock but all I'm seeing is him waving a tension and rake tool around a little bit of pink tape 🤔
master Lock I have a design that will change your company forever even the lock picking lawyer would not be able to accomplish picking this lock!
Normally like picking lawyer videos are good I see him pick a lock. But this time he was just playing with a couple picking tools and some pink tape so I don't see what the point is
Love it  ❤   !!! --- should have saved it for April Fools Day though.
This is subtle, but I appreciate you using a 🤣 emoji instead of a 😂 emoji. The former is fine, but the latter is an abomination to humanity.
I couldn't see. What happened?
I'm still trying to figute out what the hell he picked?!
Masterlock doesn't care.
next month's vid - the LPL breaking into the ML president's office and relaxing in his chair.
Wait.  Where's the lock?
Yes, wouldn't it be good for consumers if the lock picking lawyer was appointed CEO of master lock.   With a team of engineers, imagine what he could produce!
Am I the only one awaiting a challenge letter from Mistress Lock?
That’s funny
Wave rake out
LMAO.....egg on Master locks face for sure. I don't understand how a company like Master lock can set out and design, fabricate and provide you with a lock that was defeated so easily by something like a rake attack, I think that is what you called that tool. I just don't get how master lock didn't give that to other pickers and say, test this, and let us know where it is vulnerable? CRAZY.
early aprils fool and a great one
I still don't see what lock he is talking about
All I could see was the pink tape,,  what lock
You know, master lock probably is working on a challenge for you, it would be a great way to advertise both you and more importantly to them, the locks the make.
Who says that's a Masterlock?
2mins in the video. I am nervous and pausing the video to write this comment.
didn't the founder of Masterlock used to be the LPL of his era? one can only wonder how they fall so low...
Lol I love this ....so happy that LPL went along with it ... you're awesome 👍 dude
The pink tape is comedy gold
I wish lockpicks where legal for me to carry. Would help with my work if we can get back into buildings if we lock outselfs out by mistake. But love your videos it is always funny and nice to see what locks are worth a damn and what are jokes
Wait, where's the lock, I just see a floating pink thing.
Ok, this whole video is absolutely hilarious. Kudos to the viewer who sent this in and to yourself for having so much fun with the scenario.
Fantastic, keep up the good work, cheers from the home of the Beatles.
"let's do it one more time to make sure it was not a fluke" Spoiler.. It was not a fluke.
I just want to say a word here about discrimination against the physically disabled community.  I'm one of those unfortunate souls who are color-blind, most particularly I cannot see "pink," in fact have no idea what "pink" actually IS.  All I know for sure is that you appeared to be picking a nonexistent lock.  This is unconscionable neglect on your part, if not outright bigotry.  I would unsubscribe, but I have no idea where the button is.
That’s awesome!!
Is typical of upper management to tell the engineers to "think outside the box" ...is an old and over used cliche by incompetent- out of touch managment and you proved it.  How does somebody think outside the box? Clear your mind, is another.  How stupid.
The letter actually did inadvertently mention how to make the lock unpickable.  Cement.  Just a dab of cement in the keyway and even the LPL won't be able to pick it.  May cause minor inconvenience for authorized key holders...
Good joke there 🤣
😁
Good stuff. I love the sense of humor 👍
LPL wrote the letter for a clicks and to advertise his gear.
The pink tab is brilliant 😂
🤣😂
lol
Im weezing
If the camouflage case had hidden the key hole. With self closing rubber
Well, it's still progress, right.
I'm already laughing after reading the title......
Reading the letter took more time than actually picking the lock!
Everytime i see a rake i know its gonna be humiliating for the lock hahaha
The pink tape!  Too funny :)
The best security component was the letter. Clearly ML should start forcing people to read terms and conditions before they gain access to b the keyway.
Can you shim that lock open?
Masterlock won't be able to recover from this.
i hope something really sneaky and cool and funny will be posted on the april's fool day,for everyone to giggle
They tricked you into advertising to 3.7 million people
Due to the camouflage lock, I could not see it.
Dude… how is he making that metal “U” float above his hand…?
Would have been even better if the lock doesnt close, cant pick whats not locked.
That lock needed a cigarette after than rake action!
The part that the letter does not mention is that the lock was actually designed within one week. It only took over a year to send it to LPL because the workers at Master Lock accidentally dropped it on the ground and it took them 1 year to find it again due to the camouflage coloring. 🤣
🤣
master should just put a how to on their package if you lose the key.  gently tap on it with a hammer and viola.
Secret lock in the same place as before, clearly industry is booming..... And 3 seconds in....
Someone: *challenges LPL* LockPickingLawyer: hah nuts
Kinda obvious that master lock didn’t send that as a challenge 😂
Lock should have been "invisible".
Did we skip March?
I'm ashamed to admit i have a camouflage masterlock combination lock
IMO this is one of the best yet for the LPL. I needed this laugh today. Thank you.
I guess that's what happens when you move to Mexico with your assembly work!
That’s some advanced invisibility tech.
wait, where's the lock you picked?
Man this had me cracking up! The pink tape and all, good stuff! Good joke!
The letter is essentially an advertisement piece to elicit a higher level of disappointment
I've always wanted to time travel. Somehow I skipped the rest of February, went completely past March and woke up on April's Fools Day this morning.
where is the lock?
The only reason LPL doesn't show his face is so lock companies can't send hitmen after him.
"It took a while for my seeing eye dog to find it" Sounds like the camouflage did indeed add a significant amount of time to the pick attempt, not depicted in video.
Masterlock: "Behold! Our latest and greatest creation!"   LPL: "...hold my waverake"
Camouflage jokes.  You never see them coming....
No LPL... Not the wave rake for lord's sake...
Oh hey it's a No.3 in a plastic case
Just the plug for the rake took longer than the actual picking 😂
They should start selling letters to lock things up since it take more time to read than to pick their locks.
LOL
That's actually a brilliant idea! Let's make an invisible lock with invisible key hole and invisible key! No one can pick it if you can't see it!
Anyone else expecting LPL to open an empty box...I mean box with invisible lock?
This channel has me wanting to learn this skill just as another survival tool.
I really thought that master lock do something to hide the key way to prevent anyone to pick it..
Dude. You are funny as f@ck
I really wish Fluke would stray from multimeters and make an easily pickable lock, just to hear LPL get tongue tied when trying to show it wasn't an accident.
you have to hand it to the guys at Master Lock at least they have a sense of humor
My gosh! This was a long video. Took him so long to read the letter. I bet the company's intent was to try and make LPL make a video over 3 min long. Almost had him.
when you're halfway through the video and he's still reading the letter
it was so weird watching that pink tag flip around and suddenly there was a keyway! they have really outdone themselves with that camouflage coating. how long did it take your dog to find it?
Master lock is ass
I hope he never actually included a lock and lpl just went and found this one
That was pathetic. (;
Sure made that invisible lock there look easy, dude. Damn. Master Lock need to step up their game.
I think this is a new record for the flimsiest object to defeat a lock.
This is hilarious
Watch it not even be a master lock.
This was great!
Aw shoo, the pink tape, they're ruined
Master lock is like LPL’s Wiley coyote
Masterlock fa cup
lmao when the wave rake comes out haha
Anyone else just expect the lock to be a ball of duct tape with a shackle sticking out?
Moral sure isn't going to be any higher.
"Not the WAVE RAKE!" (said ala Princess Aura in Flash Gordon)
LOL! Well played!
LPL is so good he can seamlessly simulate raking open something that isn’t there. Very impressive.
At this point I think the people at Master Locks are just like: "If we ignore him, maybe he'll go away"
"The pickings will continue until morale and security improves".
Wait what was he picking? I saw a floating pink tape and the rake disappearing into nothingness
Would have been a better joke if nothing but the letter and keys were included
Is this real or not
Hehehe
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol funny
The guy who wrote this letter is an ex-employee of master lock who got fired for making bad locks last week 😃
Dang... that's a horrible lock...
The camouflage also allows them to deny it's a Master lock.
I thought it was gonna be cemented the key hole so you have to pry it open on the shackles, therefore it can't be picked. (but can be opened anyway)
The camo doesn't really work though. You can still see the shackle.
WOW that is FAST
….3D printing opportunity ahoy lol….a lock with clear parts
No it's a joke! It have to be a joke... Or it's a shame!!
Love it !!!
So... they are inventing the easiest lock to be picked? I am amazed.
lol, I thought for sure someone put super glue in the cylinder.  :47    "...cement masterlocks reputation..."
Once I heard WAVE RAKE 😂 I KNEW IT WAS A WRAP ... dam Master got BEATEN BY THE TRU MASTER 😎 LOCK 🔐🔒 🔓🔑🗝️
Person want it's lock back after locking in with the Keys lol
Thank God I watched till the end I thought Master Lock really did this
lol
LvL 1 lock picking... But.. Legendary 1000000000000
Oh boy. An engineer just lost their job.
At least the English on the letter appeared to be semi correct
These are the locks that make me want to build a disc-detainer lock with a dozen butterfly discs. Use strong metal and shackles, etc. But have it be entirely 0 cuts so just turning all discs as clockwise as they go opens it right up.
Thanks for the first good laugh of the day! 🤣
People who run companies have to realize if a human makes something another human can break it. This is why cyber security and locks will never be 100% reliable.
Plot twist: It really was the CEO of Master Lock and they actually think this will increase security.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍
I literally - and I mean literally - snorted.
I can pretend to imagine a situation where you need to camo the lock, sure, why not. but if there's an actual reason for this, shouldn't the shackle also be modified (either painted in matte coloring, or shilded with plastic) to stop people from detecting it?
Ok that letter backfired on master lock! If they are saying even a blind guy can pick our locks. Then that’s not good either!
What people don't put into consideration.. u can have the best lock in the world if its attached to a wooden door with a wooden frame (like most) anyone guy with a some mass can easily bust it open just by hitting it with his shoulder.I have done it to a wooden door with a metal frame and that's much harder.took a few tries.. note..it was my place.. I wasn't breaking into anyone's house..
I saw a YT short of this lock an the guy made your pick look slow. Sorry .
The Master Lock company should create some sort of tongue-in-cheek "official response" to send the message that they do have a sense of humor.
Is this for real no way
Sorry, did LPL just pick a floating piece of pink paper??
He is like Little Toddler, having to follow along with his finger as he reads!!!!!
what are you holding in your hands i cant see it?
I was expecting the lock to be encased in cement. Or concrete for some people. That'd really have cemented things like the letter says...
He's picking a piece of pink tape I don't see the lock???? Anyone else having this problem??????
I like the concept. You can't pick a lock that you can't see.
He didnt even pick a lock, he just jiggled the tool around in the air.
Better luck next time Master lock 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
WHAT?!?! I CAN'T SEE IT OMG IT'S INVISABLE!!!
Just needs a tape-resistant shackle.
MasterLock has been _picked_ to death at this point... Still hilarious.
I guess the finest engineers are going to lose their jobs....
Ha ha ha ! 👍
Master lock is getting gangbanged by so many youtubers and thats so funny.
I thought it’s either going to be in a concrete cube or it’s going to be welded shut. 🤣🤣🤣
I was expecting a fat weld on the shackle at first
I've seen this lock already from another lock picker content creator, he was dissapointed as well Lmao
Surely this was a joke from masterlock or someone acting as so.
He's lockpicking key faster than reading the letter.
This was great.
That was hilarious and very entertaining.
My first masterlock: Okay got something on 3, let's go back to 4.  My 12th masterlock: Okay just gonna put a little pressure then rake.
That wave rake is the plastic butter knife of lock picking, making cheap locks spread themselves like free viewing at a nude beach, most of it being actually quite ugly.
LPL, I am offering my services free of charge.  If you would like lasik surgery to rectify your bad vision, just let me know.
Yep, the rookie spelling mistake its/it's gave itself away.
Let me build a lock
Was that lock really included in the package? 😅
Where is the lock??
Post mark hahaha 😆 that little red stamp is a tattle tale!!!
LPL: "As you can see, the lock has been rendered invisible to normal sight. However, thanks to a team of local monkeys, I have acquired a set of red wristbands, and am able to view the lock as though it was without the camouflage."
There are no surprises here. Ouch.
I was not expecting the LPL to read with his finger like a 3rd grader. That was á good one😂
It can't be true... Someone made this letter up...
no matter how many times you see locks getting opened this quickly its still impressive
ProTip:  It's NEVER a fluke.
I checked the calendar. TWICE. Its still not April.
I now look forward to your “LPL April fools day” special.
Miseed an opportunity to make it LPL resistant and wrap the lock in 50 meters of duct-tape
This would have been perfect for April fools
Congrats on being recognised by an organization!
Master Unlocked.
I want to believe this is a real masterlock letter
I think locks are manufactured based on the just how dumb is the picker followed by the ignorance of the purchaser.
👀😦
Okay, but for real, as soon as I find my Master Lock word lock, I'm sending it over. XD
You nailed it
It would have been funnies if they didn't send any lock in the letter
As soon as you put the lock in your hand. I out loud said "Wave Rake" and kek'd when you pulled one out.
This made me smile, even through my anger and hurting heat over the murdered protester in Canada... thank you.
The pink tape helped us locate the non-existent lock, however... a *RED FLAG* would have probably been more appropriate.
we need a video of your "seeing lock dog" in action :)
I bought my genesis lock pick set last night! Cant wait until it comes in! Thanks for introducing me to a new hobby.
The concept of this whole challenge is flawed, you don't get worse eye sight by needing to focus on small details. Most common belief instead, is that if anything, your sight will improve. But that could be false, also.
I had no idea that masterlock was officially gonna send LPL a letter saying how his videos killed their employees morale
Once again proving that security through obscurity is a bad idea
Master lock...you've outdone yourself again.
i was half expecting the lock to open with just the turner!
Silly LPL, it's too early for April's Fools Day.
savage ! busting out the rake !
Brilliant.
Dude. Could you imagine if it came out that LPL actually was blind IRL this while time? He would become straight mythic status.
Funny.
i don't know what to do cry or laugh at master lock
imagine if they just didn't send a lock lol
Are we sure this was a joke?  Seems like something Masterlock would do...
Why is he raking the air
That's funny.. ROFL
whoever sent this, props 🤣 enjoyed this
i assumed there would just not be any lock at which point i was hoping to see him do all the usual movements just in the air and claiming to have opened it
I always smile when he take out the rake
OMG hilarious!
I can' believe this letter is not a fake ? Is this President so masochist... ???
I really wished that this was actually some sick joke from Master Lock, and how they’ve basically admitted defeat.
Anytime the wave rake comes out you know it's gonna be a bad time for the manufacturer
Hahahahaahahaahhahahaha
This is the John Cena of locks.
I bet it works if it's in the dark and raining without a flashlight or anything more than a bobby pin
Where was the lock? All I saw was some pink tape and a shackle floating around.
before i watch this - challenge and 3 minute video.... i already love this :D  edit: okay, i have no idea what he was doing there... just playing with the wind, where was the lock? xD
I am a new subscriber, so this may be a redundant question. However, have you considered engineering a lock that is really impossible to pick? If not impossible perhaps out of the league of most pickers. Seems to me that feat would be astronomically lucrative. Thanks in advance.
Gotta be a troll...hasn't it?
I just see a chromed bent metal bar with a pink tape on it, he's picking the air around it!
Master Lock need to make a special lock with a tiny inserts with hidden keyways to make it more troubble to open it. But nobody can stop a lock picker what so ever to find out the weak point at all. Thanks for the laugh Master Lock!
I would make a tool snaping lock. If I knew how lol.
I have a comment...... do you have any keys on your keychain? Do you even have a keychain?
I am missing the joke about lockpickers and poor eyesight?
I would have sent you a metalized/mirrored lock, such that we could see you while picking it!
They took any publicity is good publicity a little bit far on that one
In all fairness, if it wasn't for the pink tape you stood no chance of opening it... lol
I'm waiting for the clever viewer to send in a lock with no keyhole, thinking its enough to stop LPL only for LPL to crack that one open too
Outstanding👍
Lpl wrote this himself
I don't get it. I can't see lock nowhere in this video
As soon as I saw the rake I knew it’ was over
The president of master lock.. That's some title
KUDOS to the author. just what i needed, a good long laugh.
Guys I think LPL typed out that paper and he's just messing with us :/ There's obviously no lock there, hes just fiddling with his tools to convince us their actuality is a lock and he's actually doing something. I gotta say LPL you almost had me, ALMOST.
"And a wave rake" All right nurse, time of death is-
Pure entertainment. Nice work  to the sender and LPL 🤣
The Master Lock letterhead isn't the same as other official Master Lock documents. 🤔
This confirmed that LPL is a god. Nobody's gonna stop him!
First responders, emergency disaster response teams, mine sweepers, even exterminators have special dogs that can sniff out dangerous drugs, explosives, accelerants, cancers, bugs, and even electronic components. LPL has a dog that finds locks. Always the innovator.   I am perplexed at what he was doing with that magic floating pink tape. If that was a lock in his hands, I think a spray of paint or a wrap would help us all see it.
wow , not much gets past the LPL .. well played person in Chino California
They thought outside the box, they made the lock invisible.
Hilarious!
Master Lock: "but there was no impersonator.. that was our best lock."  LPL: "Ok folks, that was a good joke, kind of like every master lock I come across."
props to who made this 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm from Oak Creek, WI. I know exactly where Master Lock headquarters is. Numerous old classmates work there. Hopefully one day Master Lock starts watching your videos. Thank you.
Crazy
1:22 it is me or I can hear LPL trying to hold his laughter when reading 'camouflage'?
🤣
That is to funny..don't lose the lock
What's the tool you use to remove the round clips from the back of kwikset cores. I saw you use it in your fidget spinner video
Wow, wish I could have seen how he did that so quick. All I saw was a rake and that pink tab flapping in the breeze.
I remember when Master Lock used to advertise that you could shoot a hole thru their locks and still not open it...  Funny because it took longer to load the gun than it took to pick the locks.
Good one!
He started the picking at 2:01 and had it open at 2:04 Again master lock proves that the only thing they are good at is opening with ease.  I agree I believe the letter was a joke from a fan of the channel, however it wouldn't surprise me honestly if it was really sent by them as a joke themselves.
its* weakest link.
Is this a joke? Why LPL stroking his rake at nothing?
It must be using the orc logic where it's saying I'm invisible constantly
Well, maybe it was two flukes?
The wave rake is the ultimate humiliation tool
I don't get it, all I saw was the pink tape move, how do we know if he picked it?
Q: Why is this lock open?  A: I was in the back yard raking...
And he's "dissapointed"
What a waste of the development budget and shipping fee for this insult by LPL.
😂😂😂. That was funny.    Peace
The camo, bad as it is, probably is the most effective security feature of this lock. Good job, engineers!
I get the feeling that this was free advertising for Master Lock's new line of camo coated lock covers.
Isn't it illegal to forge official documents
i actually laughed out loud when he pulled out the rake
That was 🤣👍
free marketing ... Kinda.
I love that Master Lock has a sense of humor around your ability to just straight destroy any sense of security around their locks, lol
Jeffery Epstein and John McAfee didn't kill themselves       Also. Honk
It would have been funnier if they had sent no lock at all and claim that they did send it but you couldn’t find it
When you make more money on you  tube  Than you do pick locks congratulations you get  challenges like this
I "see" what he did there.
It would've been funny to have not included a lock at all. Good luck finding that!
He covered up the pink tape and all I could see was a turner sticking out of… nowhere? Where was the lock??
A for effort atleast Master Lock 😂
Nice joke, you almost had me
I was hoping that the lock inside would be glued or something similar so it cant be lockpicked.
Good thing they used a dull camouflage on the lock body to distract the eye from the solar flare bright chrome shackle
Here in the Executive suites...lmao!
Dear ML, use neodine magnet inside in key and padlock
Chino is the location of one of California's prisons.
I thought this was one of LPL's famous April 1st videos.
That's a good chin music........
LOL I think even your seeing-eye-dog could have picked that lock.
That's hilarious
Welp, actual master uses Oak Creek, WI for their HQ according to google, so Iunno if this'll hold water, but I'm pretty sure LPL was right it was a joke.
I like how all lock makers fasten the fricking keys to the shackle so we have to take off a key to get the key. Ironically, that is probably a better security measure than using a master lock..
"equal to your skills" would be a $100 padlock
This is hilarious!
Why is there pink tape floating around?
Over half the video is of him reading the letter. This doesn't bode well for the lock 😂
is there any lock that he cant pick at all
I thought it was going to be an empty package
You should have tried to find it again to make sure it was not a fluke.
Too funny
Omg lol just the letter was hilarious as you defeated another lock….
Pick a way lock could be next
Wait what did he do? Did he even lockpick anything
Haha. The pink tape is so funny.
The older master locks with the sawtooth keys if you ground down the teeth and just kept the nub at the tip you then had a master key that would open all the same style locks !
🤣👍
I have intelligence that they are now working on an invisible lock.
I was really hoping to have the reveal as a box enclosed in cement, to cement the engineers reputation for thinking outside the box. 😆
Master lock on suicide watch.
its*
camouflage probably is the best defense for locks that can just fall open from one dirty look.
Should have printed a face of John Cena and he wouldn't had found it😂
Best one ever
I like how he numbers all of his videos are numbered
Plottwist: It's an actual letter from Masterlock.
Should have let your seeing eye dog pick it open.
Is it April already? Had a very deep sleep indeed... but a good laugh today. Thanks
After a letter like that, I didn't expect there to BE a lock. Would've been brilliant if they didn't send hin one since "it's just THAT goodly camouflaged!"
Bravo.
Do you think a puzzle pop lock be high level security and pick proof?
Title: "Master Lock Sent Me a Challenge" LPL: "Challenge accepted."  Me: "What challenge?"
I still wish this was a real letter lmao
How did you manage to find it? It's basically invisible.
LPL took more time reading the letter than lockpicking it lol
when reading the letter takes longer than picking the lock
They forgot to take into account LPLs fantastic sense of smell. LPL is master at smelling bullshit from miles away, a skill he probably first developed as a lawyer and frequently uses to snuff out Amazon product marketing wankateering
What the dog doing
"our employees" The Chinese economic slaves that manufacture the locks.
Master Lock what now 😱
They send that shit for advertising, good or bad still advertising.
I was expecting the envelope to have come in an otherwise empty box. :-D
Anyone else get excited for the wave rake?
I was expecting a cement lock with a camo print.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀🤣💀😭😭😭😭👌🏽
"security is only as good as ITS weakest link"  (not "it's") Possessive pronouns do not have an apostrophe: mine, yours his, hers, its, ours, theirs.
"Low skill raking" is my go-to move in bed.
Genuinely love this channel, never picked a lock and never will.  Just find it entertaining and educational.
Can you at least show the actual lock in the next video, I got bored watching you wiggle your rake in thin air!
MASTER don't have engineers they BUY the Rights of other companies products.
He found the lock, then murdered it.
2minute video
What a nasty letter ? They mad bro
All I can see is a shackle with pink tape...
his skill is just too good, I bought the tool from him and it take me 15 minutes to open the masterlock
Not a fluke... a joke!
I thought 3 mins was a good lock.... Instead he read the letter for 1:30 .. gg
Being a mechanical engineer myself, I am pretty certain that a day will come in the future where Master Lock takes the initiative to put some budget towards letting their "finest engineers" make a prototype of a LPL grade lock. Either that or their engineers will come up with an idea on their own time, good enough for their management to let them go play further just for LPL marketing.
I can't help but think that it took him longer to read the letter than open the lock.
Think outside the lockbox next time.
I'm glad you put the pink tape on it. I was having trouble seeing it on screen.
why didn't they just hire you?
Hey LPL, any suggestions for getting a broken key out of a lock? Someone used the wrong key in the perfume case at work and it snapped off inside. The lock cannot be removed from the glass case and the keyhole faces outwards (like a standard door). Thanks!
WTF is this nonsense
ROFL! Well played.
What were you using the turning tool and rake on? I didn't see the lock.
I don’t get it, all I saw was him jiggling the rake in empty space?  I would say they camouflaged it quite well, like a master.
This is fucking GOLD! Well played.
I was expecting to see an empty box the letter came in.
😆
Master lock made a fool of ther selvs
What? You just waved some tools near a floating bit of pink tape. This is silly....
Helirious
Fortunately, the lock itself is so pathetic, you don't even need to see what you're doing to open it...grabs a rake.
😂 BRILLIANT LETTER.   I was thinking there’d be no lock in the package, for all of Master Lock’s President’s assertion that it IS in the package, only so well camouflaged, it could not be seen.
It's clearly not from MasterLock as there's a disgusting grammar mistake and also a spelling error in that letter
It took LPL longer to read the letter than to pick the lock. lmao 😂😂😂
Your killing me smalls!🤣
what lock? I don't see any lock.
I got a terrible advertisment after the video for a unpikleble bicycle, ist from a company called vanMoof, could you please show them that they aren't?
Chapeau to the impersonator and of course the LPL
Is it April 1st already????
Master Lox brand locks have only one key: They are a key part of opening your breakfast to an enhanced enjoyable bagel experience.
I bought six of these and now I can't find them. I should have used the pink tape. I will pay better attention to your advice in the future. Thank you for your help.
19-feb, "too soon, Executus, too soon"...
LPL is hilarious🤣
У меня тоже вышел видео о Master Lock
Got to love the way that LPL just played along. 😅😅
Genius. This is exactly the kind of logic that leads to most American Manufacturing innovations
Добрый день вы откроете Мастер Лок 2 рядку со слайдером?
This just in.... President of MasterLock was found sweeping at the corner of his office. Wait! Why are we reporting on this?? Oh! Apologies Ladies and Gentlemen. That was a typo. The President of MasterLock was found *weeping* in a corner of his office. Apparently inconsolable for some odd reason. And now for Sports with Steve. Take it away, Steve.
Why is he picking thin air?
Lmao this was great. Good job whoever sent that!
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Most of the video was spent reading the letter! XD
He spent more time reading that letter!!!
Misses LPL found the Lock and mad the Pink Tape on it. After it the LPL found it.
LPL can even open locks he can't see, what can't he do!?
The way says he uses his k9 dog to find to and put a pink piece of tape in case of losing is hilarious
It's amazing how much comedy has come out of a channel about lockpicking.
April 1st come early this year?
legitimately thought it'd just be a block of concrete lmao
Has it EVER been a fluke??
Hahaha, I just made a video on this.
I was expecting there would be no lock because "LPL couldn't find it in the box". I'm disappointed.
I had to pause the video when he pulled out the wave rake
Man, I could only see the pink tape, I still not able to see the lock.
Someone needs to finally send him a lock named/labelled/marketed as 'Fluke' so he'll never be able to say "it is not a fluke".
April Fool's came early this year
that fake email had me in tears.
Cute
I was half expecting the package to be empty.  But this is good too,  I guess they forgot the quite visible bracket, otherwise it might've worked.
now we need a john Cena padlock 🤣💯
No doubt that masterlocks Chinese employees moral is down. Not sure if lpl had anything to do with it haha
Wave rake 🤭
Where is the actual lock? I can only see the shackle
lmao
As soon as you see the rake come out it's game over
The video is almost 3min, must be the record for a master lock 😳
They should have covered it in duct tape. That's LPL's real weakness
Anytime he pulls out a wave rake I say to myself oh gosh this one's a bad one.
This is the hardest bait I’ve ever clicked
For a second there, I thought there wasn't going to be a lock... at all.
Is he picking air or something? I can't see sheet
The joke is on LPL- I TOTALLY BELIEVE master lock would do this.
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahaha. Per usual it took longer to read the letter than to pick he lock. Brilliant gag package. And the camo is atrocious. I’ve seen better camouflage golfballs. Good work LPL, give your seeing eye dog a milkbone for finding it be he did the tough work lol
My style of lock picking is just smash it no matter how big and tough it is one max power hit from a sledgehammer it either dents and opens or explodes everywhere
I would of sent this on April 1
It wouldve been funny if the lock arrived in a giant ball of duct tape, the one locking method known to resist LPL
I couldn’t find the lock in the video… he said he put pink tape, but I’m colorblind!
I couldn't see the lock in the video. Can you please enhance?
LOL. Hilarious.  Master locks I am sure is thrilled you read and accepted their challenge. The Chino Ca. Headquarters thanks you. Love your videos.
OMG 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Next time you should have your seeing eye dog pick the Master Lock. 😂
Which one of you glorious basterds did this!
I thought that there was not going to be a lock and LPL was just going to mime it for a minute.
I found it absolutely hilarious he mocked them
I know where they went wrong, they forgot to camouflage the shackle
This legitimately has me tearing up. This was hilarious, give your seeing eye dog a head rub for me
Rake?  Rake?  Rake?... There it is! Called it.
This is funny
He misspelled "its" like most people do so it should be fake.
masterlock: "DAMMIT NOT THE WAVE RAKE"
This fan should've saved it for April Fool's
I thought by camouflage, the sender made a lock that has to be opened by solving a puzzle. Bet LPL won't be able to pick that. Frankly speaking, I surrender whenever someone tells me to solve a Rubix cube.
You cannot pick WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE!!
Darth LPL sends out the "Choke-Force" to both the Master Lock president and his pet parakeets ..........then we hear the "crunch". {0.o}  Darth LPL: "Apology accepted..........President Naga, naga work there anymore."  {0.o}  😆😂🤣
Can we see your seeing eye dog?
I legit check the calendar bcs i thought today is April fools, damn....
"this is our rock licking foyer..."  - geology club, 2022 -
I don't really think it's funny that he posted about a floating piece of pink tape...
But pink is actually real naval camouflage, so make sure you don't take it out on the ocean with you or you might lose it again.
haha. i was totally expecting the lock to be in high vis...
:-D
You read a letter and picked a padlock (twice) quicker than I can take a shit... nice
Well, Master Lock should employ the best thing can do for security. If LPL can't see the lock. Then, it is secure. Also, running 50 volts through the any metal piece on the barred access area.
I thought the lock would never be sent, lmmao
I didn’t see anything
LPL- Let’s try this one last time so we know it was more a fluke. Me- I know dam well that wasn’t a fluke
Keyway is not camo. Did not stand a chance.
When the letter reading was longer than the actual challenge.
This must have been a joke, that's  a easy lock to pick.
A very important question: Is this padlock really a lock made by Masterlock.
Emotional Damage
Did the package actually contain the lock? Was the joke that the lock is 'invisible'?
Do you ever do any lawyering?
What a humiliation for the pride of Master Lock engineers.
Oh this was fun hehehehe  It wasn't me 🤣
Opens lock faster than I can find the key.
Think you would get a letter from their lawyers first.
Oh no, not the rake 😢
I was hoping for a lock with no keyhole and no way to bypass the lock through the slit in the shackle or something. Truly an unbeatable lock.
Wait until MasterLock uses Vanta Black and Blackest Black 2.0, how could one pick the void!?
LPL rolling with the joke, made this better.
Should have spray-painted it green, then masked it out in post!
The best joke of the day :D
As soon as the wave rake came out, I said, "It's not a fluke."
This will be funnier if lock was painted to the grey to match color of the table. It will be hell to film without some paper underneath :D
You may have picked it, but the fact that you needed the pink tape proves their innovation was on the money. You wouldn't have found it to pick if it were on a locker. Definitely buying one of these locks.
Lol, lets see... Video length: 2:53 0:00 to 1:50 Reading letter and jokingly locating the lock. 1:50 to 2:05 Picklocks the lock while delaying a bit by explaining a bit 2:10 to 2:15 Picklocks the lock a second time 2:16 to 2:53 exit speech.  Aprox 5 seconds to picklock that lock, oof that WON'T do much to morale. lol.
master lock just uses this channel for free publication, lol.
Under 2 seconds.... well to be honest for ML that is a new record I think? Normally far quicker.
I wouldn't be surprised if Masterlock does engage with LPL at some point. Some laughs like this might mean a viewer thinks of them first in situations where they don't actually need security, but need to make it *look* like there's security.  Nothing comes to mind as to what sort of situation that would be, but I'm sure someone can think of something.
april first is right around the corner!
Very silly! I was expecting, though, they had camouflaged some real high security lock from another manufacturer and put the MasterLock logo on it. Oh, well, maybe next year...
That wasn't even proper raking. Just inserting a rake and jiggling around a bit.
Holy crap, Damascus? Practically a neighbor.
Whoever sent that in, thanks for the hearty laugh!
Not a fluke???  Is fluke a competitor of master lock to see which is easiest to pick?
this is just embarrassing lol
It is funny though that Master Lock made a camouflaged lock so the deer wouldn't see it.
April Fool's Day came early! This was wonderful.
That lock and looking at the key here,, I think someone or stupid would send you that to pick, it's not April fools day yet , or this person needs a brain . Regards colin from croydon England 👍 👏 😂
Dude, when he gets out the wave rake. Oof >.<
I feel so sorry for Master Lock xD
Come on!! It's a master lock We know it wasn't a fluke
I think the Masterlock owners will never contact with LPL because they been creating their crap for years and LPL have perfectly discovered it. Now Masterlock is become a Masterfluke.
Really impressed that LPL even managed to find the lock in the first place. Judging from the way it looked even with the pink tape on, I would have probably assumed that they didn't send a lock in the first place.
Yeah just make fun of it. The Lockpicking Lawyer is cheating here. Think about it in a real life situation: Chain welded together and padlock is thrown somewhere else in the bushes.
Lol LPL....😎😎🗣
Stop! Stop! He's already dead!
But that's not the lock included, the included lock has a cloaking device installed and is invisible.
"Let's do that again, just to show it's not a fluke...." It's never a fluke....
you know the lock's terrible when LPL brings out the wave rake
Lol
How embarrassing for Master Lock!!!!!
This was great!
"..we've made a lock equal to your skills" That's when I knew this was a joke
🤣🤣🤣 I DOWNLOADED THIS VID. OMG. I love lpl videos. And this dose bring up the best point. If im willing to put a lock on something to keep it from disappearing. Then im willing to spend some money on the lock. What's so expensive about making a better lock.
“— and I added this piece of pink tape …” : )
This is one of  those faux-weather-resistant masterlocks that, should you actually close the bottom seal, will completely fill with rainwater.
Well done. Surely a fan parody, but the joke still holds. I'm guessing that camo housing is from the factory, you can buy them like that. So basically... Customers, LPL: "Your locks suck, do better!" Master Lock: "Best we can do is camo housings." Customers, LPL: Okay, you've earned a roasting!
Should of said...  "And a wave rake, becuase after all it is a master lock"
2 thumbs up for the person who crafted that letter. I have tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.
There's a pink tape floating around, when are you gonna show us the lock?
I'm disappointed that the great innovators of Master Lock did not use this great opportunity to create a lock that's covered with duct tape. It has already been demonstrated to be just as effective if not better than the highest security locks.
No Stamp bye
My friend in high school would only open his masterlocked locker with a kick from his steel toed boot, so I've never seen the brand as anything more than decoration. Your videos, however, have given me a renewed degree of disappointment in the brand, and for that I say thanks for all the laughs!
April fools joke, a tad bit early. 😜
So... it was basically a camoflock.
Hahahahahahahahaha, too funny!
Its never a fluke... We trust you 💕
Actual CEO of Masterlock: *furiously scribbling notes*
The point of the letter was the cap over the keyhole (concealment joke) which wasn't highlighted in the video. Pink tape was genius though!
Someone has great sense of humour.  We all know Master lock have no morals.
Damascus! That was one of my family stomping grounds back in the day. Does LPL go to Jimmie Cone? XD
Definitively a good joke…. We need a good laugh nowadays though , when MasterLock is involved, it’s always a joke
Not only do you have superior lock manipulation skills, but you yourself are constantly thinking outside the box. So, if you ever want to change professions, I believe you would be quite successful as a stand-up comedian. That’s all I have for you today. 🤡
Tbh i First expected a lock wrapped in a full roll of gaffa tape. Opening up wrapped things is were LPL struggles the most
I just about lost it when he pulled out the wave rake HAHAHA
April fools episode came in early
The way the letter was worded, i expected there to be no lock sent in lol. "You cant pick a lock if there no locl!"
I thought they just weren't going to include a lock.
I'm just here waiting for April fools day again, but this was a good joke.
Security by obscurity? LOL
An "Easy" difficulty lock in a video game takes longer to pick than Master Lock's locks. There should be a petition to make Master Lock remove the word Master from their name, since it's false advertisement due to them not being masters at anything except for making locks that i wouldn't be surprised about if a baby manages to accidentally open one of their locks.
:) :) :)
I believe it’s genuine 🧐😎🧐
Fun fact: You can even zip these open with a pick
WAS NOT A FLUKE! LOL
🤣😭
If they really wanted an LPL proof lock, they would have wrapped it in two rolls of duct tape.
When he said cement in the letter I was just thinking he'd cement the actual keyway.
its a camo lock, lmao
What's the dog's name?.. My dog, his name is Wompy.
That hurt my moral and I don't work for them
And in whichever cartoon villain voice you prefer;  "Curses, foiled again!" - President of Master Lock.
Would of been better once he revealed the keyway it was filled with actual cement. There by "cementing" the companies reputation.
Your channel is really fun. Thanks!
They could have come up with a better camo pattern, i.e. a lock with key ways / plugs all over its body, only one of which is real.
You can hide the lock, but you can't hide the shame.
You’d think they’d come up with more than camo on a lock. Come on Master Lock!
😔 Top master quality
👍😎🍺🍩
It's never a fluke.
watched it without voice, can someone tell me why he had a floating pink tape while he pantomimed a masterlock opening with the tools?
As soon as he pulled the lock out i thought "you could probably just rake it" ... and then he pulled the rake out.  Master lock is so predictable
i thought we were April 1st. Good laugh, thanks to both of you!
pretty sure u just sent the master lock workplace suicide rate skyrocketing up
That's kinda neat that master lock made a piece of metal that can get visibly bigger
Well, someone wore his red armbands today!
Loved that most part of the video was spent reading the letter
"...with just 4 pins, no security pins..."  ...and atrociously poor bitting! 😂 I guess some locks will be winning that un-vantage just by cyclical chance.
LPL: 596 Master Lock: 0
master lock:"god damn it! he somehow found it!"
Savage level 9999 😆
You know things will get embarrassing as soon as LPL brings the rake out.
That's the headlock John Cena uses
Hahaha! I love this! I just started my journey of picking after watching your videos, and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of my Genesis set!
Will you review the Bowley Rotasera anytime soon?
Masterlock employees RN : 🤦‍♂️🤦🤦‍♀️
Hilarious!!
Good joke from Master Lock 🤣
It probably took longer to open the letter than to pick the lock.
Think outside the locks
I love that LPL's "joke" videos are still presented in the same documentary tone as the rest of his videos, with the same cadence as a casually-delivered dad joke
I have read the name of the video and was like BRUTALITY coming up :D  Didn't disappoint. Shame Master-Lock hasn't tried to invest a bit to make the locks better tho...
It would’ve been funny if it’s said to think outside the lock 😂
...a triple knot in a shoelace would be more challenging
Maybe if they gave it a good throw into the woods, it may be hard to find. Nice joke, great content, just started watching your channel.
LPL: Let's do that one more time to make sure it was not a fluke. David Youn: stop stop its already dead
I don't get it. Where's the lock? All I saw was him fiddling with his picks on an empty palm?
That was pretty funny.
LMAO
So great to see big companies having fun with their products. With the world going the way it is, it’s nice to see down to earth people just trying to have a laugh once in a while.
Wait, was this a double edged sword? In the beginning the letter states this is a lock to match the lpl's skill level and at the end the lpl says it's a low skill pick? If so, I do believe you've been had sir!
Wow, LPL is so good he can even pick a floating bit of pink tape! When are you doing the lock?
April 1st came early this year...
*EMOTIONAL DAMAGE* !!   Steven He.
too funny. but you should send master lock a dictionary or hire an editor.  there's a cleverly hidden grammatical error/typo in the letter.
Should have camouflaged the opening machanism and not just hid it behind a lid that can be popped open after enough trial and error to find it.
🤣🤣🤣
Lol this could almost qualify as defamation 🤣
I feel like master lock just wants to see LPL make another video.
Everything is just for show and publicity
Who ever sent this up, thanks for the laugh!! I owe you 😂
Sadly, the first paragraph gave away its unauthenticity. Written at a high school level attempting to be professional over the entire letter. Another one bites the dust.
"Emotional damage"  You're the best, sir.
You are loved.. :)
Ein Kommentar
This could be from a competitor company to Master Lock? A smart person running a company would not do such stupid thing!
Jon Cena brand locks
Does tighter and harder springs work against picks? So it's harder to move with a pick?
David Youn is the president of Master Lock.
I thought it was going to be an empty box...
All I see is a piece of pink tape. Truly innovative.
Honestly, the thing that most proved to me that the letter was fake was the improper usage of "it's" rather than "its" near the end. Definitive proof that the letter didn't come from any corporate source, because the average internet user no longer knows how to properly use apostrophes.
Hahaha thats funny nice
My live reaction,” oh my god did he already open it? What a joke!!”
And then they tried to camouflage this disappointment cuz LPL is probably shortsighted
Pulls out a rake... I'm dying... 🤣
Its 1 april ???
Is this a prank? You’re not even picking anything
This would've been so good without that one "it's".
I think Master Lock accomplished what they set out to do: have LPL produce a review video of not only more than a minute, but almost reaching three minutes. This is MasterLock setting new standards!  Reading the letter was the trap the whole time!
How to destroy a 1 year budget and a innovating lock in 3 second's
it wud be funny if masterlock sued the impersonater
Master Lock: LPL made a three minute video about one of our locks. A *three* minute video!
10/10 would watch it again.
This is absolutely hilarious! 😂 Great Video Sir!
😅 😂 🤣 😭 💀
This lock's design is broken on many levels. The poor core is one thing - but why would one put a polished, shiney shackle on a lock body in camouflage coating?
I think master lock offers a great service to people learning how to pick locks. It's a great practice lock for beginners.
i couldnt see it. I might need LPL glasses. 😁
What was he holding all I see is a floating pink tape🤔🤔
I figured an unpickable lock from ML  Would be one that is welded shut.  But even then LL would find a way to pick that open anyways
Good grief. Another great video. Thanks
i have an idea for a lock for you to pick..but its only an idea ..as i dont know anything on how to build locks .
As a viewer:🤣🤣🤣🤣 MASTER LOCK😱😱😱😭😭😭
I was expecting it to be covered in cement
lmao a small part of me wanted this to be real then I saw "as and a consequence"
Funny!😁
So we can conclude, that finding the lock indeed was a fluke 😉😂
Hey, a masterlock video 2:54 long! Ah, the picking starts at 2:01...
I have one of those locks somewhere. I lost it.
To be fair, I was hoping for the cemented lock
It's not a fluke, It's Master lock.
Your fans are friggin awesome.
They probably should have painted the Shiny parts!
I was expecting a lock that only smart people can see
Honestly if it's fake it's funny, but if it's real i die from laughing🤣
"Cement"....expected it to be filled with JB Weld......
Every time I hear him say "Lets do it one more time, just to make sure it's not a fluke." All I can think is stop, they're already dead!
Definitely a fake - a real letter would be pompous and arrogant.
Next up, the seeing eye dog attachment to the Covert Companion.
I'm not convinced. I personally cannot see the lock, so I'm not really sure if he picked it or not.
If you haven't heard from MasterLock by now, they're not coming for you through the front door. It'll be something you don't see coming that gets you. They're sneaky.
A generous budget of $0.75
All I saw was the pink tape at first, what a lock!
When LPL read the letter he went, WOO, I'm scared...😲
What lock? I'm just seeing your floating hands 😢😢
Pre April Mop?
Damn
It’s crazy that’s low skill when I was taught that and I have pretty much been able to open any door or lock I needed to.
new ad for master lock " Master Lock, turning Parkinson patients, or ppl who drank to much coffee in to master lock pickers."
How did you get John Cena?
Can you make it so your website can give a shipping estimate without giving you all the information for checkout?
you forgot to quote-unquote the "challenge" in the title lol
In conclusion: We did NOT see him find it and the pink adhesive could very well have been placed by Mrs. LPL. This means that LPL FINDING this lock must have been a fluke and as such the video is a hoax or fake of some sorts.
Master Lock CEO - "Honey, I'm home" From the bedroom - "Let's do it one more time just to make sure it was not a fluke"
When I saw "cement our reputation", I expected the padlock to be embedded in a small block of concrete.
8 seconds in... LOL masterlock and challenge are not words that belong together. Unless it is... how long can I go without accidental opening this lock. (this is cute)
When watching a video,  and to the right you browse a list of other video's. You notice a new one from the LPL with the title "[1418] Master Lock Sent Me a Challenge… Kinda."... and it not even three minutes long. :-)
Hey, that sound legit
Waiting for McNally get one
Someone find a lock he can't pick, these videos don't give me any confidence in any lock, especially considering he rakes many of them open.
would have been cooler if the box was empty
An April fools joke came early this year.
Meanwhile, at Master Lock HQ…  President: “GOD. *DAMN IT!* 🤬 He thought it was a joke… 😭”
THATS AS BAD AS TAKING A PIECE OF COKE CAN AND SLIDING IT INTO THE SHACKLE. I CAN OPEN A LOCK LIKE THAT QUICKER THAT WITH THE COMBO. HORRIBLE LOCK COMPANY.
Why was the last two minutes just footage of LPL messing about with a pick and a shackle?
Damascus!!  I had no idea you were from good old "Cow Town in Moco!!"
I have an old Master Lock I stopped using on my shed because of your channel. I decided to try and "pick" it by just jiggling a different key that fit in it. Open sesame....
Well as they said, they didn’t bother making it pick resistant so it really depends on how long you took to find it with the high tech camouflage coating. I have a feeling that it must have taken a while and that’s why you didn’t include it in the video.
Imagine spending a year on your lock just to have it picked in mere seconds.
Typical industry basher. Conveniently, he left out the 20 mins of him looking on the ground to find the lock
Love this
Seems to me the weakest link is the keyhole. If they can eliminate that, you might be slowed down a bit.
Imagine if it was just wrapped in a photo of John Cena
seems like challenging a bodybuilder to lift 1 kg
Master Lock should just make a lock without a key. That will make it unpickable.
Admittedly I was expecting no lock at all, or a sample of nonmagnetic metal. "Can't pick a lock if there's no lock."
I feel like some random fan sent this
I thought it was a speed run challenge.
Methinks mayhaps it twas but a cruel joketh!
I love masterlock xd
LOL master lock 🔐 be so mad
I expected you to just hold the tools in the air and pretend to pick an invisible lock.
Is today April 1?  no, no it's not ... hmmm.
To defeat LPL, I would just buy the Fluke (multimeters and whatnot) brand and use that on my locks.. he couldn't open it twice to prove it's not a Fluke, because it is. Checkmate!
You know you've watched LPL too much that you know what the level of the lock is by the tools he pulls out.
Damn what a classy sarcasm 🤣🤣
What a cheap lock! Never will buy one of these!
Me: “A Master Lock vid that lasts 3 minutes? They’re stepping their game up.” -first 2 minutes is LPL reading a letter Me: Oh . . .
Is this vsauce?
4 pins. Seriously, 4 pins? I'm mildly surprised the lock didn't just spring open to save you the trouble. Basic cheap imported crap from the local flea market has at least 5. I presume Master Lock is also cheap imported crap these days?
Y'know.... they COULD have actually designed a good lock....   Instead, they politely told you they weren't going to waste money making a quality product.
There was one innovation that slowed LPL down though: the tactic of providing an interesting introductory letter slowed LPL down by 90 seconds. I'm going to up my security game by sticking "Dear LPL" notes on all my locks from now on, I feel safer already... .
Ngl they should pay him to design the locks at masterlock. Like, they're not even trying anymore.
Your videos are just really entertaining, I love how there mostly under 4-5 minutes, thanks LPL
Is that the picks from the banggood set?
I think it would have been hilarious if it was just the letter and no lock was included, so they could say "Yeah, our innovation is just that good."
That was hilarious  good thing he put the tape on it so we all could see it ☺️
ME: Read "Challenge" ME: Check video length  Also ME: LOL
Whoever wrote that letter is an absolute sir.
Nothing survives the Wave Rake
that letter seems kinda fake. I mean, LPL hasn't faked it but another person has.
They should have rigged the inside so just the turning tool can turn it.
yeah, that letter really seems fake^^
But where was the lock?
please never use an emoji. They suck
I thought the lock would have been the same grey as his work bench, not a forest camo, shackle as well!
Ha ha!  It worked!  While defeating that poorly-camouflaged pretender, you completely overlooked the OTHER lock in the envelope!
This was almost as funny as your 'wife's beaver' lock, that one had me on the floor. I'm waiting for Master to make a lock that just opens itself, when you take out the rake and turner. Maybe Master should add this to their new, "Stealth" line of locks. "Master Stealth, security is invisible", lol. Thanks for a much needed good laugh in the middle of all the craziness in the world.
That’s funny,,,,,,
Somewhere in the world… It is April 1st.
Dear LPL, Some Time ago I wrote you some mails about pick proofing a production lock. If this really works manufacturing companies could improve the pick resistance without much effort. Perhaps even Masterlock could manufacture more pick resistent locks. Unfortunately I never heard from you. There are now two possibilities. Either the idea is so bad that you didn't even bothered to answer or you did not see the mails. If the first is true I would appreciate a short note so I can stop thinking about it. If you did not see it I can also resend the mails if you want.
All i was see was a levitating pair of keys and later a keyhole later
It took him more time to read the letter than to open the lock.
Now LPL should send a letter back to their headquarters as if they really sent it. The address is right there in the header.  "Dear Engineers of Master Lock, While I appreciate your attention to this matter I have found that your camouflaged lock was fairly easily defeated by a seeing eye dog and some pink tape. I look forward to your next attempt. Love, LPL"  Just to troll them. It would be funny.
😂
This was funny.
When the letter had the word "cemented", I was expecting a lock with only the shackle exposed, and the lock with cement poured around it.   Great video as always
Wonder who sent this? Was a beautifully written letter 🤣
All you had to use was a wave rake!? That's pathetic. I could do that and I don't know shit about this.
What makes you think that isn't genuinely from Master Lock? It seemed legit to me.
Would have been easier just to send the letter and  apologise to all its customers ...   no lock included in this package
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ뭐야이게
That’s got to be a top 10 story and pick of all time. LPL if I were you I’d send your covert set to the Master president to show equal amounts of respect.
That gave me a good laugh🤣
"I hate to further damage employee morale at masterlock but there are no surprises here" - a wise man
I don't know what he was doing. All I saw was a floating piece of pink tape, a wrench, and a pick.
Lol. Cleaver!
if you purchase this lock for security at an inflated price, forget about it, but it will match your Camo, shit, pants, hat, socks underwear,Crocks and wife & kids and also all the matching Yeti crap.
I thought that the keyway would have been filled with super glue or clear plastic resin...
Wait. I never saw a lock in this video.
Takes him longer to read the letter than to pick the lock.
After this I can’t wait to see the April Fools video.
Isn't this Barnacules Nerdgasm?
Somebody should make a lock named... 'Fluke'.
Honestly, with the impression of security being more important than...actual security, this is just marketing for Master Lock.  Cause let's be real "We may or may not deter someone from jacking your sh*t" is may as well be Master Lock's literal slogan.
When LPL is concerned about the moral of Master Locks employee’s because he uses a 0.30 tensioner with a rack then opens the lock in under a minute.  The letter is a classic it is funny to listen to his overtones as if that was a legitimate letter thinking out side of the box 🤣🤣🤣
This was indeed a good LOL.
Omg lol
"devastating to the morale of our employees" 😂
Lol
All I saw was his hands. I'm colorblind so I didn't see any pink tape so I've watched it twice, I still haven't seen the lock. Good one LPL! You fooled us all!
The funniest part of the video was watching a lawyer read with his finger.
90 seconds to read the letter. Ten seconds to promote his tools. Two seconds to open the lock.  Something is wrong here...
Honestly, with that bit about them taking "the opportunity to cement Master Lock's reputation" in there, I was expecting them to mail you a padlock that had been filled with cement.  Unusable = Unpickable = Master Lock wins GG LPL
I was hoping to learn this craft so I could be the guy people come to when they lose their LOTO key with their lock still on the gangbox. One instance puts you on a warning, second instance gets you fired. So people really panic when they lose their key. I thought I would just learn how to pick them and when someone forgets their key I'll charge $50 to open it so they don't get fired. Deal, right?  Then I went back and watched your video on picking a LOTO and found out for some reason, Master Lock makes their puny little plastic locks one of the hardest locks to pick they make.
Everytime LPL brings out the wave rake, I can envison all the viewers just doing a virtual stadium wave XD
Probably the longest video picking a Master lock.
i don't see a lock only a pink piece of tape floating in the air
Might have been good if they really had made a better lock
It would have been funnier if the lock was missing from the box.
How sad is it that the adhesives used to seal their envelopes, tape their boxes, and to package their products is stronger than all of their locks?
Yeah, that took you 2 and a half minutes to pick but you did waste all that time reading the letter.  That's part of the plan!
Gah DAMN I love your channel
LOL !
Would've been waaay funnier if they went on about the camouflaged lock, then just didn't include one in the package at all and behaved as if it was completely invisible XD
So the lock itself is invisible due to that wicked camouflage my only question is didn’t the seeing eye dog notice the brightly colored keys dangling from nothing 🤔🤔
Does Bosnian Bill live in Chino? Cuz this smells like his brand of humor!  At least he didn't have LPL squirting the lock with ketchup, threatening it verbally, or "peeing" on it.   I don't care who you are, that sh*t's funny.  (Lord, I apologize, and be with the starving children down there in New Guinea, Amen.)  I hope Bill and his family are doing well. He is missed.
Are you sure you were not just trolled LPL ??.
April Fools has come early?
for a second i tough somebody put cement inside a lock so it wouldn't open
Pick time: 2 seconds, 2 seconds
Do HYT Chain key :)
I wonder if Mr LPL has 2 children, just to check the first one wasn't a fluke. ;)
My sides hurt from laughing as soon as you mentioned your need for the pink tape. No substitute for dead pan delivery. God, I love this channel!!!!
Oh. Oh no.
Lawyer...Lockpick...Gentleman....and now comedian... The world is right.
Not videoed: LPL taking 20 minutes to find the cleverly camouflaged lock cap.
I think this is the longest Masterlock video you've made. I suspect their biggest pick resistance was including a letter to divert your attention away from the lock. Now that is some out of the box thinking.
I'm going to be honest I couldn't see the lock but I did hear the distinctive click of a master lock opening  in *checks notes* 3 seconds.
some blessed soul decided to make our day just a lil bit brighter
Imagine this isn’t a joke and the Master Lock president is watching it
xd
I’m confused. Is it the April Fool joke vid already?  I didn’t see anything open
I must have missed something. There's just a pink piece of tape wiggling over a desk and LPL seems to be levitating it with considerable ease.
Lock picking layer is a professional guy can pick locks of any lock! You have a smart ability to do it ! I watched every video every day when you post!!! Keep posting my name is dan from New York!!!
Haha! You have some great subscribers, LPL. This cracked me up! Great start to the day!
This was a totally awesome.
Lock Master > Master Lock
I laughed so hard!!!!!!!
Next up from Master Lock:  "Empty Packaging (R)"  Finally, a pick-proof item from the masters of locks, the first in our new "No-Lock" series.  What you will find for your money after you open the package is an Empty Package (R), a lock which is un-pickable because it, of course, does not exist.  Yes, Virginia, there is no lock inside that box or opaque blister pack you just purchased, just some recycled rocks donated from the heads of several of our lock design design departments, to add weight to the packages.  Add this Master Lock super-secure Master Lock device to any ordinary hasp, and you will increase its locking security by 10x the security of any Master Lock padlock in our inventory.*  *Mathematicians among you will note that 10 times zero is still zero.  That's all I have for you today, and thanks for reading, and, if you had to move your lips to read the big words, well, so did I.
What if they sent you a bank lock
They should use tape next time, the only way to make a skilled picker struggle
Troll job!
Well done. High fives all around!
Looks like DBrand made a shell for a master lock and are just memeing it lol.
Actually, the address is the Milwaukee Area Technical College in Oak Creek.
"My seeing eye dog" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LPL is Thing, with just a click of his fingers he opens a lock. In any case that's all I have to say
"it's" - lol. Not saying that big corporations don't have grammatical errors, but it's less likely when it's about one of its own.
we are lucky that this guy is white
TIL that Master Lock Headquarters is a 20 minute drive from my house...
Funny !
Love everything about this.
I was a little disappointed that you didn't show the packaging. I am always amused when the packaging takes longer to get open than the lock itself.
Speaking of lock design could you design a lock that is hard to open even for a skilled picker.
It’s never a fluke, he’s just filling time so the video can be longer than 2 minutes
This letter is incredible! xD
Funny
Sometimes locks are just put in place so if u go thru it and the shoot u they can say look ge went thru i had a lock on ther 🤷👍just saying
Hilarious letter! They’d be better off camouflaging the employees!
Letter looks legit to me..
Pat that dog on the head ...
Has it really come to this?  You’ve obviously picked every lock on the planet if this is all that’s left.
So, is the letter real??
lol
Part of me thinks that the box DIDN’T contain a lock at all, and LPL just brought out a camo lock of his own to troll the sender of the package back.
If that’s the best the engineers at master lock could do, they may as well file bankruptcy today. Hopefully this is a joke, but it was still pretty funny.
LPL seems triggered in this one
Mouhahahaah that was awesome. No way the company would rip on themselves mouhahahaha. Very funny and super fast.
Ah, the ol' "John Cena" lock
😂 I love the effort been put into this joke.
Oh the wave rake.... savage.
Master Locks are what I used to learn how to pick. Its so easy that when people at work forget their key I open their boxes with scrap metal around the shop for them
My first thought was a lock without a keyway.  Then I thought perhaps the emperor's new cloths.  We did learn that LPL's game is way higher than expected when he reveled he employs a dog for for those truly challenging locks.  :-)
Got them !
"Professional interest and embarrassment"  Master lock in a nutshell.
If not because the pink tape, I'm sure I didn't see that lock. LOL.
Climate/virus modelers would be proud of that lock.  Job well done!
The wave rake of shame
Prefect time for a Daredevil reference! 😊
Camo pattern on the body. Mirror finish on the shackle. Genius!
Lock bully!!!
The rake  method takes less time than me trying to find my keys, putting it in the wrong way first and then finally turning it to get my lock open.
That's just a shackle!!! There's nothing to pick
Where did the lock go? I lost it.
He managed to pick pink tape. incredible
soon i will be as good as you at lockpicking and become rich
US army used this to lock their armory door.
Is it April 1st already?
I don't get it.  Why was he just holding his tools in mid-air like that?
An interesting take on 'Security through obscurity' lol
The lock could easily be discovered with a metal detector, quickly defeating this new security feature. If the lock was made of a plastic material, with the same obfuscation coating, the lock may be more resilient to the LPL's attacks. Although I'm sure he already has tools in development at Covert Instruments Research & Development.
Good PR-move by Master Lock(TM).
I thought master lock was orkish thechnology, so how could you even find it after putting a purple tape on it?
he should've just sent the letter without the padlock
Wrong camo obviously. Should have been Multicam, Flecktarn, Alpenflage or Marriott Carpet pattern.
They made a very glaring mistake, they forgot to camo the shackle.
buwahahahaha !
Lock Sniffing Labrador lore
All I seen was the pink tape, WTF???
It'd be neat to have a vid talking about the lock you might design to actually be difficult to pick. At least I think so anyway.
the real Master Lock CEO would have sent you a lock welded shut and packaged with the incorrect key. but due to their incredible bad engineers it was welded shut when it was unlocked.
Wow, in the comedy duo of LPL and the letter writer, it's hard to figure out which is the straight man.
Seeing this makes me think my blind grandma could probably pick that lock with a Rake! The garden variety. Better luck next time Master Lock.
I’m just waiting for a totally verified “Master Lock” YouTube channel to comment on this video.  That would be hilarious.
🤣🤣👍🏼
The letter is great but nothing could have prepared me for that lock reveal
But the lock looks cool. That’s all.
A lock isn’t to keep a thief out but keep an honest man honest
Oh his going to use the rake. Haha, was not dissapoint.
Master Lock  ... hear we go ......hay that is an improvement from master lock tbf lol
Elite.
This is a compendium of LPL's catch-phrases. "Master Lock", "Jiggle", "Wave Rake", "Not a Fluke", "Low Skill Raking Attack"...
Fake letter is fake
Q.  Why does MasterLock make locks?? A.  Wrong! They don't make locks.  Haha, the jokes on you!
😆
It would be good if you actually had the lock and weren't unlocking an imaginary lock. There is nothing there except a piece of pink tape. 🤦Nice try buddy.
Fantastically played you checky git.
I am just a little interested in the fact that the letter is someone impersonating someone else. Isn't that illegal?
LPL: Takes out the wave rake. Me: ok bey😆
When the video is short and the lock hasn't come out, you know what is going to happen...
I have a crazy idea… Instead of blaming LPL why don’t Master Lock just make better padlocks?
Looks like you're picking your own hand.
LOL! This is the whole You cant see me nanana booboo we all did as kids. "To pick a lock, one must see a lock"
I guess you couldn't wait to post this on 1st of April?! 😂😀
1:54  Please don't get out the wave rake.  Please don't get out the wave rake.  Please don't get out the wave rake.   OH GOD, WHY? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS!? IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT!
More than halfway of video and still talking "Yeah, wave rake time!"
I never thought i would watch LPL picking the air with a piece of pink tape floating near it.
Me watching:  NOT THE WAVE RAKE!!
What holds the pciks in place? I'm just seeing flying pieces...
I had to check the calendar to be sure yesterday wasn't March 31st.
😂
Is LPL the best entertainment on YouTube?
I could see a piece of pink tape floating in the air and he claimed to pick something...I think MasterLock won this one
Master Lock is going to ban raking tools eventually :P
😂🙌🏼 lock 🔐 picking lawyer a freaking legend
GG Master Lock 🤣
Top men made this lock.
The letter was actually written quite well, and had me fooled... until the last paragraph.  Good stuff.
Best early April Fools gag ever.
2.5 seconds.... plus however long it too the dog to find the lock.
Didn't camo up the shackle, rookie mistake.
I don't get it. Is there a part two? He said he was going to pick a lock, but all I saw was lock-picking tools and floating pink tape.
I've actually talked with engineers from Master Lock. They know about the quality of their locks and even told me what not products to use.
So many people clearly haven't watched the full video lmao 🤦
Can someone send him the LOTR books and War and Peace as a letter or something? Just so he reads it as an audiobook. The voice is so soothing!
It's not even April 1st yet !
😂
But hey, it took him longer to find it than pick it! That’s a step in the right direction!
When you realize he's gonna read the whole letter and only leave half a minute to disarm the lock 😂😂😂
You know you’re in for a treat when he pulls out a rake instead of a pick
You're going to have to find it twice just to make sure it wasn't a fluke.
there's no lock, what are you picking?
Dang, better luck next time i guess
that's funny x'D
Where is the lock???.. i can't see a lock in this clip!!! genious^^
i thought master lock is going to place NO lock in the mail, therefore LPL can not see through the camouflage
Damn, it's just a shackle
It's not even April Fool's Day yet
This channel and the community are gold.
Why do I just see a pink tape floating around? Like what lock did they sent to lpl?
The only thing that could have made this funnier is if the prankster had removed all the pins so the lock just opened as soon as you tried tensioning it.
I think this gives Master Lock too much credit. (A little too clever!) It would be more on Master locks level to "think outside the box" by wrapping it in duct tape so you can't access the key hole. Also the "cement" comment made me think they just cemented the key hole shut before reading the rest lol
All I saw was a shackle with some pink tape on it, where's the body of the lock?
Master lock is not good at making challenge locks
My congratulations to the prankster. Well done
Most innovative camouflage lock. Pink tape and a wave rake. 😂
as an advanced sticky note that says "Do Not Enter" Master Lock locks are really good, they also make excellent paper weights. they also come with a very handy feature in case you lose your key, you can open them with just about anything that fits in the keyway, be that a bent pin, paperclip, hairclip etc.
Now I'm just waiting for the harassment DMCA... 😂
Why am I still laughing whenever LPL says: ...to make sure it's not a fluke...😂❤ Is Masterlock even still in business..?
I'm confused.  All I saw was a shackle and a piece of pink tape.
Oh my God. I can't believe they cheaped out on the camo coating. Imagine they would have coated the shackle and core as well. LPL would be searching to this day.
“And this wave take.”  STOP IT! It’s already dead!!
the only thing that'd make this video funnier would be if the letter actually was real and LPL just destroyed them without actually meaning to, yet saved them by making it look like it's a joke.
I think J Boss and Righteous are part of the cancel culture crowd. "Quit making videos of our shoddy employer or else we'll troll you."
Can you create a bike lock ?
Lol damn
I couldn’t really see what LPL was doing. All I saw was a pink ribbon
Yeah... that is pretty funny. Haha
The letter is better than the lock. :)
this was amazing lmao
>Challenge >Wave rake  Lol
I lost the challenge, I laughed
Good one.  Surprised they didn’t wait until 5/1 to give you that
The letter not even in justify…..
Rotflmao
LPL in BEAST MODE!!!  I love it!
Ha! Try picking it without the pink tape. I think not!   :D
"...A wave rake...." Oh noes!
MasterLock is destroyed on milion pieces now....
WAVE RAAAAAAKE! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"April Fools' Day" came early this year.
It's from Master Lock... The only key LPL needs is a wave rake.
Solid trolling effort by whomever sent you this.
The fact it took longer to read the letter than to pick the lock twice made me laugh
I'm confused... where's the lock?
ok, somebody needs to just solder the cylinder in place, so LPL can pick all he wants, but it won't actually turn.
You can tell if master lock sends you a letter, because the envelope is really easy to open
I was expecting it to be "The Emperor's New Lock" with an empty box.  If ML ever did send a letter it would probably be a cease and desist from their lawyers.
They even took the trouble to lookup the name of the CEO.
This is embarrassing
I assumed it was going to be grey speckled to match the desk surface
Hilarious
John Cena must work at MasterLock
The first sentence gave away that it was not from Master Lock. Good laugh though.
"Lets do it one more time to make sure its not a fluke" This man could open a lock by talking to it and I still wouldn't think of it as a fluke
i thought this was going to be an “emperor’s new clothes”-type joke. send the same letter, but don’t include a padlock!
Its never a fluke!
LPL literally spent more time reading the letter than opening the lock. Definitely what I expected hahaha
We need the doom music every time the wave rake comes out
I'm not gonna lie. That lock looks badass.  If the appearance of security were more of a corner than actual security, I'd totally buy one of those.
That lock was the decoy, LPL has not found the true sample yet.
I was expecting the lock to be so well-camouflaged that well it was almost like it didn't exist... and that would be the joke.
🤣😂😅👏👏👏🐾🐈🐈‍⬛🐾
If you include the time taken to read the letter, this lock took a relatively long time to open
Master Lock has done it!!   They have an LPL video that is longer than 2 minutes..!  Congratulations to their innovations team!
Imagine if someone were to say anything bad about the lockpicking lawyer.  Then, at their house, they hear;  "Click on 1," outside the front door.  It would be truly horrifying.
It did require the wave rake rather than the padlock shim or the piss hammer, so I guess you can give them credit for that.
This should've been saved for April Fools Day.
Wow this troll letter even baited troll comments in this video
New job openings coming soon in 'Master Lock' 😁
I don't even bother to lock my doors anymore. LPL would probably just go "challenge accepted" and improvise a Bogota from an empty can.
Imagine the President of MasterLock is waiting for LPL response in his office and all of sudden he hears a calm monotonous voice "This is the LockPickingLawyer and today we will open this casual office lock"
It took him longer to read the letter than to pick the lock lol
I hope the author of the letter is reading these comments.  That was not only hilarious but very creative. 👍 Just like LPL, thanks for the lolz.
Aight... Im really interested in the LPL dog that can sniff out locks....
I mean... I know impersonating someone is illegal but this is funny
If Master Lock is gonna send him anything I’m assuming it’s going to be a cease and desist.
The theory is actually incredibly sound... It would only work in bespoke buoldings but concealing the keyhole to an entry is genius.. It made me think of when James May had some Super GT car and even with the Key ...he had no idea how to start it!
You know, we all laugh at Master Lock, but I have to think that the obvious poor quality of the Master lock, as demonstrated by the LPL, must hurt sales.  You'd think that they would do something to improve the quality of their product. 3.77 million users will probably pick a better lock when they are in the market for one.
Wow a lock picking lawyer video without a lock in it, this is crazy
Has anyone put a lock picking database together? As in something which you can look up a lock brand / type and go straight to the best way of picking it?
That's why I love this channel 🤣
I get excited when LPLs videos are more than 2 minutes and 10 seconds. It means something may have challenged him?  Nope!
Knew it would be a rake.
Dad Jokes 😂
Made it camouflage, but still has bright shiny beacon shackle. And when the wave rake comes out, its already an embarrassment
🤣 Not today Master Lock..
Just what were you picking? All we could see was floating pink tape.
I died the moment he pulled out the rake
🤣🤣🤣
IIRC the corporate mail room for Master Lock is in Chino, CA.   The engineering, however, was contracted out to Mr. G's 7th grade remedial woodworking class at Dumass Jr. High many years ago.
🤣
Each time he covers the pink tape I'm sure the lock just disappears
Now the viewers are just messing with masterlock lmao.
How does he make the rake disappear when putting it between the curved piece of metal?... is this magic? 🤯
They should send another one with no lock and say we made the camouflage better
I thought the letter would take the turn and provide a lock from another company.
what lock? i dont see any that tape is on a random piece of floating metal
Why LPL picking the air?
If thats their most advanced lock yet, they need to keep trying. Picked twice in around 10 seconds :)
I was always told a padlock was just there to keep innocent people from temptation and LPL has proved it 1418 times.
At 'cement our place' I was expecting a lock with its innards filled with superglue.
While LPL was reading the first paragraph, I was picturing a solid "lock shaped" piece of steel, lol. Well played
Thanks for putting the pink tape, otherwise we wouldn't have seen you hurting the morale of more employees! lol
Ah the classic dick joke signature :D the artist behind this truly put some effort into this
thats amazing
Thank you for attaching the high visibility tape to the lock, because due to the camouflage around the lock, I wouldn't be able to find it inside the frame if it wasn't for it.
Really leaning into the "not a fluke" 😄
This was quite comical! Love it. Keep up the good picking LPL.
Ok, that was hilarious XD I thought Master Lock might have actually made a better lock, lol
Isn’t it like, illegal to impersonate a company/business?
Whoever sent that lock.. is my new hero.
Very usefull to hide the disappointment
Master locks generous budget = $15
I was expecting pins outside of the lock covered with cement :D
A challenge? Oh, boy! Grab the dog, grab the snacks! This will probably last as long as Mike Tyson's first Cab fight!! 🍿🍿🍿🐕🐾🐾😂😂👵🇺🇸
Didn’t indented paragraphs go out of fashion around forty years ago?  And those were massive indents, even the people who still use them indent a lot less than that.
NICE
How is that pink stripe floating? I don't see any locks though???
This almost could have qualified for a community April Fool's joke.
I would be funny if the lock opened with just a turner
I always see a few people that admit to being, "scared", after seeing how easily the LPL opens so many locks.   All he's REALLY doing? Showing the world the brilliance of the Framers of our great Constitution, when they included, solidly, it's 2nd Amendment.   With enough practice? Nothing more to fear! Have a great weekend, LPL fans.
😀😀😀😀
We call a wave rake - A Master Key
Well you just sued them if your the lawyer
Video length is less than 3 minutes tells that padlock is a trash.
The only part of a MasterLock that is hard to open is the packing.
Lol
What would have been funny is if master lock made the same lock in miniature so his tools didn't fit.
Whoever made this is probably braindead, you can't just hide a lock like that
The letter was right. He didn't pick that lock.  He just raked it open.
You sure this wasn’t supposed to happen on April 1st?
I can see a piece of pink tape and a shackle, but LPL seems to be manipulating thin air.
LPL: “Hmmm… a letter from Masterlock…<tears envelope>… and we got this open”
I've found putting a master lock out in the rain for a few weeks makes picking it much more difficult.
Was kinda expecting to be just the letter....
I sent them an email asking if they'd be interested in my 'unpickable' lock design and what their policy would be, assuming either they'd buy it, or hire me or something.  Turns out their system for receiving new ideas is "Give us your idea so we can take it."
Plot twist: master lock tried to hide lock with camo so he couldnt find it and pick it open.
Haha should post this video on april 1st, not right now.
👍🏻👀😂😂😂
I assumed when they said "cement" it was going to be a lock encased in a block of concrete... I was disappointed
Why did they used old school camo, instead of modern digital patterns that are invisible even to cameras? I have a suspicion that letter might have been from some prankster.
A viewer with a smart sense of humor. That was fun, although ML may have different thoughts :-)
I was actually expecting keys with no lock. As the camo was so good it rendered it invisible.
It easy to make lock that LPL can't pick, just weld keyhole shut.
He almost started laughing as soon as he began talking about the wave rake
Creative and funny. Kudos to who ever did this.
I always go nuts when the rake pick enters the field. Definitely my favorite recurring character in your videos.
Master Lock should just quit at this point
How many takes did it take to read that letter without cracking up? I was in stitches by the second paragraph! XD
"...and a wave rake." He's gonna open it in 2 seconds isn't he?
There's another lockpicking channel called "McNalleyOfficial". He's not as serious as LPL, but he certainly is tongue in cheek when he picks locks.
The day it turns out it was a fluke the world will end.
Jokes on them, they didn't camouflage the core, letting him pick it open easier
The letter was hilarious! The master lock was just a joke.
I like it how you play along with funny stuff like this lol
A MasterLock video that's almost 3 minutes long???  The lock could have been opened at least a dozen times while LPL was reading the letter.😅
I was so happy when I saw him pull out the rake
Lmao, they're destroying their brand. I can't 😂
What is a "fluke"?  Can somebody explain this to me pls? :)
They didn’t send you a cease and desist?
The envelope the letter came in is more secure than most masterlocks.
I thought LPL would show the empty table and say: "OK, here's your picked lock, can't you see it? It's because the camouflage coating is the only thing that works well."
If this is the material we're getting February, I cannot wait to see the one for April Fools
I like how the camo is a woodland pattern; as though the most common place to secure something is amidst a thicket.
I see the pink tape, but where’s the lock?
Took 8 times longer to read the letter than to pick the lock!  Nice one 👍🏻
I was believing it till the end. I was SO excited!😭
gg
that letter is awesome :D
Woooow how it that pink piece of tape floating in mid air? Magic
he spent more than a half of the video reading the letter, not a really good signal
If I was the CEO of Masterlock I would send you a "new" lock with a keyway and all but all of it would be welded shut haha
I honestly expected an actually invisible lock, as in no lock (because it can't be seen)
So master lock basically only makes heavy grade diary locks?
Good day LPL ,actually i check all your masterlock video and it take 0.002 second more than usual very desapointing . Just kidding love your video keep it up🤣🤣🤣🤣
>Challenge >2:53 Video yeah
jokes aside, that is one heck of a letter. Good job MasterLock
MasterLock needs to now.  They should only send you the letter, and say the lock is invisible.
💥THAT WAS 1 OF THE 1ST MASTER LOCKS I OPENED W/A CHEAP RAKE & TENSION BAR. U DONT NEED LPLs FANCY EXPENSIVE SETS...AMAZON CHEAPIES WORK JUST AS WELL😎👍
Guys I couldn't see the lock, can someone describe to me what happened?
oh good god not the  wave rake
I like the idea that LPL has a dog that's trained to sniff out locks that he didn't see.
LPL is the second coming of Christ
thanks indid to whom ever send it :D
I love how picking the lock has become the punchline!
Anytime LPL goes for the rake, you know it will not take long to have it opened 😂 The letter had me going for a moment
I am confused. Wearing headphones I can clearly hear a lock being picked, but I can't see one anywhere in the video. Master lock out did themselves with this one
I’m not sure how to feel about this video because the only thing I saw were the tools moving so I’m obviously unable to confirm anything has been unlocked or if the lock ever existed in the first place.
The lock smithing society fears this man
When will the pink tape be available from your website?
ML: He can't pick the lock if he can't find it 🧠 Stupid problems require stupid solutions amirite
Thanks for the Laughs 😂😂
Oh boy, it's time to rumble.
Well, they got their wish.  He didn't *pick* the lock.
LOL!!!! XDDDDD)))))
LOL - That opening sentence alone proves this was a joke... and a bloody good one at that! I would have put "and we have consulted the finest NASA cosmologists" in there somewhere.
LPL knows how to play ball.  "It took awhile for my seeing-eye dog to find it. And I put the high-visibility tape on it so we don't lose it again."   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone remember how there was a lock he couldn't pick but then this company took a year to do this to themselves  Edit: 5:13 in video 480
*Joke's on MasterSchLock!🤭
It took you more time to read that letter than opening that lock lol
While they correctly concluded you had terrible vision they didn't think to make it unsniffable by your seeing eye dog. Truly you have a counter for everything in your arsenal.
A W E S O M E  Video,  my Brother.! aloha
the only flaw in the video was that the pink tape was behind your hand while picking, so i had a hard time seeing the lock.
“Our finest engineers” - dead giveaway it’s a viewer’s letter. 👍 I’m waiting for the Masterlock that opens just by inserting the turning lever in .025.
It’s all fun and games till pink tape is applied.
i really wished they didn't send any locks so when lpl would say there were no locks in the box they could go ahaa
Based on this video length, we know how it's strength
I thought by camouflage he meant the lock was going to be covered in key holes.
I’ve never tried picking nor will I ever( it’s far beyond my skill set). I thoroughly enjoy watching your videos,thank you!
I blinked and I missed the picking.
Lol
... wait, what exactly was he picking today?? I just saw him waving his tools around in midair near a floating bit of pink tape. Can someone clarify what happened??  Its not April 1st, is it??
First laugh of the morning! Thanks!
They should have sent this to you as an April Fool joke.
Only 2 seconds 💀
From now on I'll trust only in Master Lock
Is this really a product that master lock is selling? ^^' It's just so damn bad....
Question: How did Master Lock not send you a stop order? (Seis and desist, though I can never spell those words)
Lol
Took longer reading the letter than to pick it (okay okay rake it) twice! Gosh heckie.  It's like ML isn't even trying anymore.
I bet they had a lot of fun writing that letter
I am pretty sure that putting pink tape on the lock would be considered cheating
The fact that LPL had to use a pink piece of tape to not lose the lock definitely proves this is the most advanced of locks from Master Lock, incredible
seriously, why in the world does a camo masterlock even exist?
Now I can the comments ...
We just got Rick-rolled.
Nice adding the pink tape.
It's cruel...
If it wasn’t for the pink tape, I don’t think I would’ve ever saw it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍
I couldn't see it thankfully you added a pink tape
😂😂😂😂 ML destroyed
This is brilliant
Don’t hire whoever wrote the letter as a joke writer.
I see the pink tape, but where is the lock?
😂😂😂
LMFAO OMFG THIS IS HILARIOUS
Glorious! i love these videos so much they are always entertaining ;D
Imagine if this really was sent by master lock lmao
Wave rake.   That lock never stood chance
Pink tape! Hahahahah
Ngl i was expecting the lock to hold on for at least 10 seconds.
That letter was pretty good haha.
Fake
I thought MasterLock finally has sense of humor and courage to send a challenge to LPL, kinda disappointed 😂  *"Industry innovator"* lol 1:40 What's with that floating pink tape?
I really, REALLY hope that letter is from MasterLock and not a troll. God, this is *glorious.*
That was a rather cute letter, well written whoever made it
You know when the wave rake comes out he's going to finish faster than me in college
If this is real, this must be embarrassing.
Foiled again.
To the comedian, Thank-you.
Is it April 1st already?
Lol
🤣🤣🤣 Love it ! 🤩
Mr President himself!
After seeing how easily some locks can be opened, I am scared
heart me plz
hi!
This is not even funny at this point
Master Lock is always a joke. I am not convinced that they are worth using on anything with a value over $5.
Hello
first
Wuuuut
Just checked guys its not april 1st. Just thought ill let u know
First!!
Yay
I guess Christmas is coming early this year.
Lol im too early
lul
Hello
