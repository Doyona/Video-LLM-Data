shouldn't new and ancient friends be switched
Lol I remember having friends
My best friend's bisexual and the way we joke about each other, you'd think I was a homophobe (f-slur not included)
one of those ancient friendships is now my roommate, and in spite of the advice to “never be roommates with your friends”, we still get along like it’s nothing because neither of us can surprise the other, it’s great
If your friendship is really close, it'll either sound like they hate each other or it'll sound like boring smalltalk.  "Remember Zbots?" "Yeah." "Yeah, those were sick." _end of conversation_
You're not a true friend until you can have the most obscure conversation, yet still fully understand what you're talking about: "Hey you know that thing?" "The thing?" "Yeah the thing with the thing, in the thing, right?" "OH YEAH. That thing. I know that thing."
Behold, Mordecai Heller.
☹️
hold on to your friends. and merry christmas
It's actually really wholesome. Friends who do that have been friends long enough and know each other well enough that they can feel safe ribbing on each other, knowing each other well enough that neither means the other any actual ill will.
ancient friendships is me walking into his place knowing he is still working upstairs amd making coffee for me and him. and just putting on the tv, he walks in and just goes whats up cuck.
I wouldn’t know.
Plot twist: The first half depicts friendships where only one of them actually remembers the other guy.
Z-Bots WERE sick
I know it's a throwaway gag, but I came across 3 zbots (and a battle beast) at a garage sale last year, and they're literally sitting beside my monitor right now.
.....I have z bots
I feel this so hard though. With new relationships I'm always trying really hard to give a good impression and be extra polite whereas with older relationships we say unintelligible nonsense to one another with the most tired resting bitch face because impressions no longer matter
I was talking to an ancient friend (who I have talked to little in the last 28 years) and it's crazy how much of our conversation can just be allusions. I'm not even talking about  allusions to the last. One of us would begin alluding to any of the innumerable things in this world that we have never even talked about before and the other would instantly know what the first was talking about and where he was going with it
Z-Bots were so sick
Funny.
0:13 "Rooby-rooby-roo!" "Rooby roo!" "Ruck you!"
I would pay good money to see a version of this for women friendships.
My friend group has an inside joke about Southern accents coming from having a cup of your ass and none of us have any idea how it started
Making friends as a grown-up sucks so bad. I try my best to avoid it. You never have friendships like you did as a kid ever again.
Me and a friend were playing tic tac toe and 4 connct online from around 1am to 9am  The entire conversation was just that if anyone won wr said fuck you and continued to play.  Also like halfway through he commented on the music hes currently listening to and i just asked "you have music on?" Cz i was playing goddamn tic-tac-toe for a solid few hours in complete and utter silence.
Another thing about it is when you do something minorly embarrassing and you now have a nickname about it for all of eternity
this except it’s with my girlfriend that ive known for over 7 years
i DO remember z-bots and they ARE sick
I’ve had two close friends for pretty much my whole life. One of them moved out of state but the other one lives like 5 minutes away. I have now obtained ancient friendship personality with the friend who moved and retained new friendship personality with the nearby friend. I await the day the three of us finally meet in person again and I gain split personality disorder
Holy shit he’s using an actual phone as a phone!!
When your friend is good at painting landscape and you can only draw a crappy pineapple...
bro zbots were sick i still got a few
Lamar with Trevor vs Lamar with Franklin in GTA V
"Rememeber Zbots?"  "Zwut"
What the HELL. I was just trying to remember the name of Z-Bots, because I'd suddenly remembered one of the Burger King toys I got during that promo, like, a billion years ago. But all my descriptions of it were in vain... and now YouTube recommends this!  So... thank you SungWon?
Because my family's moved around so much, the only ancient friendships I have are with my brothers
As a person who actively participates in ancient friendship every day I cannot confirm...I AM the confirmation...PIDRBLE!!!
I’ve got an inside joke with one of my friends about how one of my favorite bracelets is absolutely not made of teeth.
That feel when I can't relate to this:")
nobody talking about the z-bots though. had the big one where the little ones could sit in his hands and head and chest
I mean legit when one of my friends gets sick i'm like "damn dude that sucks get well soon" but when one of my GOOD friends gets sick i'm like "get fucked nerd L"
I can confirm this, having a friendship in which one of our favourite greetings is the middle finger
I only have medium-length friendships, with people who met me when I stopped being a cringey teenager but before I entered my 30s and lost the ability to make new friends.
This is kinds like that Wassup Budweiser ad
I can't wait till I'm a Grandpa saying "heh, sus."
Z-Bots WAS sick!
Simply saying "glizzy lizard" gets one in my friend group to laugh hystarically and the other to tremble in fear.
This is me with everyone else vs me with my brother lmao
Friends with people vs friends with my brother
oh my god. currently, my oldest friend and i have only been friends for 4 years so i wouldn't call it "ancient" by any means (compared to some of my past friendships, at least. i moved at the start of highschool so all my previous friends drifted away and i didn't have ANY for a couple years after that, for context/reference) and compared to the other friends i met at the same time as i met my best friend we have SO many wackass inside jokes and references that no one else understands lmaooo.... i love confusing our other friends with our bullshit 👏
My friends and I regularly call each other losers and then proceed to talk about our special interests for hours Friends will come over and hang out with specific ideas of what to do, best friends will come over, hang out in silence for a while, maybe engage in conversation, and pass out on your couch for like half an hour
old friendships have your own language developed lol
"You Scoobie Doobie dick!"
You know u r good friends when they can add any verbs to "ur mom" and be cool w it.
My family has a large deck of cards of awkward inside jokes spanning decades.  Every now and then we break out the deck and play a game that has three rounds.  1.  Say anything (except the words in the phrase) 2.  Charades 3.  One single word  Divide the cards into equal stacks.  Each person gets a stack.  You do as many cards as you can in the time limit scoring 1 point for each guessed correctly.  After everyone gets a chance at round 1, move onto round 2, then round 3.  This game is also called "Monikers" but it works best with groups of ancient friends, and inside jokes.  We even have a bunch of inside jokes about my Grandma, who passed on 7 years ago.  It's a great and hilarious way to remember her.  It's always an honor when someone says or does something epic enough to earn a spot in the deck.
ZBOTS. You just unlocked a core memory from my childhood. Those things were rad.
I have never managed to explain what the wprd spilling means to me and my best friend to literally anyone else in my circle
The best kinds of friendships are when you've known each other since you were toddlers, and now do nothing except insult each other mercilessly whilst giggling madly.
I’m actually like this with a couple of new friends. We’re constantly insulting eachother and whenever we seen one of us come online we’re like ew. You. And outsiders always think we have some beef but we don’t 😭
My best friends at law school hope I die alone and hungry on a regular basis.
The way random inside thoughts become outside thoughts. That's how you know.
Wait wait I think it’s the other way around
Yes, indeed, and we can roast each other until death.
😂😂that was really funny and spot on with the ancient friendship it's consented though and you know it, that's why it works, there was consent and none of you are insulting, you're just using words.
Sometimes I hesitate when trying to make mean jokes about my friends, but then I remember that they've seen me being mean enough to still stay despite that. Although, I don't make mean jokes as much because my friends are all pure hearted/easily wounded.
This is basically me amd a buddy from middle school. "Hows it goin fatass?" "Bite me, toothpick." This is how we greet each other.
Um. I feel attacked. hahah XD Joshin.
Felt that on a fundamental level
If only I knew how this felt, but I've been stuck in this bell tower for two decades.
remember medabots?
This is so accurate true friendships they are just their genuine selves whilst new or like acquaintance style friendships are polite
You know you're true friends when a constant call and response of "ye" is perfectly decipherable between both of you
Warm salutations.
Accurate. I remember when I used to have friends.
When i saw Ancient Friendships i was expecting to see Gilgamesh and Enkidu violently kissing while absolutely bodying a demon
yup lol
I was a zbot for Halloween one year, good times
Everyone agrees ancient friendships becomes just a bunch of noises of inside jokes  I remember my friend standing still with a goofy grin on his face, i immediately knew what he wanted..
One thing that's strange is that you know you're long lived friends when you can just make fucking noises at each other, literal incoherent bullshit and the other guy still knows what the joke is and what you're trying to do.
New Friendships: "Am I weird?" "No, you're not. Don't worry." "Sorry, just worried I'm weird."  Ancient Friendships: "Am I weird?" "Not compared to me, get on my level you fucking plebe!" "I will best you one day, you fiend, mark my words!"
I greet one of my friends by giving him death threats and he does it back ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (he was the one who started that fyi)
The best feeling in the world is when new friendships turn into ancient ones
Scooby Dooby... Dirty deeds done dirt cheap (doujin)
the ancient friendship reminded me of my relationship with my brother, since we have a kind of inside joke that only us and our parents know, and we have silly nicknames for each other
I literally tell my friends I’ve had since middle school to “piss off bitch” on a regular basis. Meanwhile I’m having like mental health group sessions over discord with some friends I’ve made in college
z-bots were indeed.. sick.
If you heard me and my best friend banter you’d think we didn’t love each other like family
I still have my childhood Z-Bots collection and they are indeed, fully sick!
This is only the second time in the past 28ish years I’ve heard someone else mention Z-bots.
Old friendships are saying we don't care about each other while caring very hard for them in secret and buying food for each other even if we're almost broke while insulting each other
Lol i literally greet my cousin with "yo what up shithead"
It's better when you get hurt.  New Friends: Genuinely concerned if you're ok.  Old Friends: "You fucking dumbass"  As they laugh and eventually help you.
When İ met a friend after so many years he just said : FUCK İS SHE HERE HİDE ME!
The whole inside joke that is completely incomprehensible thing is like the ryuk gaming joke in my friend group, a cosplay of ryuk from death note with the header ryuk gaming and the subtitle bottom text, you then screenshot it and do the same thing and it’s gone so rare ryuk isn’t even visible
Zbots and Rumble Robots were the only thing that mattered to me as a kid!
The number of inside jokes me and my buddy have is insane, but my favorite one is our King Kermit voice where one of us goes "execute him" if the other has inconvenient news 😂
When I laugh with New friends: small chuckle  When I laugh with Ancient friends: Deep villainous laughter
When you tell a story from 18 years ago that they've heard 9741 times but they don't interrupt you and still laugh. Ahhh...
I find it interesting that this rule holds for ancient friendships but not marriages.
my and my best friend call each other 'Rak' ('crayfish' in Polish) and don't really use our actual names anymore
Wow. Z-Bots. Incredible.  I still have one Z-Bot to this day.
That was hilarious!  The contrasts OMG!  Thank you!
This morning I texted my best friend of 18 years "Im going sneak in your room and piss in all your house plants" and she asked me if I could check if she needs to buy more cat food while im there. I think thats just how it be after that long.
Great, now I got to look up z bots. XDD
This is completely true.
Every new friendship has the potential to become an ancient friendship.
Ngl I treat my best and oldest friends pretty respectfully but I've got a few friends who I literally only know because as soon as we see each other we just start flaming for absolutely no reason and then we just go on our way again
walking past a new friend in public: omg hi!! how are you? :D  walking past an ancient friend in public: ew go away
The accuracy of this is both painful and hilarious.
I remember Z Bots😢
Inside jokes are fun, but they also allow you to see if an ancient friendship is fading. When the old joke don't make them laugh anymore, and you can't find new ones, you know you've changed both, and it's time to move on a bit.
I hate being in a class with people who all have ancient relationships with each other and then you're just supposed to go to them to ask for help. I always feel like a nuisance and I'll never form a friendship with them...
e
I didn't realise this was true until I saw this.
Lmfao
Ancient friendships are where you can just randomly text them some violently sexual shit and they'll just roll with it.
Z BOTS
“car lid shitting his pants” is an inside joke for my group
Me and my ancient friend about to have the most fucked up conversation while eating sandwiches
LMFAOO my favorite thing about knowing my best friend from like 2nd grade is that we have the weirdest references from stuff that happened in Elementary school and we just bring up so many years later like “do u remmeber when this happened” “YEAH???”
Ancient friendships are beyond the bounds of normal friendship. There is no right or wrong. You are brothers, not by blood, but by mind. By spirit.
My friends and I just make noises at each other and understand
I always greet my friends with a good old fuck you.
The best part is over time you might actually mean the insults you’re saying…
meanwhile me: oh hi, how you doing? been well
man inside jokes are really sick no cap. i cant explain why we are laughing at the name "mozart" yo someone else
Scoobi Doobi Dick is the best thing I've ever heard
i just entered a new stage of friendship. we just told eachother to commit suicide for the first time. im very happy we are such good friends.
He's not using the PSP anymore
Yep, I have a best friend of 16 years now and we have the stupidest inside jokes and are also rude to each other every passing second lmao. The way we greet each other is literally "hi dickhead" "hi cunt"
What's a new friendship?
This one actually hurt because my best friend for over ten years hasn’t been talking to me for a few months over the dumbest argument in history. :(
I have no friendship
I could not speak to my friends for months and we continue to talk like we have been talking everyday 🤣
my best friend and i literally have an inside joke where, if he flips me off, i respond with a salute. it's fun to do it to people unfamiliar with the joke bc it makes them laugh so much
I laughed so hard at the old friends CUZ WE DO THAT LMFAO
………yep
not enough racial slurs/10
Z-Bots were sic.  Especially the ones that could "bite" that you could use like clips.  No idea how that IP hasn't been milked to death by Hollywood yet.
I can confirm the podcast episodes all open in one of these two ways
you know it's an ancient friendship if you look at each other in the eye and laugh or knows what the other is saying just by the eye contact
So the indecipherable joke is ruby ruby roo
I don't even remember why and at what point my best friend started to nickname me "Cultist" and introduce me to everyone like that  And I completely relate to making incomprehensible sounds to greet each other xdd
I like the little touch of the insults immediately turning into an inside joke  _THAT_ is the mark of an ancient friendship
still got my Z Bots :)
Another thing with these ancient friendships is the lack of tone switch. When I talk to new friends or acquaintances Ill put effort into making myself sound friendly or engaged in the convo, but with old friends idgaf how my voice sounds lol if Im depressed that day im gonna speak like it
Heck yea zbots!! I need a zbots review video
I always love inside jokes with my brother.
Unfortunately, I don't really have either of these.
You guys have friends?!?
This applies with socializing between my cousins from my mom's vs my dad's side, which is totally unhinged and filled with inside jokes
accurate lol
Is it even a friendship if you don't accuse each other of crimes punishable by international courts?
I loved Z bots! 👍🏻😁
Me and my friends inside jokes are so indecipherable that it could possibly land us in a psych ward
I do, in fact, remember Z Bots.
Shit yeah Z-Bots fuckin' owned.
I wish I could relate to both
What's your favorite best friend greeting? Mine is "what's up fuckface", and my best bud responds with "nothing much butthead"
My inside joke is "you feeling lucky tnt?" A friend of mine brings it up to mess with me lol. The story behind that one is embarassing
0:08 "And we will always be the best of chums" Definitely a true friendship with no betrayal ever.
You can tell you’ve been close friends for a while when you can greet your friend with “Scooby dooby dick”
It’s true.  Z-Bots were sick.
A thing like this one happened with me and my old school homie,when we met after a long time,none of us said anything,we pretent were gonna punch each other and just walked past each other with a poker face but then we laughted while he went to his way and i went to mine,without saying one word,just a single giggle from each one of us,ancient friendship is totally different,it has an quite fun,and sometimes strange vibe,but not in a bad way,its actually strange in a good way,i just dont know how to explain that
my inside joke with my friends is "you BROKE my GRILL?"
I thought this was gonna be about friendships in 1200 bce
The inside joke is incredible, i can't even explain what "Levité" is to anyone outside of my friends gropu
I can feel this with my relationship with my brother
New friends: Hey, did you have a good weekend? Up to anything? Old friends: *footage not found*
I gotta start using Scooby Dooby Dick.
0:09 sup f*** face
true friendships is when you fall asleep as they babble on and they just accept you for you
botsmaster  > zbots
honestly i’m the opposite and idk why
When your Friends can insult you and make it sound really mean, and yet everyone's laughing it off honestly, you know you can be honest around them
hahah true! Even the JAB couldn't effect me and my ancient friends.  I told them you guys are F***ing idiots! and they said the same. Then we had a sweet NFL sunday bbq.
Memes are just inside jokes amplified by the internet
I still have my Zbots, fucking love zbots
Daaang Z bots were sick.
For my ancient friendships it's mostly homoeroticism, the occasional rant and nerd speak.
My best friend has 2 nicknames from me that I use (I never use his actual name, or his online name). The 1st one is from a joke that backfired on me and we both found endearing and funny. The 2nd one is literally a swear. This is too true.
honest : Zbots were never sick ...
I just text my friend Ooh eh Ooh ah ah. And I get a call that he busted out laughing
the way my fucking bf walked through the door and he just hears "WHATS UP FUCKO" is absolutely fucking debilitating me.
Retsuko! Kyehehe But yup, indecipherable and then years later asking, "Where was that from again?" "Meh *continues joke*"
Z-Bots were fucking sick.
I don't want to just comment relatable but I think it is so   Relatable
Only thing missing from the ancient friendship is jokingly declaring that they want to bang each other.
One of my friend group's inside joke is George Clooney pipe bomb (???)
I have a plastic tub full of Zbots :P
Now i know why i struggle to make new friends, I treat them like they are already ancient friends hahahahaha.
"Eat shit and die, dickhead." = "My friendship with you is worth more than all the gold in the universe, and I cherish it with every detail of my existence."
All i can hear is ratatoskr
I came
Gay friendships vs straight friendships
Obviously z bots were sick..
And then there new friendships that look like they formed during the Cambrian explosion but were actually started like last month
"Hehe member taun taun?"
Z Bots are in fact the shit. I found and bought a Z Bots Megabot as an adult because I was so upset that I no longer had the one from my childhood.
Good.
Is there any doubt as to whether you'll cry when you "understand Kurosawa"?
It’s so fucking funny how referencing obscure shit is only done with like really close friends and it’s even better when those friends know what it is
Is there any doubt that to practice science is to measure how much one has not [ever] managed to intend to commit crimes (or rather, "to do whatever may/will result in one assessing oneself, at a future point in time, as guilty")?  Is there any doubt that it is my name AND religion to legally, AND AS FATALLY AS POSSIBLE, bully members of the lower socioeconomic class[es] in America (assuming that there are more parties in America apart from the ...perhaps Putinists or Jong-Unists or... Who else? {An example of such a party}]?  Is there any doubt that the only story in the universe for non-savages is about being the father of a Greenlander-Japaner-American Native by mistake and then drowning the child immediately after we found out that the child was not a male/didn't get a Y-Chromosome from us?  Is there any doubt that it's a biological revolution that in court, suddenly everybody says that he or she herself is "[rather] not a drug dealer"©️; however, it is apparent that other revolutions should be taking [1st] priority due to the reality that we exist at this particular point in time? Is there any doubt that if I befriended you more, we would create the possibility of me being the father of your next child?  Can you believe the things that Americans do for attention? First, they ignore all professionals, who are the only ones who have ever paid attention to them. Then, they "participate" in a behavior which looks like rotting/decomposing while alive. They do this alone.  Never doubt that you have THE *BEST* future
Forgot the part with ancient friendships where like a week of never talking to each other goes by and when you next meet it's like nothing ever happened
*indecipherable inside joke* 😂
Did the guy just switched the labels? How can ancient people know these references?
Joke on you i don't have friends 💀💀💀
New friends: “greetings, my good fellow!” Proper mates: “ey f*ck-o, owyagoin?”
"Likewise my compatriot!"
Holy shit, Z-bots. Got hit by a truck of nostalgia.
This is 100% completely and totally accurate.
Me to my friend when they do some dumb shit:  "I will send you to the Gods without a second thought."
New friendship: "Oh my gooooood! We need to take about EVERYTHING!"  Ancient friendship: *sit with each other in silence for a good few hours* "Hey man I'm off." "Cool stuff, see you tomorrow mate."
Oh my god, it's the World Tree Gardener
Get out of my head. One of my besties and I greet each other with "One Vision, One Purpose." (Brotherhood of Nod, Command and Conquer.)
Warm salutations 😂
I like the ancient friendships more.
(completely incomprehensible inside joke) Yup. That's all we have now.
i just cant stand it when new friendships are forcefully trying to be ancient friendship by forcing inside jokes
Oh my gosh! I forgot about Z-Bots!
Thought “ancient friendships” meant “friendships in 500 BC” and I was genuinely confused for a sec
The most decipherable of my inside jokes is "Send the child"
A friend of mine and I have a thing where when one of us sneezes, the other will say "Bless you, salud, gesundheit, etc." to them followed by the others response being "You're welcome", and then the final reciprocated response being thank you without missing a beat with what ever we're doing, playing, or talking about.  Both in public and over discord calls.  Ex: Sneezer: sneezes Friend: Bless you Sneezer: You're welcome Friend: Thank you.  We've been doing that now for something like 4-5 yeas now I think.
My favourite was a friend emailing me 'nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar nyar NYAH nyar' out of the blue and me guessing the piece of music she meant :D
... I do fucking remember z bots actually.
Oh my God I have a Zbot toy that I've never known what it was for like 25 years now. Thank you
You guys have friends?
That is frustratingly accurate and I hate it lol
Hate and respect that you know how my life works
New friendships ''Walk on egg shells'' Old friendships '' We don't give a f*ck anymore, We have seen it all''
My friend kicked in my door, did a pitch perfect impression of the scooby doo laugh and then left without saying anything. We've been friends for 12 years.
I wish I had friends.
I have an inside joke with a friend where we just stare at eachother for around 20 seconds or so before laughing. I don’t remember how it started or why it’s funny. It just is
New friendship : Yo bro Old friendship : Yo fucker
Nice.
vs ancient Greek friendships
I still can’t believe this guy is Ratatoskr
You can't have any dignity or command any respect around people who you've known for ages because they have seen you AT YOUR WORST, while you can actually pretend to be a decent person around newer friends.
I would die for my ancient friends.
This guy look like ganke from spider man miles morales
This is why I sometimes prefer new friends 😂
THE SQUIRREL
Damn, man, I had all the z-bots.
0:13 “ROOBY ROOBY ROO” “ROOBY ROO” “FUCK YOU”
I literally walked into a room with my brother and I whispered dog noises to him across the room which he reciprocated until he won with a wolf howl then started talking about religion in The Book of Elise
This guy never asks for likes or subscribes or ringing any bells. He has 3 850 000 subscribers. What does this mean? If only I could figure it out. I feel it might be important...
0:11 I can't help but picture that being the voice for that Shaggy from that AU Velma focused series.  You know where scooby doesn't exist.
Completely unrelated but you did so well in gowr. Really fun performance you added a lot to ratatoskr.
The fckin face at the very end is comedic gold
DUDE, WHAT? I loved Z-bots- I had a bunch. Why did they stop making those?
“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.”Ephesians 2:8-9“for ‘everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’”  Romans 10:13
You know its an ancient friendship  when every single joke is making fun of something stupid the other did 10 years ago
Maybe someday I'll have that...
So true
The strange references that nobody else would nderstand is too true.
i do, in fact, remember z-bots
What does it mean if I dont have any "ancient" friendships... even with people I have known for 15 years, I dont talk to for 6 months, and then I text and we hang out or do something randomly and dont talk to them for a year. Thats pretty much all my friends...
My friends caller id is literally "Ass" in my phone
Love the traditions that nobody can recall the origin of
"Ruck ryou!!!!"
Is that an iPhone 4S?
our inside joke is based on this sonic animation that came out like 7 years ago now where we just go “heh, long time no see” at each other until we get tired of it
Accurate
Z-Bots WERE sick.
I didn't know this guy voiced Ratotskar in GOW Ragnarok.
Z-bots of all Times raining down like rain, a shower for all eternity!
Treasure your ancient friendships!  When they start dying off, you realize there's no one else who quite gets those years of inside jokes, stories, and associations.  All those are lost, like tears in the rain.
Very similar to how me and my best friend greet each other as opposed to the ones I'm only acquanted with atm.
He's in God of War Ragnarok!
"screw you dude, get out of here" "Yeah man go home ya jerk"  Later: "hes really cool I'm glad we're friends"
I wish I had friends.
Hololive vs. Nijisanji. Heh summoning WW3 basically but yall know it's true, cmon!
So, basically... *Me with my friends vs Me with my sibling*
bro could you even see?
Primordial friendship
I remember this one time I was at my friend's house house and we were playing some games on separate tvs then he says " what if I just started watch por*". I thought he was joking so I brushed it off and continued to play until I see him open up microsoft edge and pull up a meru the succubus video on. I just continued to play like nothing was going on. He did the same.
I am starting to think this is the ACD Joe edition 💀
C R I N G E
Special moment the first time they say "fuck you" and it's genuinely funny.
There's something about "do you remember z-bots" that really speaks to me
🥲friends?
Me and my best bro just start making (what seems like) chicken noises when we see each other. It his how we greet, how we say goodbye and how we show affection. I often wonder what we sound like to strangers.
What are z-bots?
I fuckin love zbots
Not only do I remember z-bots, but, I have mine still!  And they are sitting on my bookcase to the left of my computer.
Z BOTS!!!!!
i love that youre still doing skits these never fail to make me laugh
Me texting an old friend ima drop by "hey man, dont let your gf know about our affair, but im coming over to kiss and hold you"  Out of context that seems much weirder then when I sent it and he replied "omg cant wait with a bunch of kiss emojis"
Ancient friends are the only friends I keep. I have issues, I like to be alone, I enjoy time in the middle of nowhere with my dogs. (Maybe not do alone) I enjoy disappearing for months sometimes years at a time. The only friendships I maintain are the ones where we might as well be starting exactly where we left off 5 years ago. If I wouldn’t be willing to catch a flight back from wherever the hell I was that week to help you out in a very real emergency we may not be friends. You known I hold you in high esteem when my answer to one of your requests is “ I dont like it, I dont wanna, I think its a bad idea, but I’ll go down this rabbit hole with you, knowing better just so I can be there for you……. When it’s time to say I told you so”
I greet my closest friends with insults, slurs, and the most rancid, OSHA violating words mankind has ever created. It's perfect.
Any time my best friend and I start up BF1.  "Ready when you are, Sargeant Pembry."
Z Bots were sick.
Bro congrats on the role in Ragnarok
I'm somehow in the middle, where I'm excited to see my best friend and yet when we play games we sound like we'd beat the shit out of eachother if we could
Real ancient friendships, "We two dear men, friends forever, were here. If you want to know our names, they are Gaius and Aulus." -graffiti outside a bar in Pompeii before its destruction
Hashtag Revive Z-Bots.
when the inside joke is so ancient y'all don't even remember the origins anymore
Fun fact:  I still own about 500 z bots
Now that you have related and showed this to your friend, this random "ruby ruby roo" might as well be yet another inside joke referring to this video and meaning the quality of your friendship
I sure wish I were able to keep a friend for more than 4 years at a time max... sobs
Ah... You mean friendships that have existed for a long time, not friendships in ancient times.
Truly
Ah yes. The Incomprehensible Inside Joke.   Me and a buddy, many years ago on Xbox360, we're watching free shows on some App that the Xbox had that had stuff like the 3 Stooges n whatnot. Well, it also had the anime Slayers on it.  We watched some of it, and I can't really remember anything about it, EXCEPT for the Male characters name, which I've just learned recently is spelled "Gourry".   The reason I remember it is because we just...thought the name was funny and repeated it. Always as a question.   "Gourry?"  Like that name was just so silly and dumb, it just stuck with us, and now, like...well over a decade later, we just...still repeat it for one reason or another.   Especially if there's a lineup of words we're pretending to not understand. It just pops up.
쌍웡 뵈러 왔어요
I can't believe I miss people being a jerk to me.
Christian Finnish Frostiis hahah like me and my BFF :) Truly friendship is to be valued
Using 'ancient' instead of 'old' is the ProZD touch of perfection we love.
This reminds me of my mom being confused about the way my boyfriend and I interact. It's 6 years of inside jokes, we're speaking a whole different dialect by now
Supportive engagement comment
Zbots made this.
This guy sounds like Ratatoskr from God of War
Bro me and my best friend are completely fine getting into fights and expressing any problems in the relationship but we don't like fights with other friends and I think that why we've remained friends for so long
You're the only person to remember z bots
Accurate  Especially the whole inside joke part
Fuck yeah, Zbots!  I might still have some in storage!
Just wanted to share this, our inside jokes with my friends is roasting the hell out of each other, deblaterating our worst secrets publicaly but it has to be said like Louis armstrong singing
Been saying this for over 15 years! Haha
This is my brother an I so much ahahaha
his wife sounds like mousey dawgy v tuber I saw like yesterday on YouTube but now she is  iron mouse or something like that
i don't even say hi anymore. it's just straight launching into whatever inane thing has been on my mind that i couldn't wait to discuss
I too regularly tell my good friends to fuck themselves.
A elder buddy of mine once described friendship to me:  A friend is someone you can call at 3 am on a Tuesday and say “I need you come help me bury a body” and he’ll just say “ok”.   I have 2 friends.
omg this is so relatable, the sheer amount of random indecipherable sounds we make for "inside jokes" is worrying
Accurate.  I can always count on seeing one friend and "MOVE DEJONG" because Killzone 1 NPCs.
I had to google Zbots, didn't remember that at all.
Damn, I wish I had friends like that... or any, really. Gimme like 2.
We don't say fuck u we say I love u
Me to my new friends: you should take care of yourself Me to my friends I’ve known for 6 years: one day you will suffer for your crimes, and I will rejoice.
Sabotage/bamboozle each other, curse each other but be there when need each other
It made me just remember of a weird inside joke I have with one of my oldest friend to date. We were playing in a metal band and we past our summers fucking around our favourite pub after rehersals. As we were drunkly carrying our instruments home BY FEET, said friend of mine had the stupidest idea ever, which was walking like he was seated on an invisible chair saying nonsensical bullshit while blasting brutal death metal on his phone. Let's say we were ALL drunk. Everyone in the band joined in as that night "the creepy spoopy walk" was invented.  God, we were so fucking young and stupid.
"Oh hey there Kentucky Fried Dicken"
This is me and my best friend. 😂
Lol very true.
Then he said it's friending Time ! And friended all over them
The indicipherable inside joke is very relatable.
iphone 4s
What it I don't have frnds
Literally some of my friends and I will say “welcome to chilis, f*** you” whenever the restaurant is mentioned, which is more often than you’d think
I have ancient friendships where we don't talk shit to each other, and new ones where we do
Still amazed that this guy has a role in Ragnarök! Way to go, my dude! 😄
Damn, ratatoskr live action adaptation looks nice as fuck
zbots were sick
God it must be nice having friends who value the longevity of your friendship. I just know how to pick the ones who get offended by the slightest thing and backstab me in response.
we just quote old youtube poops with my old friends
This is so true.
Z-bots are pretty sick
I'm pretty sure you got it backwards.
Haha yes, I too know exactly what both of these feel like, haha yes
That's exactly
Zoro and luffy
this just show me how i dont actually have friends that stayed too long huh
I do remember Zbots.
JESUS, you almost made me click an ad!  Also true.
so THAT'S what they were called! Thank you for accidentally identifying a missing piece of my childhood. I still have a couple of Z-Bots in my "favorite old toys" box I keep at my parents' house XD
Zbots! Now that's a blast from the past, I had so many of those things.
0:12  and I’m still laughing
The best inside jokes are ones that are the ones that when said sound totally normal and not funny to anyone else. One inside joke in my friend group is "you owe me a drink" and this will cause everyone in the group to cackle but anyone else will think we are insane.
Z BOTS WERE SICK!
I thought this was supposed to be some sort of historical humor, so I was very confused
"Warm salutations!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂 icant
When the inside joke becomes the language itself, then you know
New Friendships: constantly talking and to stay focused   Ancient Friendship: the occasional fuck off and nothing more
One of the best long running inside jokes for me and my friend is "I don't even know what salt is."
Inside joke gang
"Heya fuckface" "Sup shithead" "Want to game today?" "You know it brother"
it's also this way with siblings
RATATOSKR FROM GOW RAGNAROK!!!!
relatable
Now I’m wondering how the reaction would be if he suddenly treated them backwards by mistake.
Yeah, zbots were pretty sick
Bonding!
Friendship is so ancient he is still using the iPhone 4S
"Sup BITCH" seems fitting.
What’s the name of your muckbang channel?
ABSO-FUCKIN-LUTELY accurate. I talk this way to my 3-year-old kid and my best friend.
"salam bro, wassup" "i'm good dude, how's you" "*screech* bassy πiπi πiπi" "*noises*" "*noises* *scream*" "hop on poGHFH ugh BLERK" "OHOHOOOO" usually how it goes
I still have a basket of Zbots!
truest video on here
yeah, z-bots were pretty sick
I need SungWon to understand that people will be referencing the scooby doo greeting as a new indecipherable inside joke
Bro wtf I just found out he was ratatoskr
Man this reminds me a childhood friend that I have, the inside jokes part is so goddamn true
Meanwhile in a world where everyone was always ancient friends with everyone
Sent this to some of my friends and they basically went “Bro, this is so accurate like what?”
The second one is how my brother and I communicate
I didn't think ANYONE remembered Z-Bots.
Imagine missing the opportunity to call your friend "scooby dooby douche" instead Tragic
Wow, this is a new low in my life, a prozd video where I don't feel identified at all.
Old friendships are basically -insults as affectionate gestures -TMI without it feeling weird -comforable silences
When SungWon looked into the camera for a split second at the end of the "new friends" bit, it REALLY caught me off guard. Felt like I got caught eavesdropping in on a conversation or something, lol.
Friend 1: "You are a f*cking abomination, gross." Friend 2: "A**hole, I hate you so much, I swear I'll stab you in the heart someday." Friends proceeds to French kiss passionately
Me and my best friend from middle school have had some freaky mind link moments. Like randomly singing the exact same part of a song at the same time, or calling each other at the same time to share the same information...It used to be funny but shit is still happening after college 😅
reminds me of some online friends i had who called each other all sorts of rude names constantly. could tell they were close friends IRL :D so funny to watch! randoms would be like "why do they hate each other?" and i'd be like they don't they're best friends XD
The ancient friendship is my relationship with my little brother
From the title I thought this would be comparing friendships nowadays to friendships in ancient history
As an Australian, the test is whether you've asked for their attention by saying: "Oi, cunt!"
Yup, any friendship that last long enough becomes like that.
Now, if only I had friends...
That scooby dooby dick flows lmao
I could listen to Ratatoskr speak all day
Accurate af.
I remember Z-bots
Ancient, ancient friendship: "We two man, dear friends forever. Caesar and Brutus our names."
“Zbots” just unlocked a childhood memory.
NOT ME FINDING A Z-BOTS REFERENCE A BAZILLION YEARS AFTER I PLAYED WITH THEM.
The casually bringing up a shared memory is underrated for how on point it is
Because you know where the boundaries are, what's okay and what's not, and you're secure enough that if you make mistakes you know you can patch them up.
Me and my friend literally just quote old JonTron jokes and say "Italy! Lawyers!" Because of an apples to apples game we once played.
apt
The more you get to know someone as a friend the more comfortable you are swearing around them...and farting around them. :P
We gotta get the Pokémon gen 9 tier list
I got an actual friend as a adult for the first time since.......school......  And we are fairly much like that first bit, and then I have my old friend I've had since school (15 years or more )  And we are exactly like the second bit, well done
yea......yea......wish I had any friends so I could relate to this joke......
I got a running joke with a friend where we grab each others collars and yell “Look me in the fucking eyes!” while looking in a completely different direction. Shits hilarious I think we thought of it when we were drunk
0:07 I'm glad all of us can be the best of "Chums" and nothing will ever change that.
I think one of the funniest inside jokes in my friend group is to use a specific sentence one of them said once as a copypasta of sorts. I don't remember the context of why she said it at this point, but it's super funny to me
In Australia: Sup Cunny? How the fuck are ya?
My current inside joke with my friend is Jill yourself which is partially recognizable but leads to further confusion than incoherent nonsense
Yeah I have one I greet by exchanging elaborate death threats with. Gets awkward when a stranger overhears. We were totally joking I swear!
Were you in that taco bell soccer comercial? The guy looked just like you( i swear im not saying that just cuz ur asian)
This is literally me and my ancient friend
This is so real
Funny.
I thought this was a skit about modern friendships vs friendships in ancient times and was confused for a few seconds
So true😅
I’m more friends with my 1 yr old friend than I am with my 7 yr old friend lol
🤦🏽‍♂️ Talk about being needy and piegas
Lmao this is exactly how it went down with so called new friends; they were all just so fake, too nice and using obscure PC new agey words, and not honest. Just very superficial. Glad I left the group when I did
So cute!
Do you just... like hearing the sound of the chimes?  I suppose they DO sound very pretty
There's nothing worse than someone who sees you as step 2 when you're still on step 1 with them.
Ancient Friendship: How I imagine Holst and Balthus meet again in Three Hopes
One of the most accurate things I've ever seen.
Post your inside jokes here with no context.  I'll start with a spider kiss.
I still have my zbots!!!
🍉🚇📱🇺🇸👍💀🔥👨🤔🙌❤️💭😳
You know the friendship's ancient, when the inside jokes are only weird noises at this point, leftovers of once full sentences...
These short skits you do are my fav. Wondering why they aren’t classified as shorts though? I thought under a minute is auto short
So accurate

*Throws remote to your best friend who drops it. "Oh that's right, I forgot your father left your family while you were a child so you never had a chance to practice how to play catch."
goddang I remember Zbots. Those were my favorite toys.
Z Bots were sick

Z bots were the shit
"Time and trust removes all masks"
Sung Won I think your video's are fun and I hope you don't die for a very long time.
Our inside joke is we pretend to be a couple (we are both guys btw) and my wife refers to him as my mistress lol
i let my mom sell all my old toys and now that i have my own kids i wish i kept the z-bots for them, they would have loved them. mistakes were made T_T
I always get so exhausted when talking to newer friends, but I've known my best friend Erika for 10 years. our friendship's gotten to the point I can just casually talk about the dudes I wanna cage and then 5h3'77 reply with a fucking jerma gif 💀
i will bully my closest friends to suicide
I misunderstood the title as meaning "friendships today vs. friendships in ancient times" and was initially confused.
conversations with friends that turn into audible shitposts are the best
ive been friends with 2 people since pandemic days and its either insults or we just play something on roblox or mc lmao
Bro I did not know that u voiced the squirrel in God Of War Ragnarok
Fuck yeah I had so many z bots
The sudden sidestep from approaching silence to talking about z-bots was for some reason really funny
whenever my friends and I bring up vine, one of us will eventually bring up the "adam" and "welcome to chili's vine. then one of us will say "hey did you know that guy died?" but we've said it so many times that it's just turned into "did y-" and then we laugh
This is legitimately so true you can talk to your best friend however you like 😂
why
True friendship is when you call out your friend using their dead mother's name and they call you back with your dead father's name and you both laugh at the end of it
Me and one of my close friends just yell "FUCK YOU!" at each other 50% of the time
One of my closest and longest friends and I call each other freak (a Harry Potter joke) and dumb bitch exclusively. 😂😂😂😂 That’s how you know it’s real!
There is nothing wrong with this video. It is entirely true and full of factual points
My oldest best friend is also my sister so we get some INSANE fake fight moments sometimes. I love it
I LEGIT CALL MY PAL FUCKO
Z bots are indeed awesome
i greet my friends by saying "what up, sluts"
https://youtu.be/ymA1PbQX-oI
time to dig out the old Z bot collection!
So true !
Facts, I’d go “what’s up b*tch” and my closest friend would go “what’s up wh*re”  It’s a love at first sight.
The most enduring friendships are the ones where you get to insult each other.
hey its ratatoskr
My best friend of ten years will accidentally hit me and apologize and say  "that was an accident" and then proceed to hit me again and say "well that one was intentional." She is actually my favorite person
Ancient Friends are definitely spot on, we basically insult each other and the other just says ‘Nice to see you too’
This is palpably spot on
Forgot about the part where things get super real really quickly.
Accurate
Sup squirrel
Me and my friend just tell each other to kill yourself.
20 seconds long and it’s on trending❤earned and deserved for the laughs
I've been playing Fallout 76 with this guy whose ten years old than me - calm down, I'm 23 he's 33 - for a few months now, and our running inside joke is; and I fucking kid you not...  Michael Myers be like: "get your cock out"
Honestly Yea
You aren’t best friends with them if you don’t know that one story about how their parents let them have way too much Tylenol as a kid because they’d just let them pour out as much as they wanted, and because they took so much Tylenol they started getting headaches and taking more Tylenol for the headaches
My cosplay friends vs my circle of friends
No one’s gonna mention that prop iPhone 4 at the end?  Nice touch of nostalgia 🥲
Anyone remember Teck Decks? I saw a kid playing with one today and was surprised they still make them
Imagine having a friend
Stop killing yourself with a knife and a fork!  Or chopsticks! It's really easy to get fat but it's hell losing it!
Literally though. I have a friend I’ve known since I was five and it feels wrong to be nice to her 😂
“Fucko” was way funnier to me than it ought to have been.
Zbots, that was an unlocked memory
I can without a doubt say this is 💯 true
Watching his channel is a little surreal when you consider how far he's gotten now
hello Ratatoskr
A Rank supports between characters of different houses vs C Rank supports between characters of the same house
This is 100% accurate
Is that what it's like to have friends?
Bro this guy has been on YouTube for like 5 or 6 years now and he still looks the same , wtf has he been doing in all this time he’s still overweight bro it’s been 6 years no offence
El ded
YOUR RATATOSKR
I thought this was gonna be a skit about like, caveman friendships and how we had to be friends with each other regardless of our preferences simply to survive. Still funny though.
I remember z-bots. Those were in fact sick.
Cringe 😬
Bro u got it up to the smallest detail   Purrfect
Funny my Asian brother 🤣 😂 😆
I liked Meta bots
Hey it's the funny Tree Rat from Reformed Buff Adult Delinquent with an axe
I once had an acquaintance explain to me that we were "silver friends" and his other friends were "gold friends" because they had been friends with them longer, and that's when I decided they were more of an acquaintance than anything because that was some silly shit that I don't think friends say, silver or otherwise. lmao
The only person I would speak like that to is simon cowell
Why would I want a friendship like that? Aren’t friendships supposed to be pleasant?
I wish I had that. Well, I do have a friend who screams at me for being a goblin after I screech at her like a pterodactyl.
Ahh good old ancient friendship. When you both talk shit to each other.
I have multiple ancient friendships and I can confirm, this is true.
Me and my friends inside jokes can get so damn convoluted
Ancient friendships be more like: 💀💀
RATATOSKAR
My cousins and I are stupid as hell in this exact way! One of us says “Blith” and we crack tf up for 10 minutes straight while playing League of Legends at like 2 AM.
I REMEMBER Z BOTS  Jawbreaker was the best omnomnom
so accurate
I thought the “Ancient friendships” were gonna be like two Ancient Greek warrior bros being all like “I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU BROTHER” “I WOULD AS WELL BROTHER”  Took me a full 2 seconds to realize what it meant by ancient
A new friend will ask you how your day has been, while a true friend will call you a slur and slap whatever your holding out of your hands at first glance.
You know you've maxed out your friendship with someone when you greet them with the middle finger
OKAY BUT Z BOTS WERE IN FACT TOTALLY SICK
the new friends both talk like christoph waltz
Ngl at first thought this was comparing modern day friendships to those of ancient time lmao
This is sooo TRUE
The best friendships are the ones where you can roast the living hell out of each other and then talk about shared interest as if nothing happened
Z boys were in fact sick
Basically me and my friends when we're chilling and someone just sings CHUNKYYY
Dude I love Z-Bots...
hey yeah z-bots were p. sick weren’t they
guess im ancient
I thought you meant ancient like ancient times and was very confused.
Zbots were sick.
The only ancient friendship I have is with my younger brother. Damn, I wish I had more of these
The best is when sometimes some random new friend hangs out with me and my best friend they get offended on one of our behalf. Then we both turn to new friend at the same time and say "Maaaan shut the FUCK up!!"
He gets thicker every year
I loved ZBots as a kid.
I actually do remember Zbots... I'd make them fight the battle beasts
Everyone in my closest friend group all calls each other "stinky" as a term of endearment and somehow Whismur and Wooper ended up being the mascots of our collective trio (Gloom shows up on occasion too).
You’re ratataskar!? One of the best side characters by far. Congrats!! Well done
Zbots?! thats a deep cut.
“what up fucko” lmfao
my friends and i mostly commit food crimes, like the dr pizza
...and the ancient friend is comfortable farting around you.
Hahahaha good times I wish I had friends
Zbot! Memory triggered
My good friend Kenny liked to slap me in the balls as a hello gesture.  I would put him in a headlock until he was about to pass out.  Ahh, friendship.
Ratatoskr
But do you remember z-bots though?
ZBOTS!!
Its true. Can make the whole squad crack up with this question  Q: And do you know why?  A: cause it's in a can.
I did not get the ancient friendship part.
I.... Cannot believe you just dropped a Z Bots reference... did Hear that right? I just had one set but I LOVED it... You said Z Bots, right? Edit: I just looked it up and I had a "MiniZ's" set, not even a proper Z bots set. It was called Spybase 7 an it was shaped like a god darn "Z" from one side. Came with a few characters, one of which was named "Bug" but I called him "Crusher" and he was the main characters of all my toys for a good while there. ...You did said Z Bots... right?
Incidentally, I had to recently buy a new-in-box Z-Knight (not the same as Zbot, but still a coincidence) for an old childhood friend, who lent me some about 25 years ago and they had just sat in my parents' attic ever since! When we stumbled across them, we found out one of the Z-knights had lost his head, so I had to buy another one.
When you said "ancient friendships", I thought it was going to be like Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei or something like that.
yo remember z bots
Sent this to the lads, absolutely spot on
Shit, I remember z-bots! My brother and I had a couple dozen of them.
Yo Z-Bots were the bomb! I just gifted mine to my 4 year old.
You can judge a deep friendship based off of how many inside jokes you have where you don't even remember where they originated from
I have threatened the lives of my friends multiple times, and they have threatened mine many times. I love my friends.
Oh my god......Zbots....? *dies from suddenly being warped back in time at breakneck speed*
and when you don't have the ability to talk, you just flip one of your endangered birds.
i really thought "ancient friendships" was going to be a literally ancient friendship where some character was going to ask another to honor his oath and join him in war against the equally ancient rival nation that has made swaths of destruction in their borders  but this one was good too
I'm just excited that someone else remembers Z-Bots. ❤️
My oldest and best friend passed away unexpectedly a few years back and this was essentially how our relationship functioned. With him gone, I no longer have a friend with whom I dive to these levels of insults, gibberish and relatable small and big talk.   Needless to say this hit me very hard. Both because it’s funny and because it mad me genuinely sad that he’s gone.  Thank god for my wife of 15 years who is still as beautiful and shit talks to me and does inside jokes just as well as  she always has! The only person who can make me laugh like he did!
no freaking way. zbots. lol.
Fake
Thought it was going to be a Cuthulu ref
When you and your friend regularly call each other a bitch and toss around “Your mom” jokes, I think it’s safe to say you’ve either found a friend for life or an asshole you should really disconnect yourself from. 50/50 shot on which one you got so hope for the former.
One is silver and the other gold.
All I'm hearing is Ratatoskr.
I thought this was comparing modern friendship dynamics to friendships in ancient history and I was very confused.
There are 2 types of close friends: The ones that share everything with each other The ones that can cast a spell against each others families with no hard feelings
Was he channeling the rude squirrel?
Z-bots were, in fact, hella sick
Scooby-Dooby-Dick is now how I'm going to greet my close friends...IF I HAD ONE
Z-Bots are definitely sick
Zbots were cool as fuck.
Z-Bots WERE sick

To true
I wasn't ready for the Z-Bots call-out.  Nostalgia OD
Yes! Z Bots were awesome!
My brother is my best friend and we have like a million completely undecipherable inside jokes
me with my college friends vs me with my sister
I am french and I don't understand one of the sentences from the "new friendship" phase. Could someone be kind enough to transcript the sentences here so I can use google trad, please ?
This one hit close to home bro 🤣
I wonder why most things has to devolve to their most primal states in order to be good and longlasting.  Its like, the more unga bunga we are, better almost every aspect of our lives are too. Makes you think.
I have a 3 way ancient friendship and we used to make jokes about one of my mates who will not be named being extremely short. He's now taller than me
Highly relatable.
As an Australian, the difference between "oi cunt" being a threat of imminent violence and "oi cunt" being how you greet your oldest and dearest friend is entirely a matter of facial expression.
That iphone 4 though
That anime thing, wish it was legit irl.
Z-bots were top tier.
You know......from the title I was expecting something completely different.  Like how Achilles or Alexander the Great had ""Close male friends""
...Oh, I thought that said "accident". Derp. Makes more sense if you read it right.
love this so much..LOVE OLD FRIENDSHIP MANS...legendary!!!
Z Bots were the absolute tits
"Nice to see you chucklefucks again." - Literally me after reconnecting with some college friends
We're rude cuz they ain't going no where
Growing up, my parents always said "Keep your siblings close, they will be your best friends when you need them the most" or something like that. Because of that focus, it has held true. Me and my 4 siblings have forgotten more inside jokes than we remember. That's what happens when you've spent your entire life loving and living with the same 6 people.
Hell of a shot tho! *My friends will know
you know it’s a long friendship when you don’t even understand your inside jokes anymore
Yep, this is accurate
I live for someone referencing z-bots.
nothing is as relatable as affectionately calling your very best, oldest friend a curse word
10/10
It’s like that one scenario: *You trip and fall on your face.*  Good friend: “Oh my god are you okay? Here let me help you!” Best friend: “LMAO stupid ass.” *Walks past you.*
Ancient Friend: Randomly brings up 10 year old insider which was funny for like a week and I somehow remember
MEDABOTS!!! ROBATTLE
I’ve been playing cards with the same group of guys every weekend for so long and that second part is exactly how we interact with each other.  We have so many long running inside jokes piled on top of each other that we’ve practically invented our own language.
I was joking  around with my friend/roommate in a supermarket cause he was struggling to get something to scan. Calling him a fuckin idiot that should've failed his CompSci degree and a woman stopped what she was doing to cuss me out. To this day whenever he calls me a fat loser that couldnt even finish one semester of university, I repeat her words back to him before calling him a decadent slut.
honestly, i don't like making fun of or insulting my friends - i love them and i often get kinda shocked by how rough some friends are with each other... i mean, if your friendship works like that, that's fine but i don't really like that when you're nice to your friends it means that you're not that close. the inside joke thing i can very much relate to though 🤣
Both of these exist in both eras, the second is just better
Wait... you guys have friends?
Injokes are fun
Are you using an Iphone 4 as a prop?
I still have this thing with my best ancient friends of touching each other's head while saying "mouche" (french for fly). It never made any sense, and no one ever questioned it
proving that tsunderes are truly the best archetype
I love Z-Bots!
Me: **Dramatic villain monologue**  Sis: **Dramatic villain monologues back**
"Ah here's trouble." - old mate
"Vittuilu on välittämistä" as we say in Finland.
At this point in my group of friends we just refer to each other as fucker with a descriptive to each of us Mini-fucker, Mother-fucker, The fucker,  Smart-fucker etc.
Yeah, those were sick.
Hey Ratatosker give me a sound
You don't know what 39 ru tu flu is but my friends and I think it's the funniest thing ever
Man fuck me for being so bored with life back then I lost my BFF’s number…
The inside joke bit is spot on
Ratatoskr
This bring me so many nostalgic feelings
I am simultaneously both with all friends, no matter how old the friendship
You forgot the middle friend. Friend 1:yo. Friend 2:yo.
The statement feels backwards
I feel this
The truest of friendships really is the ones where you can literally just say random jibberish and the other person will roll with it.
I remember sneaking up on my friend and smacking the back of his head so hard my hand was swollen and he fell over, we then went to have lunch
Australian friends skip right to the second one
The inside jokes get stranger and stranger the longer you know people.
Friendship isn't ancient enough, you can tell because after being called scooby doo when it cuts back to him he isn't already raiding the fridge.
Great skit ANYWAY ZBots ruled, the giant Megabot that the ZBots could ride around in was the best toy ever made.
When I bought a house I found one single z-bot on an i-beam in the ceiling of the basement. It's how I knew I made the right purchase.
Bring back Z-Bots!
"How'd you get in my house?" "Screw you, that's how" "Eh, that's fair. Bring over the icecream since you're already standing" "I brought two" "Not gonna question that"
ProZD Shall forever be known as Ratatoskr to me.
The friendship of the Law is not to be revealed to the world until the friendship of the World is revealed to the Law.
Glad someone else loved z-bots
Oh dude, I still have so many Z-bots. I loved those as a kid
I thought it was about historical “friendships” and assumed the latter would be kissing
Bruh 😂
Awkwardness is always out of the question with ancient friends. You can say the most random thing like if you're in total silence saying "...oh yeah, Arknights resets in 12 minutes", then go back to total silence and it wouldn't feel awkward at all.
another gem
another video that will live rent free in my head for a good while
Totally accurate. We had this picture me and my best friend used to laugh at then start narrating those lines from Metal Gear where the guy is narrating about why were they still there. It became an inside joke between us it's hilarious.
ProZD been on fire lately, like im taking Jordan 90s level
Nice
Of all the things he could say, Song chose to speak the truth ~ Socrates, probably.
new friendship: overly pollite old friendship: you drive each other nuts and insult each other because you're that close kinda like marriage I suppose.
This makes me want to die
The traditional greeting among my siblings is a middle finger, and it's like a wild west movie trying to see who's going to draw first.
New friends, you have to hold in your farts so you don't appear rude and gross.  Old friends, you hold in your fart so you can blast it in their face at the best timing.
Ancient friendships are the best
Not enough insults in the ancient part.
as a person with 0 friends I find this very relatable
The friendships where you can just bring up rando stuff from past with no context are the best
My roomies and i often make indecipherable squawks.
I loved Z bots!
New friend: "Oh hi friend" Old friend: 'sup slut
You know you're not real friends until you start greeting them as a cunt.
I seriously still have most of my Z-bots in a box in my mom's garage. A few of them are with me cuz they're totally rad. Also so my kid can play with them or whatever.
As a person who has an ancient friendship, i can confirm that we fake insult each other
The indecipherable inside joke killed me. So true
Those inside jokes that go so far not only is it hard to explain, it's pointless. That hit home.
Effing miss my Z-Bots
Actually so accurate. weird how insulting is the peak of friendship
The word step followed by my BFF flailing on the ground like he just got stomped on is the dumbest yet best thing I think we ever came up with in grade school. Also weed robot and cocaine man 💀 (DONT ASK)
For a second I thought this meant “new” and “ancient” as in “2020s” vs “caveman times” and was trying to figure out why ProZD was implying that scooby do existed in ancient times among other things 😂
Dude, I haven't thought about Z-Bots in decades.
I misunderstood the title as being literal friendships from ancient times, and got so confused.
I thought the title meant something like "friendships in 2022 AD vs friendships in 2022 BC" and I was so confused.
Accurate
Dude zbots were the shit
Zbots were friggin dope
meanwhile me and my friend calls each other "walking disasters".
Dan era vs Jon era of Game Grumps
You can tell people are close friends when they can be rude as fuck to each other and both not give a shit, those are the best
The ancient relationships are even better when you start to kiss the homies
at first i thought the title meant "friendships today vs. friendships in ancient times" and i was very confused
Holy shit Z bots! Fuck yes!
The only level above this is Significant Other.
painfully accurate. also, gonna start calling my friends scooby dooby dicks
The passive, nostalgia farming tangents, man... That hits hard.
Now I want a DLC for GoW Ragnarok where Ratatoskr greets Kratos with 'Yo, whaddup fucko.'
Did not expect to leave this video wondering where my old ZBots are, but here we are....
Ironically my new and old friends are swapped in this scenario. (My new friends are much cooler. =3)
my best friend said if anyone says to him what i say to him hed punch them but when i say it its funny
This me and my sister
YOOO!! Z BOTSSS!!
me and my best friend have been friends for 14 years im 20 rn
My inside joke with one of my closest friends is *THE ANTS ARE BITING MEEEEE!!!* I will not provide context
I love that YouTube thinks that the (completely indecipherable inside joke) is music in the captions
So on point
Me with my friends from high school: "Why am here!? What am I DOING!? I'M ON A TRIP WITH A *DEAD MAN!"* all of us: 🎶What made me think, I could get through this, why in the hell did I ever do this, HOW IN THE HELL WILL I EVER GET BY!🎶 We were in thespian club.
[ Completely indecipherable in-joke] Maaaaan I feel called out on that one. I have so many.
Sounds legit
Insider jokes are the epitome of an old friendship or old acquaintances
Where the hell are my zbots?!?!?! I had so many
Him: Makes joke about being rude and having and inside joke My and me "Ancient Friend": Using the "inside joke" joke as our inside joke
sooooo truuuueee
This neighbor kid I knew growing up had a ton of zbots. I didn't know they were those until you made me google zbot and gave me instant nostalgia so hard i got whiplash, but i think the dude had like a full set.  Wasn't even a rich kid, though with was a few years after they came out so maybe they got them at a flea market or something.  They were indeed sick.
As I always say, “The more you know someone, the more you are allowed to bully them.”
ngl I was expecting the ancient friendships segment to just be one guy ripping ass and the other guy ripping harder ass in response.
ohhhhh
Did not think I'd hear a Zbots reference today. Still have all mine! Centoid was my fave.
This feels like a very classic ProZD sketch and I love it
Totally redeemed yourself from the last vid ... Nice .. funny ... shiny ... slippery and fun !
That first stage never happens for me. I go straight to the insults. It filters out the weak ones.
Im sure he gets sick of people telling him to make more skits... but SungWon is the living embodiment of a mood. The guy nails it.
My friend legit calls me pussyfart and I genuinely felt hurt when he called someone else that
Best friends are each others worst nightmares
And yet everyone in my family gets upset when I insult the boys.
I was expecting wizards
Bro...zbots...
78 people have new friendships.    And that's alright.
Went from nagito to fuyuhiko
So true....
You can tell someone has been friends for a long time when the word "sup" has more detail and essence to them than it should.
Z-bots rule!
Even amongst siblings, this is true.  XD
Skibide bop in bodupp
The amount of inside jokes amongst myself and my friends... man this is relatable.
For context, I am visually impaired with a white cane.    I knew this dude in college who, shortly after meeting me, said “We’re friends, but if zombies are chasing us, I’m gonna steal your cane and trip you.”   That was 12 years ago.    He’s now one of my closest friends, and I was even a groomsman at his wedding a few years ago.
Bro... Z-BOTS reference YES!
This reminds me when I was in college and 2 friends from back home texted me a picture and I said "go fuck yourselves" and they were completely taken off guard by my response, prompting me to explain that saying FU is just how my new friends and I greeted each other daily
I went up to someone I’ve been friends with for 8 years and they were just like “hey how’d it going” and I just instinctively went “fuck you”
Fucking loved Z bots as a kid
What I like about this guy's videos is how relatable they are.  Right down to the inside joke that's just meaningless gibberish to anybody else.
Makes sense.
Hey there's a guy on here pretending to be you and is trying to scam people into messaging them, thought you should know.
I love this, it is so accurate. I had a friend in my old town that I didn't talk to for a bit after I moved, but finally had the balls to contact and play Fortnite with him. We have been playing for a few years now and we keep on having these funny moments where it is like we are throwing rocks at a wall until something clicks. Like I have my constant need to say random shit and rhyme stuff while he has his encyclopedic knowledge of memes. So I remember a shirt Cold ones made and it was of a skeleton smoking a blunt saying "wagwan" and my friend thought I said "womp womp" like from the news report where a girl with down syndrome was put in a cage and a person in the report said "womp womp."
"Sup, bitch?" An old friend, i guess
Likewise my compatriot...dafuq.  🤣
I'm currently in a cursed state with one friend/coworker who I haven't known that long but he's the brother of one of my besties. Having to maintain professionalism while 80% of the stupid inside jokes work is straight up bizarre. "Morning team!" "Hi!" "Heya" "Sup muppetfucker"
Z-Bots we’re indeed sick.
"Likewise my compatriot" "Warm salutations"  😂😂😂
It's always amazing to me that he sums everything up so accurately in 20 seconds.
It makes sense. It's based off the confidence in foundation
I'm every fucken JRPG 2 characters instantly become friends after the first conversation. After hearing a minimum of hearing 3 Effort Noises from each other this signifies that they have been through a lot aka enough to call each other best friends. Yeah that's so Mid now...
What is "friendships?"
The second one is how I interact with my sibling lmfao
Friends? Unrelatable. Unsubbed, disliked.
I always envied friendships like that in the media because I never really had that experience, at least yet. I’m only like that with my maybe partner, maybe ex (we’re in a weird situation right now), practically we’re very close friends so maybe this is that friendship. Not with the people I know the longest since childhood though, we never had that relationship and especially now since we see each other like twice a year, we’re very cordial and polite.
it’s my first year in highschool and the first part is me with my new highschool friends, and the second part is me with my friend from 2nd grade that goes to the same school as me
Sometimes your ancient friendships can ruin your newer ones because they think your all obnoxious
i have many jiberish phrases used to greet my old friends
I'm just excited for more of your voice acting in Big Top Burger. I still can't believe though that Mir went with someone else for that role though. Their loss!
Having friends sounds wild
DID YOU SAY Z BOTS?! LIKE Z BOTS AND V BOTS?! MAN I HAD SOME COOL ONES! IM OLD! :D
damn this made me realize i have no close friends like this lol
Watching your friend almost die and laughing. Ancient friend  Watching your friend almost die and panic. New friendship
algorithmic punch!
bro your url has the game awards in it...wtf lol uploaded today and the award show is on right the second.
Z-bots were so sick
Currently living with an old friend. Every other conversation turns into either insults for us laughing about how definitely and very human we are
The day I met my best friend, we quoted Billy and Mandy at each other like that. "Destroy us all!"
Me and my best friends I've known for years call each other the dumbest and meanest things. And I love it
Ha, yeah. I do remember Z-Bots.
the ruder your friends are to each other the more they like each other
Confirmed that Z-Bots are sick.
I’m down with Anyone who know-knows z-bots
The amount of accuracy in this video is scary! 😂😂
Can’t relate sadly
at dinner with good friends: what a lovely ensemble you’ve prepared for us tonight   With that one friend: *holds an entire conversation making mentally damaged cat meows*
HOLY SHIT Z-BOT DEEP CUT! I HAD SO MANY OF THOSE!
I remember Z-Bots.  They were cool
yes this is true this does happen im a case of this
The indecipherable inside jokes are very true lol
We forget our inside jokes in like a week.
My brothers and I can communicate whole scenarios by vocalisation of  Looney Toon incidental musical motifs
I thought…I thought the new and ancient meant time periods-
This is many levels beyond comfortable to fart around
I preferred b-daman and I legit had a convo that started like this video a week ago with my friends about it.
It took me like 3 watches to understand you meant friends recently made vs those had for a long time. At first I thought it meant how friends act in modern day vs those from like ancient Egypt.
ngl, when i read "ancient friendships" my mind went to friendships in medieval ages where 2 guys would meet in a market and die together in battle, embracing each other, like a week later
actually no joke I greet my friends with "Greetings and salutations the one that is known as [insert name here] how was the rest of your yesterday" then the other friend arrives and we all do it in perfect unison and it sounds EXTREMLY CREEPY
The fact he mentioned Zbots means I was part of a larger culture outside of the internet without having internet access.
I rag on my friends all the time. Mutual ragging leads to long lasting friendships, truly.
Sung just wanted to bring up zbots. Everything else in the sketch was arbitrary.
But are you comfortable farting around them?
oh my god this is so true
My best friend and I talk so much that we practically have our own accent.
Yep pretty much.
My friend group's inside jokes are just other ProZD skit quotes
You know you're good friends with each other when you start rippin on each other and laugh together.
I loved Zbots!  The cool thing about them is the bipedal ones all had a similar design mechanically so you could remove the screw in the back to take them apart and switch the arms of one zbot with another to make a mutant zbot.
School friends vs. siblings
This is basically my discord in a nutshell.  It's basically just a big circlejerk of us bullying each other LMAO
This is true friendship.
I thought this was a skit about ancient Rome friendships for a minute there
Yeah, dude. You ever love a friend so much you both don't give a fck anymore? That's the best.
"You have unlocked a new friendship level where SungWon is comfortable farting around you."
ruh roh
Busting into my friend's house like "What's up you fucking wangs!"
Yo Z-bots were sick tho
You're not a true friend until a perfectly valid conversation is "You remember the thing?" "Yeah" "Yeah"
I love this. You know you're best friends when you insult each other and then laugh. Then you bring up something random, lol. So it's pretty accurate.
What is this thing you call "friendship"?
The inside joke part was so relatable like actual barbarossa behaviour with a bit of ronaldinio saucer
respect for the iphone 4/4s
Ya gotta have the veneer of being a nice person to the new friend, otherwise how could they stand to be around you long enough to get to ancient friend?
Some of my ancient friends still act like new friends tho
True perfection is when you can razz your friend and his parents sometimes join in
Rule of friends: The meaner we are to each other, the more we love each other*  *Footnote: This rule only works if all parties understand that the insults are not honestly meant, and boundaries on how far things can go are set
I miss having friends
"Raggy. 😥 Where are my balls Raggy?"
this guy made the voice of my fav character.
More inside jokes than a teenager’s social media page.
Dagnabit! Now I gotta go figure out what the hell zbots are and learn everything about them.
shoutouts to the iphone 5
Hell yeah Zbots
So true, true friends take insults to each other as jokes, cause they 100% are
my high school friends still call me by some incredibly specific nickname with such an uninteresting backstory behind it  it's literally been over a decade now and that's still my default name to use with them
Greeting friends new vs old. News: glee and giggle. Ancient: Calling each other sovabitches follow witha manly grip handshake to show dominate. Like in Predator.
I agree. Zbots were the best.
i took this title as like.. modern day friendships vs something like ancient greece so i was waiting for him to kiss himself.
Yup
FUGGIN ZBOTS!
wait... is it not the other way around?
I thought you were going to go ancient as in caveman friendships where they just grunt at each other and share meat. Things really haven't changed much now that I think about it.
How does a 20 second video get 22k thumbs up in only 2 hours?    I love being one of those many thumbs.
LIKE ZOINKS GANG IVE BECOME DEATH INCARNATE DESTROYER OF WORLDS
This is more related to who you are. Like insulting your partner during sexy or calling them daddy, not everyone does it. You just want to do the latter so you hold back on new people and let loose once you know they are ok with it.
I don't have friends anymore. :| The ancients ties have been severed.
I've been trying to get ProZD out of my house for weeks but he keeps hiding under the couch pillows to spy on my friendships to make videos about them  There might be more logical explanations but those are boring
Fucking Z Bots. Those were sick.
I don't remember Z-Bots.  I remember Go-Bots, Voltron and Transformers, but not Z-Bots.
But of course
I thought this was going to be a video about friendships nowadays vs friendship from like ancient Egypt
'Indecipherable inside joke'
Sitting here thinking about what friends I have that have been around for a long time and I'm like, "we haven't really been friends _that_ long. Even though we talked sometimes in high school, we didn't hang out much 'til college" Yeah we graduated like 8 years ago. Fuck I'm old.
My first thought was if theres no swearing or verbal attacks theres no real friendship
Yeah, that’s about right.
Man, I loved Zbots. They were so cool. Still have a couple floating around somewhere
I punch a good friend of mine all the time. We just punch each other and that’s how we communicate
Literary Reformer Sungwon, please go to China with me so I can start having 18 kids. I'm currently across the mountains where the sarcastic people live
‘Ancient’ made me think they were all going to have robes and talk in old English
You best believe I remember z-bots
Me to new friends: you are a cherished friend and I value our  time together Me with my ten year friend: if you don't buy me Starbucks I will literally hunt down your parents
Okay but we actually use the scooby laugh in one of my oldest friend groups how did you know
You know you're real friends when you can insult each other.
My goodness you have a strapping physique
transcendent thumb nail ;)
This is extra relatable considering one of my friend group's oldest inside jokes is also about Scooby Doo and dicks.
New Friendships: “Hey hows it going man!?”  Old Friendships: **racism** **racism** **heart shattering insults**
You can’t do that with a new friend because you don’t have the same level of familiarity with them. You gotta experience some shit and I mean really go through some shit together to get to that level.
Literally just this morning my friend and I said hello by cussing at each other 🤣🤣🤣
This is so fucking accurate I can't begin to describe how accurate it is
Am I the only one who thougt the video will be about modern friendships vs friendships in ancient times?
You're not true friends unless you call each other by insults.
The implication here is that I don’t have any close friends
Haha, ohh that is so true
Those were sick
So tru
new friends pour through the revolving door
I think you got it backwards oh wait you meant same time period different friendship lengths
0:06 "warm salutations" Back in my day we got cold salutations. You youngsters don't know how good you have it these days.
real vs fake 😔
You are only best friends when you say hello by cursing at each other and then immediately act like nothing happened
New Friend comes to my house: Welcome, can I get you something to drink? Old friend comes to my house: HONEY GET THE GUN, THAT ASSHOLE MADE IT PAST THE MINEFIELD!!!
this man gets the human condition 😄
thought it meant like friendship in the roman empire
Dude your skits are so good recently
sex
How deep did you dig for Zbots!?!?!? i fucking loved those things but no one has mentioned them in like 15 years
Bitter Squirrel: F&CK off - I’m BuSy!!
Mercymorn and Augustine
Zbots *were* sick
My bestie and I will both always crack up at ‘convenient handle.’ And no one will ever get why. And that is precious to me.
I thought this was comparing modern friendships.  To ones from ancient and classical history.
If people don't think we are a gay couple very much in love you don't qualify as an ancient relationship.
Well... he's not wrong.
Z Bots were sick actually
As someone who greets all his closest friends with "What's up f*cknuggets" I can attest to how true this video is
Zbots were in fact, sick.
I love that he has an iPhone 4/4S !!!!
yeah i don't have any of the first type, so i wouldn't know XD
Today my friend and I were listening to someone present a speech about fathers. Afterwards, my friend asked if she could make a dark joke. I said sure and she leaned in and whispered in my ear "that entire speech, I wanted to say "you don't have one of those!"" I lost my shit and was actually on the floor laughing so hard I got muscle cramp. My dad passed away almost 2 years ago and we've both made many jokes about my lack of a father many times lol.
I appreciate that this skit goes beyond the "new friends are nice to each other, old friends are mean to each other" surface-level analysis you usually see in jokes about this topic
The bot comments on popular comments in this comment section (sorry for the over usage of that word) are just laughable
Here at 60,759 views.
This is SO accurate, it's almost not funny...almost.  I have this EXACT relationship with my oldest nephew: we curse each other out pretty much every time we see or speak to each other after a while.
Friendships age like fine wine.
I had a friendship graduate from new to ancient the other day. We walked past each other and just said fuck you, it was glorious.
z-bots are these zombified ruzzians who came to Ukrainian lands?
When people think ancient means like a few years 😂
I knew the second half was going to hit home, and by golly it did XD
Z bots were absolutely sick
Thats how I know I got a good friend. We can joke about Goofy's massive dick and not feel like lunatics.
When you have neither old nor ancient friendships 🥲
Do the comments in the comment section in some videos/channels really show how much the audience are close to the creator/channel?
I've known my best friend for 14 years    I'm 15
Alternative Title: Fictional Friendship vs real life friendship
I thought you meant ancient as in like ancient Greece or something
Relationships are like cheese. The more time passes, the sharper and more foul they become.
Z Bots! Zo cool!
As someone who actually does greet my old friends with a "what up, fucko?" I am a little scared by the accuracy here
I know this video would kill it as a short/TikTok but I appreciate it being filmed in landscape for my old ass
"Sup fuck-o, remember the Bionicle and Exo-Force sets?" "You dickhead, you bet I remember them"
The last is Melodias and Ban.
Respect the Aggretsuko plush
You know a friendship is good when they try to destroy your entire bloodline, one of you becomes a vampire, create a new form of fighting through arrows, and has their boyfriend reset the universe (twice) after killing 2 members of your family, and then being killed by an 8 year old from prison who was also friends with one of said members of your bloodline, all hundreds of years after killing you and stealing your body!
"likewise my compatriot" I'm dying!
It's like that scene from Demolition Man.
True! I alwasy wet my hair for my new friends, but old friends I let it dry out a little bit! sooooo accurate!
Dude, I feel like I'm tripping rn. Earlier today at work, I used the word "compatriot" and I thought to myself "...is that even a real word? Was that the right time to use that word? No one ever says that word..."  Then, I load up this video and he says "compatriot" the same way. WAYYYYY too much of a coincidence lol.
_Painfully_ accurate.
first half is ENA dialogue
“Indecipherable inside joke” is my favorite part about old friendships
Bork
Hmm, so that's what it's like to have friends.
...eh. nah
I do remember z-bots...
How did I never notice this before?! 😂
That's the life
I'm so fuckin' dumb lmfao  I was thinking of this as like, friendships from the middle ages versus today and not really getting it. It was like a solid minute later that I realised, send help.
upon seeing the title i thought this was gonna be a joke about historians writing couples off as friends
19 seconds of just straight Truth.
don't forget ancient friendships treating your refrigerator/ your whole home like it's theirs and vice-versa
When you ran out of things to talk about because you’re both caught up to everything that made you friends in the first place.
Why can we only give thumbs up? Why not hearts or hugs?
The inside jokes are so accurate 💀🤣🤣
me and my wife in high school vs now
Last week I showed my wife my friends WhatsApp group chat for a couple minutes, created in 2012, and she said she got a headache from trying to decipher what was being said cause none of it made any cohesive sense
Yup.  yup…
i thought it was gonna cut to ancient greece or something
Nowadays the second friendship would have been considered "toxic."
Da heck’s a z bot?
I wonder how many times Sungwon has called Jay a Scooby dooby dick
Haha........I have no friends
"I guess that's my name now...until I die....fuck-o".
"ROOBIE ROOBIE ROOO!!"
I was so confused by this at first because I thought "ancient friendships" was like, in Egypt or whatever
You know it's a friendship that'll last when you begin to act like a married couple that only communicates through insults.
Insanely accurate.
Pure. Genius. 🙌👐👏
Heh I wouldn't know.
A close friend of mine said "what's up you scoobydooby dick" and I didn't even question it or realised she was referencing something.  So yeah it's pretty accurate.
One time my friend Logan changed the name of our friend group's Discord chat to the URL for Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up, and a few days later he sent "NO I GOT RICKROLLED BY PAST LOGAN"  Someone else responded with "past logan wouldn't give you up, let you down, run around or hurt you" immediately followed by "actually he'd do all those things nvm"
Me and my friends call each other John, its pretty funny whenever someone asks who John is and we have to explain the backstory
I have a friend. Even if we dont see eachother for months, this like we start where we dropped off.. awesome
I thought this was going to compare friendships in Ancient Greece or something
Dude, Z-Bots WERE sick!
You voice rattatoskr?!
I have a few buddies that I've known since highschool and this is us for sure
Just spent a week with my 2 high school buds for our annual trip to see each other since we live far apart now. This latter half is terrifying accurate
Yes, I can relate to this, because I've definitely had friends before.
accurate.
You know this wasn’t quite what I expected. I thought new friendships would be some cringe Gen z lines and ancient friends would be unga bunga caveman talk
me fist bumping a line of my friends in the hall be like: "wassup" "wassup" "wassup" "fuck you" "wassup"
If you can say the most wildly offensive pile of flaming garbage from the depths of hell to your friend without them getting offended, they are true friends.
"Yo waddup fucko" is LITERALLY how I greet my best friend.
Z bot reference?! Holy shit! I don't know anyone else who knows what they are.
Inside jokes are just memes that exist only between you and your bros.
New friendship: OMG don‘t scare them off!!! Ancient friendship: They‘ve SEEN shit, and are still here.
Anyone remember B-Daman? Or did I just dream all that.
yeah 💚
*“Gotta lotta guts coming here after what you pulled… c’mere ya old pirate!”*
You can tell how strong a friendship is by how much both parties insult each other without getting pissed
I am emotional
Reminds me of how Ban and Meliodas found each other after 10 years and started beating on each other in pure glee XD
Being called a Scooby dooby dick has to be earned through years of commitment and trust.
Hundred percent accurate, there is absolute trust in a bond you share with a friend where you can cuss the shit at each other and finish with a cracked smile
My former best friends used to talk crap whenever I'd say "thank you" or "your welcome"  Ah, good times.
Only true homies go ‘yo bitch’
Bionicles were dope.
Keith and Lance in S1 of Voltron vs Keith and Lance Post Season 3 onward  >Keith: Red Lion? Phh to fuck with that I am an Alien Ninja Warrior now.
100% accurate! 😂
I know we're truly friends when we start talking mad shit to each other😂
If you aren’t insulting every aspect of their existence, can you really call them your friend?
My close friend and I literally greet each other with "Yo, bitch!"
I have to be honest- I’ve never understood the “we’re the best of friends, so naturally we greet each other with name calling and such”.  I have a best friend I adore more than the waking world. I’d never show her anything other than my true (platonic) love for her, even when we’re having disagreements I still love her too much for me to use such foul language.  Am I the only one who feel this way? How are you acting with your friends?
aggretsuko plush
My friendships are legit like that to this day
literally half our dialogue is incoherent noises
This particular skit has been done before by many, many short-form skit youtubers...however ProZD proves once again that he rises above the crowd and makes the best one
Needs more Enkidu and Gilgamesh
😆
The amount of people with millions of subs these days
oh man. i fuckin loved zbots
yea absofuckinlutely also i need to use "scoobydoobydickhead"
Holy shit *ZBots*
I wouldn’t know :,(
Z-Bots! I haven't thought about them in years! Good times!
Omg ratatoskr made a new video
wait did you mislabel them?
This speaks to me. You knew it would.
Fuck yeah Z-Bots were dope
You dont want to ruin your new friendships by saying something inappropiate; and your old friendships are long time dead but who cares they still bros
Always avoid those who treat you like a very close friend in this way when you barely know each other.  The vitriolic camaraderie has to be forged in the fires of Hangouts and Time.
Where's the "they're super good friends with each other but ignore my texts and messages and memes I send and don't check out my ig stories aren't interested in my hobbies don't initiate conversations don't ask about me when they go out and yet we've been friends for 8 years"
The inside joke hits too close  Me and my friends talking about deepthroat the concept but not the action
this is literally a trope called "vitriolic best buds" it's also pretty normal in real life
When I read the title I thought it was "new vs ancient" as in "modern vs ancient", but this is great too
My ancient friendship has lasted 15 years and this is 100% accurate
Spanish is like this by default, so imagine how we Spanish speakers speak to our older friends lol
This got me really good
Ancient friendship sent me lmao
i thought this meant new friendships as in friendships in current day and then ancient as in literal B.C. times. ended up being super confused
Did he say GO BOTS?!
yuppp we do call each others names for greetings 😂
Oh god, someone else knows Z-Bots! I thought I was the only one!
the wonders of friendship. i can't relate.
Alternatively: Friendships vs Sibling Relationships
(Indescribable inside joke). The only friendships i'm still aware of
What is this??? AN iPHONE and not a PSP???!!!
Fact
I did not know another person on this earth remembered Z-Bots. I still have all of mine.
I thought this meant like how people now act with their friends and how people thousands of years ago acted with their friends and i was very confused
This is disgustingly accurate.
bruh
ill greet my friends with a string of the most offensive cancel causing slurs possible. it's beautiful.
Relatable is an understatement
Why is this so accurate lmao
all my friends are the latter or not my friends at all
Can you really call yourself longterm friends if you don't have a gibberish exchange that only you two can understand?
yeah
Yo Z Bots WERE sick
I do remember z-bots.
Imagine having any friendships
You know you have great friends if you can bring up absolutely anything, like the most random s*** and it’s just business as usual
One time with my best friend we ended up talking about strawberry shortcake and looking up if she had a pet  It came so outta nowhere
I wish i had this type of friendship
Looking up Z-Bots again and feeling sad
Z bots are great
For some reason I thought this was going to be about friendships in like, Ancient Mesopotamia or something
compatriot moment
I still got my Zbots.
Hahaha, friends... Very relatable :')
Yeah, 100% accurate
Yeah, that tracks. I've got a pair of friends for about fifteen years going, and we are very rude to eachother.
FAX
I fucking loved Z-bots
Is it weird I act like the first one not the latter one?
Z-Bots WERE sick though
It's funny, how I still can relate, although I don't and didn't have any close friends for my whole life)
What about the bit where your oldest friends just seemingly get bored of hanging out and you go increasingly longer amounts of time between even speaking to them let alone seeing them. They have long since stopped talking about their lives and hopes and dreams or anything remotely real and you are basically completely reduced to surface level activities only like board games and stuff.   Oh, SungWon is only 31, so he's still got that to look forward to (or is yet to become one of those who ceases to care about meaningful socializing and bonding outside their own little family or pseudo family unit and thus never understands what I'm talking about).   Getting old is just pain really, I would recommend not doing it tbh.
The truth of it, if you're not insulting your friend, he's not your friend yet.
accurate
Going to place this in the Canon of the pizza Brothers anime
Beautiful.
Oh man, Zbots, wasn't expecting that! I was a big fan and spent many hours playing with my collection back in the day.
Hello compatriot 😃
Sungwon, as a voice actor, you have incredible range. I was wondering if you can do an Ed Wynn voice.
The z-bots line…it went directly into my heart 💚 thank you
me and my best friend: [unintelligible raptor screaming]
The closer you get with someone the meaner you’re able to get with them without them being upset
The Zbots from burgerking were amazing
Actually 100% accurate
Man I really hate the 'likewise my compatriot' phase.
me and my dog
best part of ancient friendships is knowing the most absolutely cringe stories about each other from like 15 years ago
I miss the days we could insult each other as a form of good will.
I miss zbots :(
"roooby rooo" "Fook youuu" "Ehhh"
I wish I had someone I can do this with  Honestly either scenario :(
What's scary for me is I have no concept.
Lmao
"hahaha...I do that"
New Friendships:  "Hey how are you?" "When?" "...today?" "DID I ASK" "Alright bye!"
Remember 'Member Berries'?
The worse you treat them, the more you love them haha
Z-Bots!
Yep. I'm definitely rude af to my closest friends (vice versa).
🔔🪓
I love how ProZD said he chose the thumbnails from the suggested and now there is not even one.
...One of my best friends just woke up, and the first thing I did was link them a horrible meme I'd been saving all day JUST to share with them. This is not the first time I've done this. Nor shall it be the last. So, 10/10 on accuracy here!
Best of Chums:
New Frienships Mostly ended be like  "Hey i hope we can getting know each other"  " Yeah me too! "  *Last seen 3 Years ago
I think your subtitles are backwards, lol
So so accurate that it’s almost painful
The random topic change to something that might be a TOTAL miss just cause you feel safe talking to them you know it doesn't matter 10/10
Good friendships are built on verbal abuse that’s never taken seriously or meant to be hurtful
We don’t so this, we’re too sensitive 🙃
If you can't talk to your homie about how awesome Z-bots were, are they REALLY your homie?
Very accurate, Especially with the in-conherent inside joke.
I thought this was gonna be about modern friendships versus friendships from centuries ago, but this is better than I expected
i'm early
I would never show the middle finger or say to someone that they look like sh** except for my best friends lmao
I just don't understand this whole banter thing why would you want to say such awful things to someone close to you it's not even a joke it's just an excuse to be rude
"Scooby-Dooby-Dick" has gotta be one of the best/worst things to call someone💀😂😂😂
I actually still have some Z Bots in the house somewhere, thank you for reminding me~
Comment on this comment if you are a bot.
😭
'ruck rou' haha
ZBots were sick.  The big robot that the little robots ride in was my favorite when I was a kid.
whenever my friend and I meet we greet each other with a high-pitched "Mr Obama?" and I wouldn't change it for the world.
yeah
Now this is the level of companionship all should try to achieve
This is like how we see the friendships of the past but backwards.
Hehehe 🤭 you got that Line down pack. Thank you only for The Laughter.
😆💯
If this is not what people thousands of years from now see our friendships as I'll be a tad bit annoyed with future humanity. 😆
"Scooby Dooby dick" had me howling
This is accurate
ROOBIE ROOBIE ROO
First Date vs 5 Years Married
You know a friendship has lasted a while when you have inside jokes running so long even you can hardly understand them anymore.
It really be like that 😂
Only people I've know for 2 years or more know I play Yu-Gi-Oh, and for 5+ years of friends, I whip out the duel disc.
I thought this meant “Modern” friendships vs Ancient friendships for a second
You're not wrong.
Cherish friends like this, they are slowly going extinct.
The inverse is equally accurate
It be like that.
Damn
<3
Me to my new friends: hey how're you! Me to my old friends: wassup sl*ts!
accurate 100%
I miss new friendships.
Imagine trying to catalog every inside joke every ancient friendship has produced....has Reddit done that yet?
There isn't anything more friendly that swearing to your friend
People ask me why I don’t really like making new friends, that’s simply because I just really prefer talking to people I know will want to listen about whatever bullshit I wanna talk about 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
You know they’re a true friend when they can curse your bloodline with a straight face.
My Bro just say the jokes before I can make them-  We share 1 brain cell filled with memes .
Why would your friend speak ancient if he's a new friend?
Ruby ruby roooooo
Inside jokes are the greatest thing to have between friends. I cannot possibly explain to anyone what "sushi roll" means to me and one of my friends lol
Bad friends were never friends
This hits so hard. The relationship of the bros only strengthens as time goes on.
My little brother and best friend act like this all the time.
integrating "scooby dooby dick" into my conversations now thanks sungwon
The amount of truth this has to it is beyond human measurement.
Hashtag relatable
The accuracy.
I’m legitimately ruder to my closest friends than I am to my worst enemies
Sure would be nice to have friends.
As a matter of fact I do remember Z-Bots and yes they were sick so thanks
🤣🤣🤣
Yes
Uncomfortably weird.  Also, just making weird faces that reference older weirder faces.
I’m here so Early!
This is so accurate it's almost painful. Especially the nostalgia at the end.
Hi
FIRST MOTHER FUCKER! mom no please I was first
Zbots. Damn it all to hell. Now I have to go buy Zbots again.
First
Everytime it always comes back to z-bots
So tru
