Masterpiece ever. One the best fights ever. Great
Wilder is a true warrior, both are and this right proved it!
That second time fury got dropped, he was down for ten seconds. Count it.
anyone knows what phone did he used to capture this. quality is superb
Pity Wilder couldnt catch him like he did to  Breazeale.💥lights out for fury
Can anyone pick a better way to shut up all these Wilder fanatics?
Imagine having those tickets and at such a big event but all your bothered about is recording the fight on your phone. Not able to celebrate. Not able to shout and get involved. This is the world today.
Fantastic match, great night and 2 ferocious boxers
Skills is greater than power.. Boxer is far more greater than a fighter.
that knockout punch tore a hole through wilder's soul
This one was a war
Fury IS a champ
Everytime Wilder get Knock Downed, he stands up real crocky!!
Awesome
Wilder was out from the first uppercut.
Better quality than Bezos landing from space
there was no long count
He has no gameplan they didn't train for the cardio, he has no footwork head movement and that's it
Wilder has only one thing and that's power
I love boxing, it’s brutal as hell, but absolutely fascinating to watch.
One of the greatest heavyweight championship fights of all time
2:30 damn what a punch
While Wilder is no great boxer, he's a thunder puncher, and tough as shit. He wanted no doubt, and to go out on his shield, and did. Dude earned my respect in this fight, and changed my attitude towards him.
Absolute dosser
JESUS CHIRST DESTROY ALL FAKE GODS
Damn!  Seeing that angle on the final KO was like witnessing a murder!  Tyson's right hook was wickedly brutal!
Iron Mike Tyson would've fck both of them up!
Fairplay to sugar hill changing furys styles if u watch all 3 fights back to back u can see the changes
Love the salty wakandians crying over this lol.
Holy bullshit, the last hit,,that was so ass painful, even a man so strong like wilder cannot hold it, and his head flows like his neck is already disable…he couldn’t use his neck, congrats to the real Tyson, and he still hasn’t,t hit the backside of the brain, of anyone
Mấy anh da đen ngồi dưới buồn hiu
Best footage alive wilder did well but man tyson is so good jesus. His last hit was brutal. Im all furry fan but give credit to wilder he got hit by a semi. No one could of took all that damage.
2:32  "Aawh it's all ova! Its aaaallll ovvvaaaaa!"
Yeah I'd could only guess that it would take his entire purse to get him drunk ,the big fella!  Good onya mate
Writing this on the off chance the big man himself will see it…… I started boxing at 17 in old Trafford Manchester in 2004 and trained with some tough lads, went sparring in Jimmy Eagan’s gym in wythenshaw where pictures of a young Tyson fury decorated this humble gym. Not long after this Tyson who always struggled to get a fight because of his size was shamefully overlooked for the British national spot, and upon turning pro and Winning the British championship, forfeited it so he could also win the Irish title. My family are from the west coast of Ireland the same as him and for him to do that means more than many will know. His father even tried buying a rusty Mercedes from my front garden, John fury…a millionaire but a real man. When the whole aj-fury debate was coming up, people who truly followed Tysons career knew who’d win without a doubt. He’s a fighting man, goes to Germany to become undisputed then goes to an American champions backward and proves all the doubters wrong again!!! The past 2 years have been hell for me, life’s tough for everyone but as a man you’re expected to deal with it. Tyson showed us we don’t have to just deal with it…..seek help, reach out and come out the other side a champion! Dia dhaoibh 🍀 🐝 🇬🇧 🇮🇪
Not bad for a fella with pillows for fists 💪🥊💯✝️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧🌎
Racist stinker has lost
Tran đâu kinh điển
A fight to remember and tell the kids about.
The worst thing anyone can do is take down the gypsy king!
Tyson Fury 💪
Wow you really get the phone experience in this aspect ratio!
Wilder needs to do cardio training and learn how to move side to side learn how to faint his punches Jan and stick and move stop being stationary!!!¡ Wayne M Sims.
I love watching ignorant racist get their heads knocked off. How’d that “black excellence” work out for you wilder 🤣🤣
Wilder had said he wants a body on his record. If the ref didn't catch him and prevented his head from hitting the floor, his body may have been on fury record
I think what I saw in the 3rd fight was well on its way to happen in the 2nd fight
Fury got longer a counts.
Fuck me his head nearly come clean off
Wilders face @1:46 like OMG this dude is up again 😂
The same punch steve Cunningham took
Wilder never recovered psychologically from that first fight
And shows more class as well
that's an 18 wheel punch
The gypsy king rise again
A sloppy, lumbering, slow punch, ugly show.
Needs to be a 4th. Put that disrespect fool out of his misery
But, but, Tyson clearly cheated 😭😭lol.
Wilder looked scared and out of breath after round 3. Fury completely broke him mentally.
😂😂😂😂Que palisa
Fury is the dirtiest fighter in the history of boxing.
Very sloppy from tyson  Shame he didn't finish off the bronze bummer for good
Isn't it real funny how Dante Wilder came to fight with a skirt on and nobody noticed or said anything
Wilder should fire his hairstylist for that hairdo  😉 jsaying
Tyson really fought his ass off. Both men looked very dangerous, very strong. Tyson definitely defined champion in this fight.  I blame Malik Scott for Wilder's loss, For letting Wilder go into this fight with chicken legs. And no upper cut. I respect Wilder though, for showing a lot of strength and will, despite the gaps. And at least Tyson showed Wilder real respect afterward. What a great fight. Tyson is awesome, just awesome.
Great view! Wow! That was a brutal knockout!
respect to both warriors!
damn what phone is this bro??
I already knew fury will win the fight ! Coz wilder is not able to hold on 12 rounds ! He was used to beat his previous opponents in less than 3 rounds, so his body wasn't ready to go further, we could easily see him getting exhausted progressively ! Tyson fury is a real beast ! He was too strong for Wilder to beat !
2:33 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🥊🥊🥊🥊
Wilder never could box, he only has one punch, and no defense whatsoever, that's why he got his ass kicked
This fight was insane!
Straight up knocked out man can't lie in this video straight to the canvas
Fury got laid out lol I mean man has he got a chin
We need another fight...IV.
Bravo.💪 Viva Cristo Rey
Wilder.ajouurrrrr......
Like a shit...!😂🤣😅
Deontay gone
Www
The baddest men in the world don't have tattoos fucking Ngannou, Wilder,Fury,CR7,Nurmagomedov,
They should have given wilder a count.
Brutal. That's a fighter
Now this kinda camera we need when see a UFO.
But Is it over ?
Legendary heavy weight match .. !!
Wilder got exactly what he had coming mocking GOD JESUS HOLY SPIRT I THINK JESUS WAS WITH FURY THAT NIGHT TAPPED HIM WAKE UP. AND REFRESHED! ALI WILDERS IDLE DID SAME DUMB CRAP. ALI WAS BIRN WITH 2 GIFTS FROM GOD BOXING AND THE GIFT OF GAB . HE MOCKED JESUS . HE COULD BARELY SPEAK A SENTANCE FOR 30 YEARS
The reminiscent flugelhorn specifically intend because friction briefly mix for a impartial barometer. voiceless, first mattock
I had a better view from my bed
I feel badd honestly i want wilder to when i felt like he needed it for his own sake idk ima have to watch the full fight
Alot of really tan people were upset that the pale person beat the tan person and they hate that!
1:45 Wilder was thinking" I'm not going to beat this man.

Fury is a badass
Fury doesn’t have a Diaz jaw. He will go down… he won’t stay down however. Fury simply has incredible immediate recovery in that jaw. He doesn’t stay down. Matter of fact, he gets up quickly after eating Wilder’s STRAIGHT RIGHTS and has even more energy and focus. Truly amazing for a 6’9 300lbs man who can move quick like a mamba. He’s a top 8 Boxer ever. At least a top 8 long - time Champ. Quick as snot 🤧 doesn’t get tired, good jaw. Uses his weight well. Powerful headbutter, and powerful trash talker, oh and BY THE WAY, when he gets a rhythm he’s starting to develop elite KNOCKOUT POWER later on in his legendary career. A treat for our generation. One of the last great giants…
Just say no to vertical video.
The difference is Fury can match Wilder's power. Wilder can't match Fury's BOXING ability. Wilder is 6-7 and has NO IDEA what a jab is. He could fight Fury 100 times...and lose 100 times because he CAN'T BOX!
He was sleep from the uppercut before he tried to clinch him
Fury cheated. Look how floppy his gloves are. His hands are in the wrist area of the gloves.
Both had some good knockdowns and couple pushdowns. The Fury uppercuts was viscous.
Dude hit the mat like a ton of bricks. Then wants to be a pour sport. Way to represent America dude. You didn’t deserve the heavyweight title.
The second Wilder knockdown was a 10 count if I was counting. LOL In Japan they have a speaker start the count as soon as the fighter touches the floor. It's more efficient that way IMO.
Didn't the White Guy Cheat???
Great highlights. Awesome camera bro👍👍👍👍
Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray, Convert yourself and believe in the gospel.<33
Just imagine if that was  charlie z getting with those hooks from wilder lol.
😢😢😂😂😂
For those of you who don't know tyson fusy was 1 pound in weight and 7 weeks premature at birth..
Better get that wait under control some before the Anthony fight if their is one
Sad that Jake Paul can outsell fights like this.  Really a sad time for boxing.  Not gonna get a better fight than Fury/Wilder for a looooong time either.
Better footage than the TV, because their cameras are too close. Well done!
Glad this trilogy is over now we can see a real boxing match lol
How does Wilder even fight with those sticks for legs... he's basically disabled.
I don't see what the controversy is about. Tyson Fury gets up at 9.  Wilders ass whooping was 100% legal
I knew from way back, Wilder wouldn't last as a champion unless he actually learned how to box. It is an art. In the past He could easily bulldoze his way to victory against smaller weaker opponents by windmilling them in a crude brute manner. Won't work against a big fuqker who can also box; like the gypsy king. He has heart though. He just needs technique and better stamina.
look at the crowd. who bet on who
Fury spartan man. 💪💪
I saw interviews of Wilder saying he wants a body on his record….🤣 fool to arrogant got put in his place.
They should never have allowed these guys to fight..   jesus christ.   Way too even.   They are killing eachother for everyones entertainment.   Their brains are fucked for the rest of their lives after a match like this
Insane shots when gassed
That was some suspicious counting when fury went down
Brilliant footage. 👍🏼
To be honest that 2nd knockdown that Joe Rogan and everybody's saying that fury got a 15 second count was even a Knockdown so deontay kind of tripping on that 1
It's embarrassing that these 2 are even considered the best in the world, boxings become so pathetic and talentless..
Wait, STOP!  Did you see how Tyson cheated?  He was wearing the gloves properly this time!  😯  Right hand, right glove. Left hand, left glove!?  😳  That's not right! 👎 🤣
Damn wish I'd watched the whole thing before knowing who won, that was intense, 2 straight up actual boxers...
BRUTAL sport lol
The ending was like a epic climax to a movie. The clear wide right swing that completely knocked out the opponent dropping him into the canvas. Amazing fight
Great video man!!! Thanks for sharing.. whole new point of view....
Hey you people at the bot farms. Leaking this story to TMZ that bots farms and the list of the comments and account is worth millions. Quit your job rich. It's a fact.
Watching Fury get knocked down, he was in complete control. Even of he did get an extra few seconds, it would not have made a difference. He was up in a couple anyways
The man won, the child lost
Wilder got some serious stamina issues, only two rounds and he is sloppy and tired, yes, Fury's weigh might be the answer to that but still, happened in the second fight too. Can't deny his heart though, fought with no gas tank lots of rounds, one of the best fights I've seen live without a doubt.
Wonder what AJ is thinking?
Wilder just not strong enough for Fury.
Damn that knockout angle was even more devastating looking than the PPV’S
Wow. . Great Seats!
Deontay Wilder lost this third fight cause he was already 76 years old, but some people who know him very well say that he is really 137 year’s old. Deontay Wilder is known for lying about his age.
Fury smacked the crap out of Wilder in the 11th.
Hail victory!  \o
Tyson fury is scary good, that's what tough life makes you.
You know, you look at Fury, this tall lanky guy with a soft middle no muscles looks flabby even. Then, Wilder a knockout fighter with a chiseled physique cut abs muscle on top of muscle. And he gets whooped by this big fluffy ass dude not once not twice but i believe 3 times. Nvr has the addage dt judge a book by its cover been so true....
One worships Satan, one worships God.  It's clear who the winner will ALWAYS be.  Stay blessed and humble.
Love that in the rich seats they just cheer for whoever is on top
Not a huge fan of Wilder but damn, I really hope he doesn’t suffer from this beating later on in life.
Lmao loved watching dirtbag wilder drop like a tree
See the count here is more accurate. I counted to 8 when Fury stood up with the first knock down.  People also need to understand how the ref counting out loud effects the speed in which Fury stands up.  Fury is going to take his time getting up if he hears what the count is on. He was perfectly coherent during both knock downs
I think Fuey took a dive during his knock out. He doesn't fall immediately, he does the punch and goes down because he wants to avoid getting hurt even more. So now he has more time to recover.
Fury is 70% back fat i love it
This looks like a really good time, Wish I was there
Went out on his shield, outstanding fight
Ferocious !!!
Upload quality was amazing....but I "think" this fight was orchrastrated (I'm sure I  misspelled that last word) lol
Wow great seats! Thanks for taking us along
This guy had front row seats and watched the fight on a smaller screen than me???
This is what Canelo  is going  to do to Plant,  knock his punkass out
Wilder looked like he was on his way home from the pub :)
Wilder should won this fight
Sooo, covid just dont care coz it was a "big" Fight?! Bruh. This is y they continue to perish. It's cz of there OWN decisions...
Gotta love that tyson is built like old pillow lmao
Tyson throws palm heel strikes because they hits so hard plus hes smart enough to shield it from the ref https://youtu.be/HckOC5SpDaY
The best video out there! Thank you so much for it. 🙏
i dont understand Tyson Fury looks more like fat and out of shape compared to Wilder, how can that be? genuinely asking
Imagine paying all that money for ring side seats, then watching it all through your phone screen XD wtf? Hahahahah.
WİLDER= 🎈 KEEP CRYİNG BALLOON , KEEP CRYİNG 😀🥴😀😀   FURY İS = KİNG 👑💪💪❤️
Exactly what his corner was trying to prevent his last fight.
Great angle
2:30, better angle, shot, quality than TV. Too bad the owner didn't understand to film landscape.
Happy not to see Tysoe was better wilder was better kinda comment,  it was a legendary fight
What a fought.
Thats shows hight level od white box, Usyk the same
We need a fourth and final decider between these two equally matched titans ✊🏿
The best part when the Dosser left the ring with his head down
Fury is a giant who has agility, accuracy, and stamina. What a fighter!
What type of camera is this?? This is crazy good quality. This cant be a phone can it??
Even the bogans can be gentleman in England.
All hail the gypsy king
THX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm waiting for the left to turn Fury into a racist...Maybe Deontay will go there. lol
After watching this fight a second time I saw Fury won every round.
i still want to see them fight for the 4th time. Its electric!
What a fight best ive seen in a while boxing needed this
At the end of the video he’s like a school boy going home , nothing happened here. 😂
next time, turn the camera
What a fight
Nice picture, sadly he recorded vertically, greatly limiting what is seen....
Damn. That last punch was..     *racist.* 🙉🥊💥💤
Laughing my ass off everyone thinks the second time fury went down he was like knocked out or dazed that's bullshit if you watch he was obviously winded, looked pretty exhausted then he took a hit basically to the back of the head while he was leaning forward and fell down.
What a fight !!!!!!!!! .
Till this day!!!
Great fight respect to both man
🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
U can even tell at 1:46 even after wilder drops fury TWICE in a round look at his facial expression. Man was fighting for his life in there. Usually if you’ve dropped someone twice ur super excited and relaxed but wilder knew he was in big trouble
* In Smokey voice: "YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT!!!"
"next I’m gonna go get drunk"  Epic interview
They were probably told to fall down as much as possible so that it would be seen as more of a 'legendary' fight or whatever. Lame.
2nd knockdown should have been a point taken away from Wilder.
1. Shot on iPhone 12 pro max 2. It was shot vertically for social media purposes 3. SHE (not he) shot the fight. Hope that answers all of your questions. :)
I enjoy this Sore Loooser
Oh boy...TV cameras can be so deceiving. Here we see the true impact of last KO. thanks for the upload.
Second best?? Wilder isn't even that in my opinion.
Knocked out by the devil
Fury won but he’s so slow I’m sure someone will be taking his spot soon
Wilder is done !!!!!!
No Tyson that's a lie Wilder might have lost but his value just when through the roof he is a more exciting fighter than alot of boxers in the game right now he will be just fine
The big dosser got KTFO
Ethnic equality
2 or the worst fighters I've ever watched. boxing was  better in the 80 an 90s
I almost felt sorry for that wildthing.
The Round 10 KO was CLEAN!
Fury won't stay down for shit! Mann gets back up like Michael Myers....Jason Voorhees
If Wilder ever wants to beat Fury he needs to call up Mayweather and beg him to remake his style.
You talk 💩 you gonna get that 🍑 handed to u
Damn wilder got caught clean on the temple
DW 👎
I won’t lie. Part of me thinks Tyson went down easily to make this an even more entertaining fight. Whenever Deontay knocked Tyson out, none of the punches looked like they connected that well.    Deontays power is also ridiculous tho, so it’s possible they were real knockouts. But just crazy how Tyson gets up so easily, and doesnt look phased. He’s a tough bastard
1:52 I always found in Krav Maga that even the best laid plans of the most experienced mice and men found themselves scattered met with a well placed hook. One good one is all it takes (technically).
The fact Wilder went from a statue in the 2nd fight to knocking fury down twice in the 3rd was fantastic. Fury is just crazy with how much energy he has for a big dude. Amazing fight. Hell I'd take Fury v wilder 4 with that performance just for the fuck of it 🤣
The lack of defense or even caution by Wilder is 200% stupid.
His head almost came off on last punch 🥊
Amazing seats
Talking that shit!!!! Stay humble
1st, nice freaking seats! 2nd, I'm glad the White guy won. I recently found out from CNN news and the democrats that I'm a racist, so having the white guy win just proves our superiority...
I like Fury a lot and I hope he beats them all and can remain mentally healthy for the rest of his life. This was a good fight and it’s a shame Wilder couldn’t be a man and accept his defeat to a better boxer. I dislike Wilder because of his excuses and lack of sportsmanship. Gypsy King!
And yet ANOTHER idiot who films with their phone the wrong way round! 🤦🏻‍♀️
Watching this all in slow mo like 0.25x speed is insane.
That headlock then uppercut is a good strategy for fury
Legend says that Wilders Ego is still flying around the arena
This was expected. Didn't improve his defense at all.
thanks for uploading
Fury SMESHED him.....LOL
Im pretty much an expert on boxing and both of these guys are horrible .... a Larry Holmes would have taken apart both easily
Great fight.
That's a real heavy weight fight.
3-0  Fury 0-3 milder
Fury got up from those knockdowns like he forgot to delete his browsing history after getting in bed.
Wilder fans: fury is racist
Super
I’m surprised the camera quality is so good
Man was asked on what’s next and said “I’m gonna go get drunk”😂😂 That’s a good clap back😂😂
That's some good ref-ing
have to say deontay has gained a fan in me he fought well in my opinion and knocked tyson down twice and showed alot of spirit well don deontay
Wilders racist ass got smashed
Bad year for bodybuilders posing as boxers -  Joshua gets humiliated by a real boxer 25 lbs lighter ,  and bodybuilder Wilder gets rag-dolled again by a clearly flabby Fury (a boxer) .  It didn't matter.  Skill counts the most.
I think wilder would of won if fury wouldn’t of cheated by using boxing skills you never see wilder do that
Tyson fury he have heart and strong Chin and courage great champion respect
Love AJ but honestly, no chance against Fury
This is how racism started
Loseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!
Watching that in slow motion makes you realize the ref did the right thing to stop the fight when he did.
And Wilder said he would defeat Mike Tyson in his prime. 😄
This was kinda nice 👍🏻💪🏻
That last punch bruh...Wilder looked like he got smacked with a cast iron skillet......
Fury can take a punch, Wilder cannot. That is the difference.
Class act Tyson Fury
Unbelievable
That voodoo shit apparently did not pay off 😳
Wilder even looks out on his feet when he scores the knockdowns.
When fury goes down the black people sheer, when wylder goes down the white people sheer 😂 so funny
Racist
Tyson fury has a tyre of fat around his waist...that ls the first boxer I'm seeing  who is a young heavy weight champion but with a thick  fat around his waist..  last time only George forehand had it but he was over 46 when he had it...even then not so much....
Epiiiiiiiiiiic!
Both these fighters are garbage.  They're a good reflection of the dire state of the heavyweight division today.
It's like watching two grizzlies going at it 😂
American crowds are lifeless
No acknowledgment from welder to his fans. A true loser
Even more incredible when you think fury tweaked his ankle on the first knockdown...how do you beat that man, he's next level
That boy gypsy king was looking fresh in the legs. He could have gone another 5 more rounds
They did their thing in this match. They were both tired as hell and it came down to that last knockdown. Deontay was looking a lot better imo
Best camera angles so far for the five knockdowns
The man wanted to go out on his shield
I hope Francis ngganou can go booxing and fight Tyson fury
The KO was way worse than I thought. Holy fuck
To be fair to both men - huge hearts and will power!!!  💪💪💪
All I have to say, is stay quite and be hungry.
Thanks fury for that beautiful knock out lol 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆, wilder was destroyed
Wilder got up from the 1st knockdown looking like he's about to cry 🤣😂
TOTAL ANNIHILATION OF A DOSSER!
Wilder is such a  prick
Wilder has below average conditioning as a professional boxer. Fury does have good conditioning, great compared to Wilder. On Top of that Wilder lacks skills/techniques. I wonder what his training entailed since the first fight because not much has changed in his boxing since the first fight. He was calmer and seemed more focused before the fight but clearly he hasn't mastered his nerves, came in super nervous. That's why he gassed out after the first few rounds. Your heart, lung, brain works double time when you're nervous.
Wilder looks like his crying 🤣
Damn what incredible seats you had.
Knocked some sense into that troubled young man
Hold. Your. Phone. HORIZONTALLY.
There is no shame in losing when your opponent is clearly much stronger and better than you are.
That last knockout was sad.
I am just so glad Tyson Fury knocked out Wilder. Humble pie comes for us all.
fake!!!! If you can't see it ima pray for you!
🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷...
Does anyone see a punch on fury's second time down?
Deontay, win or lose. is a god damn true warrior. Some of the biggest heart I’ve ever seen displayed in a ring. And you lost to an all time heavyweight
Democrats  adopt stunt dummies like Wilder from the Take A Knee Tribe back in Africa
Yo stop having sex before the fight.....
LEGENDARY!
Man these heavy weight matches are so boring to watch. It’s like watching two Komodo dragons fight. They are destructive as fuck but looks like moving  with a lag.
Landscape.
They are both great warriors
Romans 1:28-32 (KJV)  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
What a beating... This what happens when you fight a real boxer
Damn wilder just looked off.  He doesn’t look to be in as good of shape as he did in the second fight. He just look so disinterested.
its so much better to see it on my phone thank you
That KO punch was brutal. Absolutely no doubt about the stoppage there.
Wilder just looked defeated the whole fight from the start
was like a rocky movie.
3410 that is
Wilder has zero boxing skills and no idea on movement
Jesus Loves You!
Fury is too good. Can't see anyone beating him anytime soon
THAT was a real old school war on Saturday night...  an epic battle
You have a personal. Million dollar piece of footage of that final knock down punch. It's great to see from there and different to the broadcasters. Cheers. Enjoyed it
Einfach nicht zu glauben, daß ein technisch so dermaßen LIMITIERTER Boxer Weltmeister ist UND bleibt. Ein Lennox Lewis hätte diesen "Amateur" mit einem Arm ko geschlagen
what in can see is the referee worrying about wilder at the end..
Hey thanks for this - felt like I was at ringside
I tell you what you could see wilder was way out of it after the first knockdown for bit and Tyson’s punches IMO did wayyyyy more damage
The reff did fuck that count up
Paying all that money to watch the fight through your camera. I thank you though
So beautiful seeing him face down on the mat, ref waving it off. Out cold.
Light work for Tyson
Tyson did exactly what he think He'll fall down twice, one just by a push only to make wilder thinks he's winning.... What a man
Tyson fury a man of God. Denote wilder basking in darkness. Fury may be young be hes kind of matured some at his age. Wilder is a shame and embarrassment 🤦.
fury has some fuc*ing stamina bro goddamnit man.
Wilder at least got to go down on his shield like he wanted too!
Is the new WWF?
Deontay looked like a broken man early in the match.  He hasn't gotten better since the first fight.
From start to finish, one of the best Heavyweight bouts ever. How many times did the bell save both fighters?! 💥🥊
Spaghetti legs= no power
"Ats all ovaaar" Damn, want to see the whole fight with this cam ! Lucky you are to be so close
Ringside seats: $1000. Recording the fight in portrait mode: priceless.
The best excuse this time cuz we heard all the others was the broken hand. Okay, so you can’t knock him out but what’s stopping you from winning on points? Oh yeah you don’t know how to actually box that’s right lol…..
Colossal fight. Congrats to tyson fury and his team.
We need this guy to record school fights
Wilder nearly predicted his own death 💀 by speaking about blood 🩸 and violence 🤦🏼‍♀️
Great fight, disappointing to hear the reaction from Wilder and his fans, Fury won fair and square.
Wilder actually got up inside 10 seconds in that 11th round knockdown. And also referee counted slow in that 4th round knockdowns, you can hear the commentators talk about it.
Anyone who ridicules Wilders ability to box needs to learn about the sport ... Some people look spectacular with technique and fluidity then get hit and fall apart and quit .... Wilder has every attribute required to be a fighter , heart guts courage by the truck load , he may be an idiot when he spouts of , he may look dreadful when he's throwing punches , but let's show him some respect he's a total fucking warrior to go toe to toe with Fury for 11 rounds
2:32 fucking hell... a lot of venom in that one.
Nicee.... I loved every bit of it.... specially the ending... I was just wondering. Were there a three KO rule or something since the ref waved it off? I wished he had given the dosser a chance to be counted out so he dont use any excuse or so he could get back to get annihilated even more
Mahina kau parehas mga lampa
1:44 The way he look at the Fans
Wilder v aj. I'd pay to watch that more than fury v usyk.
Great respect to both of them.
At this point I seriously don't think he will win anything.
TF is the real champion
Wow, just Wow! that final knockdown, what a smack!  Well done TF!
Always shoot videos in landscape mode.  😊
Excellent KO sequence of one of the all-time great fights. You can really see how huge these guys are.
Wilders like a man with a gun thinking he’s tough.   All he has to do is pull the trigger and not miss and he can take anyone out. But if he misses, if the bullet doesn’t keep the person down, or if you take away that gun, he’s got nothing.
2:48 beware of the zombie
Who is tysons trainer?. He is good. Changing tactics midfight and overturn the tables on wilder
You're not singing anymore
headlock knock down
headlock ko
that was not clean
The phone camera is dope
Always get that last punch in while your opponent is falling, stay on top of him so you can make sure they can't get back up, punch him while he's falling, never be to sure he's out. He should have lost a few pounds so he could be faster, not gain a few  to be more stronger. Incorporate dancing in your skills, buy you time when you in trouble, keep your hands up when on the ropes. Muhammad Ali knew these things. Time for wilder to change his style to a more flexible one on wheels. It will make him more able to fight more bigger and smaller fighters.
After the last knock down wilder was still up on his feet within 10 seconds.  Ref should've let it continue

Wilder must retire
The ultimate form of fighting, one man against the other with no place to hide. Such a pity there has to be a loser, but thems the rules Congratulations, Tyson, I never doubted you, son and commiserations, Deontay, it was too big an ask of you. Thanks for uploading!
Thahahahahahahahahahahah take that ya fucking DOSSER!!!!!!! Hahahahahaha
The scary thing about the gypsy king is that every time he gets knocked down, he gets up and whoops their ass on another level.
They said he had pillow fists.... good for sleeping on I guess they meant.
These guys are giants holy
Two average boxers with shit defense.
The BUSTER / TYSON FIGHT was way better... BUSTER Put on a BOXING CLINIC...
God bless both the champion 👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🙏🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Rudy sucking up to trump now. Help to blame pence wanted to overturn the election. Is that why they wanted to hang him For Trump bullshit. Say what ever about pence Trump's is still not going to pay you rudy you doing it for free.
Insane punch
Both figther had a great figth good nigth
Fury came to win wilder head in his mind what if I lose
This another pure money fight, both are act-boxing to make it look interesting especially Tyson's BS falls... garbage.
American crowds suck
Serious pity the ref waved it off. Would've loved to see Wilder 'go out on his shield'. Sheeeeeeiiitt. Bum squad. 13%.
This guy is so good he is the boxing god cheers.
Tyson fury the greatest
That got to have killed a few billion brain cells. Going to be wearing nappies.
Wow he got knocked the fck out.  I almost feel bad for him but i don’t 🤷‍♂️
Tyson literally removed Wilder head from his body.
Man, this fight was so good. All the build up, hype, whatever you wanna call it, made it even more so. I know a lot of folks don't like one or the other (in particular, Wilder is "not popular", haha) but even that just made for a better fight
I still think it was a early stoppage.😉
The difference here is that Tyson fury took his time when getting up
Both champions,,

Awesome view of the fight
Tyson Fury WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO, IBO and The Ring heavyweight champion! This is history and he is a legend! Does Anthony Joshua or Usyk have enough spirit to fight these monsters? Deontay Wilder he fought well too, fought openly and showed an excellent fight. He has experience, but no luck, this day is not his evening. But we wish him good luck. Anthony Joshua or Usyk I respect them too. But Tyson, Deontay, such fighters haven't seen for a long time. Bravo, gentlemen!
Wilder needs a drug test cause he looked spiked / drugged up AF
To this day!!
Nice, thanks for sharing!
The only thing worse in the world than a boxer is a boxing fan.
I thought that round 10 knock down punch was as heavy or heavier as anything thrown in the fight - game well and truly over.
Bum squad ha
“There’s no more deontay wilder” 😂 he came in and cleared him out 😂😂😂
I know why he lost this time he wore a skirt doh!
*Money is the issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life. life was hard for me until I started investing in bitcoin and now earning £3900 per week.*
This shows that the hard work beats talent  Widler is a talented boxer while Tyson is the  one who worked harder
Was it the three knockdown rule?
That is a better perspective than the broadcast footage. Insane...what a beautiful finish.
It's all over
Wow the heavyweight division is not what it used to be these guys suck!!!
Lol I missed this fight I fell asleep 😂😂😂
great video thanks
Nice seats!
Wilder and his fans ran out of excuses….  Well done Fury!!!
I dont even see how the 2nd time Fury went down is even tallied as a knock down.
Tyson is such a freak of nature man. A man that size shouldn’t move like he does and have that kind of stamina. What a freak. Wilders a freak too and it was so weird watching him get knocked cold. Hardest puncher ever but Fury has that indomitable spirit.
Cracking video, fair play 👍🏻
Tht was a good fight goes dwn in the books
Legendary
Prime Mike Tyson would DESTROY both of these guys!
Was 1:50 a steady rip to the balls?? 😂😂
Those little short uppercuts Tyson was throwing were just incredible.  Could there be a more satisfying way to end a trilogy??
Damn imagine a nigga knock you out and then start singing 🤣
And Wilder wouldn't even say something to Fury after the fight. What a Chump!
what a fucking beautiful knockout...everything about it, the final build up punches, the left hook set up followed by that wicked right hook.....the impact reaction and the fall.....beautiful stuff......and Wilder KNEW at some point during that round that was going to happen and still he stood his ground.....epic
Iron Tyson
This is how boxing should be, full of unpredictable knockdowns. 👍
Old but gold congrats fury
All I could say is WOW,WOW WOW, WHAT A KNOCK OUT,💪THE CHAMP SAID (NO MORE WILDER)😭😭😭😭🤘
tyson fury became a puncher. who would hae thought
I feel like the punches that Wilder threw to knock Fury down didn't land cleanly. Imagine if they did.
Fury is all in all the better fighter, but Wilder does have a big improvement from their first two fight. he's not being too wild for punch anymore and a lot more disciplined put on a little more muscle but failed to trained those muscle in a short time for the fight. he got slow but can absorb more punishment blows, got a heavy heart on that fight and last, still a sore looser in the end, will wait for his comments after the fight about again how Fury cheated. this is Fury's most intense fight and no one ever done that to Fury and kudos to Wilder, hope he doesn't go into depression and come back as a much much better fighter, not just in the skill aspect but also as a better person. but time is not on his side.
Fury should of sang Sweet home Alabama!
1:26 based off of shots landed. I think Fury took a dive on this one.
I thought the 10th rd knockdown was the most brutal. This makes the final knockdown look WAY WORSE. wilder fought the last 7 rounds on pure heart. Gotta give him credit for that
I can’t begin to describe how much I hate wilder I enjoyed seeing him getting destroyed but the more and more I look at these highlights the more u realize the beating he took he looked devastated through out the entire match those are some insanely hard blows he took idk how he was standing through all of that, it will take a toll on his health especially later on in life, I hope he’s ok now and also in the future, he should retire now and spend time with his family and so should Tyson he should fight usyk now for the belt then retire he’s got nothing else to prove
And the warrior of Jesus  just smashed  the warrior  of the devil  psalm 34
The most unskilled fight in the history of title fights but was entertaining
Bronze bomber can you say you’re not the only one that hits hard I’m sure you got an excuse l liked you until you Started making excuses
Right hand is vicious
Shaq kicking it there lol
Can you please tell what camera did you use ??  Thanks 👍
🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🚑🚒🚓🚔
What a fight man
👏👏👏👏
Battle of the knockdowns. Amazing viewpoint! Nice upload!
Those are huge men. Awesome fight.
Imagine being much more powerful than your opponent, but also much dumber. That must be frustrating.
fuckin wow
Wow
Those last few moments of that 11th round. You can see it in Fury’s eye, the eyes to FINISH HIM!….. Wilder took some blows man he showed a lot of heart.
What Phone is this,, Black berry im sute
Can’t stop watching this ko
Wilder hits the canvas at 1:56 and the fight doesn't resume until 2:17   LOL TWENTY SECONDS
There is no more diooonnnnnte willlldeeerrrr  😂🤣😂🤣
"Next am gonna get drunk" 🤣🤣
Everytime Wilder got knockdown he became older...  but the last knockdown was wild like the fallen Goliath of old!
Wilder hits the canvas at 0:13 and the fight doesn't resume until 0:31
Good video
"What a short, overhand right DEADARM!"💪⚡⚡⚡
Nice to see the racist lose.
Hate that we didn't even get to see the referee stop the fight in the actual broadcast. They zoom in too much.
00:53 low blow?
Are you guys Blind ? Wilder Pulled Tyson down and ref called it a knockdown and Wilder and his fans still think he won all 3 fights LOL Sorry peeps Fury won ALL 3 Fights NO QUESTION
Tyson is a class act
Love both these monsters and it was an amazing fight thank yall so much for this 3rd fight
Wilder. What a sore LOSER!
Wis suwe ora tau jamu. Jamu pinsan godong telo.  Wis suwe ora ketemu, ketemu pisan gawe gelo.
Wilder is jacked af
Same as second fight of them..wilder has no strategy and game plan..
DJango Unchained.
Anybody who denies that Tyson Fury is the best of the best", is a typical lying hater.
Cracking fight best bout av seen in a long time better than Aj / klitchko bout . Goodnyte Wilder is finished now . He ain't gonna beat the top heavyweights the  like of Fury - AJ - Usyk . I just hope we the boxing fans have the chance to a Undisputed fight on the cards with ALL 4 belts. Fury getting more n more exciting too watch . Just hope he can pull off being the Undisputed Heavhweight Champ . Since Lennox was the last
Wilder he was down for more than 10 seconds
Man that was a hard hard hit.
This refs A1 top class referee you can tell compared to others
if he had more time in the 3rd round, that might have been the end. wilder was shoooooook.
https://youtu.be/pZN3xkVSzVY play this crazy tune
There's only one Tyson Fury.
I honestly believe that Wilder should rethink of his life more than his career he has cemented his name as one of the best boxers in history however with enough millions in his account he has ti make use of them in his future.
Hi Paris 2:06
Fury the LEGEND !
Great win by Fury but please put some respect on Wilder's name!
You got knocked the f*** out 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was an easy call for the ref to stop the fight.  if Fury hadn't knocked him down ref would have called it anyway.  Wilder was getting tee'd off on before the knock down.  Severl hooks and uppercuts were landing with ZERO defense from Wilder.
Second knockdown by wilder didn't even look like a knockdown
That final punch is too good. Had to replay it again! It like a movie.
Fury has Jesus Christ in his life.  Wilder worships Satan, performs rituals and involves witchcraft.   As always and forever... Jesus wins!
Thank you fury for gettin rid of that pleb
“Now dont be sad…coz 3 outta 3 aint bad!” 🎵
Why is this vertical?
Thank you uploader!!!! Love it!!!!
These ends here no more 4th fight
1:30 Fury was down  1:41 Fury got up
Am I the only person in the world that see only punches to the ear and the back of the head from Fury???????
thats i called true boxing fight .. not like Mayweather runing boxing match
The fight of the year no year century 😇
But not even that humbled Wilder..or even gave fury his respect as a fighter ...
Jez what phone was this recorded with?
La chance c'est génial!! Pensez à moi la prochaine fois svp. Merci mdr
What a  fight got that money worth👍👍this both guy a warriors..
Wilder's not much of a boxer, has a weak chin, poor defense, poor stamina and misses most of his punches.  Fury beat a very one dimensional fighter.  No big deal.
What a great video!  Well done,  camera man!
When Fury does the final K.O. (227 -233 )look at his face ,rewind n look !! pure aggression 😎 he looks terrifying,like a bad dude that creeps into people's nightmares (esp. Wilders 😂😂) GRRRRRR.......BOO!!
Wilder showed a lot of heart even in the final knockdown. He got up after 8 seconds even tho he was completely out cold.  Insane fight!!
Fury I like your character
Bench press that ya fanny
Wilder actually makes the count at the end. Fight should have been stopped in the third
I will never forget this final war between two boxing legends. Fury incredible, Wilder doesn't have to be ashamed of anything, thanks to both warriors 🥊
how much was those tickets for them seats
I just wish Tyson did not drink because with mental issues which I have and other problems Alcohol is horrible. When he retires  if he drinks it will not be good for him, it’s a death trap. I know for me it would be for sure.
It's like watching 2 giants fighting
Wilder & his followers are whining about the stoppage - watch from 2:52 - if he would have been hit one or 2 more times  he might have been carried out of the ring
Two Gladiator's Amazing fight!
Damn he massacred him
Fury is Freak
Brutal that ko nice to see it from a mobile phone makes it feel more raw
1:52 fury schooled wilder with that counter
Chelsea fans reactions __} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZWYkHr5jDk
Chelsea fans reactions __} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZWYkHr5jDk
I've followed wilder for a few yrs now and I've always said it he just has a hook with power hes not a boxer or has a boxing iq hes a brawler with a hook shot i knew once he fought a actual boxer with a fight iq his career and him are done .. and iv won money and bets on the last 2 fights haha thanks fury!!
Puts A whole new spin on "He Bounced"
1:40 Just goes to show what bitches some of these Wilder fans are when you have to scream stay down at fury.
That punch at 1:56 almost put him on a flight.
God this video gives me chills. So incredible. Wish I could have been there. I watched every single fight live since 2018 and I feel lucky just to have witnessed the entire trilogy live in my living room. If only I couldve been there,  ahhh!! I can feel the energy through this video
Spzilka vs Fury
Camera is what deontay felt lol
Wilder the biggest chump to ever consider himself a boxing man. He is a disgrace to the sport. Well done the king
Wilder got exactly what he deserved
Once a KING always a KING !!!
This is the second fight in two weeks where the white supremacist has battered the poor Blackman this is racism at its worst,surely Joe (piss pants ) Biden should call for an immediate inquiry.It disgust me seeing a Blackman getting battered by a White man
Great work
Pillow fists was it LOL..:) long live the gypsy king
Awesome angle by the camera Guy..
How many more excuses can wilder make  My suit was too heavy  His gloves wasn’t on properly  His gloves were tampered with  He’s bigger than me  He lent on me  My water was spiked  I wasn’t ready  The board is corrupt  Long counts  He hit me  I was tired  My ear hurt  The big nasty gypsy man beat be up  I want my mum  Feel free to add anymore you have heard from him
Imagine going to this great fight and see everything on your fucking phone. Gtfo
What a great angle to see the KO from..👍🏼👍🏼 Love how the ref helped him to he canvass for the KO.
Definitely NOT an iPhone being used for such great quality. Maybe a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 ultra.
This is almost better quality than live TV, great seats haha
Did you seriously watch all that behind your phone
Sloppy fight. Furry beat him 3 times already
The moment was too big for Wilder.
Fury is mentally a strong intelligent ...the fight was won by a more intelligent man
Wilder has bad movement and extremely negative attitude
Best $79.99 dollars I ever spent
9 knock-downs in the trilogy. Woaw
Thank God this wasn't promoted by Triller
Honestly I think this fight did nothing but boost Deontay’s credit as a fighter, regardless of the stuff said outside of the ring, they were both in there at war until that last beautiful right hook
Wilder - They paid me to take a dive….
Wilder even had a LONGER COUNT then Fury lol.
Here goes Tyson Fury next challenger https://youtu.be/8pcjw7qBCZw
😂they said FURY had a long count after his Knockdown well the ref did the same SLOW AS HELL count on Wilder when he was down lol#BronzeEXCUSEsquad
Thank you for the video bro great sht!
Tyson Fury🐐
Finaly Fury knocked out that clown
And that my friend is why you need the white towels 🤣
no way was he fighting after that punch man looked fuuuucckkkeedd
Man Fury knocked the dog shit outta him !!!💯🤣🤣🤣
Watching these guys I just went back in time to watch Tyson's early fights and man I bet he could have beat them both on the same night.
Thank you ref for not being Richard Steele and stopping the fight too soon
Greatness
2:05 Paris Fury
Fantastic footage brah
Man, Malik should've thrown in the towel. That knock out is just way too brutal for a (ex) champ to go out on. And I don't even support Wilder...
Wilser Manusia sombong pantas di ko. Kuping bocor, bibir pecah. 👍👍
Wilder is the one who do one chip challenge and taking about mama
KO.  Fury wins
Wilder finished
The way Wilder fell reminded me of Jiri vs Reyes's spinning elbow finish that just erased dudes Consciousness
No more Deontay Wilder for you, Indeed. 🥊
Love white people
He simply got out boxed and showed no defense while fury was bobbin and weavin using foot work n keeping his chin covered n that's amazing for a man his size wilder kuldve took the lose as a man and be left with dignity but the man is a cry baby sore loser n showed who he really is
both knock too the floor both got up and kept fighting,but the shots they where taking amazes me espiecially wilder from 7 round too the 11th!
Like Tim Witherspoon says. An era of average heavyweights. Tyson the exception
I really miss Mike Tyson's pace, power and precision. In particular, I missed Mike's pace in this bout!
Now we know before Tyson, Wilder had been fighting losers.
I VisioniZe Wilder going Wild when he learns his Leasons WeLL . He must See All Fights Of Roberto Duran ! Or Tommy Hearns  ?
What a fight!
What a fight
Goodnight alabama
What a war.
Thanks. Great video
Not sure why wilder got another fight with him fury when he is clearly no match for him.
Furry willing to go 12 more round wilder exhausted after 3 round
Wilder will defeat Usik and then come back to fight Fury
Mike Tyson didn't really have GREAT fights. His opponents loss quickly and historically. What made his fights good was the amount of POWER one man could hit another man and then it's OVER. His fights were exciting and the anticipation was CRRRrrraaaaaazy... But a 20 second fight? It wasn't impressive, the fight itself NOT Mike Tyson he was awesome for 3 punches and a ducks. But you can't say "THAT OTHER GUY WAS GOOD GREAT FIGHT".
No one seems to notice that weight difference matters. 277 vs 238 lbs is just a literal mismatch. Fury was bullying that lean man. I would never put them in the same weight decision.
Wilder forgot leg day
good video...deontay has zero class ...time to retire...no fundamentals and no dignity
Unreal fight, that last punch was brutal.
Also I love wee Sugar hill
On TV you don't just how big these men are.
Fury never stays down for long, he's proper on it
people like to make fun of wilder but it really wasn't a ko. he actually did beat the 10 count  but he looked gassed
How many knock downs? Wow!!!
It's weird how the shots that took tyson down didn't even look like hard shots
Fury had been touched by God to take down the EVIL WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING DECEIVING THE PPL:  FRAUDSQUAD!
WILDER'S Biggest mistake was he challenged Fury's LORD and Saviour Jesus Christ to a battle , Big Mistake by the DOSSER
#wedgie witch  curse
I’m not a Fury’s  fan. The guy looks more like a farmer than a professional boxer. However it should be said that Fury felt twice while our friend Wilder went for a deep sleep
Both are real men! 🐘vs🐅
Last hit was cleannnnn
Thank you fury 👏👏👏👏❤️👏👏👏👏👏
There is no deonte wilder......next I'm gonna go get drunk ! straight savage 😎
Wilders stamina is the problem.
For anyone that doesn't know Tyson has just had a little one in August due to that his testosterone levels are as low as a prepubescent boy and he still won most fighters take a year off after having a child the man's a living legend
What a fight🔥🔥🔥 Respect for fury❤️❤️
Happy all family and friends tyson furry.
xxl
After 3 fights finally wilder sleeps for good🤣🤣🤣
Thay after boming ur brain out ritier with the lot woooooooooo yaaaaaaaaaaa thay only 1 tic tac toe champ
Epic fight
Everyone is "patting Tyson Fury on the back" and singing his plaudits for his defeat of Wilder. While it was a thrilling fight, the simple fact is Tyson Fury gave a less than expected performance. TF after all was a 3-1 favorite in the fight and I believe a majority of boxing fans thought that TF would end it prior to the Championship rounds with relative ease.   Obviously that is exactly what did not happen in the trilogy. Until Wilder "went out on his shield", he had a realistic chance of winning the fight late in the 1thh Round. I believe the reason why John Fury is hesitant about TF fighting Dillian Whyte is because Whyte uses both range, mobility, and pressure as a 6'4" 250 lbs. fighter. There is obviously something about Whyte that JF is now uncomfortable with after just witnessing his son defeat Wilder. He knows that Whyte will not serve as a tuneup fight for the undisputed.
https://youtube.com/shorts/h_Qt7es6rTo?feature=share
Always bet on two knock downs by each fighter ! Fantastic odds 50-1. Enjoyed a lovely steak dinner and 2 bottles of Bollinger! Cheers lads
Rigged gypsy king
Sorry wilder these people are very powerful n u won bro
He got knocked the fook out 😂
0:58-1:09
Some guy saying “stay down” to fury after the 2nd knockdown 🤣. Then we know what happened
"Fury had no chance" beat the man 3 times and Wilder cant even shake his hand...sore loser who doesn't deserve to fight again, wonder what his excuse will be this time? "oh my right hand was hurting" or "my trainer gave me a bad gameplan" absolute joke.
Fury did that without any of the brits there due to flying restrictions, the guy is just better than everyone else, you are witnessing a living legend, take it all in for he will be talked about in years to come when the likes of AJ etc are forgotten.
View and experience in person is much better.
Good job Tyson. Interestingly Tyson barely got up twice it was like he didn't care much.
another slow ass count for Fury and another robbery
he gets taste of his own medicine knocked out 40 people , crys when its his turn fury a real boxer fighting since he was 10 ,  your a footballer started boxing late
Lol..... Ojoro Hollywood
1:44 fury gave him the death stare like yh I'm gonna make you pay for that mate and wilder was like shit why couldn't he just stay down 😂😂
Great angle to see the big dosser fall..
haha haha black live matter now😁😁
Deontays face twisting on impact is a beautiful thing.
to the wildetts saying fury should have been counted out...at worst its 9 seconds. and considering fury went on to beat wilder black and blue it would have been the wrong call.   do you spastics actually have no shame, youd want wilder to win a fight by 3 milliseconds and a bad decision when fury was legitimately perfectly fine and just took every second he could. he could have got up at 5 seconds but chose to take the extra breath like someone with 12 braincells or higher would.   the count is to give a boxer a chance at recovery and for the ref to asses the damage / see if its sensible to allow them to continue based on body language and response to commands.   when fury gets up , he's steady, verbally responsive, holds his hands up and is generally more steady on his feet than wilder was since round 2... you delusional clowns would actually rather the worst man win when he's perfectly capable of continuing... shows how desperate they actually are...
Wilder was out for the count. Stumbled to the corner
Great clip this
that counter at 1:50 was a fooking beauty
This fight proved once and for all that all Wilder has is a lucky shot. That's all he'll ever be
Fury's second fall was pure IQ play. He's not recovered yet and took the 2nd fall to waste more time of the round. If he stand, he'd probably got ko
That’s why : be humble
F U RYY!!!!!!
Wilder came to the ring in a skirt and Fury made him his bitch LOL
The only fighter who I can see beating Fury is Francis Ngannou.
I love it when these stupid wilder fans suddenly changed tone when they saw their hero get slept in the canvass.
Wilder said that furry doesn't have knock out power in the conference. That knock can send you to different parts of the world. Tyson fury is very tactically that's why he won
Gypsy king ❤️🔥
Hope everyone knows the heavy weight division will die with Tyson fury because without a fighter like wilder Tyson fury is in for some boring matchups in the future… I hope wilder comes back and brings life into such a boring division. Best fight of the year for sure
Awesome clips. Could watch that last blow a million times. Your ticket probably cost as much as my house lol.
Always rooting for a brother in Christ, but Wilder definitely had some heart. Great match 🙏🏾
That final punch was the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in my life
If you count the second knocked down of Fury he was lost! America we need to bring the Belts home where they belong! Great fight all around tho
I'm convinced that even that punch would've KOd Canelo or GGG
Malik would have made a nice chunk out of the $25million that wilder made
Jake Paul vs. Deontay Wilder next..👍
Whover paid for this live show, was worth every penny. A legendary fight . 100%!
No more wilder
Referee is the big winner
Fury is a beast
White man is conquerers💯
it looks like fury,s fist is heavy asf
Tough sport. Respect for both warriors despite results.
Fury vs usyk and Wilder vs AJ next
Such a legendary fight.
man did the ref just catch wilder falling dayummmmmmm !!!!
Wilder when he gets knocked down: ahh man I'm so sad right now.   Wilder when he gets a knock down: Fuck yeah im a beast!
RIGGED!!
Great footage. Thanks.
Tyson Fury, "ya feel me?".......Wilder, "my gloves were too heavy".....LOL...like the ref had to wave it off...the dude is on his side, snoring....LOL...wait..was Wilder wearing a SKIRT??? LOL
Watching the whole vid in slowmo is the one
I want a 4th fight to see Wilder looking scared and wobbly again
If you really wanna play that slow count game against Fury, Wilder got a slow count in the third before Fury got knocked down. 0:12 to 0:32
Wow I never realised the power in that punch what finished him..Goodnight Vienna Son , as we say in Leeds 🤣
Should have knocked him out in the 4th ..Saved by the bell but resigned after that to his fate..!!
Spiritual warfare, God wins
The fight was fixed. Fury cheated, he used 'boxing skills'. You wouldn't see Wilder doing something like that.
The delusional wilder fanboys will never talk about the rabbit punch from Wilder on the second knockdown.
FUCK I wish I could see a fight live like this. Shit is expensive. fuck
Aaaahh it's over!!  it's all over!!
Loooooool
The last knockout was vicious 👊
On the way back to his seat after the stoppage, wilder looked like he was going for a Sunday stroll head in the clouds lol
Both men meant business but one's miscalculation cost him more, respect to both men but mostly to the king of the ring, king Fury you're the best 2×.
That was one of the most sloppiest fights I ever seen!
The heavyweight division is so sloppy now no disrespect but there’s no finesse in the heavyweight division these guys were fighting Their hearts  out but it looked so fuckin sloppy….
Minus all the Fury crank sucking. He IS a great fighter, simply outboxed, out conditioned, and out classed Wilder. HOWEVER, Wilder would destroy all others… Facts.
Anyone who says Fury doesn't hit hard is an idiot. The punch that ended this fight was a bomb.
Yeah tyson lost count the secs
I’m waiting from the headline from the SJW’s at ESPN,,,,,”Tyson Fury wins over Wilder from his Gypsy White Privilege”😂😂
"This camera quality is insane"   No, no it's not.   Someone with common sense simply used a phone from 2010. Sad that this is considered great, must be a lot of idiots producing footage.
The way Fury slipped Wilder left hook @ 1:52 ( round 10) and then connect with his right was very masterful. He's a fighter who can slug it out but most of all, he's a talented boxer who can adjust his game when he needs to.
Real life Achilles vs Mamnon
Kkkkkkkk yes!!!
Next time hold camera in horizontal format
Mike Tyson still the best
Mike Tyson still the best
FURY IS JUST A BETTER BOXER
Can’t believe wilder got up immediately after the Knockdowns didn’t stall what so ever
How the evil race baiter fell 🥰wonderful Fury is the Christian king 🤴
Wow the more times you watch it the worse it gets, tyson definitely prolonged the pain on purpose
is it a phone or camera cause the video quality is 100 uffff!!!
wilder looked drunk
Sounds like the majority of people are cheering for Wilder.
That inside uppercut really set the tone for this fight
You are the best tyson,over all.
now wilder if you walk in a room...and no matter how big that room is...if Tyson fury is in it you are RETIRED.....until you leave the room...then you're back to being a tosser.
4th round. Fury knocked down at 0:59 and is up at 1:07 <<  So, 8 seconds. Fine, no problem with that.  Fury down for the 2nd time at 1:31 and is up at 1:41 <<< So, so close. Within the bounds of human error? Yea, I would say so... But, the ref did count slow and I am not referring to the standing eight. Talk about on a knife edge!  Brilliant battle by both men.
great fight, would love to see wilder fight again against joshua
That was a great fight it was a movie.
When you're falling sooo bad that even the referee tries to catch you 🙏🏾
Bronze Bummer 😂😂👊👊
Won't get this in those dumb exhibitions.  This was a proper FIGHT.
rspect for wilder his the real deal bronze bommer.Congrats Fury.
Tyson Fury best heavyweight in the world
How is fury holding wilder in a headlock and uppercutting him legal.
Both these guys would beat Usyk and Joshua what a fight
Referee got paid for this no doubt about it
Best view angle so far. Every moment is crystallizing
Best fight i seen in years. Tyson fast for a huge man.
He seems to go down whenever he is hurt to avoid taking more shots.  This is why they use to have a three knock down rule.  Fury is a great fighter...but this is a legit criticism.  There should be no flopping in boxing.
Deontay Wilder......sings     Show me the way to go home.....I'm drunk and I wanna go to bed.....
Craaazy fight
Wilder hit the floor like a sack off shite 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wilder really had a heart he is worrior
man that move at 1:53 was slick
How many of us want another fight regardless 9f the results I the trilogy? Like if you agree
Great vantage point.       Fury was ask if he was hurt after the fight, His answer was when you get knocked down you don't feel it. Which is true, when that button is pushed you just go limp.    Another quote I heard once from Evander Holyfield, " if you can feel the pain, your still in the game"     Also true.         I get why Fury was going for behind the back of Wilders ear, that's the spot that's disrupts equilibrium.          Great fight
Hey Thanks for Posting this !!   This angle is very interesting and kinda almost more REal !!
for all the people saying it was longer than ten seconds, people need to realise, its not a 10 second count... its a ten count
New iPhone films in 4K
😳wow .. congrats to the winner🤙
Don’t go for any but that second knocked down the stupid should of kept counting 😂😂😂
Booom bommm amazing
Could watch that knock out over and over lol
Wilder was happy at Fury fell. He think is over. But that was not the end. Only this time was the end a humiliation.
Wilder - "what's going on? What tf did I do wrong, tell me!"
The Ref don't try to give Wilder a ten count, he should have given Wilder a chance to recover. When Wilder knocked Fury out cool, the Ref gave him a 10 count, but it was actaully 16 seconds not 10.  In the first fight there was a video clip of the Ref telling Fury we are here for you.
That's what you call flipping the light switch or short circuiting the system. Blown light bulb night night
Obviously it’s good for us on YouTube, but imagine paying the price for those seats and watching it all through a screen 🤦‍♂️
Did some fool shout "say down" to Tyson? LOL don't they know he's a Machine!!!
Wilder looked drugged up. Or he over trained for the fight. Whilst fury came in sluggish and overweight and still knocked Wilder out.
Wilder's head on the 11th round was flailing on that KO similar to how Kamaru Usman knocked Jorge Masvidal out cold, the sweat just burst and drizzled in every direction.
1. That was no boxing classic, if truth be told, but the punters enjoyed it. 2. Amazing video.
Though not a fan of wilder, its sad to see a champ down on his knees like that, hope he'll come back even stronger then before.
He almost murdered wilder
It's like watching two giants fight
277 pounds of pure British beef right there, that kind of weight behind a punch would take out any man. Credit Wilder for hanging on but his fundamentals just aren’t up to scratch
Haha.
Look at fight referee turns wilder to wrong corner then stops counting to tell him he's in wrong corner... referee know some tricks but vecio don't lie
Champ Wilder
Love it 😊
I will say this, I can't stand Wilder and loved seeing him get destroyed physically and even more so mentally/emotionally. But dont EVER question that man's heart!! He went out on his shield like he wanted too, and didn't shy away from Fury for 1 second. Of any fight they had.
Great, for bove
Wilder built his entire career on the belief that he only needed to make contact with his opponents in order to win.  And then Fury comes along, and Wilder gives him the hardest knockout punches he’s ever given anyone else in his life. This tried and tested approach worked for Wilder for over 40 of his past matches, but not on Fury; not even close. Every time Fury gets knocked down, he gets right back up. He doesn’t even look like he suffered any damage.  I can only imagine what this image of an immortal would do to Wilder’s confidence. The man has never been humbled like this before.
You don't have no power  you couldn't knocked me out....next day ko 😂
It was the ref that saved wilder this time....
Where is AJ? We need him badly.
I see the problem? Deontay is wearing a dress!
The Gypsy 👊💚👊🇬🇧
JESUS SAVIOR PILOT ME
Tyson Fury is the Goat!💪💪💪💪
As soon as Wilder knocked down than that black woman she got into ring and started shouting to someone..very strange and would love to know why & whom she shout at?
British can go home with belt the American can have their fraud biden and the nonsense woke ...let go brandon ..now days American are losing everything
What’s up hood!? 🤣🤣🤣
Best boxing fight i ever seen
This is a good view to watch from  I enjoyed that (: thanks
10sec count
I wish there was a love button fuck liking this video, seeing excuse ridden wilder go down like that made my year...good one sided fight no doubt but sportsmanship and respect especially afterwards is a necessity in a trilogy, the loser should be humble.
I do t think fury was hurt to much when he got dropped, wilders punches never connected properly hence why fury got up easily. Fury the Fucking champion wilder done out ere.
RESPECT
Wilder is up in 8 seconds..🔥🔥
Fury's superior punch picking was the key.Wilder was just swinging and hoping.Fury was setting his punches up and when Wilder's lack of defence showed Tyson found the gaps and exposed a brave but limited fighter.
To this day
Why was people talking shit about wilder , this was a really good fight. This was a proper heavyweight fight.  Anyone could have won, they just needed that last big shot.
You had the best 💺 seat in the 🏠 house !
I know this might be a stretch by Wilders right arm hooking the fence I think was his body still trying to stay up while he was knocked out. I think after this fight, Wilder has finally become a true boxer, rather than a fighter.
Only reason Wilder held tge bout so long is cause he didnt accept any good challengers. No skill whatsoever lol
No disrespect to the new school boxers... but they don't make them like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Holyfield, Lenox Lewis, Sugar Ray no more. It's like the new rappers there already rich or portraying and not hungry or thirsty enough like the Mexicans, Russians and so on, just my opinion 🤔
Brutal KO slow motion
Did a better job of filming
Wilder fought and fell like a log of wood for his daughter survival. There are many twists to this life. All depends on where you view it.
Cameraman, you should to record most of streetfights. Where’ve u been? Some of professionals aren’t able to take this kind of pic
sheesh another close call comeback from fury
Really hope I never see wilder box again. Also if he dose. Just put him on his back foot and its over. Fury has shown all you boxers how its done
Fcking Fury won 10 out of 11 rounds  again
Lol ganamos los blancos
The ole Nokia 6110 camera lookn good.
The encouraging prepared apically pretend because airbus specially cry within a stimulating disease. tedious, malicious landmine
IAM SORRY BUT I STRONGLY FEEL ITS MATCH FIXING.  BECAUSE WILDER CANNOT LOOSE LIKE THAT.  BECAUSE EVEN IF NOT BUT SEE WILDER IS PLAYING VERY CARELESSLY HE IS NOT EVEN DEFENDING HIMSELF.    NO MATTER  WHAT BUT SOMETHING IS FISHY
Dang the shots look more brutal than on broadcast
That was a sorry sight seeing wilder getting taken back to his corner what a dangerous sport.
Art in motion 🥊
HACK OFF JACK OFF
Playing with numbers like little kids when they have no power cuz they have no soul. I don't even care watch me all you want say whatever you want hack my Facebook I don't give a f*** people know who I I have friends you have zero that's why all you care about is money.  You're all going to burn.
Hopefully Wilder will shut that mouth of his for good and leant to be respectful
Please, don't sing...
I myself, hate recording live sport from the side lines of any sport my kids play no focus easily distracted. So for the life of me, I can't fathom how you could watch such a historical and momentous occasion through the lens of your phone, thats crazy! I always end up stuffing it up at some stage, but this, this was so good so well done I can't fault you in any way! I got a ring side perspective I could never ever pay for! Thank you and Cheers!
THEY'RE GOING TO STUFF YOUR WIFE'S TURKEY BRO
Fredericks Patrick networking hells Angels are coming now. I'd do the footwork you guys do the finger work LOL. Two demons versus an OG and a four-time murder are you stupid? No you're just really s***** at what you're doing and you're going to get what's coming to your ass. So is Jen.
Absolute giants battling it out in the ring 👏 crazy to see it in this angle!
Fury almost decapitated wilder
Great video
Classy White MAN! Vs sore sport!
This fight is the best fight in 2021
Fury is not even a human.
The squad is bombed!
Blows my mind that people sit there with their phones up, watching through their screen, when the fucking fight it right fucking there! Waste of good tickets.
Notice how fury stayed longer on the ground to get a bit of rest, he didn't go immediately back up
I still think Wilder drink lots of hard liquor😂😂😂😂great fight tho
RIP replay button
Looks like shaq had a big bet for wilder. Haha
HorttoRomano,is best.
Seru👍
Wilder is wildless!
I'm too old for this sheet.
Since the Rumble In the Jungle Fight  until this fight ...ohhhhh....a great fight to be remembered..thanks to the two Champs
I should have paid more for this fight
Athletic cool hip gangsta wannabe wilder lost to a bald white man with a dad bod who has fists of steel. You love to see it
To this day!
Tremendous footage there. Thanks for sharing.
I love how Fury continued to talk shit to Wilder after he lost. Fuck sportsmanship this is how champions should carry themselves. Kick the losers while they’re down. Fury is a beast.
Awesome.
Priceless
We'll never witness a man like Fury again
Wilder is a very poor loser.
He Drago'd that Dosser 🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
ouch man...he ain't coming back for anoth 20 months
left hook right hook combo...when do you see that???!!! Wilder was done in 8th, end of 8th in his corner he was orbiting somewhere....dropped 10th, KTFO in 11th!
I want to see it again way better than the second fight
Respecte to both men they gave it all what a fight.
Nadie de la esquina de Dentay fue a ayudarlo a penas cayó noqueado. Lamentable
im gonna be the pooper and say, shouldnt they been brawling over xoom 6 ft apart? man were never getting rid of covid
Regardless of who won, they both were real fighters !!
That black guy -was easy money for Tyson fury
Ref stopped counting at six and then continued at six 😂. But I think he made it up in time. I recall Ward saying it live that the count was slow.
What a battering 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💪🥊
How have you got front row tickets to Fury Wilder 3 and the whole time watching it through your phone, what a prick.
Why did you film this vertical instead of wide screen?   Learn to use a phone.
The ref was pure class.
I never even dreamed about a fight this good! I knew it was going to be good and  I knew Wilder was going to fight better than the 2nd fight. But this? 5 knockdows? The winner of the fight going down twice in a round? This guys deserve every penny they earned. That final knockout was CRAZY! What a great fight! What a great trilogy! Boxing is not dead! Boxing is not dead at all! 🙌🏽🙏🏽🦾
Woww
Tyson Fury the best boxer in that heavyweight division   I feel bad for Wilder his old coach Jay Deas never taught him anything only told him to rely on right hand .. Scott wasn’t improvement either he told wilder to gain muscle mass and he gassed out
Watch this fight free  Gotta thank the hackers for this
That final blow was insane
Thanks for the clip! Nice view!
Good footage  - a pity they haven't learnt how to film in landscape mode instead of portrait mode.😔
I remember Wilder saying that Fury didn’t have any Knockout power!!! I wonder what he’s thinking now!!!!
Notwithstanding the shitty talk from Wilder he is a brave man,the weight difference between them is huge it's like Wilder is two weight classes below Fury yet he went out there to knock out the much bigger and more skillful opponent than him and almost managed to pull it off,now for me that is something .. Bravo Wilder .. Congratulations Fury ... 💐💐💐👏👏👏
Broke his wooden shield when he fell and curled to his side like a fetus.
There will be a forth fight between Wilder and Fury in the future, 2 years from now.
wilder gets up ... great fight
You have a great seat there man. Must have cost >> $$$$
*Wilder looking like “ I know this man ain’t just get back up* 👀 “ 1:46
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8RgS_FzEyQ
After you placed bet on Wilder: "Bronze Bummer!!!" After you placed bet on Fury: "Bum Squad!!!"
Fury retiring soon he can't take no more fights like that. Aint no way he ok after that. He fooling yall this is why he didn't want to fight this man again. Wilder hits hard as hell. Fury was bruised red all over he was in pain. He didn't want to get up but he pushed hisself really hard to do  it. After he beats usky for the undisputed titles he's done he retiring champ. Watch and believe he is tired. His heath is more important he will realize if he dont already know that.
See when Wilder,Hit the Canvas the Ref didn't Stop Counting,and tell Fury to catch his Corner,But when Wilder drop Fury the Ref Stop Counting,and told Wilder to catch a Corner.
Sviniqta q spasi sadiqta
That right hand as Wilder hit the canvas was so satisfying
I wanted Tyson to win but it's sucks seeing Wilder go out like that.. just goes to show that any one can be turned in to a rag doll
Next I’m gonna get drunk. Thanks
Imagine paying all that money to be ringside and then watching the fight through your phones camera 🤣
Incredible. Been waiting for this. Thanks so much
So was the gloves loaded,  water spiked, trainer throwing in the towel premature, Nevada boxing commission pro fury, out fit to heavy... or just  win .. better boxer
Great to see these angles! Thanks.
Beyonce got baptised 😂
Excellent clip thanks for sharing.
DOSSER SQUAD!!
Every black person in stadium at end  not clapping lol
Tyson deserves utmost respect for his feat.... But Deontay showed extreme heart.... Tyson is the only man Deontay couldn't conquer... Make no mistake, this is the world No 1 and No 2 right here until they retire
No one can match Mike Tyson era huh
For Deontay it hurt a helluva lot more to lose than the actual punches, this fight was a matter of pride and restoring a wounded Ego. Ten feet tall and bulletproof, all the women want me and nobody can kick my ass. That is the way of the Ego, you can't teach me a damn thing. Then comes the fall when we all find out how fragile the Ego really is and reality sets in.  Shake his hand Deontay you can't win them all and besides even if you could where would you put all the trophies and awards? In reality they don't pass out awards for doing the right thing it is its own reward and your own sense of honor is all that really matters anyway.   Cool? I hope it is and I hope you're alright. Forget about measuring yourself against Tyson Fury you be the best Deontay Wilder you can be and everything else will take care of itself.  Peace and love always brother man.
Shrek the real champion
I wanna see wilder vs aj and Tyson vs usky
Defensive cost Wilder.
People don’t notice wilder don’t even give a single interview after the fight that’s dangerous big depression
its just good to see a actual fight for once most of mayweathers fights were annoying the hell out of me
To steal a line from Skip Bayliss, I'm not sure that Tyson Fury is an actual HUMAN. NOBODY - no HUMAN - can get up like he does, and get BETTER afterwards. It's insane. As a former boxer, I never experienced an opponent getting back up after I put him down. As a boxing fan, I can ONLY imagine what kind of psychological effect happens when you THINK you just ended the fight, and the guy gets up and hits you even HARDER than he did before you floored him. Tyson Fury is not a picturesque fighter in any way, but his talent, ring-savvy and ring-intelligence is second ONLY to Muhammad Ali in my book! If these two fighters faced each other 20 more times, Fury would win all 20 bouts. He just OWNS him! What can Deontay do? Hit him HARDER? Impossible! Wilder's BEST (which would have SLEPT any other HW fighter) was simply not enough. Tyson Fury is just an incredible, incredible fighter - in ways that MOST fighters have NO idea about. He is the only fighter alive that can literally will himself to victory! I hope that he retires before he loses that rare ability!
They should have let continue Wilder get brain damage, he’d stop taking Racist comments
The “Gypsy king” has Knock out power
Furys conditioning is what makes him a champ. The stamina that giant has is unbelievable.
All these fickle fans cheering when fury was under pressure. Cheering when he won 🤮
He would’ve gotten up with a 10 count…. Tbh
This very painful to watch bomb 🌋 squad 🤣🤣🤣
Next I'm going to get drunk!
Jesus Christ wins
wilder lost to a man that looks like he drinks 3 big bottles of beer XD
for someone new to boxing it literally looks like some angry uncle fighting on streets with someone
shot on an iphone?
😂😂😂😂👊💥 Bombed squad
Now I understand what people mean when they're saying 'watching it from ringside'... You see every punch so clearly.
The last knockdown was classic.
Let's thank this cameraman.. It's like im watching a movie .. Wowwwww
Those are some great seats
Why is Wilder wearing a skirt?
ty bro been searching all over forsomething like this
Amazing capture
Wilder looked gassed on the first knockdown!
2:37 Nate what you doin?
And that PAUL guy wants to box the GYPSY KING??...🤣😂🖕🖕🖕🖕
2:29
Amazing fight. Bravo to the organizing committee.
Watching this fight really makes me realize how fast mike Tyson was.
Is a looser, wilder
Brother Deontay! Go AJ next as he's hurting too. Fury is lying as the People want to see Fury/Joshua. AJ/WILDER will be another classic and the winner will take on FURY! You must win this or the boys from the hood will call you Fury's Beeearch!! That hurt more!! Aotearoa NZ former champ!
Goodnight big mouth.
2:32
Finally. Someone actually had a good phone
Best video yet I’ve watched keep doing it
Most fighter would be out of his element after eating that kind of punch Fury after his second knock down got up looked straight toward Wilder  He knows Wilder is Fatigued at this point  He took over
Wilder talked all that shit. Jay took his money and let him get pounded on like he wanted. I almost feel bad if I hadn't have seen his purse.
I absolutely HATE vertical videos!
My poor ass thought it's shit watching it from ringside. I think it must be as addicting as cocaine watching everything up close there.   You'd be thinking about that feeling for months
I prefer these camera angles
Wao...the camera quality is from next generation 👍👍
This is murder…wilder could have gotten killed!!!!
Thanks for sharing!  That was some great footage!  I don't know if he's always been like this or not, but looking at Wilder's face and expression in this trilogy it seems like there's just nobody home inside.  Fury on the other hand... his face looks like there's an entire family of hearty lads living in there.  It's as if one guy was exhausted from round 2 onward but reflexively just kept swinging away and lasting as long as he could (admittedly getting some great shots in and making things far more exciting than they could have been) while the other guy was as energetic the whole time despite being monstrous in size.  I felt on the edge of my seat mostly from wondering how long Wilder would last and clapping that he lasted longer than his body, face, and game plan warranted.  Fury never looked out of it but Wilder looked like a zombie half asleep but still trying to attack when he occasionally came out of his stupor.  Wilder just looks... dumb to be honest and he fights dumb.  His trainers obviously told him to go to the body this fight but he only had the focus to do so for the first round.  It's no wonder his corner men were telling him to WAKE UP!  It just seemed inevitable after the very first time Fury knocked down Wilder that it was a question of WHEN not IF he would knock Wilder out.
The refs count on Fury’s second knock down was stupid long.
Great footage.
Wilder awe his life to the ref But im sure he will blame the ref for his loss and he did haha
Fury all day
Dontay should have never taking this fight fury is a beast
Usyek and Jushou are shaking now 🤣🤣
Best fight this modern times Not like TBE floyd running?
You can clearly see Wilder calling for a Time out seconds before the knockdown.  The ref and Fury ignored his desperate plea and the relentless punishment consumed him.  Hats off to the ref and fury for cheating and not allowing the time out for a doctor to look at Wilders hand!!  I want my $500 back!!
Is sad, wilder did not had a chance without footwork nor defense
When arrogant a*****es got served. He deserved the humiliation. NO MORE DEONTY WILDER. HE WILL BE WRITTEN IN HISTORY AS A SORE LOSER. CAN'T ACCEPT THE FACT THAT TYSON FURY IS THE BETTER BOXER. WILDER LOS 3 TIMES.
Wilder is very lucky that last Right Hook did not catch him on the Chin.
It looks like Fury's 2nd KD is a slip and a push.
1:30
This shit was garbage. They both looked drugged or like the party the night before. I'm looking at this like wtf is going on. Hangover
You got knocked the fuck out
The ref rocks
In Deontae wilders defense he got a double count off that first knock down but he still couldn’t stop fury
I think wilder started to rise up again after the the final knockdown but referee somehow didn't wanted him to go on.
How much did that ticket cost to sit there ? Woulda loved to have been there in person .
Have to feel sorry for Wilder.
So jake paul wants to fight tyson fury? Bruuuh😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fury is the man!!  Who's next?  Who can beat Fury? I don't think any heavyweight can deal with this version of Fury!! Do you?
Thanks for uploading this version. It feels real and live. If you can put the whole fight up from this angle would be fantastic!
NO shock here i never thought Wilder could fight like Tank Davis said he fights like a Tom girl
That slo mo fall was epic
This fight was literally like a Rocky Movie
Why can't Wilder move well with all those muscles?
Fury wasn't knocked down twice. The second one wilder pushed the top of his head down maybe even a rabbit blow.... this video makes it clear
Tyyyyyyyyson furyyyy tyyyyyyson furyyyy 🎶🎶🎶
Why did the referee restart his count when fury got knocked down the second time????!!!!????
Bro great fucking stoppage he was out on his feet the last 4 rounds ...wilders heart is legendary but guess what he has children maybe that’s more important than winning
Great vídeo ! 😎🥊👍
fury is the man n the ring  enjoyed ur win
Wilder got decapitated with that last punch holy shit.
Wilder almost died in there respect to both these men.
Like on the Friday movie Wilder got knocked the f*** out lmao
That’s called real men boxing
One of the best fights ever
At this point we have to agree Joshua will have alot work to beat fury..... He was very light
Gets invited to Heavyweight fight if the decade… watches entire fight through phone screen.
What phone are u using man ?
If the camera has this quality I wouldn't mind watching it vertically.
They was beatin the shit outta eachother
At this point it really don’t matter who won,just a GREAT FIGHT
Too many complaints, boxing gloves,u broke your leg,next thing u will break your balls.shut your big mouth with all your trainers mouth.full of trash  .wilder,.its right time fo u to retire.
Hurtful omg
Tyson has incredible stamina for a man of his size.
wilder is supersized version of Vic Darchinyan. so predictable when about to land his power punches.
One of the very best of heavy weight in boxing of all times,, hats off to both boxers they both show their quality.
Tyson Fury, the greatest of his generation.
its crazy how when fury got knocked down  it took him more than 10 seconds to get up and wilder got up withing 5 seconds .... to be honest when fury got knocked down the second time the fight shouldve been over
Deontay wilder still the best.
Wilder looked like apollo creed falling to the canvas In rocky4.  😁
2:33 (try it in .5 replay) have you noticed that wilder knocked himself out with his own right hand. and that could be his next excuse🤣😂😅
1:45 Wilder expresión ," owh shit he's woke up 😕😕!!
Entire thing looks choreographed.
Great seats
Im strong for my size but I have No problem admitting that that final punch may have killed me outright.
awesome video, thanks!
Thank you reff for helping brake the fall
First phone to record holding the phone vertically but also record in landscape and portrait mode wins.
This shows... Being in shape dosent matter 😅
I was rooting for fury from the start and I had tears at the end.. Brutal sport. I hope wilder comes back strong and healthy. God bless both
Crazy thing is Wilder was up on his feet in less than 8 seconds tho... all hail the gypsy king and his wonderful performance
1 question, at 3 min 20 sec, wtf is that thumb doing
Belgrade police terrorists, bandits and nationalists love you as much as they love terror, violence and ethnic cleansing
Hopefully wilder gets back in there soon
I still miss the 80s 90s heavyweight matches. I doubt either one of these guys would make it far with Tyson, Hollyfield etc
Brits rule !
Lovely to see the Wilder supporting shouting 'stay down' getting owned by the end.
"WINDMILL WILDER"!!🤣🤣
Wow! So this is what it's like to be watching from ring side.
Man, the end of a trilogy fight and we didn't get to see the fighters squash the beef and hug it out. Pointless of them to ever fight again. Winner won fair and square and the fans won because they sacrificed so much in the ring. Damn shame.   And did I dream it or was there a fight prior to this where a guy got DQ'd because he couldn't stop punching his opponent in the nuts?
Good night wilder
I’m well aware Tyson Fury was about 40lbs heavier in this but doesnt it seem that Wilder gassed out early like he did in the second fight as well? Dude was bragging about benching 350….you should have been doing damn near all cardio instead. He still had power in his fists but the guy could barely walk from exhaustion.
Great video. Thanks.
In the first fight he outpointed him.  In the second fight he stopped him.  In the third fight he knocked him out cold.  He finished him in every way possible and the more they fight the more brutal it’d be for Wilder.
TYSON FURRY “ THERES NO MORE DEONTAY WILDER” 🤴🏼 long live the king
Wilder was very fast K.O he did nothing
Fury deserves a movie about his life...such an inspiration...
Wilders team say they making sure he takes significant time off BUT we all know that's covering for Wilder as he goes through post concussion protocols. 100% he was heavily cuncussed. He just about staggered to the ground leaving the ring also. Nice try team Wilder. Some of us know the protocols cause he had them slammed on us also.
When fury went down that first time I counted at 10 when he got up
God bless for your content brother!
Wilder said he was going to lick fury in the ring😘
Deontay is literally the definition of what Mike Tyson said many years ago. Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.   His plan was going well for the first two rounds and then as soon as he got clipped, he reverted back to his old ways.
Good fight ..thanks for watching
That was an amazing last punch
It was like watching Rocky and Apollo. Epic🙌🏼
Everybody is saying how the ref saved wilder's life but he did let him take the punch. What ever happened to the standing 8 count?  I don't know if they had it for  this fight but it would have been the  right thing to do or let him get up on a 20 count and then stop the fight. It still would have been a TKO but they denied Wilder the chance to even get back on his feet. (which he did anyways.)  My hat is off to Wilder while I will forever be waving the middle finger at Fury.
White Boy Summer is extended another 2 weeks.
"Total abliteration of a Dosser"                  Tyson Fury
wilder ate those punches like cheerios lol
That last hook made me dizzy. May as well hit him with a brick.
Next time horizontal 👍
I will said this...and a majority wont believe it..  But this fight was FIXED.
Everything I see a bumsquad fan I look at the knockout and smile
Those were some brutal uppercuts Fury was landing. You could see the sweat flying off Wilder’s head.
WWF boxing 😃
What was this recorded with?
Bro I wish it was a draw cause I like both boxers
WILDER DOES A GOOD HOOK TO THE HEAD THEN SNAP DOWN !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't think I've ever seen a close up KO like that and if you slow it to .25  it's insane ..
Slowest standing 8 counts ive seen
Is being 40 pounds heavier and lying all over the guy boxing?
The greatest fight ever!!
He was given him those upper cuts  like Mike Tyson used to do
The 2 KDs from Wilder was him hitting Fury on the backside of his head then pushing him down! Common how cant people see it? Obvious af!
He was happy to get outta there. Please don't let them fight again. Wilder can fight one of the Paul Brothers
Dayum lol, Fury has ENDED Deontay! He said “there’s no more Deontay Wilder”, LMFAO, he freaking ETHERED HIM!
A trilogy were one fighter doesn't win a fight.
Man that last shot was so devastating
One Man goes to the hospital the other to the night club.... Says it all.
I know wilder lost but damn..I AM FUCKING GOIN TO PAY FOR A 4TH FIGHT!!
Apart from the 2 knock down in the 4th this was a pretty one sided beat down ,even in the 3rd Wilder was lucky to make the bell.
wilder cud of got en up 1 more time
Makanya jadi manusia jangan sombong dan merasa hebat,,,ingatlah diatas langit masih ada langit,,apalagi.jika anda sampai menantang Tuhan sang pencipta semesta
Done and dusted end of a era!
Fight of the year!!!!
Damn. Nothing to be ashamed of wtf.   They want to end this trilogy. Both of them.. they swinging at their best.. damn.
Fury best heavy weight fighter
Wilder is a sore loser
Get those good nft’s.
Great video !!!!
What an unbelievable fight!!
perfect spot, perfect shot.
Wilder dead man walking, he should retire soon
Wilder cant figure this guy out fury crazy good
Wilder hancur oleh kesombongannya sendiri👍
“Man he cheated, he had bricks in his gloves “  LMAO
One of those fights where I wish I was amongst the audience in the arena. FIREWORKS :-)
TO THİS DAY wilder is a bronze dosser
" I want to go out on my shield" says Wilder. Well, I guess if your shield is the floor with your face on it you got your wish!!!!
Pillow fists wins again
I’ll always remember how a dumb fucking argument with my fiancé ruined my chances of me watching this fight..
Somebody need to retrain wilder before he gets killed literally he don't block his head
Congratulations to both fighters, they've paid their dues... No champ forever.
Fury is a brawler not a fighter...and brawlers never give up.....
Good footage
It shot on one of them old Nokia's  They was quality  And on a pay as you go contract  Top marks
Boy, they both fought like shit. Cant learn much from that fight.
Some are saying the count was slow??? What?! Pretty sure you can find some boxing highlights with slow count and boxers that take the time to recover. Wilder fans are inventing more excuses like Wilder. A lost is a lost no matter what.
Deontey ear is his weak spot 🤦🏿‍♂️
Damn it’s like they’re fighting in there
Covid tried to take this away from people
I miss the old times heavy weight fights..This is like a cheap bar fight.
Nate Robinson would be proud
Amazing fight and everlasting memories in boxing real fight
There’s literally another ref outside the ring that keeps track of the count. If fury was counted out the fight would have ended. Also to me it looks like wilder hit him in the back of the head I can’t believe it was a down
Can someone explain to me the knockdown at the 1:30 mark? I don't see it.
Gj ref on almost catching wilder ! Damn with this angle we can see that even when fury land what seems like "softer" punch they look really powerfull! I have some boxing experience and i was telling my gf how a boxer like wilder/fury would kill me even if they could only use jab. I would be proud to last a few punches lol
Always feels good to watch arrogant people who are in denial get knocked out and embarrassed in front of everyone.
clean fight
That was Brutal
what a fight
Be honest even he knocked down fury twice that round but wilder looked more tired,, we walked with heavy breathing and mouth opened
Wilder mistakes,  poor diffence, skills and easy tired but he need much respect ,a true warrior
So did that cameraman just watch his phone the whole fight, but still forgot to put it on landscape!?!
I hope wilder doesn't have any permanent damage. Think of the amount of power headshots he took off furey over these 3 fights.
Alright I’m a realist and Tyson Fury is for sure the baddest man on the man planet. BUT!!! IM SORRY!!! The 2nd time Fury got knocked down might have been the longest count I’ve ever seen in all my life of loving boxing
I loved the Rocky movies but Fury is an idol for my whole families. Specially for my son's. Fury forever & forevermore.
The last words: "there is no more Deonte Wilder"....😂😂😂

Can i give you a weird prediction that can come to reality? WILDER CAN TAKE DOWN USYK IN ONE SWING  USYK CAN OUTBOX TYSON FURY
nothing makes me happy thaan the yanks being upset by twatheads loss
Insane camera!!!
Fury's second knockdown in round 4 was more of a loss of balance then from a punch, either that or he was tryna entertain the fans, if you look carefully you see that he didn't actually get hit before he fell
After seeing this I don’t get how Wilder can have no respect.  These dudes nearly killed each other.
BEAUTIFULL.
Went out sad
Twice wilder knocked fury too but I respect both
That last bit were wilders face caves in off that big smack straight in his temple really makes me laugh 😅
Am I the only one tryna spot the wilder fans in the background 😂😂 like look at 1:33 those two dudes in white getting all hyped and then look at 2:44 😂😂😂 they speechless and ain’t moving
Poor Wilder got knock spark out - he was asleep when he collapsed over the ropes
2:33 that was a demolition punch from fury
That ko was nasty 😂
Is it just me or does deontay Wilder look like he is pouting every time he gets knocked down
fury's shots were cleaner and more precise than wilder's
You have to put fury to sleep if you want to win or he will get back up and hunt you down and win simple only 1 Tyson fury 🙌
Ill remember this fight until the day i die. I have never been so emotionally invested into a fight
Legendary battle, thank you for a great finght
You have the best camera view 😘
Fury is a mutant. Big guy!
Fury has made me realise that AJ is sh*t at boxing
Good guy ref catching Deontay as he fell from the knockout. Always nice to see refs that have the fighters health in mind at all times.
It all started to go wrong for wilder when he started to slag off Mike Tyson. Tyson Fury was furious he did that. At that point wilders fate was sealed!
Icl its kinda sad uno suttin deffo happened to wilder after the second fight 😂
I love how all the butt-hurt Wilder fans are up here making their best excuses. Time to get a job...
Beautiful
Dive squad😇
The bronze diver 😅😅😅
2:09 Paris Fury
jack hammers
best highlights I've seen so far from fury vs wilder 3 absolutely everything was on point & the quality my goodness excellent 👌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
2:30. Conversing with his ancestors lol.
One man had a sledgehammer in his hand and landed it a few times. The other had a hammer and hit the first guy hundreds of times. The hammerman won!
Hey guys we have free links for all sports, boxing, mma, nfl, football, basketball etc in the description of our videos.
Whover paid for this live show, was worth every penny. A legendary fight .
Film horizontally!
poopie fart sniff sniff
No losers in this fight both win
That KO clip is insane, Wilder got bashed up proper
Wilder got knocked the fuck out!! Fury unleashed his fury on that fucking sausage
Fury is so arrogant. Would expect someone who understands mental health to be  More compassionate before and post fight.
Gotta respect the speed of that referee. He was all about the safety of Deontay when he went crashing down
If Deontay ever suffers from insomnia, all he has to do is walk into fury fists.
Fury's greatest challenge has always been and always will be the buffet
Dam this shit so close I feel like im there lmao!!
Great angle !
Wilder can't cry cheater this time lol. He's gonna need a shrink after this trilogy.
Big SHAQ in the house at 2:59
Doesnt look konfortable to watch matches from the ringside.... Too expensive for this kinda views full of heads... Looks better a bit more upstairs like the krowd in front of the kamera
Wilder got the heart man....props
Wow nice footage 🥊🥊🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Still knocked out....TO THIS DAY
Ref actually tried to catch Wilder on the way down.
Just looking st Furys legs after the knockdown steady as a rock Wilders looked like jelly. Wilder gave his best,it was NOT good enough.👑👑👑👑
Not even a Wilder fan, but you can’t deny respect to him for being a warrior and believing on himself.
Superb camera angle. for that final knockout.
LOL funny how when Tyson won he was respectful, no show boating.  Deontay would have thugged it up with his wife.  Thank god we don't have to hear those two yapping anymore.  Great fight.  Both warriors.
TKO is NOT a KO
I wanted Wilder to win soo bad.
It feels a lot different when you are this close to the action, watching two gigantic humans go at it on a raised platform in front of you.
They didnt let wilder to get up now, but in the first fight they gave 15sec to fury to get up after knocking him out...
1:28 how??
jesus ferkin christ musta give him brain damage after that hit
You got knocked the fuck out craig.... I love how Wilder acted like the first knock down wasn't shit with baby giraffe legs
Tyson!!! Yeah baby!
He is beatable. You just have to have a good clean heart.
The Gypsy King 👑  beat this loser 3Times in a row 😂
Too THIS Day!!? Too this Day!!🤣🤣🤣 Team Fury All the way from Day One
Tyson Fury is very beatable. You just have to have a good clean heart...,,,,,.
This is the first time I see Wilder going to his corner after the KO.  He looked like a complete zombie.
At 1:48 the "let's go wilder" scream hit home. He didn't even look happy, just focused. Fury's just too good man. I don't think there's anyone in the division that can stop him.
Fury Vs Usyk pls 🥊🥊
Check BLM in the crowd at 2:44 LOL. Heartbroken😂
Can’t wait for the excuses he will make why he lost.
How much were those seats?
Epic fights. Epic ring side video! WOW
Boom and that's all she wrote lol Have a nice kip lad
I definitely got my money worth with this fight, I really wasn't cheering for either man but had a great night with family and friends.
Second knockdown of Fury looked like Wilder pulled him down by his neck.
Best footage iv'e seen yet! 😆
People are not tired of this bullshit fake,and still put money into it 😅
Ya big dosser
Wilder can beat Fury, but he need to learn to save his energy because more than half of the power shots he did, not land and cost him tons of energy, tactically got beaten by Fury
nice footage .. cool to see it from a different perspective
At least they touched up lol
Actually feel sorry for wilder here lol, u can see he is a beaten man, Fury too good. Wilder can just retired and focus on his family maybe...
White lives matter
Lol that winning shot from Tyson tho damn
damn man those blows are heavy. hope they dont end up developing brain damage when they get older.
I wish live boxing could be like this video
I've never seen either fight.. wow they are both trash
Wasn't for that rope
Wilder ran out of gas.  Tyson turn off the lights on him. Simple as that.
Didn’t hear Wilders wife calling Fury fat when she got in the ring to help her husband off the floor 😝
The second knockdown of wilder was a clear shot/push to the back of the head. Should've been ruled a slip.
THAT ko HIT WAS LIKE  being Mauled by a Grizly
All the black supremacist in the crowd
Bomber looked shaky walking out the ring, pride well and truly hurt
Great footage dude 👍👍👍
Wilder is getting better🤣
Best one yet!  THANK YOU for the upload!
How much did that seat cost you?
Fury has a hell of a chin.
I saw Fury hitting the clinch several times which by rule is illegal should wait to separate, and only then start fighting.
In slow motion his head looked like a bobblehead doll on that last punch
Two beasts warriors at work
Have that wilder u big dosser
you guys in the comments with old media stay cheatin and lying ! Cant tell the truth to save your lives ! In the 4th round your boy Tyson was knocked out completely and taking a nap! Your boy stayed on the mat passed the 10(count)! The referee then stopped counting, then continued even slower! Your boy got up at the (17) count. Then they rang that bell immediately to give the napper an extra 3 minutes to recover!By their rules, since he did not get up and tell the referee he was good andcan continue, the referee who also has been paid and brought should have declared wilder the winner in the 4th by TKO !
Holy cow what a battle. Man I actually felt sorry for Wilder when he hit the canvas then. Amazing fight.
Honestly competitive fighting is fun to watch but clearly not a sustainable life to live. I hope they’re both okay especially Wilder. Respect to both fighters awesome show
Raise your fist in defeat after denying the Gypsy King his respect.   Not the representative that Heavyweight Boxing needs, also NOT a warrior's heart.
Wilder got his ass beat, but at least Fury was nice enough to sing him a song lmao serenade him after kick his ass lmao ..
How can you have as many fights as Wider has and still not understand about the neutral corner?!
Disliked for not filming in landscape mode
Still STAGED at the end of the day! And Dontay need to pay for some boxing lessons
Great angles!
To this day....
RIP WILDER
Knocked the section 8 right outa his ass
Fury is a master of tiring opponents by clinching and leaning on them. Also his clinchwork with the uppercuts is crazy like hell. Kinda reminds me of Khabib in the UFC. Very OP, but not the mainstream way of fighting in their respective sports.
The better man and better boxer won.
These 2 was on the floor like me and my friend drinking on Saturday
Great video. Thanks for posting.
I knew once wilder started falling on fury. It was over. Wilder was exhausted by round 6.
The way the ref tried to catch Wilder on the way down.  Poor Wilder took a lot of brain damage that night. Wonder if he’ll think it was worth it in 30 years.
CLASSIC
Wilder is racist
Wilder is racist
Man I regret not paying for this. All these other hyped up fights made it hard for me to want to buy any fights now as too worried to waste my money on a shitty fight.
Unbelievable fight 1 for the ages
Deontay vs Anthony joshua is the only fight that will make sense.
This camera quality is insane
Sometimes americano behave like spoiled kid. Just the other day they were chased out from Afghanistan by Taliban with bloom. Now wilder is sent to sleep in his backyard.
I hate to say this but I'm glad the ref called that fight in the 11th round. One more round of that type of beating and head trauma could have been tragically fatal for Wilder. Tears came to my eyes seeing that last KO. Wilder was literally ready to go out on his shield 🛡 even if that meant death. He was ready to literally die. Nobody deserves to die in the ring. Great call by the ref. I pray both recover well. Wilder needs to take off from boxing for the next year or so just to recoup. His pride won't let him but he doesn't have anything else to prove. The world knows he is good just not better than Fury. Take care of yourself and family. Let the pride rest.
That’s what happens when you miss leg day too often.
Jesus, all of those knockdowns were crunchy. Glad both guys made it out ok. Go GYPSY KING!
"Soembody gotta pay." He was right.
Deontay's family needs to keep a real close eye on him for a while, this must have been devastating. As much as I dislike the guy's aura and use of words, I don't want to see him spiral - and this could very well see him spiral. Tyson broke him, you could see it on his face for almost 8 rounds.
*him
That’s the first time I’ve ever saw a referee try to catch a boxer on the way down. That’s usually never done so props to the referee
In 3 fights, after couple of rounds, Deontay Wilder looks absolutely drained.. In the second fight he was punched to a pulp.. You got to give Fury credit.. He's massive & keeps on going..
arogant ppl allways get punnished
bro that shit was ugly
1st real Gladiator match we've seen in a long time.....best fight in years by any two guys....this was money's worth....congratulations to both guys....
This POV is insane, actually feels like I'm there!
Big DOSSER N HIS FANS STAY QUIET
Amazing footage
Nice. Thanks for sharing
Those hits look harder from that angle. Love whoever recorded from that side. Great classic heavyweight battle as well.
That was one of the best fights I have ever seen. So exciting.
its allllllllllll ovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Damn he made it sleep
It looks as though Fury was hit downward on the back of the head in his 2nd knockdown. He never complained about it so thats that hahaha
Wilder's going to lose by KO more often if he decides to continue boxing. This is difficult to shake off.
Paid 80 dollars for this fight, I ain't even mad.
Good job, man. Thanks
Fury was fully conscious everytime he got knocked down and got back up.  That last knock out Wilder was GONE good thing ref stopped it
Deontay did well he just lost stammer and focus
Wilder is a loud mouth that got his mouth shut and a sorry show of sportmanship
Holy shite! That knockout punch almost took his head clean off! What a great angle!
Now that was worthy footage.
Boxing is a very tough sport! In fact the toughest . Kudos to both of them for giving us a great fight! It's not easy
None of the blacks jumping about in the crowd when wilder has his head caved in................. what a beautiful,  beautiful knockout
Oh no 🥱 what a devastated KO punch. The end of TF/DW. No more 4th battle. Both are great warriors. TF shew his steel fists and DW his bronze right-hand punch. I salute you both.
Poor old wilder looked groggy 🥴
Boxers are trained to listen to the referee's count. So if they can get up it's based on what they are hearing. At the end of the day Fury beat him...AGAIN!
How are these guys still alive? All you have to do is flick my nose with your pinky finger and I will be sneezing for a day and might call in sick tomorrow.
Wilder going down reminded me of Apollo Creed going down in Rocky 4! "THROW THE DAMN TOWEL "
Going out on your shield sometimes can be fatal.
I think Deontay got safed by the Bell in Round 3 i think if that happend earlyer Tyson would have Kod him there and then crazy Fight Deontay has alot of Heart and Grit to go 11 Rounds when he was so hurt and tired Tyson is the King realy best Hweight ever!
Good show💪💪💪
2:32
Power boxers
This is a real fight.. No one runs..just box..  This is what people wants.. Win or lose people will love it
The extra weight Deontay put on was his un-doing. The speed and velocity of his punches wasn't there. Both fighters fought sloppy. What exactly was the point of this third fight again?!?
Legendary Instant classic now placed among the greatest fights and one that that will be talked about FOREVER. Unbelievably Amazing and Epic. Thank you Fury and Wilder. 🙌🏼❤
What a great fight
That ring side view must’ve been Niice 🔥🔥🔥
For those stupid people who pay PPV to see Jake Paul lol This IS a real boxing.
The way Wilders head flips and all the sweat flies off of him in that last punch looked straight out of a movie.
He would fell on his head if there ain't those ropes!
I can’t stand Mora. He likes to be centre of attention and wants the boxers to be in his shadow.
This is the best I've seen for how Tyson won upper cuts on the inside
Tiiimmbbeerrrr!!!!!!!!!!!°
Man that guy Fury is a snake. He bites then when the victim is stunned and panicking in his head he offers a hug to kind of assure him of safety, lulling the opponent only to later sneak in a body shot and nasty upper cut that snaps his head back up. By the time fight is over Wilder mentally drained
That last shot defo cleaned his clock
There is no more Deontay Wilder
Pillow fisted Fury my ass
Furyyyyy🥊
Kudos to Wilder for making it until the 11th, he was gassed after 3rd.
Be a boxer is not easy, respect to both fighters
Great..great fight but after this i don't see Wilder fighting again..his ego is seriously damaged and he had a ton of faith in his right hand punch..so to see Fury get up shattered his confidence and this third fight just confirmed it to him..his confidence was misplaced.. I believe this fight will have devastating consequences on him mentally in the long run.. He took to many punches and the damage is going to be more and more evident in the weeks and years to come unfortunately..
I’ll bet he was wondering where that towel was.
Wilder pulled Fury down on those two supposed knock downs.   Watch Wilders glove go behind furys neck then he pulls him down.
This trilogy was insane  2nd fight that was peak Tyson ain't never seen such humiliation
3 - 0
Wilder is like a kid losin every time and than he is lookin for reasons
Mario Yamasaki:   Early Stoppage.
Boxing should be suspended for a year to let the world digest this classic!
sweet & simple
KRONK BOXING
HAHAHA for those who went for wilder
Have watched this video a trillion times and I laugh with each of them.
Man, this video sums everything up. Wilder almost turned into a punching bag for Fury. Daaaaamn
Just saddens me to see all the comments about wilder knocked out fury and the ref helped him and all that jazz. Bottom of the line is wilder took another bad beating and yes has a couple of good knock downs in round 4 but really fury really did badly beat him up to the point I was actually worried for wilder seeing his head flop about with every punch before he finally went down. How u still say all these petty things about the count and wilder not shaking his hand after was terrible. Such a bad loser and afyer an amazing fight were he orobbely should more heart in this loss than he did in all his pro wins
Love it 😀
good job on the ref catching deontay on the way down to prevent any further injury.
Both men are absolute beasts!! Respect to both Warriors 🤜🏾🤛🏻💯💯🔥🔥
Wilders body must be in some state now. He got such a pounding round after round
That last one was a doozey.  U would've been digging mine or any normal mans grave. Heckuva fight! And all these people bashing Deontay for not wanting to congratulate Tyson at the end. So what!! He fought a serious tooth and nail battle and wasn't feeling very chipper and sportsman like.. Big deal! I'm not a very good loser either and especially right after the fact.  Both men are winners in my book
All the credit to Fury, but the ref does have to speed up the count on Him. . When you look at it a few times those counts were a tad long.... Not excessively but still . ...
That happens to cocky and exhibitionist talkers.
LEGENDARY
The best Wilder vs the worst Fury out of the trilogy and still victorious!!!
This is one of the all time great fights and worth staying up all night here in the UK to watch
If wilder could actually rely on boxing than his right hand he would be phenomenal and actually beat Fury. His power got him there but it’s also the reason he isn’t there anymore
Fuckin hell that slo mo ko looked insane. Furys angry face accompanied by the sweat flying from wilders head, just like wilders ko of ortiz, was savage! You don't realise how hard that was until the slo mo. Fair play.
Fight of the century like a dam Rocky movie 🍿🍿🍿
Twarde chłopy!Szacunek dla obu.
His black ass got whopped
Tyson fury wins but both are Brutes. And fuck that sausage.
What a fight. Although he is a sore loser, I gained a lot of respect for Wilder as a fighter this 3rd fight. He showed a lot of heart and went hard to the very end, even seemed like his hand was broke at one point in the fight.
this one is for CHARLIE Z.
Great footage. Great fight. Two absolutely tough nuts but only one with any grace.
Scrappy as fuck   looked like two drunk bums fighting over a can of special brew   neither one could ever   say their close to Ali
Spark out babyyyyy
damn! just 3 seconds before this video starts Fury calls him a BITCH. Im still looking for it...
yes, record it vertically so we can see the fight and the back of the head of the people watching too.
When wilder goes down face flat on the mat,all his fan boys and sympathisers are down with him too
🇬🇧👊🏼👑
Wilder was froze in time. Sent to the shadow realm. Straight to the upper room. Into the Gulag.
One of the best Heavy weight fights ever!
That fucking crowd soon stopped dancing hahahahah  Liverpool UK
This fight wasn’t supposed happen fury is to much for him
Give it to wilder he put up a fight but my guy got slumped
Losssss squaddd
Thank you for sharing. Amazing angle and very different feeling than on t.v...
Ref caught Wilders head coming down. Thank God cause that's exactly how the BKFC fighter died a few weeks ago. Your knocked out and then your head bounces off the canvas falling full force...that's how people die or end up with brain damage for life. Ref was expecting one of them to go down hard and fast. He was ready and waiting for it. Good ref in my opinion. Little conscious acts like this that save fighters from more than they need. I also like how fighters basically get 15 seconds after a knock down nowadays. Changed after so many deaths in the last few years. They count a little slower and they also ask you to take a few steps after your count to make sure your okay which buys you some time. Back then you had to be up on your feet by 8 seconds and you had to beat the 10 count. Lately, every knockdown I've seen in the past few years, fighters get 15-20 seconds. in this Wilder vs fury 3 fight the ref gave both of them like 20 seconds in-between knockdowns. I like it. Count slow and make them take a few steps after. Those extra seconds and extra steps to get your legs under you are vital! I know most people don't wanna see that and some will even call it cheating or a fight being rigged.... What its really doing is its keeping the fighters safe...that's why the refs do it now. Their not rigged refs. They just don't want anyone to die or get seriously hurt. I saw a video were they said the fight was rigged because Fury was given 15 seconds to recover...watch when Wilder was knocked down and you'll see the ref gave Wilder 20 seconds. Their not cheating. They just don't want anyone to get too hurt... because truth be told they're already taking tons of damage..
crazy fight. regret not buying tickets 😔
Fantastic video. Literally you could hear bombs coming off their boxing gloves.
GYPSY KING FOREVER 🤴
👏👏👏👏👏
95% of yesteryear heavyweights would have beat up both these guys. Their guards are wide open and they seem to lack stamina that the contenders of yesteryears posessed.
Thanks for this video. This is great!
Was every Wilder fan in the world in that crowd?
Say what you want about Wilder but the guy never gave up...he has some serious heart, warrior in my book.
I will remember this fight forever. Thank you Fury and Wilder. Classic Heavyweight battle.
Easy money thank you Tyson Furry🔥
Counted both furys knockdown and he stood up on my 8 count. Slow count can be put to rest.
Two absolute warriors...
nice vid dude....excellent job
👌👌👌👌 love Tyson Fury
👌👌👌👌👌👌
It was a great fight. Got to give it to both of the men.
