This had to be a setup. I mean this looks staged as hell!
Only been an nba fan post bubble so I don’t know everything but how come people say the lakers have 17 banners but nobody talks about Dames bubble mvp. I’m a Celtic fan I don’t like Dame or the lakers but I feel like you can’t count one and not the other. Either the Lakers have 17 banners and Dame has an MVP. Or the Lakers have 16 banners and Dame doesn’t have an MVP🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
The fact that this was recommended to me 2 years after...
This is where the Mavericks get to avenge their 2020 first round playoff loss to the Clippers!!!
What's more embarrassing? Getting postered so hard you fall down, losing by 30 or missing 5 wide open layups in a row? Answer below 👇👇👇👇
Just realized clippers here have 27 at half and suns have 27 at half wtf.
this is hella disrespectful 💀
When you play on rookie difficulty on 2k lmao
I can’t believe OKC topped this epic fail 😂
Omg tmaback for clippers
Who's here after the Mavs blowout the Hornets
1980s highlights 😂
All we needed was a mostly full or completely full crowd and hear the boos in the building that's what happens when EGO and just ring chasing gets you nothing but bad games and just failure
First the biggest gap in points in nba history at half then 7 points away from being the biggest point gap at  home  of all time it’s hard to wacth as a clippers fan
Me playing NBA 2k like:
Lmao
who is here after clippers fried the mavs
Ahhh bring in the tears clips fans
LA belongs to the LAKERS
The Clippers really need to start fearing and respecting Dallas. The Mavs have had their number all season and now up 2-0 heading back to Dallas...WITH FANS in attendance.  It's going to get loud in Dallas
And the Clippers actually wanted Mavs on the playoffs.
This wasn't just a game, it was an absolute massacre
Clips saw this and thought aight we want Dallas in the 1st round
Who else is here bc the Clippers are down 2-0 to Dallas? Reminder... the Clippers threw games to get this team in Round 1. That franchise continues to screw up big time.
Mavericks and Luka came back for that revenge game cuz clippers kicked em out of the playoffs while talkin the most smack
This happening again lmao
"cLiPpeRs wiLL sWeEp thE mAveriCks"
Enjoy being swept 4-0 Mavs 🤣
not good...
Warriors break this record haha
dont worry guys pg just shot a bad shot
Now the warriors is getting smacked like this by the mavs😭
Every time the Clippers scored it was a highlight, so they showed it
"That was a bad win for the Mavs" - Paul George
Can’t believe GSW topped this fail...
I'm here after the Raptors won by 53 against GSW today. Both games are roughly similar in nature ngl.
I’m confused, I thought after the Clips got Kawhi and Pissoff P they were the greatest ever team in the NBA ever
being marked in NBA history......50 plus points
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
At least the Clippers lead 2-0 and had the first points of the game.
Me when I play rookie mode on 2k21 😂
I swear it it’s a Boston game with those green tops
Me: Oh My Goddddd
2020 los clipper mavs win 2021 los clippers mavs win
Way off P back at it again 😂😂😂
“Expect Paul George to carry this team”
Games over but technical foul on every ****a on the clippers for losing by 50 points -djmeechymeech
Pandemic P
Me when im playing my career
77-27 half💀
When I heard the clippers lost by 50 I thought it was a joke..
That's tough for la
& y'all fired Doc why? Clearly it's not Doc I said that even before this happen, he the coach these niggas out there airballin shots up 3-1 the coach can say all he want it's the PLAYERS who gotta go out there & execute, PG out there talkin bout yea I'm playin on a MVP level this year watch as Morris told ESPN after PG's recent good game vs the King's meanwhile why ain't nobody talkin bout this game where he had a measly 15 point game like get the fuck outta hea that's not MVP level, he doin it again & the playoffs ain't even start
Clippers being Clippers 🤷🤷
Just throw the whole team away start fresh
This is a highschool team without Kawhi
Dis sum real 2k21 type shit
Commentator: Expect Paul George to carry this team.......
This what happens when I play my nephew on 2k... he's 5 yall
When you put it on rookie difficulty in 2k
When you play 2k on rookie mode
bruh
0:20 “Expect Paul George to carry the team”
Amazing
Clippers half time score is like a high school score
That was just sorry
Was it a school game
These commentators are the biggest Clipper riding bandwagons I’ve ever heard.
This is quite SAD
Bro how do you choke a 2-0 lead bro smh, only the clippers
Halftime Record have Been broken.. what a shame
George is so blessed with that money
This game looks like USA on the Olympics
The biggest achievement on 2k is gonna be winning with the clippers
Clippers Left There Offense At Home
lol nobody scared of the Clippers. Nuggets came back down 3-1 and Mavs believe they would've beaten Clips w/o KP injury.   Clips got toasted here
You want to become a millionaire? Play basketball. -Paul George
Ok but the first thing i saw was mavs wearing green and me thinking it was Boston vs Clippers
This never gets old.  Clippers playing like they're up 3-1.  HAHAHA!
This is just one of those games where you can imagine James Naismith rolling in his grave on the Clippers.
This doesn’t make no sense right here 🤦🏾‍♂️
#Embarrassing
The Clippers are lucky there were no fans :/
Afk kc c Leonard kya kanser ang laruan ng clippers🤣🤣🤣
Where's the defense
Can anyone tell me what happened to the unicorn?
When you change the sliders on 2K
That's a los blowout XD
Doc rivers wya
Clippers fs the jv team of LA
Yeah doc rivers ruined the clippers not PG
Bro ppl keep telling me the clippers have talent... I have yet to see them be talented at anything other than rolling over and getting obliterated when they go down more than a few points
PG is nothing 🤦🏽‍♂️
Playoff P 😈
I like how they put paul george on the early game but when they saw that the score was unredeemable they take.him.out lol
Why is ty lue even a head coach?
Just blow the team up after this🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Mavs playing like there in a allstar game
I still feel like Kawhi could’ve won one more with Lowry
Doc Rivers: 🤣🤣🤣
this looks like when I play the cpu in myteam😭
Mavs halftime score: my iq Clippers halftime score: my average test grade
Parang fiba🤦gilas vs italy
love to see it
pg brick 13
Easy season for mavs. Sorry clippers maybe next season 😀
NBA 2k on rookie mode here.
They must of forgot to stretch before the game
The clippers have nice jerseys for nothing🤦🏾‍♀️
Tyron Lue boutta get fired bruh 💀
Clippers gonna want a refund from all there players
It's crazy to think even if the Mavs go scoreless in the 2nd half, they're still gonna win by 4 points. LOL
What’s even more amazing is the clippers score the first basket
Bro I made 🤢 face when saw the score
Wearing black on the day they were down 51
2k Rookie difficulty
And  trash  coid  stinky paul  George is bad and sucks
george is bumified and the clipper is wasting their money on him
doc rivers and kawhi carried the team
im tellin yall mavs gonna go high in the playoffs
Bruh Team Nigeria in 2012 put up the same number of points as the Clips with 2 minute fewer quarters against Team USA. TEAM NIGERIA I REMIND YOU! NIGERIA! (I'm Nigerian btw).
The fuck did I just watch???
Maybe the had that corona
The problem when a team depends too much on a star.
The new jerseys are doing the Mavericks pretty good.
Mannnnmm Luka is such an amazing player I really hope he wins a championship one day
I know Clippers have another "Star". I just can't find him. Must be behind the clouds.
Well now tyron lue fired
Real title: Mavericks team highlights
looks like Dallas is playing 2k on pro 😂
God Bless Us All!
Luka Doncic just went Super Saiyan mode
Mavs: Clippers Destroyed! Clippers: I aint gonna hide this beautiful scars. :)
the most embarrasing moment of PG13
Them niggas was playing on hall of fame difficulty
Really 2nd Quarter 62 18 score?
exciting game 77-27 at halftime
PG should have been on the floor the whole time for many reasons. Half the reason they lost so bad.
Thay put that 🪵 wood in them deep.
This looks like me playing 2k against my son when he was 7 😆
Ah yes memories back in 2k17 when one day I decided to become a wuss and put it on rookie mode just to see what happens and the game at halftime was 73-12 against the hornets. Scored 125 point triple double in that game
Josh Richardson is underrated
man watch this make me mad why did sixers trade josh richardson for
The clippers in this game are me when I play 2k online
50 points LEAD
Nicholas Batum, Reggie Jackson and PG all had a chance to play with Bron 🤷🏽‍♂️ I know they feel stupid. And if this isn't enough to trade PG idk wtf the Clippers are thinking.
Flashbacks to my rec league days...      pain.
PG already in Playoff form.
When they said "Expect Paul George to carry this team" I knew they were in trouble.
They don't deserve to play basketball anymore
I thought this was the celtics vs the spurs until halfway through the video
i thought i was watching a dallas mavericks highlights
Suddenly, the Golden State losses don’t look so bad!
Mavs vs Ateneo
The Mavs could have scored 0 points in the second half and still would have won
PG - Pandemic Gaming 💪
Rghmm. My
This looks more like Dallas vs USC tbh
"They can't stop Luka. It's a conga line to the basket"
when u click the video and your first thought  is "is this NETS vs BUCKS? am I the only one?.
Tyrone is getting fired
Haha tambakol
Crazy how luka's number is 77 🤯
The Mavs played like my MASSAGE THERAPY SKILLS   AMAZING!!!
Welcome Back Pandemic P 😀
LOL
Can't believe this man got the max offer biggest scam to the NBA, get this garbage man outta here. BUT mad respect tho he got that bag 💰
Clippers are trash
Clippers niyo pagod na 🤣
Damn blowout
Wait and this is without Kristaps? They gone b a problem in the playoffs they all stay healthy 4 real shit! They getting them back from last playoffs🤦🏾‍♂️ pg-defensive is rated E rn no leadership man I would of fought somebody!
My nephew blew them out the building!! #jalenbrunson
Them green jerseys was distracting them cuz they ugly AF!! But damn lol is this real life!! ?😂  a 50 piece and a Mutha fuckin buttery biscuit!!
The boorish pheasant intralysosomally raise because profit directly scare athwart a scrawny gram. clumsy, common format
Erase the first half, and they didn't do too bad ay.
I m not gonna put the blame on pg this time. They should fucking fire some of those players because of the lack of balls
Where Lou Will?
2020 ain't done for the clippers.
The envious page bailly ignore because sousaphone positionally accept outside a understood pond. ignorant, charming step-mother
6:25 "LukaVision Activated"..
Kawhi will sign with the heat next season
tf?? this is boston celtics vs brooklyn nets
Why did we give George an extension
These pandemic p comnents have me rollin🤣🤣
They beat the Lakers and Nuggets and get blown out by the Mavs? Lmao
We all know the clippers gave them that game straight rigged 😂
This game would be tied if they lost luka
8:41 the bench was LOVIN' this massacre 😂
Mavs: Diving out of bounds Shoots from the bleachers, off the trash can, hits the top of the ceiling, and Swoosh😆😆😂 Another 3pter  Clippers: Wide open 3 with 6feet apart, anddd another Brick 😂🤣
Porzingod ain't even playin tho...
This is like watching USA Vs. China. 😂
Clips here making Nets loss to Hornets looked competitive. lol
These Niggas Ought To Be Ashamed Of Themselves 😭😭😭
Mavs were playing in rookie mode
If only they had Leanard, they would have only lost by 20!
Unfair the mavericks were playing rookie mode 😒 😅
What happened to the virtual screens 🤔
wow
One day without Kawhi and it is a 50 point blowout
DISGUSTING GAME... thats the only thing I can say... 4-33 3PtFG, 26-76 FG.........
The Inglewood Clippers looking like they old self. Straight TRASH!
Clippers only had 13 in the second quarter omg lol
Clippers is the ass of nba really Lakers starters barley play
They did worst than golden state when there against the bucks
Bruh they was playing with them like lil kids they shooting trick shots and shit lol
Clipper got smashed...
If you want to relax, just watch this!  https://youtu.be/dqMHkMmhap0
Pay me 500k for a year with the clippers, I swear I can keep them from loosing by 50 points. IJS
And i thought the warriors are bad
This was a good game by clippers
Wahahahaha
@2:02 The Mario Mushroom sound has me dead...idk y
When the Monstars come and steal your whole team’s talent 😂
This is what a score will look like in 2k
This is abuse
They treated them like high school kids how does this even happen?
J-rich is AMAZING!
Clipper owner got to fire the coach and all players too😂😂 Mav play them high school kids
Who messed with the sliders and put the difficulty on rookie?
The Clippers were missing Kawhi and Morris, but to fall behind by 50 is wild, what’s more is that Dallas was missing KP too lol it’s not like LAC was outmatched, they were just severely outperformed
The sliders were at 100 for the mavs
How embarrassing 😳
The Mavs' bench could get to the playoffs in the Eastern Conference   Oh, and F to pay respects
I ain’t gonna lie the clippers lost like me when I play 2k
Rookie mode on NBA 2K.
A great big lost to mavs with big big lead Lol 🤣🤣🤣
This is completely awful. Last season rolls on, proving that their move to acquire PG-13 and Leonard was more than a mistake, it was a tragic accident!! We're literally watching the L.A. Clippers of the 1990s....wow
I'm glad Hardaway Jr is on a team with a dope environment🤙🏾
PG13 ain't old enough to watch this kind of vicious violence! Get him off the court!
Parang naglalaro lang ako ng NBA2K 😅😅😅 Difficulty:Rookie 😅😅😅
PG should have scored 50pts and Ibaka like 30pts since he made Kawhi not play.
Agua Caliente would’ve been more competitive
This Nigga luka was playing 2k on pro😭😭😭😭
That’s the problem...  only kawhi and PG was allowed for load management ...... it seems the whole team need load management as well...
The first 2 minutes i thought I was watching just mavs highlights
damn those jerseys...  i thought it was the celtic playing the spurs .
“I think internally, we always felt this is not a championship-or-bust year for us”
Imagine the score if they had Kristen porzingis
Mavs coach: should we let up and go easy on them? 🥸 Mark Cuban: push straight down their throats! 😈
Mark Cuban yelling with the team after that dunk was hilarious🤣
But Pandemic P supposed to kick in till the playoffs  🤔
This is Globetrotters shit.
I really hope for the clippers sake that this isn't how they play without Kawhi Leonard, because that is scary, and I'm not even a Clippers fan
Hey random person scrolling down the comments...      Have a wonderful day  :)
Pandemic p has Mutilated
Thought this was Celtics vs Spurs for a sec😭😂
Did lukas 3% go down loven the mid range game though
Lol
Real close one here i thought the clippers were gonna win when they had that 2 point lead in the first half
Since the league are using the same system/style anyways. Why not just remove coaches entirely and just let the players go at it street style. I think nba will be more exciting that way instead of positionless basketball with a lot of people standing on corners shooting 3s.
Pg13 needa try out golf or tennis some sport where he won’t get hurt & can hog the ball😂
This clippers team is trash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1yh4MH6tZw Another Good Highlights MAVERICKS at CLIPPERS
Doc laughing dumb hard rn
I wonder what skip is gonna say now
They really gave pg that big check 🤦🏽‍♂️ bro went on airplane ✈️ mode. No where to be found.
wow what a performance from mavs an astonishing blow out win wooaahh!
That was NAAAASTY.
Serge why did you leave Toronto :(
y’all talkin bout practice? 🤨
Imagine how much bigger the lead would've been if KP was playing lol
George Paul 🗑
You have to show respect and appreciation to kobe taking over a game when shaq would get fouled out o can't play win or loose. He took over
27 points at the half horrible! Horrible performance just horrible!
Did Mavs change their color to green?
Hey their should be a rule 74 to 20 whatever at half game check game called by ref's why play the second half
What a comeback for mavs after being down 2-0 to start the game... 🤣
Mav's weird-åss green uniform confused the fook outta Clippers 🤭
And this is the team that the Lakers should be scared of? This is the team that would have beaten the Lakers in the playoffs? OK.
This was sad
Boban shooting fade aways.  "Oh we're doing that now😳"
STOP THE COUNT!!!
Clippers were so bad they had to show their first quarter free throws as highlights 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How did Tyronn Lue get another head coaching job again? They fired Doc Rivers for him? WTF????
when i play mycareer on pro
Omfg 🤣
STOOOOPPPP THEIR ALREADY DEAAAD 🙈
Paul George's career is officially over
Clippers: We don’t have Kawhi Rn at least we got pandemic p  Basketball Gods: Mavericks go brr brr
4:28 Cuban was big happy😂
Clippers got depth right?
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏🙏💐😀💝💝💝
Mavs 2.0 https://youtu.be/z7jVl-GnZrI
HOF VS ROOKIE
🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
Don’t ever compare clippers to lakers ever again not in history
That 2nd quarter was a “your opponent has left the game” vibe. 😂
This is how many blunts ty loo rolled up              👇🏻
Mavericks could do no wrong and the Clippers couldn't do anything right on this night. Your gonna have nights like this......go Mavs.
Yall relax. We know What will happen in the play offs. Why you think their wearing green ? To represent the Christmas tree but to also show they are all Bark. Tree bark i guess
but kawhi was out they would have done better with him than without him
Boban Marjanovic > Paul George hahahaha
Hi
1:37 “stop i could’ve dropped my crossaint”
Paul george can not guard luka period
thanks  for the preview playoff P! i knew u were always there :)
"expect Paul George to carry this team" Proceeds to lose by 51 pts
felt like i’m watching an exhibition game between mavs and a team from turkey
The only lead the clippers took this game was 0-2
The title is clickbait
Hillary 4 prison
i cant believe the Mavs destroyed the clippers.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
Up by 50 at one point of the game before the half or was it 50 something still a major blowout losing by 40 or 50 points before the Fourth quarter yea they need to make some trades I know it's one game but this one game tells you something, matter of fact tells you alot bout this team.
Lmfaoo where was the clippers at?? They was a no show lmfaoo 💀  I guess they forget to pay the refs
Mavs leading by 50 at the half   Pandemic p: we still in the driver seat
If Kawhi leaves the Clippers, I wouldn’t be surprised if the Clippers keep playing like this
They ran they ass out the gym😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂......go mavs!!!!!
Clippers just defended "Openning night champions" & "Chistmas day champions", so they ...
embarrassing
Damn
5:52 - George Paul, trying to hit the sideboard.  On a serious note though, with just Kawhi being out, the Clippers fell so hard that they scored only 27 points in the first half. The absence of seriousness and respect for the game and themselves is extraordinary from this bunch.
J rich out there ballin
Somehow Lebron James had something to do with this
Luka said this payback from the playoffs
Change the title to Dallas Mavericks vs LA Clippers High School
This look like someone playing 2k on pro lol
miami vs dallas finals
love to see jrich succeed, heat nation is proud of you👍
Luka is a beast!
That's messed up
Bruh
Without Kawaii Leonard this might be a very bad team
Must be nice for George Paul to get that Max while maintaining to play shitty basketball.
This looks like playing NBA 2k with your Create a Player mode in 99 overalls, in Rookie difficulty!🤣🤣🤣
“WNBA vs NBA”
62-18
This proves that they can’t win without Kawhi
Everybody say the clippers are dogs guess NOT
history!
I understand that the Clippers losing by 50 at the half is a record and that all the talk right now is about the Clippers but can we jus acknowledge that Dallas is a really good team?! When KP comes back and he will be fully healthy, Dallas will be a tough out for anyone! You gotta give a lot of credit to Dallas for this blowout instead of blaming it all on the Clippers.
5:52 loooooool
Pg hes in a dark place again after this loss
this is like, mavs vs lac g league
No more Black Lives Matter on court? Oh forgot elections are over....silly me
Clippers choking again this year. This was pathetic. If yall didn't wanna play just say everybody got Covid
https://youtu.be/1IMySMwics4
Give Dallas alot of Credits... they just step on the gas and never look back...
18 on trending
Laker fans right now : hahahahahahahahahahahahahahah lmao
giannis shouldn’t have signed that contract and signed with dallas in the offseason
Dallas played lakers game before that with out AD playing naw no excuses plz they just stink 🤣🤣
Dang dang what just happened 😳
Paul George is all athleticism with 0 IQ. Now that he's not as athletic its all downhill from here. Smh what a terrible contract.
Luka's Mavs vs the "Title Contenders" Cancun Flippers ft. Pandemic P XD
NOW THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE !!!
Y'all know that this is what the USA team used to do to the other countries in the Olympics right
Did the Clippers have ANY highlights in the second quarter? I swear I was watching the same end of the court for like 5 straight minutes 😭
looking like me and my lil brothers 2k games 😭
Bro this one of them high school blowout game😂🤦🏼‍♂️
"They beat us by 50 but they're a bad team." Wayoff P
The worst
All yea clippers going all da way this year good game from them
This the results you get when you got tyrone as a coach you get stepped over frfr smh pathetic kawhi needs to go and george needs to retire 💯💯
I wish we did this in front of the clippers fans...
Clippers is officially a cuckoo's nest. Poor Balmer, money can't buy you a championship.
Clips got their ass whooped
This what it looks like when I play 2k with my lil cousin 💀💀
KhaWHY did Pandemic P Panic so early and its not the playoffs??
khaWHY did yall get SPANKED like that??
mavs wearing green is confusing
And to think that Luka is not even close to his true potential...what a talent.
tambakol kau dyan hahahahha
Now i see why that 2k shot meter the way it is
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Hallelujah!  Repent and turn from sin! Obey God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
Quit being a George and be a Paul
They should've stopped that game at the half
Wow Dallas won by 51!
PG13 team points in the first quarter
What is #51 on the Mavericks doing there?? I thought he got killed by John Wick?
I thought this was a Boston vs Brooklyn game for a second
Bums. No accountability. Leonard is about to get exposed for his lack of leadership, lol.
Paul George should change his number to 19 😭😭😭😭😭😭
2:02 they had to use a made FT as a highlight for the Clips 😅
Happy to see clippers down after smoking Lakers lol 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
best game ever 2020!!!
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
Why is Kwahi always out? Soft mentality
🫁looks to me the clippers took the night off because leonard was out. Didn’t put up much of a fight out the gate. I get he feels it’s no big deal and it probably not,  it’s a game they could of won. If you’re getting blown out by 40 you’re not trying hard enough  All I’m saying is: this isn’t all on PG. they look look casual and out of sync  I’m not saying he’s back to the Pandemic P but he’s on his way if he keeps this up.  Dallas just had one of those nights. They just came off a lost so they was gona come out and Make a statement while KL was out.
So embarrassing for clippers once again smh so much promise for this team there's championship expectations is put d window
So if u break yours nose you can play but if you get elbowed in the mouth you cant
Muuurrrdeerrrrr  - Chris Smoove
I know playing for mark cuban has to be great that man energy is what you want fr tho
Carma hahah 😂😂✌️
Really.smdamnh.i guess Kawhi is the blame cause doc rivers ain't there no more.
Damn this is like a prep team vs a public school lmao
Looks like I’m watching Brooklyn vs Celtics
Patrick Beverly stellar defensive display.
When you play your lil brother in 2k
Another "Fault George"
Gess who's not making the playoffs this year.  😬😬😬
Tf happened to the clippers
Clippers will always be clippers lmao 50 pts straight trash
Paul: hey superise! I was there😬
Imagine Pandemic P carrying the clippers to come back from a 50 point lead, wait. I can't even imagine it lmao
Mavericks is good 😲
This is bad 😲
Ty Lue might get fired if they keep playing like shit
That clippers team is going to get Ty  Lu fired in no time. Let's go Pandemic P...
This is why I’m a kawhi fan and not a clippers fan 🤦‍♂️
Clippers  are not going to NBA finals
Tyron Lue continuing the loser culture the clippers have lived by. No accountability,  waving off this loss as a bad game and giving his players a pass. He now owns the worst half in NBA history, the worst loss in clippers history and one of the worst losses in NBA history. For all the money they are gonna pay Paul George he hasnt shown a willingness to lead by example. All talk and no game. Regardless, as a Laker fan every L the clippers take is fine by me xD
I only came here for the comments 😂  This why I made my last video
*A 51-point lost, tho !?!?* 😳🤯   *EDITED:* Wasn't the Clippers supposed to be like the deepest team in the NBA?
The Mavs didn't even need to score in the 2nd half and they would have STILL WON!!!!!!!
they trashed the clippers goddamn

*Charles Barkley: "That's Turrble"*
Literally 99% won’t see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook county which then led me to loosing my apartment. I'm currently living out of my car which I try and make the best of. I've applied to a bunch of places I'm hoping to get a call back. if anyone could help me with whatever you could bc I'm needing stuff like hand warmers which I stuff my clothes at night when it's cold. Also cheap burgers/fastfood. I know times are tough for everyone these days but if you're able to help me I have paypal user name pay2winlife  If you're unable to help I totally understand  God bless you stay safe 🙏
If I was clips I would trade Paul George for bag of potato chips, someone buy try trash bags for this man.
Dey should sign me atp
Pain
I didn’t know YouTube allowed murder to be posted!
I'm not sleeping on the mavs
As a heat fan I love JRich on this team great addition
Broadcaster: the clippers should definitely win this game  Boban: and I took that personally
Crazy James Harden dropped 44 in a OT thriller for a team he dont even wanna play with .. PG sign a extension and drop 15 in a 51 pt lost 😂😂
PANDEMIC P
Where those the clippers or their G league team 🤣🤣
All Hail Queen James and her Bronsexuals!!!!!!!!
This wasn’t all on Paul George there defense and passing was horrible. You can see the lack/nonexistent of team chemistry.
There's the Paul George I'm use to as a Pacers fan! Is he a great shooter and explosive player? Yes. Is he a leader and the guy to shoot the last shot? NO!
Don't you ever forget the the Clippers are the opening day champions
PLEASE FOLLOW ME ON IG @2696RAMBOS I NEED SUPPORT WITH FOLLOWING IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED
Powell bacc, James Johnson, luka duin da majik triccs, Hardaway caint miss, etc* I c us once again bein a threat n da playoffs* #GoMavs💪🏿
At least score 80. .Lol.lmao. BAHahahahahhaaaaa WayOff P.
Marc cuban's happy
The LAC blew a 2mins of the Highlights on this vid 🤣✌️
The Clippers got so much dawg they forgot they were playing men's basketball
So I take it this is still doc rivers fault🤔
Just proves that PG has no impact in the team. He can easily be replaced. Only Kawai can carry.
8:24 is just beautiful
The clippers just got out hustle good job mavs
Boston Jersey vibes is hitting me when i first saw the Dallas jersey.
I had to look at the score 3X 😬
Yeah remember people said Paul George  got better
Playoff pee
Damn y’all need khawii and trez Harrell that bad huh
Idk why bonanza ain’t starting or playing at least 20-25 mins a night. He’s a game breaker yoooooo🔥🔥
This is absolutely embarrassing 🙈
This is what Paul george officially said after the game: I take full responsibility," said Clippers guard Paul George, who scored 15 points but missed all six of his 3-point attempts. "You know, it's a tough game coming [after] Christmas. I enjoyed my Christmas Day [celebration] yesterday. Today just popped up on me a little too fast. I'll take full ownership for that, coming out and being prepared to play today. Be a different situation come next game, and we will be ready."
*Paul George* They were taking bad shots, Kawhi wasn't available, I didn't have my ps5. When you take that into account technically we were up 3 points.
And this is supposedly the same clippers teams that was favored to win it all last season and everyone had them to beat the Lakers, saying they had a better team than the Lakers. With the so called "Experts". Clippers got they ass whupped.
What the fuck did I just watch
Pandemic P isn't just for Playoffs, Its for the regular season as well!
I came here for the jokes
5:50 Pandemic P imitating Luka and thinking how that was a bad shot
Clippers ain't shit look just like a high school team. Paul George I mean George Paul ain't shit either 🥴
clippers are a joke. their whole offense relies on pg and kawhi to score half the points and the rest of the team to score the rest. they have NOBODY. lakers in 4
The cpu don’t play tht bad
Oh my goodness I've never seen anything like this .
Tambakol😁
Bro if the Mavs didn't score in the entire second half they still would have won lol 😂😂
Wayoff P
Dallas smoke 💨 the clippers what’s man man down
When boban hit his 4 points it’s weird how I even felt the hurt in the hearts of the clippers 🤣 they hurt hurt 🤣 man if they started him they might’ve told boban he can’t play in the league because he don’t need to jump 🤣
Josh Richardson is a fantastic addition to Mavs.
lmao boban just did the standing dunk
A Mavs highlight reel lol
BOBAAAAAAAAAAAN (idc he didn’t play much, it’s BOBAN 😂)
Boban hitting fade away shots with one hand 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥
I thought these were the celticts
Who turned up the maverick sliders and turned down the clippers slider
ATLEAST THEY MADE HISTORY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
I love how the clippers still show off after they score some pints 😂
Doc Rivers be like 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why didn't clippers play?
Beverly f u
Wait is it me looking at the scoreboard wrong or did the clippers actually only score 27 points in they first half
Clippers Go Home
Them Clipps making the kids feel, like they all belong in the NBA. It was the gift of hope.
Guess this is doc's fault.
I don’t want to hear clipper’s fans saying oh Leonard did not play. That’s no excuse losing by more than 50.
IT was destiny. The scored 27 on the 27th
Kawi lang malakas
I love how the commentator laughed at 5:00, hahaha
This game might be  candidate for the biggest L of this season. Sheesh!😂
Mama, there goes those Flippers🤣😂🤣
Checking title every 10 seconds to see if I'm watching Celtics vs. Nets
0:38 did Luka really cry after that High Five? Or is his arm injured?
Is Lou even playing? Where’s Beverly? I guess it’s just one game but dayuum!
Str8 to the comments
😎
PG13: That's a bad game.
Paul George puts the pa in overpaid !
They biting on every fake
I thought Mavericks is Celtics😂
Paul George you need to fire your trainer...damn up by 50 first half? Damn
I love this game 💕😂😂😂
2020 is about to close out,  everyone's here who saw this comment will have an incredible year,  Success is coming your way in 2021 🙏 💯
2020 not done yet for the clips
Guys cut some slack on pg kawhi wanst even playing today
Come on!!! Be fair to this loser!!! I hate your comments!!! What if there was a 50 lead after the half?????? It can happen every 50yrs you know?!!!  Dont judge this loser based on a single game. Come on! You know better than that!
Clippers just got lucky in the 1st rnd of 2020 playoffs, KP got injured and also with the help of nba officials.😅
Ahhh little brother still can't fight the battles that big bro can. And all is right in the world.
What a smack down
THAT LAUGH @ 5:00 😂😂 EVENTHOUGH.... IT'S THE LACLIPS COMMENTATORS 😂😂 #CHOKES 😂😂
In the 2nd half the nba shold have called it a day
Should we just call it a year since we can already see pandemic p x playoff p happening form a mist
That laugh at 4:59 tho HAHA
Kawhi will be bouncing soon enough and this will be the new normal for the Clippers
Josh Richardson was on fire too 🔥
Unbelievable. Clippers had first quarter points going into the third quarter.
As a new basketball watcher/fan, it's so confusing at first when the teams jerseys are just a completely different color than their color on the scorebox.
49 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂💀💀
Tambak
just a reminder of what a Clippers team without Kawhi looks like.
brug its like playing 2k with your younger  brother😂😂😂
Mavs without Porzingis=> STILL GOOD Clippers aka "chokers" with  PANDEMIC P and without Kawhi => TRASH🚮.😜
Keep the same energy yaul have 4 lakers. That's why yaul cant an wont win anything
I don't wanna hear nothing else about no damn Clippers 😂 biggest halftime ass whooping in history 😭
The worst score of 2nd quarter of all time. Another achievement for Clippers hahaha
Tyrone Lue and Pandemic P? What could go wrong.....
#LifeStarr: and these clips are the biggest threat to the Lakers in the west Stephen A.???
I remember looking at the NBA website and thought I saw a glitch when I saw that the Mavs were up 62-18. Then I saw it was not a glitch....what a strange game.
No khawi no problem😂🤣
Then they all clap hands at the end of the game like nothing happened
PG lowlights smh https://youtu.be/OFRLAP0JvUs
Luke Kennard shooting🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it possible for a coach to throw in the towel whn a team is being violated and are completely helpless? I’m asking for a friend🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Josh Richardson for Seth and the other guys? Looking real wise right now.
The tangible thomas thessaly wreck because stew summarily satisfy off a deserted daisy. lopsided, smart coin
NBA felt so bad about the Clippers that they show them hitting a free throw at 2:01 for points.
CANCUN CHOKERS JUST MADE A HISTORY LAST NIGHT!📣
I can’t wait to watch skip and Shannon 😂
Damn this is embarrassing lol😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mavs did not need to score in the 2nd half to win😂
Whats crazy is that I dont thinn the Clippers even called a single timeout in the first quarter even though they were down by 20+
I'm gonna finally admit it, the Clippers are fucking overrated
Mavericks must had the sliders On😂😂
I walked in on the score in the middle of the third quarter and I thought my cousin was playing 2k automatically
This is me playing on rookie difficulty
Can’t wait to see skip bayless excuses for this game
Team of stars and they still ain't shit without Kahwi
Good god the clippers offense was pitiful to watch... no ball movement. No off ball movement. Shitty screens. Jesus that was painful
Ion think Rick liked what pandemic p said about doc 😆
Pandemic P: " IM BACK " 😤
This video gonna be legendary
HAHAHAHAHAHA PG poor guard
Pandemic Pee
Dallas playing on Rookie
Good thing fans weren't at this game lol
Man...yall are stupid if you really thought the richardson trade wasnt in favor of dallas.
George after blowout:" its not that big of a deal"  dude just got crushed by 51 points.
Super lupet ng dallas halos lahat umiiskor
Wasn't Pauline PAID hundreds of millions extension contract to play awesomely great for today !
Even a single free throw is a highlight for the clippers in this game hahahahaha
@ 7:11 That's exactly it. The gulf between these two teams, culture-wise, is the selfless play of the Mavs. I'm not sure if Luka ever brings home a championship in Dallas, but what he's helped build there is reminiscent of Russell, Magic, Duncan... players who put success before stats, and build their reputations on how they interact with their teammates. It's a joy to watch, and it's basketball at it's purest.
where playoff P at again? all them ballhogs and no TEAM lmao
Did you guys see rdcworld’s skit on this? That shot had me dying bruh!
It has to be completely humiliating to make it to the NBA and have a guy get an offensive rebound and dunk over you without jumping.
WHO CARES!  Nobody is watching the live broadcast!  Even less care about watching a 'highlight' clip.  When the NBA loses its wokeness it might get its fans back NOT BEFORE!  Speak Truth to Lies....Only watched 1 second of this trash.
Joker from The Dark Knight to Past the Blame P: "What happened, did your balls fall off?" 😕
Lakers and clippers played on the same day in staples. How the hell dud they change the floor that fast?
Postpartum P: "I'm not James Harden" 😐
Now I know Kawhi is hurt, but yall had nothing for the Mavs......nothing???? Flippers a 4th seed at best this year lol
pandemic ppppppppppppppp
this is like an olympic game. Dreamteam vs mexico
@lisa atkins its a japanese skin bleaching lotion. It says in the article the african american celebrities in hollywood use it and it changes their skin color from brown to light skinned mixed race,they dont admit it though https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product  i guess nobody will admit to using skin lightening products they want people to think they are naturally light skinned.
PANDEMIC P ----- it was my teamates fault we lost
When are they going to sub Mark Cuban in?
Hof Difficulty.
Its upsetting!  Good thing I didn’t watch the whole game i might swear again in front of the TV !  Anyway ! Stop bashing PG his not the only one player in the clippers ! 🤭😬😬😬
This guaranteed everyone is dependent on kawhi to help them kawhi can't even get mvp with such a trash team
“Some wildin in the first half”😭😭
Man these are not nba players these. Are bums
This is the new strain of Pandemic P
cHaMpiOnsHiP tEaM
luka amazing performance 2021
When name is only a hype....this is it folks
Idiot excuses P
USA vs Malaysia
WOW!!!
WAHAHAHA THE ANNOUNCER IS GETTING CRAZY TO THIS GAME... THE LEAD IS 50.. MOST TOUGHEST LEAD IN NBA HISTORY 🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅
Ty Lue we need answers..
Another fantastic game from Way Off P and the LA Floppers lol
Well they cut it down to 40 in the 3rd🤷🏾‍♂️
Just imagine getting paid millions of dollars to just stand there and be trash
Shannon Sharpe about to get on skip today 😂
whats clippers excuse? no Kawhi? hahaha... like if Kawhi will score 50 pts in a game... hahaha and by the way Pandemic P choose that game to show how he really is.... hahaha... its not yet playoffs but he appeared already... hahaha
Who's the Dallas player wearing ZERO jersey??? He's FAST and also Got shooting.. DAMN this Team is quite an improvement.
Mavs vs  elementary player 😂
And they’re back 👌
Mavericks clips the Clippres 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pinulbos ang clippers na dinurog ng lakers.. hahaha.. shame to you clippers.
Paul George is gonna blame Ty Lue for not using him properly
That Clippers 10-0 run in the 3rd though...
Wow, Clippers follow up the ending to last season by participating in the least competitive NBA game of all time. Mavericks just keep killing them!
Wow, Clippers follow up the ending to last season by participating in the least competitive NBA game of all time. Mavericks just keep killing them
This is very biased... they showed way more highlights for the Mavericks.
Its the 80s. Clippers and Warriors are trash while Lakers just won a chip.
PG: I was in a dark place... again.
This has the be the most Paul George and clippers thing ever. "Dude said expect Paul George to carry this team" down by 60 and lost by 50 lmao Wouldn't be any different if they had Kawhi blew a 3-1 lead Leonard
Thought I clicked Celtics Nets I’m like wtf 🤣 jerseys had me gone
This season the Clippers biggest influence is the Knicks.
The lucky segment advisably boil because mass namely dream absent a vague niece. utopian, periodic paint
And this is why they need a floor general. Yes, they're good offensive players individually but it's nothing when they can't get their rhythm.
They're not often having a great cooperation inside the court.
Mavs just have mote scorers younger quicker . going need k-town t p be healthy to beat them. Definitely need another scorer on tram whos volume threat with the big 2 .   Luka better turn pg
I don't care what the situation is....No NBA TEAM should be getting 50-balled.
Even with Kawhi, I would have still think the Mavs beats them by 30.
what is going on with clippers man? blow hot n cold-at the same time!
"We're still on the driver seat"  - George Paul
PG should’ve stayed his ass in Indiana and try to build there. After he left his game hasn’t been the same.
0:20 that didn’t age well😂😂😭😭
No challenge
🤣🤣🤣🤣
If this have a fans  Fans go to EXIT
So kawhi left toronto for this?  He shouldnt have left haha. He even took Ibaka with him..
The mavs didn't have to score a point in the second half. Lol
Boiiiii wth is this
I guess TyRonn Lue is going to loose his job again 😁
Flippers doing flip things this team is straight ass cheeks 🤣🤣 Dallas look like they were going against a high school team no 🧢
NBA 2k with player vs. CPU rookie difficulty
Wat happend to you coach no adjusment of defences
Way to carry your team when your buddy is out PG 🥴🤣
How you top last year's collapse? You lose by 50! They consider themselves a championship team?! This is one of the worst loses in NBA history - considering the fact that this Clippers team is on the short list to win it all. This was EMBARRASSING!
Marjanovic dunks without jumping 😂😂😂
You see, we were winning by a little, and then all of a sudden we were losing by a lot. This is the most fraudulent playing by the Mavs in the history of basketball! They should've stopped the count when we were winning.
The clippers gone clip
When you play sweats in the REC on 2K with randoms.
CLIPPER'S got SPANKED!!!!😩
Difficulty: Rookie
When you increase user sliders to 100
Lol
Dapat pinasok nila si JuneMar
Kawhi: “I WAS a fun guy”
Can't wait for skip to blame this gigantic L on Lebron somehow
PG13....SA KANYA NA NAMAN ANG SISI.... NBA RECORD.....biggest half margin..... ...maliwanag.....inconsistent si PG13.... matinde ang revenge ng mavs tapos na tambakan din ng lakers..
Trashed 🤣🤣
Lakers living in the head of the flippers rent free.
Sadly the whole team choked
😂😂 WOOOW 😳
Chinese players are so unpredictable
Well Kawhi didn't play so, I look at this game differently.
It kinda felt like I was playing 2k with my lil brother watching the game😂😂😂
Hope he has a good year this year gets a lot of unnessesary hate. People who dont play sports wont understand how hard it is physically and mentally to get over the kind of injury PG went through.
Another indication, PG cannot handle pressure.  Kawhi goes out, need PG to step up, Clips get blowed out by 40.  Can't blame Doc for this one.
the Mavericks finally played some of their black players, instead of that slow 90s Utah Jazz stuff.
Damn Idk the clippers been taking some hard Ls lately but it happens but damn 77-27 like damn
The slippers 😎
Clippers in playoff form early.
Luka in the bag
30-11 and playoff PEE HAD 9 POINTS the rest of his team had 2
7:27 -- child's play...
The title should be how Mavs demolished clippers
This clippers right here reminds me of my first time playing 2k hall of fame, didn't know how to d and make plays
200 mil contract player smh
Skip bayless: its because they lost danuel howse. Oh wait.... odds makers.... oh wait.....😂😂😂😂
Clippers need 2 relocate asap
The ubiquitous element phytochemically decay because heaven biologically bathe pace a ripe appliance. sophisticated, annoying emery
Is Ibaka out too
Im not even hatin. But as a professional. For the kinda money theyre making. Being blown out by 50 at the half is unexceptable. Thats your profession. Thats flat out embarassing and a disgrace.
Boby with the No jump dunk 👀
I feel the clippers need divine intervention right now!😜😂
The game was over before halftime...
Paul George: I blame Santa Claus,Kawhi, Ibaka, and Doc Rivers. Everyone but ME
Dallas vs AI "rookie" 🤣🤣
Paul George probably was like “idc I still scored 15 points”
No Kawhi No Win
I guess the Clippers only built to beat the Lakers. Lmao.
8:49

Looks like this game highlight is just for the Dallas Mavericks.
The players are exposing TY LUE
what could tyron have possibly told these guys in the 2nd quarter 😭😭😭😭😭
Gotta give props to frank vogel for making pandemic p look good with the pacers.
I'm just waiting on how Skip will defend these Clippers after this.
ohhhhhmmmmmmyyyyyygggghhhaaaddddddd!!!!! is this the the big ass mouth clippers so assuming to get past the lakers for the nba finals????? like wtf broo, in your dreams!!!!!!!!!!
Sheesh what the hell did I just watch 😂
Blame Doc Rivers for the way Pandemic P was used tonight!
we had more points in our lower elem ball game
(Gg
kawhi should have stayed in toronto.
😂😂😂😂💀💀
Paul choke🤔
Pat Beverley is trash
Wtf just happened!!? This was so disgusting
pg is 💩
Dream Team vs Angola
When you put your 2k game on rookie
It’s the announcer saying “expect Paul George to carry this team” for me😂😂😂
Usa vs Ph .
Why the Mavericks trying to be the Celtics with that color?
Got 21’d in the first quarter 😭
This game has 1 million views already 😅 it's usually not that many if you consistently watch NBA highlights
Imagine when kp and wcs on the floor at the same damn time 😮😬😈
is this the full game highlights or MAVS HIGHLIGHTS??
The Clippers aren't a threat, George proved he didn't deserve that money.
Did steve balmer watch this?
no body: Absolutely no one: The depths of the ocean: The vast space of the universe: Matt Damon: Paul George: Well they made bad shots.
Paul George will probably say: "The coach didn't have me on the right spots on the floor"  😂😂 Excuses P
Can we stop saying Paul George is a superstar PLEASE  p.s  I used to be a PG fan when he was with the pacers but dude is wack
LA Clippers Bad Chemistry = Worst Loss in Clippers Franchise History!!
No Kawhi + Pandemic P mode 😂🤣😂🤣
Pandemic P is back oh no
2020 aint over yet lmao
I thought it's boston vs spurs game... 😅😅😅
51 points! 😬
*They say Curry can't carry a team?? Put Pg13 on that list **#ProppaMusic*
*Clippers nowhere near Lakers level.. truthfully clippers look like the clippers again **#ProppaMusic*
When the CPU cheats in NBA 2K:
Clippers are just load managing their scoring.
Came here specifically for the jokes did not disappoint 💀
6:28 definition of a wide open shot
chris smoove vs rookie difficulty
Whenever any type of pressure situation George Paul will fold .
wish barea was still playing during this season I'm a warriors fan but this was sick and looking forward to Luka this season
When your high school plays the worst team in the division.
How can the clippers beat the lakers then lose by 51 points to the mavs🙄🙄🙄
Yeah it was really Doc 😂😂
Smh 7:25 that’s toying with them saying we’re better than them
They were down by 20 and staples played the Mario power-up sound. Hahaha, it must have been a tech for the Lakers trolling them.
This should never happen in a nba game . The loss of 1 player should now affect a team like this . This  crazy  George Paul Got 200 mill  and ain’t worth 5 cents .
That clippers logo is the worst in sports history. IMO
Only 21 + year olds must see this
Where the flippers fans at? Who were noisy about beating the lakers. 🤣
7:12 when a euro player show you why it’s a euro step
Clippers looking so unstoppable this year.
PG: "That was a bad game"
Lakers won by 36 while having AD out 😂
Pat Bev “ ay ayy ayyy where y’all going? “ 😭😂😂😂
6:46 tf
This shit ain’t pg-13 this is rated r
Pandemic P just mutated
I can say the ball is circle. 🏀
I thought this was MAVS vs CLIPPERS HIGHLIGHTS? Where's the Clippers?
Even if kawhi was in he wouldn’t have done shit. This team is ass. Fuck the clippers
Luka don’t care if he up 30 he want his foul if he gets hit ..lmao love how he lets the refs know every time with a semi tantrum
Clippers making excuses that kawhi ain't there , Mavs are without Kristoff and plus they dont have any 200$ mill player presently playing like crap
This video should be called mavericks highlights and the clippers are just there
If Paul George the best player on your team good luck bruh
- Last year, clips only showed up for the Lakers  - This year they're showing up for the Lakers and Nuggets  - 28 years from now they'll show up for the other 28 teams to win... Maybe  How can a team that lost BY 50 be a threat? I know it's only game 3, but this really speaks to their mentality on how they don't show up except for who they perceive to be tough teams.
Pathetic p
When will nba teams realize that tyrron lue can't coach? Jesus.
Backboard P is a number three, they better try and get a number two real quick.
Paul George best friend George Paul is back guys...bit early have to say.
Hahaha Wayoff P for the lose. No Kawhi. Big problem
This game looked like the '92 Dream Team playing against Angola.
Wall George
Pandemic P is back....
Hahaha Tye Lue getting fired! Paul George looking bad. Can things get any worse for the clippers 😅
Luka Skywalker ~ FORCE CHOKED THE WHOLE CLIPPER TEAM!
Thats bad Game
if doc were coaching they would have lost by 100
Shaq be like, "This doesnt matter, I've seen it before."
Hey don’t worry the Clippers did get a PS5 PS5 ma Mhen 🤣🤣🤣 dang. Clippers got beat up by 50 points in the half while the Lakers are crashing the T wolves by more than 30 plus ...well Karma went back with this foul mouth Beverly!!!😆😆😆 Lakers repeat ‼️
Way off P 😂👌
Nice 😂
Was kahwi hurt?
Ty lue is trash, Lebron made him look good in Cleveland.
Worst game for the clippers. Lots of turnovers. Poor defense. Poor plays. So many forced shots.
I guess claw shouldn't have left toronto huh😕............
Clips are the favorites to win the title.
The Mavs jerseys may look ugly as hell but they got some good players. 😂
Dallas should had let the waterboy play im the 4th quarter 😂😂 Shit maybe he should had played for the Clippers to help them too
Jalen Brunson is such a no nonsense player. He'll be scarier when he reaches his prime.
What a lead. You're like playing 2k
The laugh dude did after he said 60 to 18😂🤣🤣🤣
Clippers Covid. Second Wave😂
The difference between team ball and one on ones all game. The Mavericks flow was crazy
LAC blew a 2 point lead
Mavs looked like they were literally TOYING with the Clippers in this game wow playground mode
This game was a perfect combination of a team hitting every shot vs. a team who couldn't buy a bucket. It's glorious.
So this team is going to win championship???? Hornets has better chance
MAVERICKS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | December 27, 2020
Kobe scored 81 points by himself and scored 73 points as a whole team..
How did the Mavericks lose a point between the first and second quarter? Or was it just a broadcast error?
I remember kids last year riding on the clippers saying they'll beat them lakers and win the championship. When they saw this They went missing...
Searching for "Clippers highlight against Mavs" but found error 404.
Since when did the Cowboys score so much
Mavericks vs barangay
The only way to match up with Lakers this playoffs is to be the 8th seed, 7th seed tops (incase Lakers drop to 2nd)  Rest well Kawhi
Like this for a LMFAO reaction on the clippers
By the way kawhi had said it he might not stay lol
Man the Mavs really murdered the Flippers in this game. 😂
I think clippers are practice on there ps5
9 minutes of highlights? h u h
Qwreyfyfrdtdugykgummijlj ipugydwtsgrr
thought it was Dallas highlights lol
just a pre season no kawhi
You lose your star and just lose your wits, huh.. let’s the clippers lucky season begin lol
The longer paul George hair get the worst he play
DALLAS Mavericks 124 vs 73 LOS ANGELES Clippers
Paul goerge: I am gonna make everyone stop making memes on me Luka: ARE YOU REALLY SURE?
PG 13% Way off P Pandemic P
I’ll say this again doc rivers and ty lue are the same shit brother,they both got one ring with stack team it wasn’t because  they were good coaches that’s just facts
Westbrook was DEFINITELY right about Pat Bev
Tf is this shit 😂
Putting Pandemic P at 4 and not starting Morris lol
I can’t wait for the mental health excuse
1:36 Someone already knew the Clippers gonna blow this up. lmao
😂😂😂😂😂💀
Wayoff P is back, baby!!
Celtics looking like world beaters against the clippers
What the hell did I just watch. Smfh🤦‍♂️
8:40 up by 57 points😂 the clippers probably went to that same strip club that James Harden got caught on that video 😂
Notice the midrange game from Luka.. that’s not something he’s ever pulled from his bag since he’s been in the league. Looks unstoppable
i think dis clippers team is from cba🤣🤣
Flippers fans?
Pandemic George back at it again! 🔥🔥🔥
Skip don’t even need to come into work tomorrow 🤣 this game so damn embarrassing I keep coming back to comment shit just don’t sit well with me 😭🤣 high schoolers played better than thisssss even peewee league!
Out of all the things in the world I could say all I can think of right now is how skip is gonna somehow bring up Lebron in explaining this lose by the clippers🤦‍♂️
The Mavs are mad dude. Did everyone forget a few months ago where they almost made it to conference semis, but got gangbanged by Injuries and techs.
Kawhi gets hurt and the whole damn team goes load management 🙃..sir somebody got to play 🤣🥴..
CLIPPERS NIGHTMARE! HAHAHAHA 🗑
Pandemic “New Strain” P
Bruh the clippers got done so bad 🤣 like dawg wtf was that !!! 62-18 in the 2nd Quarter bruh 🥴 did Mfs not know it was a game today or what ?
That was completely pathetic
Play "off" P: All the shots they took were bad shots man
pg says i will get my revenge on my ps5
Damn 51 points that's crazy. Mavs was on point.  Good game
Looks like PLayoff Pete showed up.
Josh Richardson got the game-winning FG at  6:08 lol
This 51 point loss is CLEARLY Doc Rivers' fault.
I thought the 62-18 numbers at 5:13 was Dallas's win-loss record and then realized that regular season is just starting
Love the throwback green uniforms, and this score is 2K-ish where you're in a zone just dominating the cpu. Never thought I'd see a score like that in a real life game.
Me playing nba mobile with rookie gameplay mode
2:33 21 skunk pass the controller..
Looks like the Clippers are still obsessed with besting the Warriors, even in the mediocrity department.
So Kawhi get out of commission and the Clippers forgot to play basketball. 13 points in the first quarter.
When Kawhi underwent "load management" for the Spurs or Craptors, they didn't lose by 50.
Mavens vs Aau basketball team
And this is why no one should clown Lebron at all, look at this joke of a “coach”, he literally only has one scheme and that’s it, lebron legit coached the team
2007 clippers back in action.
just rename this to mavericks highlights
idc what anybody says that was a bad game
Clippers are the worst team ever. 😤
Oh my gosh that was brutal.
Paul George: " it's Doc Rivers' fault."
The Dallas Celtics? Or the Boston Mavericks?
Deum the clippers got slaugther by the mavs by 51 points it's crazy.... No porsingis no problome no kawaii huge problem for the clippers.
The clippers are hot garbage.
Thanks for the Mavericks Highlights lmao
Pandemic P at it again 👏👏👏👏👏🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
a few breaks here and there and they would have only lost by 47
How about that. Clippers overhyped the first 2 games. Then now.
Am i seeing right? I can only see 1 basketball ring.
No kawhi.  No wins for clippers
What's wrong here?
Wtff I just Skipped to the 75% of the highlight and then the score was 39-83
Thank god they have pg
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It kinda bothers me that at first glance I thought I was about to watch Celtics vs Spurs.
I cant wait to see what's Skip Bayless gonna say on Undisputed haha
Wayyyyyyoff P!!!!!!!!!!!
Stii doc rivers fault??
And this was without Porzingis on Mavs, so both teams were without one of their top 2 players. Clippers are really worrying without Kawhi on both ends of the floor
Clippers....Where memes happen.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
what did i just watch
PG 13% I mean , way off P I mean PG 13 had a pretty bad game
2 heat players on Mavs.
Clippers doing amazing things again.
6:20 When the Clippers managed to close the gap to 40 points, I thought they had a chance...oh well 😆
LMAO at the 2nd half the MAVS should've called their G- League Team
Defense has left the chat....
This just shows how much Kawhi impacts his team. If he's not present, his whole team looks like not nba players.
So embarrassing for Paul George his legacy is at stake here
Luka playing like Lebron
No matter who Marvs played today they would've still won. Their shots kept falling in.
It’s ok to lose every once in a while but 51 points is disappointing.
kawhi is faking another injury for the remainder of his contract after his pandemic P antiques in this game 🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🔟
Man why they don’t just press start and quit🤦‍♂️
Pfizer P is lit 🔥🔥🔥
so satisfying
Now someone tell SAS that's why ty lue was not even considered for Nets head coaching job. Kyrie knows what's up. Ty lue ise T R A S H
Skip Bayless gonna have some numbers that tell you the clippers actually had the better game
Bruh
There’s a reason why montrez Harrell left man 🤦🏿‍♂️
I can’t wait to watch oprahside
Pandemic P Blames it on Christmas 🎄😂😂
kawhi is faking another injury for the remainder of his contract after his pandemic P antiques in this game 🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🔟
Rookie Difficulty in real life. 😭🤣
RegularSeason P, MVP mode activation malfunction.
clippers stay getting clipped!!! 🤣🤣🤣
That was Ugly...🥴
Did the clippers play today?
New nba history record broke by LA clippers..hahaha
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while
LMFAOOOOOO
meanwhile the lakers tonight, No AD, No Problem bwahahahahaha
Pandemic P...
I thought the clippers are supposed to be full of "dogs"
Clippers intend on winning the WNBA title this year. Hang that banner already! Bank on it!!!
"That's a bad injury" - PG13 to Kawhi after the game
It's like playing 2k with your adult cousin in Christmas Day & show you no mercy HAHAHA 🤣 you are like "i hope, i can go to settings and customise 3pt shoot to 100% so i can lower the gap" and after that someone.. said watch this Ty Lue drop by A.I its like you earlier! Hahahahahahahahaha 🤣🤣
1st quarter ends - Mavs at 37 pts 2nd quarter begins - Mavs at 36 pts  Didnt watch the game, someone care to explain?
Lol la our way guess which team won by 40 and which team lost by 50
Shannon Sharpe already on his way to Undisputed...he gonna have a field day with SKIUUUP Flipper Bayless tomorrow.
Doc Rivers is laughing his ass off somewhere
*Nets missed net* *76ers got sixed* *Clippers got clipped* *Bucks got Buckshot*
I can’t wait till Chris smoove  talk about this game 🤣🤣
This is what happen of you set the difficulty into rookie in the 2k
So the Clippers beat the Lakers but the Lakers beat the Mavericks and the Mavericks beat the clippers?? Looks like the Mavericks are the Denver nuggets now
Pandemic p. Corona 13 what’s going on
Yeah Kawhi is packing his bags 🎒
I don't even think Khawi would have helped. That was a a complete and total beatdown
refs made bad calls
The only reason they lost by 50 is because they didn't use paul George correctly. They had him out there looking like ray Allen
Let see how Paul George blames this one on Ty Lue !!
Lol smh. Dallas didn’t want to lose 3 in a row and they showed that but Damn man just disrespectful.
It don't matter because the Clippers will face whoever in the Western Conference Final
Congrats Clippers for breaking a new record!
Doc Rivers received a call tonight in Philly after the game and got fired again!
Man the mavs were mad losing the past 2 games. They came in with authority.
Just letting you guys know that Paul George deadass said in his postgame interview that he takes full responsibility for this, but also that he celebrated his Christmas the day before and that gameday came up quick on him (paraphrasing). You can’t make this shit up.
just like playing nba 2k on pro mode vs ai 😂😂
Lmaooooooo Kobe is responsible for dropping 81 on ty lue head the most points after like wilt chamberlain now he’s got the highest point deficit loss in shot clock history.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂he got bad luck
3:20 the mavs have 37 pts 3:25 they only have 36
Clippers probably would be UNSTOPPABLE if every team wore PURPLE AND GOLD😂😂😂
😳
I think kawhi can make 52😜
When you first play nba 2k21!!!!!!!
this proves that it’s not Doc Rivers fault they tanking
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣flippers🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
And Mark Cuban was there?!? DAMN
I dont care what happened in the playoffs last season but luka OWNS the clippers.
lol with that score it's like watching a FIBA game
Wtf only 39pts in the 3rd?wtf
This is more like a Dallas Mavericks highlights vs LA Clippers lol HAAHAHHHAHAH
And they did it without KP.  Whoa.
Nice video highlights by Team USA vs Team Angola right here.
A disgrace to staples center!
WTF !!??? Choke????
Mavs schooled Clips like it was a videogame or something.  Without Kawhi they are a lameduck team, for real.
WAYYOFF P BABA BACK AT IT
Clippers are LOSERS
"Playoff P" no... "Precision P" nope.. "Overpaid P"... yea, that sounds about right! 🤣
60-18 whaaaat 🤒🤒🤕🤕 c'mon
Clippers is consistent in choking... its like amateur vs pro..27-77 omg..
cant wait to see PG interview after game  😂
wtf PG 15 points? Pandemic P at it again
The score was legit 18-62 in the 2nd qtr 💀
CLIPPERS MAKES HISTORY AGAIN..
No look pass 8:27. Thats absurd
im a sixers fan and i feel like shit because the cavs waxed the floor with em tonight, but damn... this was ridiculous... im sitting thinking now that at least im not a clippers fan..  lmao!
Doc Rivers sleeping good tonight.. 😴😂
Daddy ... Are the Clippers TRASH LOL
Pandemic P back already? Didn’t expect that til playoffs
Pros vs. Joes
Me playing 2k and gets a 40 points lead
Remind me again why every single NBA media member still thinks the Clippers are a top 2 team? They have no playmakers at all. Cant win a title by forcing a ton of difficult shots out of isolation, it's just not good offense.
I didn't score more points because that's not my style of the game.                                    - Paul George
Lol...clippers
This makes me nostalgic for the Loy Vaught, Lamont Murray Clippers. They would only lose by 25.
You know what i take it back luka WILL win mvp
Unk better give Skip the business tomorrow 🤣 I wanna see Shannon throwing fire at Skip
So load management season starts earlier and earlier every year.
highschool games be like
🦁 60- 18 in 2k21, I'm quitting and sending hateful text  messages to my opponent.
Props to the NBA employee that had to find Clippers highlights for this
When you play rookie in 2k games
MVP luka
Is this NBA 2K22? Super Extreme realistic graphics 🤣
Do you realise that if Dallas didn't shoot a single shot in the whole 2nd half, they still would have won by 4? 🤦🏻‍♀️
Announcer: “expect Paul George to try and carry this team” LOL
Clippers must recruit Lebron to win.... Kahwiless Clips is Slippers... feel sad for them.... Go Lakers....   Ibaka: damn should sign with Lakers grrr paul george: damn this team is cursed... ahhemm... why they blame me? Kahwai: ahhhh hhhaaa hhhhaa awwwwww
Cooking show
Luka took it personal
People talkin about Pandemic P    Ty lue: What about me? 😢
Now that I think about it, it’s actually pretty insane how many shots the clippers missed, like everything that could’ve gone wrong did go wrong
Can’t wait for djmeechymeechy new video on this
I’m not a fan of either team but this was hard to watch
1:44 travel
Mavs already in playoff mode
Why would I watch the mavs just shoot around?
true story: elementary school trip to a clips game, got home, fam asked how was the game, I said, "omg, the nachos were amazing!"
what with confusing jerseys
Looks like Celtics vs Spurs
The last time I saw a team get beat this bad it was a girls college team
Waiting for smoove’s reaction on this lol.
I thought the Mavs are playin against a highschool team. 😂
Clippers should be relegated to the G-League
Mavs halftime score: 77 Clippers final score: 73   🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
It's like team usa vs china in fiba
Doc rivers rubbing his hands like birdman as we speak
It’s surreal to see an NBA team only have 27 at the half; it’s even crazier that it’s a team with the amount of talent the Clippers have.
Kawhi is the team, no debate
51 point blow out, are u kidding me
How much time I watch this match...its not even getting bored...thanks to the pandemic god
I feel bad for any sales rep that works for the clippers. How do you market this product??
boban marjanovic only used 1 hand😂
Luka and j rich ballin 😭🔥 love to see it
I'm a fun of clippers . The fck
This is the 2020 - 2021 Clippers? why are they playing like the 2000's clippers Hahahaha
Hahahaha choked 😂
kawhi should leave this team really ain't all that w/o him
Pandemic P showin em who's the real Pandemic Goat 💪
Yup...it was Doc's fault
All cause 1 man didn’t play ?🤦‍♂️
Clippers playing like they're perpetually up 3-1
Fcking embarrassing.
Highlights have more bricks than made shots
Is this a domination game with the clippers?
Leonard and George are the most overrated players in the league. Kawhi is a diva who only has rings, because of the great teams and coaches he has been surrounded by and Paul George is a choke artist who takes a mental vacation as soon as his team needs him to step up. I feel bad for clippers fans cus they sure as hell ain't gonna win a ring anytime soon.
CLIPPERS : ELIMINATE LAKERS !!! ELIMINATE LAKERS !!! ... TARGET ERROR , TARGET ERROR !!!
At least he said "I take full responsibility for this loss".
and then add Porzingis LMAO
So close
I don’t care what anyone says, that was a bad win..
For those saying "Doc is somewhere smiling" the 76ers got anally punctured by the Cavs hush that talk
That didn't take too long for the Clippers  to be the Clippers
8:50 mark, reggie jackson should be fined smh
😂😂😂 62-18 @5:13
Bro, I know they don’t have Leonard, but how do you get dumpstered like that in the first half?
Seeing marvericks wearing green is throw off
Mavs need to sign josh Richardson quick
I couldn't stand listening to that one announcer who sounded like he was just congested.
Pandemic P needs that second dose of the vaccine 💉
⚠️⚠️⚠️Second wave of pandemic has started
Luke Kennard ain't gonna work out already missing Shamet. Ain't no point talking about PG cause well......     Bad game or not I ride with Kawhi but this is the weirdest team in the whole league.
27-77 at half im dead
Hey skiiiiuppp
this looked like celtics vs nets
Kawhi really left Toronto for these bums? And Serge joined them? WTF!! 😂
They will change the game if kawhi was there in the court. 💪
Paul George bra. 🤦🏽‍♂️
I just came here for the tears...
The Clippers got there shit fucked.up     Again
Shut up, dude they are not complete. Cuz KL was not there. !!!
The clippers might not be as deep of of team as has been stated about them.
51😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
The clippers are better than the lakers I thought tho ? I’m confused
"Expect Paul George try and carry this team"...OFF A DAMN CLIFF
Steve to PG. Give me my money back
4:28 yeah I get that a lot
See flippers fans never talk trash to the lakeshow again cause karma will strike  F THE CLIPPERS
😭😂💀😭😂😭💀😭😂  Mavs could have scored ZERO points in the second half and STILL won the game   😂😭💀💀😂  Good lord
thought this was nets vs celtics for a second
#chubbyluka
Clipper fans after game 1: <pounding chests> Fakers suck! L.A. is our town now! 2021 NBA Champs, baby!  Clipper fans after game 3:  <crickets>
The Clippers franchise just always find a way to be the laughing stock of the leauge 🤦🏿‍♂️ 🤦🏿‍♂️
This like putting team USA vs China. 😂🤦‍♂️
Good Lawd, they dingalinged them boys. Kawhi looking for his next team.
Boban was standing while he was hanging on the rim
So the Dallas on hall of fame 🤔 mode. And Clippers on rookie......
9:09 wait what, so how many is the first?
Ala kasi si kawhi eh hahah
Day 1 without kawhi
Imagine how many trashtalk and beef the Clippers players got in the court the whole game lmfao
Flight:.... Me: 😂
Paul George turned into George Paul again.
The gorgeous clarinet consequentially preach because partridge clasically waste beneath a cut grandmother. unusual, endurable low
When you adjust the sliders in 2k
This is painful to watch.
2nd largest????  I thought my ESPN app was just kind messing up a bit.  What could possibly be number 1?
This is history!!! 🤣 doc rivers voice *y’all are trash *lmao Paul George hear me when I say this you are trash 😭
$190 Million contract what????. Blaming Doc rivers what?? Backboard P what?? Load Management what??
When people thought Clippers is built to beat the defending champs but forgot about the other teams 😂
Straight Dallas highlights lmaooo
4:26 Look at Mark Cuban he loves it What an Owner!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
GEORGE PAUL IS BACK 🎤Skip B
51 PT BEAT DOWN!!
Man the clips kept the game close 🥶
Sheeshhh, it's crazy how trash the clippers are without kawhi
This Is Like Playing 2k And Your Game Sliders Are All In 100😂🤣
Dagkot pa mog kandela
Me when I play vs computer:
clippers the 2nd round exit😂😂
"It's doc rivers fault" - Pandemic P
People was REALLY hype after that opening night game from George Paul....  I just chilled like "Just wait.. The side of the backboard" PG will be back
I thought these were highlights by both teams, but all i've seen were just mavs highlights 🤦‍♂️
People really saw Paul George have one good game and said Playoff P is back.... bruh he trash in the playoffs and can only do good in one regular season game every other month 😂
The coach is 💯% genius ty lue
Came here just for the roast
Let us not forget the Sat Luca on the bench for all of the second and most of the third and still one by this much.
Paul George - Ball Game
The wasteful black atypically answer because afghanistan relatedly blot anenst a awful fall. hurt, obnoxious dedication
Tangina nakakahiya Clippers niyo HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Dallas game highlights
Is this a Dallas Mavericks highlights? I'm confused.
Them fools didn’t have over 30 before Halftime 😂😂😂😂
The LA clippers will never reach the Western Conference finals.
omg this is freaking hilarious 😂😭
clipers are good teams theyre strong  this game was really they did not serious in thier play no diffense and offense...
Losing is acceptable but being blown out?
The Clippers is the greatest joke franchise in NBA History 😂
EITHER THE FLIPPER'S FEAR THE DALLAS MAVERICKS, OR THE FLIPPER'S ARE GOING TO BE TRASH THIS YEAR, NO NBA TEAM HAS EVER MADE THE WESTERN CONFERENCE FINAL'S OR ANY CONFERENCE FINALS MUCH LESS THAN THE NBA FINALS WITH A LOSS LIKE THIS ON THEIR SCHEDULE RESUME! IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG YEAR FOR THE CLAW AND PLAYOFF P,  GO LAKERS
Is this the biggest away win in NBA history?
Clippers are still getting the chip this season , they’re the best team in the league they’re just getting used to different formats so stop the bandwagon hate
Can't wait for Unc to slam this to Skiuuuup's face
Clippers just wasting their money on Pandemic George. Anyway, that's another record that they've got. Wehehe!
it would be more embarrassing if there were fans in that arena, imagine leaving from arena after the first half,, 😂😂
Not synced in defense, all iso in offense. Those were the issues during last season in playoffs.. And now they still believe that ty lue is an upgrade of doc rivers..
LMAOOO THIS SCORE THO
Clippers are always gonna trash
POV: you play in 2k, then in rookie mode 😆
It looked like a literal whole rec game on 2K irl, that’s embarrassing. Idc if Kawhi isn’t playing, you mean to tell me that George Paul, Cancun Bev, Serge, etc hell the COACH, can’t rally the team to at least compete or seem competitive? Christ Almighty LMFAO, DAL and DEN become the 17’ Warriors when they see LAC sheesh.
this was your time playoff p smh just gave up early
This is like Seirin vs Generation of Miracles on that first season
Embarrassing  -Phoenix
The energy Dallas had was insane
Im not even watching these highlights I went straight to the comments and let me just say I was not disappointed😂
Shay "Clippers celebrating Season Opener Championship" maybe ppl should slow up on the Clippers & Nets and let the *WHOLE* season play out 🤷‍♂️
Commentator saying PG will carry the LAC while Kawhi is out in the beginning of the game but it starts to get awkward after that.
The Pandemic ain't over therefore none of us should be surprised that Pandemic P returned.
Paul George Mvp mode,He's having a session with his trainer on his mvp calliber days oh i see the progress
is this celtics vs nets?
It's like team USA vs any country 😂
WayOff P can't carry this team even if his life depended on it.
If the Clippers had Steph Curry shooting 3s like he did after practice, the MIGHT have had a chance lol
😭 thought this only happens in 2k
Playoff Paul George activated
Ty lue exposed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niElyJm-kAk
I want a reaction of video of skip bayless asap
Dam LA Lakers won Without Glass AD ???? 😲 but when James gets hurt can they win without LeGM
Come on youre suppose to be Robin to batman but at this point you're just the butler
HAHAHAHAH clippers is nothing without leonard , Where is the heat now paul george   I dont hate clippers or pgeorge  And wow 8:41 thats so much 60 advantage pts wow GG
yup..pg13 carried the clippers today..to the history book...
wtf am i watching the nba????
Clippers forgot the season started. Had a JR Smith relapse “Oh I thought this was scrimmage! We didn’t see the fans.”
I can’t believe clippers gave pg that contract!! He’s not worth the money and good thing my Lakers never traded for him or signed him!!
This is what happen when you built your team just to beat the lakers and Denver
Clippers smoked before the game😂
Imagine being blown out by 51 points in your own arena... without the fans, homecourt advantage is meaningless at this time... The Clippers should just blow up the team, trade away all the players... there's no chemistry, no fire...
Haven't seen a beating like this since Nate Robinson
This should stop the Kawhi Leonard disrespect
Mavericks stored up their 2020 team takeover for this day. RIP Clippers confidence
😂🤣😂🤣
Pg is now ready for play off🤭
When the announcer was like: _"40 pts in 2nd quarter!"_ I was like: _time to close the video. mavz just won._
Only bettors knows why
seems like the nba messed the sliders up
2-0 was the only time they lead lmaooo 😂
Way off p lead his team to yet another waaaaayyy over paid L😂😂😂😂😂 everybody Cancun on 3😂😂😂😂😂
50 points?!? Kawhi and Ibaka are going to regret leaving Toronto. Weather up here sucks but if you’re a multi-millionaire how bad could it be when you don’t use public transportation?
Choke hahah
9 mins and 19 seconds all Maverick highlights wtf
Where is the glitch button 🤣
Fuck... havent seen a blowout this bad in a while.
Rigged for bettors
Shannon Sharpe gonna have a field day tomorrow lmbo 😂
On your court too 🤣🤣
4:49 someone laughed with me
God damn!!!
You keep bashing paul. But can you say it says lot more about kawhi and his effect on the team? Without him. There you go
Someones getting fired😂
Mavs playing rookie difficulty clippers
Clippers out here looking like a WNBA team lol
Ty Lue getting exposed
Paul George can't even be a second man....can't lead anything but his overpriced salary and non deserved advertisements
This is like an actual nba team vs a jv high school team
Clippers management just wasting million dollars of money for paul george imagine millions of dollars
Clippers should fire their coach..totally trash..
I think its the coach .. I dont like the coaching.
load management ruins the team again. thank you kawhi
What the fuck happened
Paul George is just Draymond Green with braids.
Badass assist @ 7:25
Pretentious P talked about performing at a high level this season, just like in his 2018-19 MVP Season that he forgot he ended up exiting the first round.
PANDEMIC P
I can’t wait to hear what skip going to say about this blowout and how it’s all lebrons fault
There goes the remaining Clipper fans, how anybody can support that team after they just did this is beyond me.
Poor Kawhi can’t even leave the team to his ‘co-star’ while he’s out resting.
Clips regretting paying PG. I’m sorry that kinda money is for a LEADER. PG is not a leader, sorry.
So George Paul played in today's game ... I wonder if he is going to blame this loss on Doc Rivers 😂
Probably a blessing in disguise Clippers fans weren’t in the arena. Imagine PAYING to go in person and watching that happen. If fans were allowed most of them would probably have legit left at halftime.
Clippers fan: Paul George. Skip: George Paul the end .
Clippers run LA 🤣
Y is the LA junior varsity playing the mavs🤦🏽‍♂️
If I am the GM of clippers I will kick all of them out...
In Rob Parker voice..”..the Clippers are championship frauds!”
Mega blowout LMFAO 😂
Clippers rlly disappointed me.
51 tho? I guess clippers are back to being the clippers
Clips build my ass this niggas are on a warriors level
Literally all Mavericks highlights after the first quarter
First time , spend more time on reading comments than watching the video.
Someone tell stephen A. Smith that the clippers are not the biggest threat to the lakers hahah cant wait what he has to say tomorrow's😬😂
Mavs coulda stopped scoring at half and still won...
Damm my goon not even in rookie mode you get this much points
the clippers extended paul george's contract... its like this is fate they self implode
The Clippers got beat down worst than Nate Robinson😁😁
Them boys look lost out there.
I've never seen any team in the NBA wowowow
Damn Clippers look like high schoolers without Kawhi
This team is a big joke!!!!
Hey Clips! Where's Morris? 🤔
4:59 Damn, felt that laugh of mockery. Are they home commentators of Clips?
Paul George needs to go play for the Knicks!
Paull George "that's a bad win."
That wasn't Paul George that was George Paul.
*Khawhi Leonard laugh* let’s go mavs‼️
Down Fifty P
Kawhi left a championship team for this😭😑
Clippers, exposed!  After this game, not even the G league teams fear them. 😅
clippers got butchered
Oh.....
This looks like a my career game once you get all your badges lol...and hit 90ovr
I see PG is finally back
2017: Clippers 98-144 Warriors
Ty lue coaching at its finest
Y’all know what I’m here for
"My trainer is back"  -pandemicP2020
Richardson!
Shannon is about to commit homicide lol
yo by the fourth quarter they (clippers)  should've just let fans off the street play. it would've been more entertaining and they would've shown more heart.
We less than five games into the season. But if you wanna crown them then go ahead and crown em
Why is watching PG13% fail so miserably so entertaining!! 😅😅  Sorry PG, you brought it on yourself by tryna diss other players whilst taking ZERO accountability.
Waiting for flight to react to this😂
Skip Bayless: I got PLENTY of excuses, wait & see!
Mavs vs A.I 🤭
The flippers 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Skip will shut his mouth ):
ginagawa mueeeeee!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA
George Paul was given a $223million contract. 🤣😫
Close fight
dang
You start Nic Batum of course you going to get blown out. Batum robbed the Hornets.
108-57 in the 4th😐😐
The Clippers doesn't fail to make history.. in a negative way.
We the City of Los Angeles would like to make a trade... The Clippers give LA a bad name Name your offer below👇🏽👇🏽
16 on the mavs is a MyPlayer if i've ever seen one
What in the world
At 0:25 when announcer said Kawhi is out so PG13% would have to carry team, you knew it was OVER.  PG only does well when there’s no pressure. Kinda like when you kill it in practice.
Bruh....
This  comment section almost have me feeling bad for PG... almost 😁
So that's whay they Pay PG 45MM/year. To get wrecked if Leonard doesn't play. 🤣
so its official Clippers without Kawhi is different🤔
How about that for “sample size” Clipper fans? Haha
LOLOLOLOLOL
Clippers totally a trash team without kawhi..
There go the Clippers being Clipper...I guess this was Doc Rivers fault too🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
WTF? Clippers on rebuilding mode or something?
This is horrible!!! 🤦 Omg! Disgusting man they are trash bro they stop playing some good basketball pweeew 🤦🤦🤦
The flippers lose  The world wins
"Stop hitting it, it's already dead 😔"
Hahahaa kailangan tlga nila si Kawhi
Just like 2k with full sliders! 😂
You boys is Chumps
Bruh Ibaka needs to make twice the shots of everyone since he took out his best player 😂
Came straight to the comments bruh
Good game very intense....
What a rough way to lose smh. Can’t wait to watch first take and undisputed in the morning lol
I picked the mavs to beat the clippers in the bubble clippers don't have  a young depth like the mavs
The clippers are. "Championship contenders" they are a "group of dogs" and the "best defensive team" in the nba right now.
The fans would of been gone by the second half if they were there 😂
Clippers is gonna feel what lebron felt all them years he had Ty Lie 😂😂
what just happened ???!!!?
Overated player . Overated coach.
Pandemic P: "Doc wasn't using me right."
Clippers won't have been that far behind if PG was out instead of Kawhi. Man, PG's reputation has degraded so much in just a year.
Yo 7:30 Luka looked so bored when he passed the ball😂😂
Is it me or PG ain’t been the same since he got engaged🤔🤔
Pat Bev trick y’all
WOW, Shannon is going to have a field day tomorrow🤦🏽‍♂️😂
“Mavs highlights ft clippers” 😂😂
Paul: but doc is the reason- oh nvm.
They should put some boo sound out there 😂 this is terrible
Commentators : Expect PG will carry this team  lost by 51 points
Embarrassing
Worse than genocide
I thought YouTube didn’t allow videos depicting murder
Why couldnt the Clippers shoot 13 percent from 3 when playing the Nuggets. man.
Luka Doncic will next break Luka Aikins record. Just wait.
Leonard punching the air right now 😂😂😂 you left the raptors for this 😂 should've joined bron 😂
They were up so bad the Commentators got bored && called the win b4 the game finished 🤣🤣
Luka must be playing on pro difficulty on his MyCareer 😭
Isn't Pandemic P got his new strain?
Luka thiiiiiiic
wow they rlly rely on kawhi that much
Wow
Can someone please explain to me how Zubac is in the NBA. His defence isn’t even defence...
How is Zubac in the NBA?
Thats like team a USA vs Kazakhstan FIBA game 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆

Another tragic tragic day for the Clippers fans. Mfers can’t win for losing. 😭
Analysts : take kawhi out and clippers are still a playoff team.   Mavs: so I took it personal
Bucks be like.. We beat GSW by 39 points  Mavs: Hold my beer
Mark Cuban is by the far the best owner in the league man what a cool ass dude
I wonder what Skip's excuse will be this time
lmao was the highschool basketball? like i thought my app lagged the score for lathe clips
I'm only here for the comments
Clippers lost by 50 points (Their biggest lost in franchise history)....and y'all still think they can Defeat the LAKERS?🤦🏻‍♀️
Pandemic P lining it up to leave the clippers
That 77-27 score tho 🤯🤯🤯  LA Clippers 2021 Roster https://youtu.be/-39CjHmrOdY
The clippers think they can BUY a team.. well you can’t buy heart and the desire to win. Why they think they can just a buy a championship is hilarious, dropping millions Upon millions just to get the same result. Obviously kawhi didn’t play but tons of talented players out there and still got spanked. These teams will meet again and I can see the mavs winning in 6.
Just a bad shooting night for the Clippers. Make no mistake they are winning it all this year and for the next 3 years.
At least it was a close game
Clippers fans ya'll ready for 5 years of Playoff P leading your team ? because Kawhi is gone next year.
Great game Dallas
Umm I know that this is the beginning of the season but bruh a 51 point blow out in the words of the NFL COM’ON MAN Clippers only ready to play When it the LAKERS cause it don’t seem like they was even in the game they found some scrub off the streets and put them in the game and photoshop the teams face on them
This is one of them games you sim to the end WITH your vc
For a second I thought I was watching playoffs already, with Playoff P in the building!
*Dallas Mavericks Highlights  LA Clippers 2021 Roster https://youtu.be/-39CjHmrOdY
HEY NBA PLEASE BE LIVE NEXT DALLAS GAME VS HORNETS THANK YOU SO MUCH IM WATCHINH FROM DALLAS TEXAS IM A DALLAS FAN

When you put my career on pro and sim the rest of the game:
PG: . .. ...🎤 👀  ..... That’s a bad team
Oh yeah go go go pandemic P 😬
Ye Kawhi runs the Clippers hopefully he will be back stronger and better upgrade :D
Flippers....their $190mil guy smh

Paul George is a waste of talent.

Lakers would never 😂
Don't be judgemental guys all vaccine have side effects like Pfizer
Championship contenders my ass
Sheesh, I thought it was a dallas highlights xD😂
Their glaring weakness was exposed. Clips need a floor general, badly
bruh mavs got 6 guards and making it work
Yo.. I thought IBAKA and BATUM made the clippers a much better team? Kawhi is fucked!!
Trashy P is rising though 🤣
this is a massacre 🤦
https://youtu.be/lIureQLETvk
The Mavs scored more in the 1st half than the Clippers did the entire game.....
Imagine if this happened last season....
@8:26 yo what the heck is with that pass :O
Damn USA vs China look different here.
50??!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s not all Paul George fault tho ... ty lue should not be coaching at all their fukd
200 mil worth it.
George Paul is a superstar
4:28 Mama.. there goes that man
Man the mavs played a whole team of Ai Players
If you round up the clippers 3 point shooting percentage, it would be PG13%.
this reminds me of when homer simpson beat up the hamburgler and kept pounding him while the kid on the side was crying stop lol
Its just a regular season
What happened to kawai or what ever
5:52 pandemic p looking like he abt to hit some shots
Pual chorge unstoppable. 😂
We saw this coming with water boy Lue
Ty Lue is on the clock now 😬
Kevin Durant taking his talents to Dallas
right when the video started, I thought the Celtics were playing.. those green jerseys
It took 3 games, but maybe Carlisle has figured it out.
Embarrassing
Doesn’t count... The difficultly was on rookie.
Luka already better than PG
bruh they better donate those ps5s coz they dont deserve em after this horrific loss
kinatay ampotek
No Kawhi = Clippers are trash. Ballmer, please blew the whole team up you need to rebuild
0:37 - No more high fives for Luka
Cant wait to hear what Skip Bayless and Chris Broussard got to sayy😶😶
Sliders for the mavs were on 100
I'm just hoping Dallas would win but 124-73?? wtf happened?
So playoff P really needs Kawhi 🤣
"We're still in the driver's seat."
Man the NBA is biased they are only showing mavs highlights
It's like highschoolers vs nba players😂😂
Thank goodness isn’t baseball. Bunch of babies crying unwritten rules. Takes a baby to cry and a man to take your whoopin
This HAS TO BE some level of hell. I feel so bad for the Clips bruh
Can kwahi be that powerful!? He sits 1 game they lose by over 50? Lmaooo
That looked like the Globetrotters
Kawhi gonna fake an injury and get traded from this team too.
Whatttttt.¡¡¡ clippers without kawhi is whattttt,
This the new strain of Pandemic P. Announcer called the game in the first :30 "He's gonna wear out Paul George all night"
NICE GAME PG"FUCKIN USELESS" 13 . waaaah
PG is back in the Pandemic Mode 😂
Who fault is doc rivers or ty lu?? PG13
Should have entitled the video "Mavs Highlights" lol
Mark Cuban the Goat
“Expect George Paul to carry the clippers now that Khway is out!!!”  Game finishes: Clippers get BLOWN THE FUCK OUT !!!! 😂
The announcer said expect playoff p to carry the game... jajajajaja
Balmer malding rn
Durog hahaha
this should be titled MAVS HIGHLIGHTS 🤘🏽
Blowout 🥶
5:00 man that laugh is humiliating🤣🤣
George Paul is back and the Clippers getting blown out  that's how bad this team is without Kawhi Leonard
At this point I think you can trade pg for a bag of the chips and the team trading the bag of chips would decline
WTF HAPPEN?? 🤣🤣🤣 CLIPPERS WIN ONE GAME AND PG13 do great and everybody go to excited making predictions about clippers better then Lakers and now they got the 2 worst losses in nba history 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣flippers
Stephen A.Smith gon have a heart attack while ranting about this.
Kawhi out for one game in the clippers just gave Paul George what!! 😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣 Why you never should have left Toronto
social distancing SCORE at its finest
pandemic p getting side effects from covid vaccine
So glad I’m not a clippers fan 😂😂
CLIPPERS maybe is cursed
Clippers: We're gonna beat the Lakers Mavs: lol take that 50 point L
Look at this bandwagons when a team lost 1 game.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So you're saying... 51 points is for Kawhai's average scoring but he's not on the court? My ass can't breath... haha
Haha Kawhi is overrated
This is worst than Nate sleeping
Dallas could have scored 0 points in the second half and still would have won by 4
Not only Pandemic P came back, we saw the Mavericks tryouts for the Harlem Globetrotters.
Playoff P back at it, 4 years $190 mil for this lol
This the Clippers team the Lakers should be afraid of? 😂😂😂😂😂
Silver lining for the Clips: No one watches the NBA anymore.
Paul George after this game “you see I grew up a Bucks fan”
sicking 🤮🤮🤮 73 point s c, on man
Mavs basically played with themselves.
they will never bounce back this season from this
Who nicknamed him playoff p for anyways trash ass p
Clippers were out there looking like a LA Fitness pick up team. 😂😂😂😂😂
For a second I thought the clippers were playing the Celtics since the mavs were wearing green jerseys
LMFAO!🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 TRASH!!!🤣🤣
Disgraceful
Bruh ...Lu shouldve threw in the towel. I mean damn, you down 50....by halftime...they had 80 by the third....wow....Skip is bout to get BLASTED on undisputed 🤣🤣
nasty
Wtf . It's murder time..
Pendemic p version 2.
it's hard to watch than my kid's first recital in school
Elementary vs college
No Kawhi No Problem for loss
Mavericks played like they had the difficulty on rookie on 2K
omg wtf lmao seeing on the scoreboard vs. actually watching it lol
Paul George was upset Leonard got to Load manage before him. So he threw the game to get the 4th quarter off
Wtf is this .?? Shit game hahahahhaa
All y'all niggas are haters 😂😂😂 who cares it's the 3rd game of the season. Clippers did the same shit to the Lakers back in 2014 beat em by 48pts. Gave the Fakers there worse lost in history. The hate is real Go Clippers 👏👏👏👏 chumps ♥️💙 keep hating loser's
Yeah I dont think the Clippers run LA lmao
Pat Bev locked down Luka once more. Defensive Goat.
Why is only the green team scoring?
Have mercy 🤣🤣🤣
Wow!!!
Finally got that payback for the dirty plays in the playoff
Demm Paul George is back!!!!💯-💯
is this enough evidence to show that the clippers are nothing without kawhi?
Lmfao
Shannon sharpe is going to act up on undisputed after this one
Yall sure that max contract was worth is clippers?
I can’t wait for OSN to react to this. 😂😂😂😂😂
Some high schools teams literally would’ve put up a better fight
@4:59-5:00 "2nd quarter score 60-18" Listen for laugh😅 💀
Ty Lue is nothing without LeBron
They need to make a highlights video of all the bricks from the Clippers during the first half that can make a new Clippers Arena.
Paul George post game interview finna be like : “The crowd would’ve definitely gave us a boost.”
Nice
Clippers trash 🗑 with Leonard 😂 seriously though why build a try franchise in Clippers they’re cursed 😈 have been since the beginning.
The Clippers got they ass dubbed.
It must be the jerseys. 😂😂😂😂😂
Kawhi leaving in free agency
5:00
Rookie settings. Haha
Paul George wants a trade to Philly.
Rookie settings. Haha
PG after the game: "idc what nobody say they were mostly bad shots they made" 😂
Why is everyone surprised we are talking about the LA Clippers
From "Pandemic P" to "I'll be Got Damn P"
yawn
It's like a 2k game HAHAHA
PG is somewhat OVERREACTED!
LMFAO!!!😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Clippers should be ashamed of themselves..lakers would never
Paul George: We lost because our coach Doc Rivers could not make proper adjustments from Philly.
Pg13 u suck so much stfu about u going back to being a mvp caliber fucker
That is the ugliest jersey
First step is admitting there is a problem. You have to get some leadership on this this team man. I don't care if its the coach. Horrible and embarrassing!
Damn this like going against level 50 world boss and your only level 1 in the game lol
Dallas vs Computer
Paul looking like he is sufferring from severe trauma against Luka. His confidence is gone, Luka living inside of his head free of rent right now sheesh
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
SKIP BAYLESS GETTING ROASTED IN THE A.M. 😂💯🔥💎 GET EM UNCLE SHAY
So this is what a clippers team without kawhi looks like.. Damn they're not even a playoff worthy team without the claw😂
this is why the clippers look scary
What a shame PG 😂 not even close
I wish they Laughed at Pat Bev's face!!!
Paul George shouldve to dropped 81 smh
wheres the loud mouth beverly?
Paul George can’t spell nba finals
What a way to get your first win of the season. Did not see that coming. Lets go Mavs!!!
Can someone explain to me how did this happen ? I mean damn you may be a LAC fan or not but that's embarrassing
Im disappointed at this point cmon clips..
The chief joseph noticeably type because rainbow intialy hate pro a obsequious mistake. free, shy jaguar
LOL
Not even 2019-2020 Warriors and Cavaliers had a loss this bad.
Too bad there is no Mercy Rule like in NCAA haha
The Clippers are The Khardashians of the NBA (Artificial no Substance)....
Beverly is 🗑️
Did Paul George not play well? If not can someone help me figure out what his stats were
Clippers think they are the best team in west after the win over lakers. LoL
Mav 👍
Imagine averaging 18 points per quarter bruh💀💀
No defense at all :3 just all out offense
Pandemic P needs Kovid Kawhi to thrive... the disease needs the virus. Lol.  PG CANNOT carry a team to victory period!
Now we see why Doc "got fired".
73 ÷ 4 quarters = 18.25 points....  That means they made LESS THAN 4 points EVERY 3 MINUTES.....WOW
I can’t wait to watch Stephen a smith or skip💀💀💀
Clippers out here braking records lol
Skip will still try to find an argument pertaining to lebron and the lakers on Monday hahaha
I wanna see skip and shannon debate about this.
I don’t care if Kawhi is out y’all suppose to be a defensive team this is sad....
I thought It was Dallas vs Chinese teams🤷‍♂️
😂😂😂😭😭😭😭them clippers bet not ever be mentioned in the same sentence as my Lakers! We may lose some but not like that 😭😭😭😭
Pdown by 50 P
Cannot wait for Tso Sage to go in on them.  🤣🤣
ty lue sucks..
Clippers are literally down terrible.😕
The Mavs just swept the floor with Clippers today. Not gonna troll them much, everybody has bad games, but this is worrisome.
Go Mavs!!
God damn LMAO
That was very close match
Kawhi knew this will happen so he let Ibaka injure him...Damn prototype
Mavs have the Flippers' number. If they get them in the first round again, it's a wrap.
Have some empathy for Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers please.
MAN CLIPS RIGHT WHEN I WANTED TO BUY A JERSEY....NVM
Media: The Clippers are just load managing till the playoffs.
Just when u thought playoff pg wasnt back 🤦‍♂️
😂
51 POINTS JESUS CHRIST !!!
This is a great snuff film
Its a murder
what happen
Can we get some f's in the chat for the Clippers
The jersey of mavs looks like a Jersey of Boston Celtics
what happened to other players of Clippers?
Damn im really glad that hardaway jr is finally getting what's he's worth on the Mavs unlike what they did to him on NY
Welcome to the Dallas Mavericks Show! 🤣🤣🤣
Bro what the fuck? The Clippers are trash
Pandemic P 2: Electric boogaloo
I can’t wait to hear skip excuse tomorrow 😂😂😂😂
Clippers pack in the air 🚬
As we speak, Doc Rivers thought the Mavs were the better team than the Clippers tonight...
"without kawhi expect pg will carry this team"  PG: ok
2k rec when the other team quit but 1 person
The title should be:  MAVERICKS FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS at FLIPPERS| December 27, 2020
Varsity vs junior varsity.
At this point I'd rather see bron go against luka in the playoffs before he retires
I thought the game was only 2 quarters...
they should remove PG on the thumbnail
Are you kidding me? I expected this from the Knicks but you?!   Basically a Mavs practice session smh
Total Destruction !
Skiiiep George Paul Bayless
Shannon is going in on Skip tomorrow.
Yoo wtf 😂
is this real? -51 Damn.
Bs
Dallas could have scored 0 points in the second half and still won by 4 lol
Anyone notice that the Mavs lose a point at 3:22 ?? Goes from 37 to 36 from quarter 1 to quarter 2
Can you guys run up my channel 🔥🙏🏾🤟🏾
And some Clips fans were really saying before the season started that PG would be a legit MVP candidate this season. Bruh if that were the case PG would’ve taken of business in the absence of Kawhi today.
I’m tryna figure out how kould this happen ...
they had boban shooting one handers 😂
This team carried by kawhi🙄
Change PG to Carmelo A. 😂😂
rigged
The La clippers was my favorite team But they suck now
Imagine if there are crowds, after halftime the stadium would look like the same as now
shiet.. if i paid courtside for this game haha ..
Mavs playing against clipper kindergartens 😞
He did drop 15, that’s enough
-Most of you are here like me: you saw this score in your sports news feed and was like, "...hunh...??" and you couldnt process it so you came here to see if that final score was a typo, or "what happened??" -The commisioner should pull all clipper tv games until after the all star break for this.  -Cant blame this one on montrez -Cant wait to hear all the pundits who praised the clippers "deepness" wiggle outta this one mon morn. -Skip bayless is gonna get broussard to fill in for him mon morn because hes going to come down w/ covid symptoms sun night -For those of your who dont know, THIS is why no western team will fear the clips come playoffs.  -Once again george proving hes not built to be the man and loses all confidence if batman goes down and its left to HIM to save gotham -Ty lue tried to channel phil jackson coaching mj and kobe by not calling timeouts early on when the score gap started to develop, sorta gonna "let them figure it out...". Only 1 problem though... -he aint got mj or kobe -last thing, just a reminder, shannon sharpe said, "yeah... more like playoff p wit' two e's- playoff pee" 😭😭😭
They look like an children here that cant even open his own candy. Tiger vs cat. What a pity team you've shown this time. Haist
What the heck happened to the Clippers!!!  At least one team was on the court tonight!
Thank you Ibaka 😅😅
Mavs are playing euro basket super fast passes and intensity at 100% on defense
looks like a pick up game
Clippers and Rockets in the West and Sixers and Bucks in the East are the NBA's overhyped underperformers.
This highlight reel contains a Paul George miss. Classic.
77 to 27 lord please have mercy !!!!
They better apologize to Doc Rivers
Wtf happened to the clippers?
Watching flippers get blown out is a great way to start the day XD  Tho hopefully Kawhi recovers..what he suffered was nasty
This was a very competitive game for 90 seconds
They even changed the score coming to 2nd quarter at 3:24
Damn after the 2nd quarter mavs' score looks like a 3rd quarter score while clips have a 1st quarter score 💀💀
Your clippers is tired HAHAHAHAH
Just when you thought Pandemic P was gone he comes raging back
Skip is gonna say Kawhi had a grate game even though he didn't play and gonna bash lebron even though he wasn't in this game either
8:13 that dunk is clean
This is why clippers is a defensive team 🤣
"That's a bad loss"
Clips going to the Finals this year! Kappa
Tye Lue and PG got contracts that make no sense.
This got ugly fast
why an NBA team playing with High school team
.......
Mavs annihilated the Clippers without KP and the starters only playing a little over 20min. I love seeing my team look like they are having so much fun playing the game.
News flash: Ballmer is selling the team!
You should lose 2 games if you lose by 50 or more.
this is insane!!
7:25 is killing me. They didn’t even care at this point
Me: Wanna hear a joke? Friend: Yea? Me: Respect Friend: I don't get it Me: Neither does Paul George
It's just a warm up game guys. 😆
Pandemic P carrying this flippers to trash😂😂😂
Pandemic New Strain P is back 🤧
NBA GLOBAL GAMES FINAL RESULT DALLAS MAVERICKS- 124 SHANGHAI SHARKS -73
Well we all know Skip is going to ignore this and try to blast the Lakers lol
Yow i dont know men. A scary championship team they said. But i dont even see the worst team get blown out like that😂📴
at one point the lead is bigger than the flippers score😂😂
I thought it's a preseason game, geeez
Clippers are designed only to stop Lakers
Is this full game highlight or is it just Mavs highlights?
Clippers are a joke man🤣
thought im watching celtics vs nets when first saw those jersey colors.
Man Luka is making this game look easier and easier. Looks like he’s really focusing on the drive and kick these days, making lots of opportunities for his teammates
Clippers on playoff mode early in season
Imagine paying Play off P 190million💀. Clippers are a bunch of bone heads.
there has to be some record broken in this game right
Tambak ang mga gong2x na clippers
My lady asked who on the Clippers got the "rona"? I replied everyone.
god damn
This is like when you play 2k20 on rookie mode..😁😁
50 points in 2nd qrt.😃
Clippers play bad without Kawhi
This is when you play 2k on Hall Of Fame level for the first time.  Thanks for all the likes...
6:20 LMAO
Yo Brunson looked nice🔥
this is sad and satisfying at the same time
What happen to the team that used to be a "threat" on both lakers and the west?🤔  'guess Pierce and Barkley had already predicted it lmao😅
As they announced that a new strain of COVID-19 was discovered, Pandemic P strikes back with 0-6 from 3pt line.
How about that? PG overrated.
Next time Clippers play against any other team the title gotta be Kawhi vs the other team name coz the whole team ain’t shit with out him 😂😂
This is History!
Its like a game of 2k on rookie...lol
nice mavs highlights
Clippers fans stop watching after 0:17.
Are the Mavericks playing in Rookie difficulty? 😂
Commentator: "Expect to Paul George to carry this team"   Yep he sure did carry them on the losing end
What a shame I had to see it for myself 🤭😬
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pat bev: "the next 5 years are mine" 😂😂😂
When you play on rookie difficulty
Another magic happened 😮
mavs beat them so bad that the entire 4th qr was trash time lol
Trump really got that wall he was asking for
60 to 18 😂😂😂
Throw the Damn Toww!!!!!
Wow wanna know why harrell left them
The Clippers showed everone how to social distance on defense .
Toxic people only notice of when he play bad
5 mav clips for every 1 clippers..
“The clippers got better.”  Ha.
I checked back the first half score more than three times, suspecting a system error
This is clippers first loss of season.  Sheesh people relax!
Even if PG scored 50, it wouldnt have much of a difference. That was a trashing.
WHAT IS WITH TODAY'S NBA SCHEDULE OF GAMES? Upsets all across the board. HAHAHAHA.
Somebody forgot to tell the Clippers the game had started.
That was a nail biter!
Too LATE!!!! Can't take it back now! We all heard you!  Hahahaha   0:22 - 0:26 🏀😆🏀😷🏀😆🏀😷🏀😆🏀😷🏀🥴🏀😂🏀🤣🏀🤭
sheesh mavs...
Nets lose to hornets, bucs lose to knicks, clippers lose by 50, browns lose to jets...what a strange day in sports
These the same guys that beat us in the playoffs, rigged ass nba narratives smh
HAHAHAHAHAA
I literally thought this was celtics nets
Brooklyn Nets is much worth the hype than this pre-school team.
I just interviewed Paul George, and he said it was Doc Rivers fault. We believe you Pandemic P
This is a weird day. Mavs blowout Clippers. Nets lose to Hornets. Sixers get their ass whooped by the Cavs. Bucks got shitted on by the Knicks.
Im just here for the comments 🤣☠
Clippers can beat the lakers. But not for dallas.
😂😭💀
Clippers breaking records and History...
Let's go!! Paul Goerge is backk💪🔥🔥
Fuck the clippers😤
LMAO CLIPPERS ARE ASS. Skip keeps saying "The Clippers are built to beat the Lakers", Ok Skip I'll give you that. What about the other 28 teams? Or maybe they're built to beat the lakers...in the regular season.
Wow that’s actually ridiculous. They get paid millions of dollars a year there is no excuse to lose by 50. That PG contract is looking like trash
i thought it was nets and celtics playing on clippers court thou🙄🤣
that's right, keep sleeping on the clips. good good
lol luka really playing with them like kids at the park
Looks like my son and I playing 2k 😂😂😂. What a disgrace from the clippers. The number one high school team would have beat them.
This is more like Dallas Mavericks Team Highlights. 😂
"it's not a big deal"
Skip has some explaining to do about the clippers
What do you expect
LEGGO MAVS #MFFL 2021 BRING THAT CHIP HOME 👑
Nice one Fraud George and Co. Ltd. 😀😀
Damn mavs blew them out.. that’s for beating my lakers lol
Pandemic P is back, baby!
Doc Rivers must have the biggest grin on his face tonight.
Insert the Charles Barkley and Doc Rivers face meme
Clippers never understand that just cause they have a team that could beat the Lakers, doesn’t mean it’s gonna work on all the other teams lol.
What the fuck bullying flippers..😅😅😅😅
THE CLIPPERS MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A BABY MAMA WHO KEEP GIVIN HER BABY DADDY CHANCES BUT HE KEEP FUCKIN UP!!!!
Better then Lakers they say
It looks like Dallas Highlights or Dallas Scrimmage to HS kids.
7:26 is this game in a nutshell
Shit!! here we go again. The clippers is the biggest threat for lakers.🤐🤐🤐
Mavs should just wear these greens on the road from now on. Those blue duds are so soulless.
Close game!  Clippers up by 2.
Bro ain’t none of that kawhi gone bs if you know basketball Fr then you know this shit finna be real bad for the clippers
Clippers were just on rookie mode that’s all
trade Paul George
the game is over in the first half hahaha
Wtf is LeBron's former assistant coach doing?
PG CAN'T CONTROL WITHOUT CLAW
I was really disappointed that the mavs did not win by a hundred.
Nice contract for Kennard ..  he is better than Harrel .. Deserve his contract .. 🙄
I bet Skip will blame Bron for the Clippers losing and say the Clippers only show up for the Lakers lol and Luka could've went on and rested the rest of the game lol
They look like the same playoff team last season :-D
welcome back Pandemic P..  lol
LMFAOOO
Clippers taking load management to a whole new level. They are resting DURING the game.
without kawhi the clippers fucking suck. no need to argue. its facts
at one point during the game the Mavs turned into the Globetrotters
I'll bet Gilas Pilipinas will play better than these bunch of trash!
A high school team would put up a better fight than this
Clippers again made a HISTORY!  Go clippers! braah.
Made the clippers look like an middle school C-Team😂😂😂
I can’t wait to see Shannon eat this up tomorrow
Clippers suck ;!!!
Kawhi is the clippers
Cant beleive my lakers share locker rooms with these losers.
There’s literally zero defense
Doc Rivers at new home in philly:  miss me yet 🤣
Mav vs high school..
Clippers be like : We need to beat the Lakers, fuck the rest HAHAHA
Pg 13 percent
Epic fail
I watched the game live i just came here for the comments
51 blow out 😂
anyone check their Shooting setting Slider??  i think all mavz players are cheating.
Dammmm Clippers Got Ownnnnn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hahahahahaha what a game. Hahaha
How did yall get 9 minutes of highlights out of this slaughter
Massacre
PG13 is noob without kawai
2k21 looks so real here
Westbrook said "Pat Bev fooled us" Well, Paul george fooled us too🤔🤔🤔
There should be a mercy rule for stuff like this
Did I jus bare witness to a LIVE slaughter
Awful these players should be ashamed of themselves for not even trying. As if dallas were playing in another level.
When you put the controller down to take a bathroom break, but forgot to press pause on the game...
50 point lead by the Mavs @ the half. I can't wait 4 Skip Bayless and the lame excuse he will come up with 😂😂😂
Clippers makes another Record LOL
naaaaaah PG will be on Ty's back whispering he didn't make necessary adjustments......lolzzzz
The Mavericks stopped playing defense 😭😭
Skip will find a way to blame LeBron for the loss.
this is full of mavs highlights 🤣
They gonna fire ty lue right now
What happen to clippers
This was an NBA game?
The Mavs could have went the whole second half without scoring a point and they still would have won.
finally, a win for my Mavs. ♥️
paule choke
The Mavs could've still won even if they didnt score in the second half lol
That was embarrassing!!
Wow! The last time a team is down by 40+ is actually from 3 years ago when that team faced the newly-built Warriors super-team upon the arrival of KD. And guess what! The team who were on the receiving end of such merciless beating ARE ALSO THE CLIPPERS!! Now, they got the same merciless beating from a team who isn't even projected as a Super-Team! I'm finally convinced they are cursed SMH!
Let's go Clippers🎉🎉🎉
Somehow Paul George still found a way to blame this loss on Doc Rivers.
These clippers about to disband in a year or so.. ow they're joining the euroleague soon
The player chose Clippers forgot to his settings on 2k
The return of the pandemic P saga
Clippers used all their juice on the lakers now they out lol
Paul george is bad luck everyteam he play for they suck
That's a bad injury -Pandemic P
𝚆𝚎𝚕𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝙽𝙱𝙰 𝚌𝚕𝚒𝚙𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚜

What a great team ,another Poison (lason) P game
The whole game is on one side of the court 🤣🤣
you sure these are the kings of LA????? LMAOO
Lou needs to go. The coach. No way you let your team go down by this Much. Embarrassing
Kids close you’re eyes, it’s rated PG13!!
Paul George tryna be the hero but turned out to be the villain to the clippers.
Someone's family member had to be have been held at gunpoint cuz they aint no way they actually lost this bad lol
Tye Lue is not a good coach !!
Clippers would be lucky to get out the first Round. Looking at this game. Wow.
What Super star down 50 only takes 13 shots?
wthell :-) luka is looookaa!!! 51pts win booom
You Gotta Love The Clippers Concern For Kawhi. They Played The Whole Game Praying For Him With Their Eyes Closed.
He said largest halftime lead in NBA history, smh
WtF just happen?
Chris smoove be like : PANDEMIC P BAAAAACK AT IT
Imagine blaming it all on the coach and firing 1 of the best coaches in the league ! Nah couldn't be no body else fault but Doc Rivers !!
Was that game the last place G league team vs the NBA dream team or was it a Harlem Globetrotters exhibition?
Trade Paul for Westbrook
The Clippers are back at Clipping. They think by winning one game they have won the championship. Keep load management and may not pass the first round with Phoenix, New orleans and etc on the rise. Dont worry about the win against Lakers. Pretty soon desire to dethrone the  Champs will be met with appropriate force. Ring night no big 18th is on the way.
FIBA WORLD CUP 2020 USA VS CHINA
😂😂😂😂😂😂no surprise
Something to add on Ty Lue’s career. 😂
Really 51 difference? This Clippers team need a lot of work specially in consistency.
Hahahahahahahaha

PlayStation 5 P woke up feeling DANGEROUS

Paul George don't have it.
Fuck this 5 something clippers do better
I missed Pandemic P. Not gonna lie.
Anyone else just come for the comments?
My Favorite player Team PlayList  1.Zion and Ja On Grizzlies  2.Russel and kd and Kyrie on Nets 3.Paul George on golden state  4.Chris Kawhi on Heats
Paul "New Strain" George is back!✌️
And y’all sorry pathetic losers lost at home 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💯💯💯💯
Fifty Piece P
Layoff P
Pandemic P needs to get vaccinated.
I have never seen a Franchise lose with as much consistency as the Clippers. New owner/New coach/New Arena/New uniforms/New court/New Decades = Same old losing.
NBA teams that can stop Lakers 1.Nets 2.Warriors 3.Milwaukee Bucks
Dam The Clippers gets more attention than the Lakers lol, thats showing alot
Pandemic P hahahahaha
FLIPPERS 🤣🤣 LOSERS

Dallas Highlights ft. Clippers
Fun Fact: too much masterbation drains energy
51 doe
Fuck the clippers
When you put ur settings to a rookie in 2k
Tf I just watch
Bet me ship either show up and make an excuse or not show
Should have changed the title to "Mavericks Highlight at Clippers"
Sad basketball have no "throw in towel" rule. Need to have one for players safety or... dignity... like this.
This tells u how valuable kawhi is to his team
Wahahaha. Choker p is back🤣😂😂
tf
Damn they got smoked this was a barbecue bih
shouldve been titled “mavericks highlights vs clippers”
“Those were some bad shots” 🥺💀
Nobody noticed that luka is on 🔥🔥🔥. But Pandemic P. Is getting all the attention. It's great!
2:06 the "lone defense" ...??
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REACTION OF SKIP IN THIS GAME HAHAHAHAHAHA
What the fuck LA half score tambak
The news is Kawhi was so furious watching this that half of his stitches opened
Luka and Josh Richardson combo tho👌🏼
PG13 says win they won against the Lakers "I love the way i played and me and Kahwi compliments each other" and Now when they Lost a huge 51 points margin PG13 blames his team mates LOL 🤣😂🤣😂😁😁
Title should be "MAVERICKS FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS"
Way off Pandemic P is on Play off mode already 🤣👌
Another record for the mavs🔥
This blow out win is a historic payback time for Luka after Pandemic Poor George and Flippers dumped them in the playoffs
Pba team can beat these pussies
Even without Kawhi this is absolutely embarrassing we saw the real clippers today same old same old
Why tf didn’t they just sim to end
Why da hell do they mimic the arena sounds? That it's just proof that the world is a simulation.
Pure trash
Its like playing nba 2k12😂 45-50 point lead?
Mavs could’ve scored 0 points in the second half and still would’ve won
Mavs used a David Blaine magic trick to make Paul George disappear
When your younger brother’s first time to play NBA 2k vs hall of fame difficulty.
Damn Dog, Even The Announcer Was Laughing!!!
Hey, Change the title to Mavericks vs WNBA team
Came here for the comments.
Pandemic P : I don't care what anyone says, that's a bad lead.
Pathetic P.
Pandemic P is back
They should have a mercy rule in pro sports for situations exactly like this one. Daaaaaaym
The clippers were down so bad that even by half time it could be a full game highlights lol
Ayan na lumabas nanamn ang ugali ng mga players ng clippers
Yo bro ya los by fitty.  How ya do dat?
college vs freshmen😂
LD > KL*PG Eisenstein’s Theory of Clipper Irrelevantivity
What.......what happened....to the Clippers depth??
I thought it was PG + bunch of 3rd stringers. Ibaka, Batum and Kennard was there yet they cant score 😳
Paul George has Never been a Leader & Never Will!🥴
They was better off using the Clippers G league team.
what do you say in the locker room after that lol
This is embarrassing across the board
Karma!!!!!  Lakers next !!!
listen carefully @19 seconds....LOL pandemic P done it again..no he cant carry a team..no chance at all
This is embarrassing af- he shoulda step in even when Claw is absent.
I'm so disappointed in the clippers .. I cannot watch  🏀 anymore
3 games and ty lue already made nba history
Is this the new strain of pandemic p?
Lol fucc kawhi n PG who tf chooses the Clippers over the Purple n Gold? A loser 🗣 that’s who. If you wanna win championships go to the Lakers Everytime💯
Luka the coldest white boy since Steve Nash
I see the clippers are back in their top form.
total massacre this is disgusting and when those guys get in the locker room they need to have a serious talk about leaving it all out on the floor those guys bragged about playing time last year and what stars was doing this team is in trouble and I ain't talking about the Los Angeles clippers they need some new pieces in order for them to compete for a championship if kawhi Leonard goes down late in the season who will be there to pick up the slack they don't have anyone by the deadline to trade deadline the Los Angeles clippers need to go out and get some serious help that's my opinion I'm sticking to it 🤔🏀
Paul George to Wall George with all those bricks he's putting up!
720p again
I can't stop liking all the roasting comments XD
Paul George- “Those were all bad shots”
There needs to be a lowlights reel for a game where you only score 27 in a half.
They too worried about beating the Lakers and end up getting curb stomped by other teams in the west
The body language of the Clippers going up and down court just look like they don't give a Fuck their losing.
Wow 😳 damn 2020 champs my ass.   Only one real team in LA.   Lake show baby 👶.
Smoking dat clippers pack
This shit will made me 😡 rage quit 2k
Mavericks got all the highlights
Pg 13 cannot carry this clippers team! That’s a fact!  Curry needs more then klay Thomson to win a chip , facts.  Brooklyn nets win a chip next year, fact!!
8:48 Boban with the no-jump dunk.
Skip bayless on suicide watch
L M A O the clippers are trash idk y ppl keep giving them 2nd in the west, these dudes are not consistent.
Clippers gonna clip 🤷🏾‍♂️
Practice game
Nice to see the Celtics dominate the Brooklyn Nets.
The five Clippers starters, combined,  made ONE three point basket out of 19 attempts.    Paul George is in playoff game seven form.
Hahahaha Tang Ina puro highlights Ng mavs pandemic p is waving
"Expect Paul George to carry his team"
"that's a bad shot"-2019  "that's a bad team"-2020
Tyron lue suck HAHAHAHA😂
Balmer must b bangin his head in dis game
just looking at jerseys I thought it was spurs vs Celtics
My condolences to the clippers organization and their fans 🙏
Clippers basically gave up before Halftime.
What will be the reaction Of Skip
“Lol expect paul george to try to carry this team” that didnt age well
Clippers fans saying that they didn’t have Kawhi should remember that Mavs didn’t have their second best player either. Also Luka had an average game, Imagine if he didn’t...
We all know who got the Player 2 controller today. What a beatdown.
I can't wait to hear Skip and Shannon talk about this game tomorrow
https://youtube.com/channel/UCZC_3CbJeZhHM8YLZ4-1xOw
They were sweating to spoil Lakers' Ring Night, they forgot the NBA had 28 more teams to worry about lol.
Let's go George Paul 😂
Clippers....what was that??
This is Dallas Mavericks highlights. 🤣🤣🤣
I dont wanna hear nothing about no paul george ever again!!
Just imagine the score being 51-0. That’s how bad this is
wow! Clippers in play off mode 🔥
TICKET TV:I JUST GOT A TEXT THAT SAID LEBRON MADE THE CLIPPERS LOSE!!!NOW SUCKA,THIS YALL KING?🤢
Meanwhile LAKERS defeated MAVS with a large lead. Then u say FLIPPERS is better than LAKERS. duh stop dreaming flippers fans.
I think Clippers is so lazy they don't even defend well in this game haha
now we know how much carrying kawhi does for the clippers.
Those clippers sure loves breaking records.lmao
Talk about a beat down.
Clippers up 2-0: STOP THE COUNT!
WTF HAHAHA
ON PRESEASON THE LAKERS WIN WITHOUT LEBRON AND AD VS THE CLIPPERS HAHAHAAHHAHAHA PANDEMIC P IS WAVING
I wish kawhi leaves this team and take serge with him to go to a better one
Yall know playoff p, now introducing paul george in general.
6:37 - freaked me out
El fucking Boban 😂
NBA 2k21 CPU difficulty: Rookie
Where was Beasleys shit talking now?
In way off P we trust
Really guys, is this the championship clippers or what? Chemistry won’t be the excuse this year, they’ll say its maths and social studies next time. Lmao
They scored 27 points in 24 minutes. What was I watching? Did the Clippers open the floor to the WNBA to play for them?
All the defensive credentials given to the Clippers and they can't barley guard Luka. They just see him pass by. 😂
If that was a boxing match, someone would’ve had to stop it. 🤜🏾💥🤕
Clippers score 2 points.  Trump: stop the count, clippers claim this game. They won.  Mavericks stomp the clippers. Trump: this game was rigged. Clippers actually won if you only count their points.
When you play your pops on an old school 2k:
8:58 A big lead flex by Boban.
The Clippers made sure that everybody knows they are the biggest joke in NBA history.
Imagine paying for these seats to watch your favorite team get blown by 50 at half!! LOL same ole Clippers....oh wait good thing tickets weren't sold..
JESUS CHRIST
hey, atleast the clippers lead 2-0 in the game
Mavericks vs LA g league team
Josh Richardson was such a good acquisition for the Mavs. He’s a great role playing guard/wing. With Hardaway and Finney-Smith, Luka is getting plenty of help
1:45 shoulda been a 2 smh no wonder clipps lost
Wahaha damn thats was 40 points the largest lead 😂🤣
YEEEEERRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!😬😬😬😬  CLIPPERS ARE FLUUUUUUUUUKKKKKKKESSSSS!!!!!
As a diehard lakers fan ima try to say a couple nice bout these clippers highlights for once..Zubac looks alot faster now .and..um yea that's it dawg..👌😢🤣🤣
Intro boys flips
Is this NBA 2k Rookie difficulty?
0:23 LMAO
That’s just embarrassing
Wow🤣😂🤣🙈
Historic moment for the Clippers!
I can't wait for Undisputed tomorrow
Without Kawhi , Clippers are just the Pistons 😂
am I colorblind or are the Mavs wearing GREEN  This does NOT look good at all
Kawhi out, its only the regular season, we didnt want to embarrased the Lavriq so we let them win, wait till playoffs  Wlippers 2021 champions
No heart clippers 😂🤣
Clippers are overrated.
Stay down lion heart he's gon kill you!
Maaaan they got their asses kicked 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thats a bad shot
Clippers team still choking
Powell should grab 10 rebounds every game
Dam remember when PG 13 was respected as a player with the pacers. Now you can’t even take announcers serious when they say “ expect Paul George lead the team while Kawhi is out” 😂😂😂
Lock In 😂😂😂😂
Fraud George is back.
A whole different team without the claw. Way off P can lead a team #sorrynotsorry They lose kawhi will leave
Ladiesss and Gents! I present to thee ....The San Diego Slippers and George Paul!!Lakergang 4 life fam!Leave L.A🤣🤣🤣
pathetic!
Lol pandemic p lol dudes a joke
this is a 2k score
0:35 luka aint good at high fives
Change the title to "Dallas Mavericks full game highlights"
THIS IS THE CLIPPERS I KNOW. Are we in the playoffs ?
paul george: i want to retire as clippers uniform this is home  Clippers Gm.: i think you should retire now or else retire to other team.
This is what you called "Lakers Effect"
Los Angeles Ricky bakers these cats got murdered like the Black American dream in Boyz N the Hood
Now tell me it's Docs fault. He should've made adjustments
Shiiiiiiiiiiit. Wait till playoffs start. WCF here we come 🦸🏾‍♂️
Kawhi definitely needs to leave next year, these guys don't have it in them.
It wasn’t DOC after all
Mark Cuban is the best owner in the league, him getting hype on the sidelines for a dunk is all I need in my life.

this man is paid a quarter of a billion
Move the Clippers to Montana to take the pressure off them
no kawhi + Pandemic P = No game. I can imagine paul george thinking all of their shots was "Bad Shot"
Is PG13 still suffering from depression? What is his excuse this time?
Just set my DVR to record Undisputed tomorrow morning!!
Pg13% woke up felling dangerous  15 pts 4/13 fg  0/6 3pt  LOST BY 50+ POINTS
Forget rookie mode. This was the tutorial for 2k.
Murder! Haha
I can’t wait to hear Shannon Sharp clown Skip tomorrow 😂🤣
Clippers built only to defeat Lakers
With the first pick in the draft, the Clippers select...Carlton Banks from Bel Air Academy.
tyron lue has been fired as head coach..
wow Clippers set another record 😂😂😂
Gooood Night!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂
51 though!? ........"How Sway???? How???"
The Mavs had gotten away with manslaughter in front of many witnesses 😐
Bad Shot
The game is so boring to watch, blowout by 51 points, it really shows that PG13 is nothing...
Who will pg blame now
PG max contract is now retracted.
Clippers trash 🗑 😂😂😂
Varsity vs freshman
Time to fire Ty Lou.
I dont know who more busted Kawhi Lenards mouth or the whole clippers team ball game vs the maverick
why clipper suddenly becomes a piece of shit?
44 point lead with 5 minutes left in the second quarter.  Clippers should be embarrassed.  They just gave no effort.
When you're playing association as the Mavs but you're in rookie difficulty 😂😂😂
No Leonard, big problem. 💯🔥
The fact that the Mavs kept in their key players even after they were up by 40 is hilarious 😂🤣😂
Yikes.. talk abt a beat down !
They gotta be playing on pro looking bad for the clippers they year already over with
Somebody has to get fired or traded after this game. How does Ty Lue have zero plays to get his players easy points or at least get them to the foul line. Seems like Ty Lue's whole career was made by LeBron James. Damn.
Dificulty mode CLIPS :Rookie
Shitttttttt. LeBron, you wanna reunite me with Montrezl?  I gotchu on free wings for life no 🧢
Paul George is gonna be like those we're bad shots
Man this can't be Pandemic P. ☹This gotta be Vaccine PAUL😂😂👍
“Your opponent has left the match “
Where all the clipper fans talking smack against Lakers and blazers but then but then getting destroyed.  If you guys have bad games like this heading to playoffs y'all going to get eliminated if you don't step it up
It's the Spirit of Christmas and Thanksgiving,
What do you expect. Pandemic P +Ty Lue - Klaw = L
UP NEXT UNANG BALITA YEAR END 2020 PRESENTED BY GINEBRA SAN MIGUEL
The title of this video should be the dallas mavericks highlight
If Mavs made zero point in the entire 2nd half Mavs still can win four points! Luka's 3-point % does not look good, need warm up!
Doc would have never let them lose by 51...
It’s just one game, but something has to be said today. They need to have a serious talk. It don’t even look like they cared yo
playoff peepee showing up early! lukas a stud
Skiiiiiiuuuuuuuupp
I swear. Watching this you’d think the title was “Mavericks 51 point blowout Highlights” don’t even seem like the clips touch the ball in these clips (no pun intended lol)
Wow. 205M and you score 15 pts in a 50 pt blowout that you were on the court most of the game for. Wow.
NBA GAMES IS BROGHT TO YOU BY GINEBRA SAN MIGUEL SAN MIGUEL BEER END HOPE
Pg13 " Coach Ty did not do any adjustments ".
Ty Lue effect
Bobo tambak
Clippers ain't going no where this year either, they need to change up the roster this team will never make the western conference finals
Nothing makes me happier than this.
wheres the clowns who were backing that bullsht about Doc Rivers being the problem? ...and how Ty Lue..the same guy on the bench last year will be so much better this year as head coach. Bet by years end the same people will be calling for Lue's head. clippers should have gave them the coach they really want.
The Clippers management needs to sue all these "players", this is false advertising.
Lakers in 5
mavericks full game highlights 🤣
Pg ain’t shit without somebody by his side 😂😂😂
The Mavericks could have scored 0 points In the 2nd half and still would have won LOL.
Just proves how much of an impact Kawhi is to get this shit to the second round last season 😂
why does it look like boston vs spurs?
Woulda been pissed if I bought tickets to this 😭 horrible
this is like when you crush yo homie in 2k
So kwhai goes out n they losing by 50 tho smh I’d wanna quit after this game fuck that 😂😂😂😂
Luka hitting fadeaways now?
This is some 2K 💩
White nba fans are ruining basketball 😒
The Mavs looked like the Harlem Globetrotters out there
New covid new pandemic p
Hahahah tambak clippers nila chamba lng panalo nila sa lakers
My dumbass thought this was celtics vs nets.
No Leonard Yes problem
Gs fan:Donny worry clippers ,dallas did it to us too last season
Skip bayless is gonna look like a damn fool about this game..they may not even bring it up since the cowboys won..the show 90 percent will be about them
pg13 % back at it building mansions🤣
Please don’t blame it on the coach
Pandemic P, Lakers 2021 Back To Back Champs
Porzingis is smiling. Making money without playing lol...
GoMavs
Its all montrezz fault!!
Change the title to MAVERICKS FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS LMAO
Sheesh 😳
DAMNN😭, wa happens when Kwahi doesn’t play
What impresses me is that James Johnson can also facilitate and setup the offense. Josh and Tim needs to keep it up to fill in for KP's absence. #letsgoMavs
Lol 😂😂
dallas celtics
King ina clippers choke  Wag na kayong maglaro mga gunggong Buwaya si paul george🖕🖕🖕🖕
"initiate surrender"
I thought warriors has the worst game of 30+points lose... But guess what LA clippers lose with 50+points??? This is worst than i thought...
We're gonna sew how good Ty Lou is this season. We all know his only ring is coz of Bron.
Everything went right for the Mavericks. Everything went wrong for the Clippers.
This happened last 2 szns in mavs vs jazz game. 56 point lead, the energy of the mavs were so different it was really hyped. I suggest go watch that game
🤣🤣🤣
Raptors would have pulled off another comeback and send Mavs into another dimension
The fuck is this game holy
I've never seen any team in the NBA get blown out like that in my entire life
when you're grinding badges on 2k
This is what happens when a team doesnt have kawhi...
My god it's murder
This the clippers everyone hyped about?
PG is a great leader, leading by example! If I miss you miss too!
Steven A. says its not fair to have a good white point guard that can pass to all the shooters.
Clippers seems to be making history most of the time.
The commentator's famous last words "I expect Paul George to carry this team"
2:02 a single made free throw was a Clipper highlight
So this Clippers team is gonna beat the Lakers?!
"DoC is THe ProBLem"
Shits all scripted nonsense
Boban: Gets the ball 8:34 Me: GET IT BOBAN, FUCK YES!
The mavs scored more points in the 1st half (77) than the clippers (73) the entire game
I lost by 50 points b4. It was on 2k tho😏
Maybe after this performance kahwi might be front runner for mvp 🤣😂🤣
Is this the worst team performance in NBA history?
lvl99 ovr players vs players that just realized basketball is a game.
What happen to clippers hahahha
mavs skyCrapers
Mavericks had on rookie custom sliders turnt up to 100 i see😂😂🤣
WTF   Paul George
Pandemic Pee
Pg13  his single player not for the team
Great win celtics 😂
Clippers should be investigated
This is the team last year that everyone expected to compete on the finals😂😂
Club  shay shay tonight at 10pm to celebrate 🍾
God, that sequence at 7:23 is so fucking SMOOTH.
The NBA should have a mercy rule in place for games like this 😂
Paul George you are one of my favorite players but goddamn you been acting trash can you go back to being a mvp and dpoy candidate 😂😂
Mavs lead 45+ Rookies and other rotation players: It's free real estate
PUT THE MASK OVER YOUR NOSE MARK CUBAN
These jerseys got me fucked up, why the Nets getting smashed by the Celtics?
hahah what a stupid coach clippers has.
No suprise we loses this bad. Like Kawhi said we need a true playmaker, Kawhi is the team best passer without even trying and with him gone there’s no balanced offense
What the hell happened to clippers
Rename: Mavericks VS Brgy. GINEBRA 😭😭
What a beat down
So he's out but you still play like champions. This is the players fault. No way do champs tuck their tail between  their legs and submit to a beating, like this. Where'the fu...... Character.I dont think they will be champs, no character!
No OT tonight
There is No Claw
Clippers looking Deadly😈
Mavericks played great on both ends
It is almost a Mavs Highlights game
George is overrated
"Players Club" P hasn't been the same since he wifed the skripper
All we going to hear is kawaii was out hahahaha....wack ass clippers
You can see in this game..the way luka drives to the basket, actually not only him everyone...you can tell they were mad after losing 2 games...they sent a message to doubters after this game
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
Where was sweet sauce Lou.?? 🤣😂😂
“The NBA isn’t on rookie difficulty like 2k”  Mavs: Watch this...
thats crazy. the second kawhi is out, they get their shit pushed in lol cant wait to see first take tmrw haha
So many bricks I can build a mansion in Minecraft.
Well a umm i don’t think clippers will be good with out  Kawhi Leonard
This is 2k literally
Paul George isn’t a superstar and people need to stop hyping this man up. He’s had good games yes, but so has Jeremy Lin, lance stevenson, his own teammate Lou Williams, and this list could go on and on. PG is more of a 6th man and should be at most running the bench squad with little to no playtime in a 4th quarter cause the dude is as clutch as a Hyundai. Stop hyping his name stop overpaying the dude, stop trading entire rosters away, start benching the dude.
Expect pg13 to carry his team 😂😂😂😂
Ole Side Board George back at 🤦🏿‍♂️
Poor'aul george 😂😂😂
yan ang dallas ko d kalakasan pero may laban
50+ lead?! is this Highschool vs Allstar?
Playoffs is still far. And way off P is already back.
The clippers said the mags were familiar with staples center that’s why they won
Why was Luka playing with that kind of lead...what if he got hurt????smh
How can the clippers be this bad without Leonard? Team is a joke. Mavs look good, they'll be scary once porzingis gets back
Shannon Sharpe is gonna be grinning ear to ear tomorrow
Without kahwi on clippers and without porzingis on Mavs
Kawhi's MVP stock level just went up like crazy lol
Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip 😂😂😂 Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip 🤣🤣🤣
Mans should go for Ingram
USA vs Gilas Pilipinas 😂
No kawhi,  BIG BIG problem
This was fucking terrible
Goodbye TL again
The Mavericks were fuckin cookin them 😂
Kawhi is a leader. When he is grinding out there everyone else follows suit. Tonight is a perfect example of how important Kawi is to this team.
Clippers: "Pops trippin man, he wants me to ask to show the Clippers highlights too. You know I wouldn't trip."  Deebo: "What highlights?!"
I thought this was nets and Celtics it's confusing
Paul George "i should be at least a 92-93 rating on 2k" Pandemic P "Imma about to end this man's whole career"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk1l_y0VaJo&ab_channel=Y2KSports
DAMMNNN!!
I still love your paul george
It’s dock rivers fault right ?
Clippers are only build to beat the Lakers. I can see another early exit in the playoffs
LMAOOO
How are grown professionals down by 50 at the half and proceed to lose by 50!
this is why mavs couldve beat the clippers if porzingis was available.. clippers are overrated... dont go overboard saying they are the biggest threat to the lakers....  they need to get pass other teams first... Stephen A. Smith Sucks
Clippers Opening Champion 2020-2021
Commentator1: 60 to 18 lead! Commentator2: HAHA 😂😂
"Now that Kawhi is out, expect Paul George to carry this team” Oh No No No PepeLaugh
🤣🤣🤣🤣
We Beat them in the playoffs so i aint trippin ✌
You mean mavericks basketball clinic highlights. 🤔
Commentators laughing 😂🤣 pandemic P just a bad shot 💩
Bruh in this yall team that think gone beat lakers in a 7 games hell naw
Who Paul George blamed now 😂
Revenge mode on Dallas is ON
Pandemic P with a history
George has been weak since he changed from waves to braids...get rid of that hairstyle same for steph...
what’s up with these jerseys. thought this was a bucks and nets game
The devilish corn optically dry because fish socioeconomically copy on a cute manx. aware, right hill
Wtf did the mavs and bucks trade jersey color all of a sudden?
Mavis coaching strategy for the game:   Don't hit the side of the backboard like Pandemic Pee and we'll win BIG.
Shannon Sharpe: Clippers lost by 50 Skip Skip: Lebron air balled a FT ok Christmas
If your girl wins in 2k  , she gets to go through your phone 😅
Hold up!!😂😂 Luka lookin LeBron out there.
PH VS USA BE LIKE 🤣
It’s funny to think ibaka caused this
"imagine last playoff without kawhi vs a healthy mavs"...
Upcoming news: “Paul George has added Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks as his desired trade destination teams.”
Tell me how they beat the Lakers then lose by 50 👀
This should just be Dallas Mavs highlights lol.
This game is the example of “professional vs Highschool team”
The saddest thing is that the Clippers didn't even fight back. They just accepted a 50 point deficit.
Breaking news: Skip Bayless is taking Monday off due to tonight's blowout loss!
This only shows you that Kahwi is the king of LA
Did i just watched nba 2k21 Highlights with Game difficulty : Rookie 😂
Did Paul George get hit or kawai
.wadu hek
Clippers were only outscored by 1 in the second half. All good.     😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
PG 13% back at it
I thought that was the celtics🤣
With the discovery of the UK mutated COVID-19 virus, it appears pandemic p is fully recharged and ready to suck. Edit: I see pat bev going ham and making unnecessary shooting fouls again. Lmao how this chump win nba all defence team awards
Damn that score social distances better than me
Clippers turns into flippers
Will the clippers get past the second round this season
Well damn
can’t wait to hear shannon sharpe on this
How does this even happen to a professional team?
"Serge Ibaka fault" PG
Fucking dismantled
Tell me how they beat the Lakers then lose by 50 👀
These teams need to stick with there original jersey color. celtics vs spurs lol
Haha wow this is for last time the clippers blew out the mavs in the playoffs. Th is is just pure destruction
poor clips.  now evry other team.will try to duplicate what the mavs did.
PG13 Freaking sucks! I mean damn! How do you lose by 50 points? 15+ OK, but 50+ Ty Lue needs to be fired and PG13 needs to be traded for this shitty ass performance!
2K21 ps5 difficulty mode: rookie
Wayoff P is in the building!
Commentator at the start 💪😤 After 51pt lead 🙂🙃😶
Clippers sucks!
Just wow!
Clippers offense is a disaster
What’s up Bev? 🤣
Clippers probably ain't gon make the playoffs this season! Hella trash!
Paul George and the clippers in playoff form already.
The biggest margin of a loss in a NBA game was by 55 points Jazz at Bulls NBA finals 1997 in Chicago. SMDH
dammmnnnnnnn 🤭😂😂😂
195M contract. Stop it 🤣😂😅
doc rivers
I can't wait for Undisputed tomorrow
So what was that about the Clippers? LUL "124 to 73 is the final score as Dallas wins today by FIFTY ONE!" lmao it just sounds like a comedy scene
I know Kawload is out but common loosing by 51 points.
George Paul needs to step up. Simple as that. If Kawhi knew Paul was going to play like this he would have stayed in Toronto.
Lol this clippers team is only build to beat the Lakers, they forgot that there's 28 other teams in the NBA.. 😂😂They probably lose in the playoffs like last year and we won't see the battle of LA again... Hhaha
after PG scores 33+pts .. Lol PANDEMIC P IS BACK
Jesus. Kawhi not being there should not have that big of an impact on the team. I can see them losing by 10-15 points. Hell, 20 would have even been too much for them to have lost by. But 50 plus?! Pathetic. Kawhi, get the hell out of there as soon as you can.
190 million dollars GUARANTEEEEEEEDDDDDDD...
Look like a game of 2k played on rookie
"I wasn't even trying"
How you get 21 in the 1st quarter
This look like a high school game😂😂😂😂
How did Dallas went to 37 to 36 points ? wtf
I saw this score at halftime looking like an exhibition game vs some country I've never heard of.
@5:00 smh 😭
Should be renamed “Mavericks highlights”
Enemy concedes deafeat 😂
The most forbidden documentary in history, “Europa The Last Battle” at archive dot org https://archive.org/details/EUROPATheLastBattle
They had this game set on rookie with all sliders attributes maxed out
Bubu ang coach ng lac,,
Best believe Kawhi gonna leave if they keep playing like this lol.
Mavs treated this game  like A JV vs varsity scrimmage smh
Pat Bev a good defender? Luka lit him up 😂😂
I'll watch this beating all day🤣🤣🤣
Wonder what will Skip have to say 2morrow at undisputed.
I have to say...they do get up to play the Lakers though!
Wow
When you play 2k on rookie mode
Mark Cuban was feelin himself
7:20 is so dirty lmao
Profesional vs local
Paul george trade at bitcoins 😂😆
I hate this game all they want basketball
Atleast PG13 admit that lost is he's fault, than curry
Mavericks get up for Clippers like Clippers get up for Lakers... Lakers In 5 🤣
besides Paul and Kwahi.  This team has not real 3rd option.  Lemon Pepper Lou should have started.  Too much iso in the clippers not enough ball movement
8:45 that’s not even fair lmao
the disrespect at 7:28
Never forget The Clippers were once AHEAD, 2-0.
well, well, well, flippers fans be crying that kawaii is gone that they lost but aren't y'all forgetting you still have a "superstar" in Pandemic P? lmao Also Lue isn't a coach, as much as Doc is overrated TLue is a downgrade from him. If you're a Flippers fan and consider this loss a fluke because Kawaii is injured, Mavericks isn't responsible for that. They aren't responsible for Kawaii to be elbowed by his own teammate, don't forget that in the playoffs Mavs has KP rarely in the playoffs and Morris is injuring Luka, you would've been outed the first round lmao
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no no no
Feel bad for anyone saying clips were makeing the finals lol they look worse than a college team and there only down one guy lol.
The lazy smash paradoxically blush because twine radiographically warn along a rude mexican. natural, fanatical riddle
Luka>Paul George
COVID 13
The mavs had so many steals that i lost all my hoes in the process
Nah this is a preason game.damn wtf is this for real
This wasn’t a clippers loss as much as a dallas win tbh. They just look fucking amazing out there. Such good chemistry and talent. I hope the win this year and Luka get the recognition he deserves.
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo AAAAAHHHHHHHAAAAAAA HA HA HA HA HA AH AHA HAAAAAAAA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAAAAAA!!!!!
Paul George is in Karma for leaving Pacers.
Kawhi gets  injured Paul George not gonna handle 15 points*it Luka donakick” without porzingus 24 points destroyed clippers Luka >Paul geroge
This is hilarious all you clipper fans like this matters you guys will always be the team you were in the playoffs last year
Massacre
How do you respond, after you've been blown out by an opposing team? You put it behind you, tear off that page, and move on to the next game, PERIOD!!!
Clips got obliterated
wasn’t my fault we lost
Playoff P came out early 😂😂😂
What even is this highlight 😂 should have just been mavs highlight 😂😂😂
2k21, person vs easy AI
For a minute I thought this was a Celtics vs Spurs game by the jersey colors....
Yo who turned the game on rookie??? 77-27??? Thats crazy!
this the same clippers that clapped the lakers smh
Yess sirrr
I told you, paul george is nothing but a pony. Hahaha
Just in case you forgot who pandemic p is lol
George Paul is back!!!
so this is the big threat against the lakers? DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNN
the l.a clippers just played one of the worst games in nba history:  only four clippers scored in the first half 77-22 halftime score(largest in history) down by 47 points heading in the 4th clippers shot 12.1% from.3point line pandemic p 0-6 3P 4 turnovers   source:basketball forever fb page
Wtf was I watching the clippers just got whipped
Batum is a curse. Y'all are about to learn the hard way. Good luck, Clippers fans.
Its a blow out happy new years guys. 😂😂😂🧨🧨🧨🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Clipper defence social distancing
🤣🤣🤣
Is this mavericks highlights? Haha
Finally, Pandemic P has come back home
Mannnn I remember watching one of those hot take videos with one of the hot takes claiming that PG will be the league MVP leading the clippers to the best record in the NBA.
Just imagine with KP on the floor...
They got lucky paul george and kawhi didn’t play
PG should take a vaccine now
I was like watching in Olympics basketball, where USA fought in Nigeria back in 2012-2013 something 🤣🤣🤣
I therfore conclude that this clippers team is no better without Kawhi.. Better trade PG in exchange of Vince Carter
In PG's defense, this is just the regular season, so Playoff P is nowhere to be found.
Clippers only get up for the Lakers. What a eyesore of a game
New ahievement unlocked
Fired Ty lue ASAP, this fool thinks he’s Phil Jackson. call time out🤦🏾‍♂️
If your old enough to remember, this ain't nothing new...This is just the Clippers being the Clippers. They're fucking cursed...This trash should not be allowed to call Staples Center home as Kobe once did 💛💜
Basically a Mavericks highlight play reel.
Luka has mastered the one legged fadeaway
Scores don't always tell the story. That 50 point half time lead wasn't as bad as stat sheet says lol
Clippers without Kawhi = Chinese League team
That last dunk by the center that didn’t leave ground was the scariest thing about this loss 😳
why are the mavs jerseys green? shits kinda pisses me off
max contract on paul george? bwahaah! its a disastah
That was pathetic
The married apology phongsaly blush because target analytically deceive among a lavish roast. same, inconclusive lobster
Good day to be a Mavs and Cowboys fan 🙏🏼
Luka lez go
flippers.....
Nothing but shame!
Mavericks playing a G league team .
I thought this is 2k 😬
It’s crazy!
Boy, that escalated quickly.
shannon sharpe bout to crazy tomorrow 😂
Why was there a Mavs practice in the Lakers stadium? 🤣🤣🤣
Paul George carried, alright. Helped the Mavs to victory.
Well you look at here: pandemic P on his natural habitat.   *english accent
BIGGEST BRUH MOMENT
hahaha nakakatawa ang clippers tinambakan....sabi ni pg maganda dw kondisyon nya ngaung season....maganda tambakan...😂🤣✌️✌️✌️✌️
Mavericks beated the Clippers final score in the first half 77 mavs - 73 clippers pg has to carry and average like 35
Them boys got double dubbed smh😂
What highlights?
Your opponent has left the match🤣🤣
& this the team the Lakers should be worried about? Lmfaooooooo
I blame the refs for that ass whooping. Just like in boxing that crap should have been stopped.😂🤣😂#RSC....
Paul George going out like Roy Hibbert 😂😂
PG's excuses are about to be legendary
The Clippers are cursed they will never win a championship
They shouldn't pay this guy Kawhi Leonard he's taking days off what the hell it didn't work last year
The clippers played like someone might take a test on a book they didn’t read
Paul George is literally stealing money 💰 at this point
"If he's gonna score 89% of their points their gonna lose the game."  "He's gonna have a Wilt Chamberlin"   LMFAOOO
At least Wayoff pee couldin't dissipont anyone in the playing like this
I'm dead 💀 🤣 😂 😭 😩 😅 💀 on,,literaly lost the game from half time smh..I swear i will pay Clippers fan no attention 😤 bruh,don't say nothing to me bc I can't hear y'all at this point.
Lakas ng inter L.A🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pandemic P signed an extension lately and lost a 50 pt game LMAO
Ohhhh Shannon sharpe finna have a field day with this😂😂
Thats a beating...I've never seen anything like ! in the first half alone...77-27??? How!!??? 50pt game??
This Game Made History WHAT!! A DEFICIT
why does this look like a Celtics spurs game
74 to 27 at the END of second quarter?? EVERYONE is fired. Gimme Prime Chino Hills.
PG13% couldn't wait to let clippers fans down again
Oh nah game winner was crazy 😭😭https://youtu.be/VLosfhvZo98
I guess doc was the problem lol
Dallas was mad they lost on Xmas that all
Flippers have always been frauds, they need to get evicted from LA. Man but Luka gets all the superstar calls from day 1.
Paul.. paul.. paul... why?
clippers bench starting to get exposed lol
Looking like the YMCA Clippers
Clippers team looking like a rec team
Tyronn Lue replace Doc Rivers
Doc river's laughing his ass out🤣
@ the people who thought tye lue was a good coach
My Detroit Pistons are the worst team in league and are tanking for Cade but I know damn well they wouldn’t of lost by 50. Wow.  Just wow.
Can't wait to see Shannon's face hahahahaha
Godamm 😭😭😭😭
Kinda feel bad for em lol 😂
I like how a lot of people are talking shit about this team but if they played in this game they wont say shit
It logical to think that any team can falter, when one of its "main pillar" has a crack. However, if the absence of LEONARD cause such an epic loss, then I am quite worried about The CLIPPERS, and WORRIED I am! The other abstracts akin to Leonard's facial injury on Xmas day, are empathy and sorrow. I hope he gets recuperated as quickly as possible...with enough time to re-congeal with the team and compete accordingly. Best wishes to ALL the fans and NBA players this day onwards!
Pandemic P🤩🤩
what a shit show
This was not just on paul george. Pat Bev is the only guy trying on defense. Zibach or whatever his name is should not be in the game if that's how he is going to play
Na check the sliders bro they cheating
If it wasn't for the refs the mavs would've eliminated the Clippers from the Playoffs
Luka looks like he’s gaining weight
This look like a 2k game 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Damn Ty Lue showing how great a coach he is it makes sense why nobody would sign him I'm pretty sure Paul George first response to the loss will be it was Ty Lue fault we loss as Jerry West would say its a shit show 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The warriors is the worst team early this season.  Clippers:hold my beer
"BACKBOARD P" IS JUST PATHETIC OMFG 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭!!!!
wtf?!! is this and NBA game?!
It's a record
Pandemic P = 🐐 😆🤣😂😹
PG is blaming Serge Ibaka right now
This is what Playoff P meant when he said he’s back to his “MVP season” self💀💀💀
wow this was just embarrassing...
So Clippers have : Kawhi Leonard and Luke Kennard...  So easy to mix up the names
Clippers are an embarrassment to LA 3 1 leed blown and now a losing by the most in a game by 51 glad their leaving staples and taking those selfies off the real banners
Paul george....   Paul george. listen to me when i say this YOU ARE TRASH.
Did anyone really think Kawhi could put a winning team together.  Kawhi would not know a winning team even if he wins a championship with them
Paul George: “I’ll give em 15 points to make it look like I tried”
It's a massacre...
Hahahaha dalawang buwan ang lamang...chokers ka talaga flippers
Could’ve been highlights of all LA points and the video would be half the length
Luka Doncic with that mid range
I see the Clippers in playoff form already huh
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Skip tomorrow: “THIS JUST SHOWS YOU HOW VALUABLE THE BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE KAWHI  LEONARD IS, WITHOUT LeFRAUD THE LAKERS WOULD HAVE LOST BY 60!” Also he’ll try and say since the lakers lost to the clippers and then the clippers got blown out by a team the lakers blew out that it makes the lakers look even worse.
Clippers = And1 1997 squad
Atleast the Clippers won the 3rd quarter in points scored: 30-27
clippers just a joke 😂😂
I knew it was a matter of time before playoffs PG show up.
Classic Clippers
Ty As the coach is great am I right?
Chai
Luka Doncic 24 pts, Josh Richardson 21 pts, Tim Hardaway 18 pts, Paul George 18 pts, Serge Ibaka 13 pts.
*how you have one of the best teams and predicted to win the championship or at least go far in the playoffs yet hold the league record for the WORST loss in the last 65 years? HOW SWAY!?* 👀
62-18? Wtf.lol
Looking like NBA Dallas vs HS Basketball
Jesus 😳😂😂😂
Its new corona virus strain. Pandemic P is being affected
Coaching and the locker room is the issue on the clippers. Fire Lue, get Mark Jackson his old school system of the warriors before is suitable on their roster. Go back to basics.
If kawhi play he must score 52 points to win.
No Kawhi  No Problem tyronlue suck
If KP played, Clippers would be totally destroyed.
I legit thought 77-27 was photoshopped when I saw it on Twitter, so I had to see the highlights myself
Dallas is Burning!
I was Born in L.A & Obviously Not! a clippers fan but Damn! Bro. I was even Embarrassed for them hehe Not!. And this the team that's supposed to Challenge the Lakers in the West! , 1Super Star short isn't an excuse to be humiliated as such, Lakers with either AD or Lebron can handle the Mavs believe that!
Wow, what an azz whipin! Down 60 in the second quarter. Pretty sure I’ve never seen that before. Not in the NBA anyway. Love it when the Clippers get destroyed.
https://youtu.be/IhVqjFKRHmY
Mavs first half 77: LAC game 73: Oh my lol
Y’all surprised?
Lou Williams only plays 9mins. Ty Lue is DOING DRUGS!!!
When you switch the difficulty to rockie
All that money, Bummer rewarded P.G less than a month ago and P.G going to blame today's game on a Christmas hang over. 😆😆. If he would have at least got his buckets and they lost by 50, i wouldn't blame him for the lost. But 15 points( 7 shots) that's pathetic.
All that money and  Paul George cant even make it competitive. Kawhi will leave next season.
Kawhi probably is thinking about playing for the Lakers next year well if they still want him.
Anyare sa inyu bqt kayu nag pa tambak na ganyan nga nga
CLIPPERS DON'T WANNA BE THERE
The rematch will be very interesting. 🤔🤔🤔
Don't let Pandemic P distract you from the fact that J Cole went platinum with no features
Wow! What a blowout. No Kawhi No Kway!
The Clippers made history today but for the bad part.
Luka is making sure his team mates get some points to
Was that an exhibition match?
actually terrible defense, giving the Mavs so much space and not contesting on so many shots. Just watching the opponent shot and hope they miss.
So basically I'm going to watch the mavs score on the clippers 90% of the vid? Lets goo fuckkk clippers !! 💛💜
What the hell?. Is this L.A Clippers. Ahahahahhaah
Holy crap! Dallas looking really good.
Wow the Maverick destoryed the Clippers 77- 27 in the first half
Not surprising it’s the clippers led by pandemic p or curious George or backboard p
62:18 at second quarter?
What do you tell your team when you down by 50?
When you reverse boost.
CANT WAIT TO HEAR FROM UNCLE SHAY SHAY!!!🤣🤣🤣
Paul George said after the loss that's it's is no big deal sounds very familiar when he said last years collapse wasn't a big deal and it didn't matter that kinda altitude proves that Paul George isn't a franchise top dog and can't lead a team to a chip
Way Off P played well for the Mavericks tonight.
People still think Luka is not a Top 5
We talkin about fifty? 57?
WTF
I play a ton of Basketball. cool video. go jazz blazers celtics
Bro, this is the Clippers I know growing up! Always losing with double digits.
Shannon is going to assassinate skip tommorow
Rookie Mode on 2K! 😅
What happen PG? Without Kawhi you can't your team lol.
No Kawhi its a problem.😪
Clipps u trippin
These numbers by Kawhi and PG13 looking pretty bubbly     Pun intended
LoL hating pg when its him scoring most of the pts in 1st half and his teamates just cant do anything on offense and defense its not just pg its a team lost🤣🤣🤣
Well at least the clippers made history 😭😂
Beatdown!!!!!!!
Confidence gives more confidence 👍
Just like what doc said, they have something to do with their offense.
Kawhi out because he got elbowed in the face? 🤔 Mj: hold my flu
Pandemic P for all star
Yo what
FLIGHT GON HAVE A MILLION VIEWS
where is Patrick beverly?
How deep is the bench? I mean shallow haha
This is the type of score you expect when Duke plays northeastern state tech community college 😂
Woooww. Impressive CHOKE at home. Damn, they really are consistent in terms of CHOKING. They out there setting the bar so high🤣
Uhmm... somebody tell Paul George it's not playoffs yet.
I had to stop at 5:08 the score  is 60 to 18 is this even NBA basketball clippers ain't shit
Damn PG was my favorite player   keyword: *WAS*
Dont play in your court its sucks gadeeeyyymmmm
Warriors is still better than clippers😅
60 points lead :( What a pandemic game :(
Mavs definitely making the western conference finals this year lol
Its big deal that paul george cannot carry a team since his in pacers😂😂😂
didn’t know i clicked on a mavs highlight video
New virus strain Pandemic P.
All clippers fans was crying watching this match... This is so embarrassing moment to LA CLIPPERS
Skip has to have 50 excuses why his beloved Clippers got their asses handed to them knowing Kawhi's absence is # 1 reason.
Do the Clippers even ball bro?
Kawhai
i'm sure it was Doc Rivers' fault..
Man Handled
PG has been bunz for so long I dont understand why everyone thinks paul is a all star
That's the worst game. What the heck 51 points lead by Mavs, so it is  the  biggest lead in NBA history.😀😃😄
May God help the Clippers this season. They are going to need it.
Wow the clippers is a joke team
Dam. Kawahi is a very big piece for that team. Wtf is Paul doing?
What a nail biter too see if they would win by 50
Pandemic P opener hahahaha
What 73? Hahaha
No khawi big problem hahahah
All attributes of mavs was on, theyre just playing 2k and cheat mode😅
Did a tidal wave just go through Los Angeles?
And the clippers are gonna be the Lakers in a 7 game series?! Hahhaahah
Ty Lou: “let’s try defense” Clippers: Defense, what’s that?
With Kawhi out, Paul is not capable of carrying this clippers team.
Pandemic P episode 8 The Loss by 50 Points
Dallas Mavs full highlights
Oh man. Unc Shay Shay is gonna have a field day tomorrow!! Set your DVRs, people!
Clippers is weak That's the reason  Kawhi is not the excuse😂😂
Wow what the hell was the clippers doing open 3 after open 3 then some easy layups then some more 3s the whole game lmao terrible they are still in shock from loosing to the nuggets 3-1
Yo this was sooooo pathetic. Clippers fans must be sick. 💀
Travesty
Steve Ballmer lost a dollar bet with Mark Cuban.
boban wears 51 for that reason
I watch Luka first 3 games, He is developing the team first before itself, He is now evolving as a Team leader. Scoring is easy to him, That's why he is now a pass first guy before he shoot it. Good Job by Luka big thumbs up.
Shows you how bad Tyrone Lue is a coaching
easy money
The clipper curse is alive and well😈
PG 13 retire right now
Me playing 2k with rookie settings:
We should keep Clippers out of the playoffs conversation as far as the western conference finals goes. Lakers vs Blazers and east Brooklyn vs Miami
clippers should be ashame of themselve I see quit, quit, quit all over in this game
This is embarrassing. It’s not on the coach at all. Money should be taken away.
Bro that was sad💀
So, this is the team that's supposed to be a threat to the Lakers?🤣🤣🤣🤣
So ya can beat the Lakers, but not the Mavericks?
Its better to surrender.
can’t wait to watch skip and shannon tm lmao
I wonder who laughing the hardest the lakers or Doc rivers 🤣
Steve Balmer got scammed.🤣
Idgaf if they had no Kawhi, there is no excuse to get blown out by 50 before halftime.
Paul George will probably say “It’s Kawhis fault for getting injured”
You invest $226 million in Paul George you're result a 51 point loss
Paul George probably thought they were playing a playoff game. Coach should remind him its now regular season game.
Luka Domination,,,ive seen the Clippers look bad,but this is embarrassing..
Gotra rename this as Mavericks highlights lol
Doc rivers rubbing his hands like bird man right now!
Are you serious up by 40 in the 2nd quarter
Paul George is in full playoff form so early in the season 😖😬
Well at least they still got that opening season win banner to hang up!
And they get paid millions to lose by 50. Smh
The Clippers are trash.
HAHAHA WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS GAME
ThE cLiPpErS aRe A dEeP tEaM
Anybody thought that a drug test needed..just saying by the actions..lol lol..
Fire Ty Lue or else Clippers will suffer more like this.
bruh these scrubs lost against a kp-less mavs by 51 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Was Interested in the NBA at one time. NO LONGER!
They should have traded PG for a decent guard he is not the superstar that he once were in pacer. I would gamble with IT rather thatn PG inconsistencies if they can get DRose a much better option.
Damn I admire PG when he was in OKC, but now he struggles a lot and have many injuries
Should name it "Mavericks full game highlights"
Dont let this distract fron the fact that their coach is ty lue. We all know that guy's capablitiy as a coach he is shit
cant believe the lakers have trouble beating clippers but smoke dallas and dallas smokes Clippers even without Kawhi Dallas gives the Clippers a run for their money
Flippers Lmaoo
hahahaja where is the TRIANGLE OFFENSE HAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😅😀😁😂😂 its an ashamed
*Dallas Mavericks team highlights
To much team Mavericks for poor clippers.
Paul George can talk all he want but at games like this where he is the focal point of tje offense he always fail to deliver.
PG needed to step up big but flopped bad
Clippers should not be allowed to play in NBA. They look like G league team.
NBA just introduced the 31st team: The Local YMCA
Clippers are trash. Pandemic p is trash . LAKERS RUN LA #GETCLIPPERSOUTOFLA
Clippers are the Clippers and will always be the Clippers
By the 2qt they only scored 18-58
Bro wat is this 😂😂😂😂
What just happened?
PG13 is a joke choke
It’s like a hall of fame player playing 2k21 play now online vs a beginner player. No great passing, sloppy shooting, and sloppy coaching. Bad coaching perhaps. Annnnd the Mavericks lost to the lakers the other day. I have a feeling the lakers were just playin around with the clippers and expected to lost so they could figure out there team.
So Dallas decided to take their frustration to the other L.A. team
Someone should fire doc rivers
clippers gave the wrong guy the money
break the clippers up its over 😆
So PG13, signs a 5 yr $200+ million contract to participate in this genocide?
I'm here for the common 😂😂
those green mavs jerseys are awful
Is it me or is this game just a high school game to you?
One of the greatest ass kickings ever assembled the fans knew that they were going to lose so the fans didn’t show up
Clippers curse back at it
Thought i was on 💉 looking at this short 🎮..bless their ❤..mercy.
Mavs Just had the difficulty set to *Rookie*
How do people watch basketball? So boring, can't even touch the other person to defend and people get all hyped up when people dunk. Like what? What do you expect... the other team can literally do nothing about it with out getting a penalty. It's not that impressive. Maybe if the other team could push and hit you it would be impressive.
You could say it’s cuz they don’t have kawhi but then again the mavs don’t have kp and also kawhi not making that 50 point difference he woulda maybe got it down to 20
Clipper fans must have the highest of highs and the lowest of lows ever.   Hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
George Paul has returned
GM COACH SAID WHO GET HIGH POINTS we give bonus
Even the score is social distancing. Let that sink in guys 😂
Clippers was out of sync, maybe kawhi incident took a hit on them mentally..🧐
gamers: "cheat on" 😂😂
George Paul has returned
There's no fans to keep them engaged or motivated to fight for anything.  This was a pick up game
Damn pg still can't adjust hey blame it on "Doc" oops.
This is literally 2k in real life.
Rookie difficulty 😂
Nice to see some normalcy in the world with the clippers get dominated like the old days
And why media always overhyped those mtf chokers? Smh
🤔🤔🤔 so how does the Mavericks have 37 points at the end of the 1st quarter and then going to the 2nd quarter they end up with 36???
Chocked
Tyronn lue can’t handle the team
Not only do we want them out of our building but we want them to take the LA off their logo💯😂😂😂💯💜💛💜💛💜💛💜
Lol why did I think I clicked the Celtics vs Nets game at first cause the jerseys look so alike
Dont worry LA, theres still the Lakers and their savior Bron.
Go Mavericks
51 Points
Yo can the clippers even pass the second round in playoff lmao 😂,Paul george’s contract is too big
77 - 27. Alrighty then
The CPU difficulty was on Rookie that's why! 😂
Just disconnect the internet with this blow out! Oh I’m not watching 2k in rookie?! My bad
Pandemic P activated too early 🤣
And to everyone wanting to discount my Mavs by saying Kawahi was out. Well Kristaps Porzingas is out for us too 🤷
First it was Stephen Curry, now it's Luka Doncic... Clippers switching owners real quick
Damn child abuse this is someone call the cops.
One more of these, Ty Lue will start packing...😂😂😂
Pat Bev be tricking yall
They should have let me get in I could have made a shot
This message is for the clippers if you think you built your team to beat Lakers you won’t be able to win a championship because you not gonna face Lakers for all 71 games
REAL CHOKE...CLIPPERSSSS
Thanks for showing up...
Tyrod Lue is BACK!
Kwawang clippers..hahaha
Thought this was bucks vs spurs for a sec
This is Doc rivers fault!
Lets all admit, Lebron Legoat of this league still no question 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do you think the "defense" chant track is getting tired?
"Lets run it back next year" - Paul George
Where the hellis f’kn mvp year paul George haha lmfao
The front running fraud of L.A. 😂 Laughing stock of the NBA. With or without Kawhi no excuses for this massacre!
MVP candidate no second Star.
11-12 Bobcats >Clippers🤣
This just like a mycareer game right here
Its Maverick Highlights
stg 2k graphics get better every year wtf
How you doin Skiuuup?
It was better the fans didn't see it up close...yikes!
I want to blame the blowout on Doc Rivers, I wasn't placed in my spots - Paul George
lol. Remember those fanboys kept saying Paul George would be the Pippen and Leonard would be Jordan? Even in Pippen worst day as the leader of the team he never let other team to blow them apart with a 50 point half-time margin (not to mention it's done by a middle of the road type of team in Dallas). lol. Lets not even try to get into Leonard being the 'new Jordan' hahahahaha. Trash shit hypes at its best for real.
51 points apart! Damn! 😂
This is how the score looks when I play my little brother in 2k
We beat the fxck out the clippers😂😂😂😂
7:25 Luka made this pass saying “this shit too easy” 😂
i'm locked in
Honestly, the thumbnail should’ve been just Luka and Tim Hardaway or Josh Richardson.
clippers just need to move outta la already
I thought there was an error in the game stats Lawai Kennard LMAO
That’s sad when 7’6 is making one hand dadeaways 8:36
You can't blame Doc now...
Is this Boston vs Spurs?
WTF WAS THAT, THESE BUMS LUCKY THEY DONT HAVE FANS IN THE STADIUM OR AT ALL
I think they need a new coach
Omg that is a sad lost Clippers lost by 51 points
PG BRICK
Pandemic P, hahaha!! So glad he left okc!!
The clippers didn't deserve highlights in this montage.
Clippers is not the best in west , actually Lakers is the best , they win because during there game Goerge got his lucky shots and Now , George is A damn! Hes not unstoppable!
Pathetic
Bopols clipper
Looking forward to the excuses tomorrow, skip
Kawawang Clippers 😂😂
8:34 Boban with the nasty one hander fadeeeee 🔥
We missed you pandemic pee 😆😆😆
Celtics looking good this year.
I've never seen this bad of a loss.
Trade Lou Williams are Patrick Beverley for d rose
Luka is so special. Can’t wait to see his future
Los angeles jets 😝flippers
Lol he gonna cry in the car#mygrandmagavemethatchain
Clippers really became overpaid ball boys for the Mavs in this game wow
I can’t wait for First Take tomorrow😂
Idc who didn’t play... DOC WOULD NEVER LOOSE BY 50!!
The clippers blew a 3-1 lead and guess what else, you won’t believe it        A 2 point lead at the start of the game
51 skunk Hn you gotta past the sticks after 21. 😂😂😂
Wish K Leonard had been in that game...with that score...
This can't be real. They made the Slippers look like a high school freshman team
Kawhi pabuhat is back
Ubod nyo pala ng tatanga pag walang kawhi hahahah
Playoffs? Playoffs..........playoffs?
Hold on getting my popcorn for the comment section
They need to test all the Mavs players for drugs, 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, because they're on HIGH!
PG needs rest.
Can’t wait for uncle shay tomorrow 😂
Down 32 by the 2nd quarter how does that happen?? Lol
Choked to the highest point
Somebody should be fired. I don’t even know who, but 50 pts by halftime is unacceptable for a high school team. I don’t remember seeing that before. A message needs to be sent immediately!!
Knicks > Clippers
I’m curious what Skip has to say tomorrow.😆
Man these uniforms are hideous
辣眼睛...
this looks like a game of mycareer and luka is the myplayer 😂
Wow
No Kawhi right? Mavs don’t have Porzingis so what’s the excuse? Got smacked by 50 and they’re supposed to be champs? Lmao cmon
I wonder who will Paul George blame this time?
How long has Pat Beverly been in the league? I swear that man has been here for 200 years...
The hardest bubble on Clippers life.
Ty lue is not a coach.
Pandemic P: That's a bad win.
51pts whaaaaaaaaaat?
I know that hurt the heart
When you play 2K with your younger brother
“Expect Paul George to try to carry this team.”   Nah.
*I think this is an example of how the Clippers really feel about Paul George...*
I don't care what anyone says, those shots the Mavs were taking were all bad shots, even if they did go in.
Mavs won by 50 but it’s their *second* largest win in their history!? How.
Clippers making history once again. The other way..
Paul Choke is Back
Yo wtf kinda 2k shit is this.!?
mavericks highlights*
Yooooo , they got washed!!
Clippers beat the Lakers, Lakers beat the Mavs, Mavs beat the Clippers. Damn the West lol
dear lord 5 points in 9 minutes??????? Like i saw the score at the end of the game, but thats  a dry spell drier than Paul George's playoffs
CLIPPERS ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT. Trash ass team and office
Mavs after the beat down: if they DIE they DIE!😂🤣😎
Tomorrow is going to be so fucking awesome on Skip & Shannon
Omg!!! Someone call the police!!
Without leonard LAC is nothing as u can see😂
Im Waiting to Nick Wright's laugh 😂😂😂
hahahha
WTF!! They played like how kids played on 5v5 fullcourt. There's no energy and defense on the court
Luka  magic   LETS GO MAVS
PG carried the team to mariana trench
87 people are clippers fans
Pandemic P is back to his old self *chris smoove voice*
The Clippers got violated
WTF 🤭😂🤣
Yuck
Pandemic P gonna be like: “the coach wanted me to play like Kawhi Leonard but that’s not me so it’s his fault we lost by 51”
Kawhi is on load management with 8 snitches! 🤣
Clip clip clippy lol
Let me correct you: Mavericks full game highlights.😁
Why did Luka even play after the first quarter. That was overkill in a game that was overkill
Watching this AFTER finding out what truly happened lol George Paul is back! 😂
Well atleast Paul makes history with the clippers in this game 🤔🤭
I thought they were playing the celtics....jerseys colors all over the place now lol
PLAYOFF P
Too bad the Clippers can’t play the Lakers every night. 😂
"Stop! Stop! He's already dead!" Kid from the Simpsons.
Same story like last season, beat the Lakers, and to lose weaker team like the Mavericks. Clippers will choke. 51 point loss.
All these bandwagon Lakers fans happy and commenting Kawhi is out and now Clippers get blown out lol but I bet they win more than 35 games Lebron don’t even like y’all he trying to get the Jordan fans lol 💣💥🧨🌋
Clippers back in playoff mode 😤😤😎
Tambak!
Who else cant wait untill flight reacts to this?
This will happen if kawhi not playing for the clippers..
Just imagine if the Porzingiz was in game
Is this a training practice or actual NBA?
Without kawhi pandemic P cant handle
To clippers fans  KP ISNT PLAYING TOO THO!
I guess the Clips didn't run enough pick n rolls for Paul George
JESUS AND GOD LOOVVEESS YAAAAALL SOOOOOO MUUUUUCCHH, PLEASE TURN TO THEM, JESUS IS THE WAY AND THE LIGHT TO HEAVEN ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE ETERNAL!!!!!!
PG13 ain't good..Khawi is definitely the face of Clippers and Lue isn't a good coach!
The clippers only lost kawhi and they whole team collapse
Ohhhhhhhh Patriiiiiiiccccckkkkkk!!!!!!!!! Lol I just wanted to see him after the game 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5:00 the haha is classic.
That's a bad lead.
I've seen WNBA players defend better than the Clippers in that 1st half. They got so dejected, the Mavs bench comes in and became the Harlem Globetrotters.
Mavericks highlights😁😁
Damn the Mavs really went full out 2k Mycareer  on the clippers 😂😂 this how bad I beat teams on my Mycareer always thought it was unrealistic, guess not🤷‍♂️
The clippers are just ass
Stop. Stop. They're already dead 😭
Looger Pops a whole min out .. outside yes I did get some air ma’am and there go 5. Dreams
And Steven a smith said Kawhi wasn’t doing anything🤦🏾‍♂️ look what happens when you take him out the game.
I know Kawhi is on mvp level and Pandemic P is making more money than AD but Ty deserves some shit too I only see ISOs man's was lucky LeBron carried him to championship
Wtf is this team
Clippers should ask the PS5 back after this performance.
Clippers fans after Opening Night "Lakers are trash, this is our time"  Clippers fans after getting blown apart by the Mavs "It's only the regular season, Kawhi was out, we didn't even want to be there anyway"
PANDEMIC PG 51: Bad Lost lmao
Ight yal Cancun in 5 🤜🏽🤛🏾
Did the mavs play a wnba team??? Wtf lmaoo
Now that Pandemic P has left the bubble, its time for Pfizer P 🔥🔥
If you're a Clippers fan I just want you to know yall got FUCKING BLITZED🤣
The Clippers need their own bldg. At present I believe they're the only team in the NBA that doesn't have their own bldg. to play in. I think people are underestimating the importance of this, mainly their owner, Mr. Ballmer.
Dallas won it by Submision 😂😂
This is murder 😂😭😅😭😂😭
The Clippers will Clip...
Kawhi use a load management again😂😂
Where was this energy when Ad had 16 points and Lebron had 20 in a blowout lost in the season opener?
after they found out kawhi was human they all lost faith it looks like.
me hinking it was celtics vs net at first look👁️👄👁️
And this is why Kawhi is leaving these bums.
This flippers are so bad 😂😂😂
Unc Shay is gone have a field day. Skip formulating excuses on the Klaws absence. 🤣🤣🤣
clippers are sorry ass
Goodnight
Clippers got rid of all of Playoff P’s scapegoats.  So the next obvious choice was to blame Christmas.  This man legit have a PhD in excuses🤧😂
Mavericks vs the Generals
Opening Season MASSACRE 😅
Paul George....Paul George, listen to me when I tell you; you are trash.
Kawhi lang yata inaasahan ng clippers e si paul george di maasahan
“Stop it he’s already dead!”
PG really got some of us with that first basket huh
Yikes
FLIPPERS TRASH
your turn, SKIIIIIUUUUUP
Clippers are garbage man
So.... is Ty Lue getting fired?
Shannon Sharpe turn up big dawg
CLIPPERS LAUGHING STOCK OF NBA PAUL GEORGE SHOULD BE BLACK BALLED LIKE THAY TRIED 2 DO MELO BUT MELO AINT DESERVE IT HE'S PLAYING BETTER THAN PG OFF THE BENCH
{#•0}FrenchLenox
51 points. First time.
As the clippers  coach what do u say in the locker after a game like this 😭😂😂
Go back to Buffalo and be the Braves again.. Their whole objective is to beat the LAKERS yet they have problems with whole league..  And who ever has been down by 51 in NBA history
@5:52 you see the moment Pandemic P comes back.
NBA showing bias by showing all Mavs highlights!  😂
As a Laker fan this put a big smile on my face
This is a proof on how overrated of a coach ty lue is. He better thank SAS for that undeserved job
Paul George: "It's not like it's Championship or bust we just got to come together we'll be alright".
When "load management" kawhi leaves the clippers next year in free agency, PG13 can lead this clippers team to an 8th seed in the west, bc he is an overated player!
If the Mavs keep this type of intensity this season they will be a top contender in the west, but we gotta stay this solid we can’t stoop down to a shitty teams level we gotta keep playing like this
Where's lebron haters right now? Hahahaha Clippers chocker hahahaha
George Paul for the win!!!!
These niggaz was playing like the Harlem globetrotters lol 😂
I wonder what skip gotta say tomorrow 😂
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I can hear Stephen A Smith now “ By Fiftttyy!”😭
PG: Has one bad game Casuals: Pandemic P is back.
Pandemic P got the new strain of Choke Virus.
0:24 did he just use Paul George and carry in the same sentence???
Another history made by the clippers.. Hahaha!
Bro for every 1 highlight from the Clips there's like 5 highlights from the Mavs. 😂
Flippers are trash. They won against lakers because lakers are tired of beating clippers in pre season and lebron did not play in the end of the fourth. Lakers have a blow out win against Mavs and Mavs have a blowout win against the Flippers
Homecourt panga ng clippers
Clippers were playing hall of fame🤣😭
Damn that wasn't a blowout, that was a fatality
Sliders up to 100 for the mavs and around 20 for the Flippers
Was this legal 😳
I don't understand why the Mavs are wearing the Celtics jerseys? What is up with the recent trend of confusing color changes?
I asked were you here if so do you hear who’s with you   {#}CaLotteryScratchers
All I can say is wow 🤯‼️
Clippers has to be the most mysterious team in the NBA. They could show out one game and get blown out the next. Some say it's a part of the game, I say it's a mystery. To Pandemic P continue...
I think we found who the new bobcats are.....
What the heck NBA, you can’t just upload a murder sence
Mavs blow dem out 1st n 2nd quarter 😂😂
Cool....and calm he said as he walked away....."ballgame"
Some where Doc rivers is lauging.
Hahahahaha
title should be Mavericks' Highlights
Great AAU game
Shannon sharp gone have a field day with this tomorrow😭
What did Westbrook say about Pat Bev again ?🥴
Doncic and co. stomping on the Clips!
Clippers got that blood n blood out rape treatment
Beat the Lakers opening night, and beat the Nuggets...  ...ONLY FOR THE MAVERICKS TO WHOOP THEIR BUTTS BY *51??!!* 😂😂😂😂  Yeah, the Clippers ain't going anywhere.
Playoff Pee in majestic form 🔥
Greek Freek really needs to take note of Doncic's game, especially how he takes his time and maneuvers in the paint.
LAC - Los Angeles Cancun
We Clippers fans, We don’t care! Just one L. The most important is to beat the lakers. We can have 50 Ls, but the lakers should never beat us coz we are Kings of LA
The clippers are officially a middle school basketball team.
Boban should get more minutes in this game since they're up on 50 pts. He's just standing in the paint and can dunk lol
Clippers fans be like “ I don’t like saying it, but this was fixed game” 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Warriors’ loss to the bucks doesn’t seem so bad now
Clips are a sad-looking bunch.
If porzingas was playing, they would be down by 70 at the half
Damn lmao
Idc what coach you bring there, this group of players is the problem. Starting with PG and Leonard.
Kawhi is not playing. Don't bother to show up. Sorry Clipps but this is kawhi last season here. He's taking his talents to a real team.
this is embarrassing
Wish they had montrezl now huh
Stephen A smith tomorrow : " Georges Paul"
TY LUE is on... default settings again😂😂
8:45 got me cracking up
I know that Ty Lue is the New Coach of the Year Pandemic P is the MVP Ty Lou WILLIAMS is the 6th man of the year  Beverly is the DPOY and Ibaka would be the most improved player to knockout his own teamate
Paul George is so overrated
Clippers with their best 11-12 Bobcats impersonation
The clippers making records again. Lmao
This is an embarrassment to any Clipper fan. I dont understand how you can be in the NBA and only score 27 points in 2 damn quarters 😒
Humiliating and Pathetic
Bench players were very happy with this game because they got a lot of playing time.😄
This is embarrassing. I dnt like the clipp but dam sho sum fight
losing by 20 is already embarrassing but losing by 51 points is fucked up wth. Clips have no excuses in all wayss even if kawhi was out mavs dont have porzingis too
Pandemic  P is back
WTF PG WTF!!!
put a spanking on them boys 😂
Kawhi biggest mistake in his NBA career is the decision to go with Pandemic P.  I thought Toronto was  a biggest loser of a NBA team in term of getting to final and no one could lift this team up but oh man i was wrong.  No one can lift this max paid player Pandemic P up.  Clippers are done unless they can get rid of this dude even for a lesser talent but more reliable.
PG 13% is back
Paul George is the man😂😂😂.
This game is unreal
The Clippers seriously gonna be a threat to Lakers if PG make his move to be traded...
How many turnover did LA clipppers got?
That's crazy to lose by 50pts+ so I knew in the playoff clippers will beat mavs in 7 games but one of them can beat the Lakers in 7 games.
Title should be Mavs vs Ginebra.
First Take tomorrow gonna be absolutely hilarious!!
Throw in the towel!!
This feels like playing in 2k with the sliders maxed out and in rookie difficulty. 😂🤣
Threat to the Lakers they said.. smh
Clippers breaking another record!
Way Off P is back! as "Skip Bayless"
How the hell do you only have 27 points at halftime 😂
Luka really took the "cry me a river" comment by morris personally
Nets > flippers
Lmao and people thought the Clippers was gonna win
Commentator: Kawhi is out. Expect Paul to carry his team.  Viewers: What do you expect?
Damn
Clippers played pretty good...in the second half
This was fucking embarrassing for the Clippers oh my god hahaha
Bruhhhhh what the literal fuck😂😂😂😂
And yall talk shit about gsw ? 😂😂😂  okkkk
if the NBA thinks that trash-tier upload quality will compel me to buy their season pass, they are sorely mistaken
Is this a clippers team? Or chalkers?
Wtf is this shit man 🤦‍♂️ get it together
What was Paul George’s stat line please. Only he can score 37 and the. Lost by 51 in consecutive weeks
This is very sad. KL is going to leave Clippers after this season watch. I'm from Inglewood we Lakers all the way. All I have to say is for Clippers fans how dare yahh Disrespect The City and say LA is ba Clippers city now lmbo.
Paul George: I was just lagging
What happen to the season openner champion hahahahha Clippers is always a clown😂😁😁😁
How the fuck is that even possible
Mavs vs an amateur team!
🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️TY LIE IS NOT THE FUCKIN ANSWER
They should change the title to Mavericks Full Game Highlights.
i know there are no fans but bruh it's still their homecourt. damn clippers.
Clippers: playoff mode on
I love it, this is the paul george ik, I'm expecting this type of excellence from him in the playoffs as well
Wtf 😕
Pandemic P😂
Clippers exposed or just a bad day?
Lol kawhi is probably looking for some new locations😂
MAVS REALLY SCORED LUKA'S JERSEY NUMBER IN HALFTIME?
77 points in first half. Where's the defense..
hahaha.... ano to masaker? anong klaseng clippers to?
My carrer games have the same exact score
The proof the Clippers should never have gotten out of the first round of the playoffs.
Kawhi should be the MVP. This team is hot garbage without him
Nobody: Flight: That don’t count
Even though Kawhi sat out this game, it's still horrible for a team that is considered as the greatest challenge to the Lakers. Worse than a pre season loss😂
Pandemic P: "We can beat the Lakers!!" Luka: "I'm about to end this man's whole career"
Rename title: Dallas Mavericks vs LA Prep Academy
3:09 GAME 😅
And we never saw Skip Bayless ever again.
Clippers tanking for Cade Cunningham 😭 they let the Mavs do this to them with no KP their practice gonna be brutal 💀
LMFAO.
WTF DID I JUST WATCH😂😂😂😂😂
Wtf
Jesus Christ
SKKIIIIIIIIIUUUUUP!
Opening night P is at it again
6:21 I waited for the 50 points lead then I left
This is how they play when their not lucky... wtf 51 points??? Go pandemic p!!!!
The whole Mavs team should be on trail for this Murder
If this was the second largest margin victory in Mavs history... What was the largest??? 😂
I payed $4 nba tv to watch my clippers play...about to call my bank to place a fraud alert to cancel transaction. Man that some B's game right there
Lmao that score at halftime looked like a team USA game
DAMN...talk about a complete blowout...😂
Damn the Clippers couldnt maintain a 2 point lead 😱😂💩
PG13% robbed the Clippers 😂
Looks like Khawi is leaving LAC next season. He's not happy that Pandemic P signed for a contract extension.
i could not believe it when i saw that halftime score. i thought that was a bug or someshit lol
Seems like kawhi can only set the tone for this team, that's really not good. I could see why they wanted a point guard.  You Clippers fans should be somewhat happy though because kawhi probably won't even be sitting out no more after this game lmao or maybe in the worst-case scenario he will bounce after this season.
2:05 they really just showed a Clippers free throw as a highlight 😭😭😭
There’s the Clippers and the Paul George we all know and love
WHAT HAPPENED?!
Wow
Pandemic P second strain
Wheres ty lue with his championship coaching experience?
Like that old saying goes: revenge is a dish best served cold.  Boy, Mavs definitely got their revenge today and I know y'all gon say Kawhii didn't play, but guess what? KP didn't play, either, so no excuses.
Angry clipper and trump supporter :  '' If they only counted the legal points we would have won by a lot ‘’
This is USA vs Asian's team
I’m here to read comments please make some good comments to make me laugh
Pandemic P, I mean PG13%, I mean Wayoff P
Sissy p so weak!! Can we just trade this dude
Let's all laugh at the clippers!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn
Can't wait to hear what Skip has to say,he'll prob have excuses like these bums and say he only cares about his Cowgirls🤣🤣
4:59 that laugh tho
I'm watching Playstation  stimulation games ^_^ LOL
Not just Paul it’s the team effort
the jerseys had me so confused thought this was celtics vs nets lmao
"It's only one game" "Kawhi was out" "Wait till the playoffs start" "Regular season doesn't count" "We need more time together" "Trez did it" "Doc did it" "We never expected to win it our second year together"  Just thought I'd post all the excuses before the Clipper fans share them all 🤷🏽‍♂️
Can't blame Paul George--the rest of the team is weak (except Kawhi).
Harden and Wood combine for 75 McCollum and Lillard combine for 76 The Clippers combine for 73
This is the worst game
Y’all got f***ed
Clips Sim to the end with no VC.
PG scores the first point of the game Luka: So you have chosen death
This shits straight embarrassing 😂
Damn dallas could have went the hold second half without scoring in still would have won dallas 77 at half the clippers 73 hold game
IS THIS AAU BALL? Wtf Clippers
Wtf is this score line, clippers are pathetic
Mavericks not even playing 2k on rookie more like undrafted 😂
Welcome to the western conf. Finals game 7 lol.....
Dallas Mavericks vs California HS
did they cover?
bruh clips been tryna disconnect since 1stQ
should be "Mavericks full game highlights" xd
Hahahaha 🤪🤪🤪
So you guys can beat the Lakers but not the Mavericks? Crazy 🥱
Paul George “let the game come to him”
I was watching football and saw this score.i thought it was a joke.
History....
We ain’t even got KP so y’all shouldn’t use kawhi as an excuse
What excuse now GP 😂😂
“Clippers run LA” Also Clippers:
Clippers create NBA RECORD HISTORY AGAIN.
Maaaan what was the point of uploading these highlights lmao
Kawhi will take his talent to the Bay Area and join Warriors
Pandemic P is back baby!!!!!
Is this a Dallas maverick channel? All i see is dallas highlights 😂
hahaha way the go PG13% and sideboard i mean borg.
Maybe the Clippers thought its playoff already..😬😬
1st half submission win
The clippers are fucking sad
thx Ibaka
Tough game for the clips
Damnnnnn👀☠☠☠
Georgeyy Paul is Back in full effect!!
Clips w/o kawhi: If they win, they are really good and may challenge for wcf. If they lose by 10, its alright. They didnt have their best player If they lose by 20, maybe it was just a bad game. Anyway, its just their 3rd game of the season But to lose by 50??! FIFTY??!
I thought I was tripping when i skipped the video how the fuck do you go down 50 💀💀
PLAYOFF P showing the world what he does best!
Had an 8 game point spread parlay today.  Yeaaaa, my hopes of winning that ended after the first quarter.
Clippers fans: throw damn towel
Flipper's are here to stay 😂
And the Lakers blew these guys out two days ago by 23...?
This game is like playing nba 2k in rookie mode 😂🤣🤣😂
Paul George when asked who was to blame for today's game: "Doc Rivers"
BREAKING NEWS: Clippers are taking the Mavericks to the court for claims of counting illegal score counts.
I think it’s safe to say PG is a role player
Bro ima keep it short. Clippers suuuuuck
tf Spurs vs Celtics?
Serge's elbow must've felt really bad after this.
Clippers are only food against LeBron in the regular season lmao
All that talked and praise for T Lue, Doc Rivers would never got blown out like this. This bad coaching, bad leadership, and the team basically quit.
That’s a bad shot
Dallas wouldn't score a single point the whole second half and will still win this game. 😂😂😂😂
Clippers could’ve won by fifty and they still wouldve been hated. When they beat the lakers and Denver no one praised them yet when they lose to a team they beat they get hated. Can’t have it both ways
I can see why Kawhi declined his player option
SAS finna go off tomorrow!
Clippers are not even playing defense that much
THIS SHOWS HOW BAD IS TYRONN LUE AT COACHING! SMH!
Now that is what u call annihilation.
If you look closely, there was actually a Clippers offensive side to the court
This was rookie difficulty
Well here's the thing SKIP...
Never knew that the Clippers were that much onto Scat Play.
50?! ARE U KIDDING ME!?
so...Ibaka knocked out his entire team with that elbow
clippers fans no where to be seen after this one
How you have more points in a half then your opponents team total as a whole ? Lol
How did they lose to one of the worst defensive  team lol
It's all about Dallas Mavericks highlights 😆
MAN, IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO COMPARE WITH LAKERS? SMH
I was tryna quit the game for them i thought i was watching somebody get whooped in 2k for a min
Luka on first round exit "that's when I took it personal"
Is that the kryptonite jersey?
Who would hire the worst coach in NBA history? Clippers: Yes
PG thought it was playoffs already and stopped scoring
If the Lakers this season lose by 50+points without Lebron I’ll turn in my Laker fan card in forever.
The score was fraud and am asking the Supreme Court overturn the game.... Pandemic p and Patrick
Go go go
how is there 9 mins of highlights
Nice Mavs👏👏👏
Now, THIS is the Clippers that I know!!  Good Job Fellas!!  No front running, get your a$$ beat EARLY!!!!!
Yo the mavs scored more in the 1st half then the clippers did all game 🤣
🤭🤣🤣🤣
This video better have 3 million views by tomorrow
Let me get this straight: Clippers beat Lakers, Lakers beat Mavs, Mavs slaughter Clippers. WTF🤔🤔🤔
Coach Tyron low: "PaulGeorge is unstoppable" (during the first game against Lakers) -Meanwhile Coach Tyron low: It's a prank!!!
We look damn good teams better beware Luka magic n Richardson
You made your bed kawhi, now lay in it.
The Mavs should have gone home after half time and the CliippTARDS still wouldn't catch up.
score line during the game reminded me of the scrubby sixers days
Why at the start, I thought the spurs and celtics were playin?😂
Should've signed Rondo
after this game the clippers fired ty lue and trade Paul George to nowhere..!!😂
I'm laughing at clips they got schooled no cap 🤣🤣
This is probably the Clippers' worst game ever
i saw the notification of the halftime score and i thought  google is tripping so i check the game but it was pure murder 😂
Pandemic P gets 190 million to lose by 51 points
If there's a Golden Buzzer, i would press it now so the Mavs will skip the playoffs.
When you play 2k with your brother.
thats how you lose a 3-1 lead a repeat again this season
Did it really just say that the Clippers was shooting 7% from 3 😳
Way off P: So Kawhi is out am out too read the the contract.
Clippers vs Lakers = Clippers W by 7pts Clippers vs Nuggets= Clippers W by 13pts Clippers vs Mavericks= Clippers L by 51pts WTF is this for real?!? end of the half mavs lead 51 pts & at the end of the game still lead by 51 pts...😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
The clippers are trash
Pat Bev... where's all the laughter??? Y'all ninja's trash... just like Snoop said.
now these are the clippers i know
Wtf are wrong with ether clippers?
Bro. This is embarrassing
8:50 you rang!!!
Halftime: “Kinda One-Sided, Isn’t It?”
Stop the count
wg nyo svehin kasalanan nanaman ni lebron yan ....matambakol prsng warriors lang ....hahaha
Look at how bad they are without Kawhi Leonard
WTF! I typed a comment at the beginning of the game, looked back... and the score is 77-27.
So we not using MERCY RULE! They should've called this game.
😂😂😂
Only here for the comments 🤣😭😭🍿🍿🍿
Just wait til Porzingis comes back!!!!🦄
This Clippers team stay making history for the wrong reasons.
how is this legal?
As a Lakers Fan, this is hilarious
damn. i thought the warriors were bad. they did beat the lakers opening night but damn.
That was the BIGGEST TRAVEL EVER by number 10 on Mavericks
I knew after clippers beat Lakers kwhai would find away to miss games
I wish they wouldn't have dribbled it out tbh
Luka>Pandemic P...
Now Paul George knows how it feels not to have your one two punch. When porzingus went down in the playoffs George had a good game 4. Back in your face punk. Go mavs
Is Kawhi really this good lol
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Stephen A was like.. Floppers is the biggest threat to the Lakers? 50 pts after the 2nd half? Led by Pandemic P?🤣🤣🤣
Luka at about 7:25 is the best part. The casual spin and pass back, then just walk away.
Unc Shannon better let Skiup have it tomorrow. Skiup better not say anything about Leonard being out. There is no excuse when you have another all nba player and an elite 2 way at that in the starting 5. But I'm sure he gonna be up late to tonight trying to come up with a excuse for this one.
USA VS MALAYSIA
It's like they thought firing Doc Rivers and paying PG more than he's worth would solve all their issues and weaknesses as a team...
Lawd, have I been waiting for this highlights 🤣
Kawhi chose this over the Raptors.  I mean they're 0-2 but didn't drop to 57 down 😬🇨🇦
If a team loses by this much, each player should have to donate part of their salary to charity.
I bet the Clippers will pay PG13% higher salary after playing this good.
Welcome back Clippers 😆
OH YEA I 4GOT THAT THE CLIPPERS ARE THE TEAM TO DETHRONE THE LAKERS RIGHT??? 51 POINT BLOW OUT BY DALLAS??!!!! SMDH
“Doc Rovers is to blame” Paul George
Pandemic P is gonna blame Doc for that... "See, itz cause Doc had me doing Pin-Downs & Playin' like Ray Allen and..."  - - Good Job, George Paul!!!  Where that 50 Point Game when you need it?
They beat the Lakers and the Nuggets.. And they seem to want to let the People know, that they are the Clippers so they did this.... Hahaha
This is so satisfying🥴
Load Management Clippers' Version at it again!!!
Im here to know the lead, not which team wins
What a Score HAHAHA
Luka needs to realize that the Clippers have families that have to witness the stuff he does to them. Have mercy!!!
Clippers didn't have kawhi but mavs didn't have KP
skip throwing his shoes to tyron lue pg3-1 beverley ibaka batum paterson williams.
Clippers played like straight up Garbage, No Excuses,
This is a 2k my career blow out. Kawhi or no kawhi this is ridiculous
Damn nigga that’s embarrassing as fuck...
The whole clippers team was moved to NBA D league after this game
I don't want to hear nothing about if Kahwack would have played the Flippers would have won lol, Kahwack is not dropping  52 points... STOP IT 🤣
I'll bet on the Mavericks as this year's champion. May the 2011 spirit posses this lineup. All hail Dirk.
Clippers suck!!! Go back to the basement n stay there.
My team looks good!
Clippers looked solid for about 15 seconds
I thought its celtcis brooklyn game. Haha
Thats gotta be embarassing. You would think they just played the 1992 Dream Team
Wait... What the hell was that. 🤣🤣🤣
This looking like a NBA2K MyCareer game 💀💀
The Clippers at halftime were basically my middle school basketball team at the end of the game 😂
What the fuck is wrong with these dudes.
you gotta leave right now 🖐🏿
skip and max ......kkkkk
Here it is... Sign of the choke
Imagine giving all.your.picks to get pandemic p. Payed him 200 mil,payed kanmard and morris 64 mil each, and kawhi leaves next season, lol
I literally thought this was a glitch when I checked in on the score in the 2nd quarter
PANDEMIC P LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Who’s watching skip and Shannon tomorrow 😬✋
Clippers activated Playoff Mode
Pandemic p
My Jaw is dropped  BIG TIME the clippers flat out SUCKED!!!!
This is the dumbest game. They get millions of dollars to lose by 50. Just  get rid of the Clippers team altogether if they can't play without Kawhi!!! Thats BS!!! Ya know that coach can't do anything without LeBron James!!! That game was embarrassing!!! They didn't get defeated, they got defecated on.
Dallas vs Bulilit selection😅
"expect Paul George to carry his team"
Kawhi not playing is not an excuse to lose 50 damn because you still have a superstar playing. Damn
don’t let the final score fool you, it wasn’t that close 😭
PG: I'm back, I'm locked in.   Welcome back Pandemic P 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mavs using custom game settings 😂😂 everything 99
Paul barely played any defense. Kawhi is the reason that team is good. Paul cannot carry this team, that max contract ain't nothing. If they lose this year best believe that the team is going to be disbanded.
What happen to our clipperS players coach
Clippers are trash 27 pts in a half wtf
😮These new uniforms be confusing me for a second. I'm like... I didn't request the Boston vs Spurs game.
Th clippers should feel ashamed of themselves for being down 50 at halftime
Damn! NBA 2k21 on Rookie difficulty! Sheesh!!
Playoff P does it again
lmaooo wtf yall doing
Okay. Everyone can shut up about the clippers for the rest of the season
Doc Rivers: 🤣
You cant blame the coaching system
Ref!!!! Where you at, stop the game!!! This is bad!!!
This flippers team is purely trash, pandemic p is trash, no way this team is a threat, they are garbage phew
Luka is far ahead of paul george that's crazy
Shannon Sharpe tomorrow morning: "SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPP"
So westbrook is right all these times that patbev only run and do nothing hahaha
This ass whooping reminds me of the goodnold days when the warriors would do this on a nightly basis ☹😞
The mavs are gonna be scary if they play like this all year
And I thought Canada beating Germany 16-2 was bad, sheesh these clips are fucking embarrassing
None:  Chris Smoove: Pandemic P back at it 😂
This was sad
Pandemic P about to shipped off to Milwaukee or Orlando
Clippers are COMPLETE Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!
This team supposed to be the best?
Tyronn Lue should be fired after this game, absolutely disgraceful performance of a basketball team
PURE GARBAGE !!!🤣🤣🤣
ESPN gon eat this up tmmr morning 😂😂😂
Ik all Clippers fans gon make excuses that their best player isn't playing, but when LeBron and AD sat out, we still won. That's the difference. If you lose by 50 flippin points when your star player is out, something is wrong. No more excuses for y'all anymore.
The only word I can use to describe this would be “YEESH”
😂😭😭😭😭😭got y’all asses whooped smh, used all that energy for the Lakers again
The Mavs turned all AI sliders down - 20
This whole game was encapsulated in Boban's dunk at the end.
Felt like I just watched a 2k match on easy LMAO!!!
Nyahahahaha tambak is real
if dallas has the top 10 guys healthy going into playoffs its clearly a WCF trip
Deym
doc 》》》 P.George
"60 to 18" HA HA" "Is the lead for the Mavs" LMAO even the commentators laughing at y'all Flippers😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I bet not see PG name anywhere near top 25
That amount of money he sign! I was disgusted how Playoffs P played todays game
Cant even believe dis a nba game
I really couldn't finish watching, reminded me of going to my Nephew's game and they were way outmatched I would want to just call it or let the fans suit up to help, couldn't hurt.
for sure kawhi will most likely opt out next season he might even join the lakers
pre season started😂
I remember yesterday or two days ago pg talk all mighty of.himself.then lose by 51 points and cameback as pandemic p again,lol
its all ty loue's fault
what the actual fuck
History
Mavericks could've went home at half time and they still woulda won
Ibaka be like i just signed my ass to this team with lower cash too 😂😂😂
If anyone is still a clippers fan after this game... Yall got mental health issues... You need to get help asap... There's old men out there in their 90's that would've scored more than 11 points in a quarter... 😂.. Lakers nation 4life ✌️
12,579 views in 37 minutes
Dang.. season P still not enough for the win..
Losing by 50 is crazy..  it shows that this team without kawhi is garbage... Paul Jorge is there this shouldn't be 50.. but yeah we already know who's Paul Jorge.. he's a star which is not a star and gets overpaid.. he don't even deserve to be paid in high price..
Clippers literally go on a 10-0 run in the third q and the highlight skips right over it. Good editing y’all we really appreciate it.
Clipper fans: “Clippers haven’t been the same since the Great War.”
George paul choker
Clipper s will avange on playoffs.dallas is lucky this time
Who's gonna score on this team? Oh wait
Stephen A gonna have a field day
Mavs without kp clippers without kawhi clippers are nothing without kawhi how tf do u lose by 51 pts
Clippers' coach: "My bad, I thought it was still Pre-Season."
Do you blame it on the coach or the players?
“Expect Paul George to try and carry this team”, 😂, poor guy, George made him look bad at his job.
The Only Reason the NBA hasn't gone Bankrupt Already is They took out a Mega Billions Dollar Loan to loan out to all teams so they all don't go bankrupt. This game is OVA
The Josh Richardson Seth Curry trade is looking like it was a good move after all. I was a bit skeptical at first because Seth was so good last year, but Trey Burke can kinda fill the same roll.
Clippers’s fans canceled all their hair appointments this week.
mavs just playing with china team
Lol I see playoff p is back
LAKERS NATION UNSTOPPABLE SOLID
Garbage time started in the second quarter. The clippers must’ve wanted their bench to have experience.
Clippers already drain out by beating lakers and nuggets. No kawhi? Nah thats not an excuse for letting your opponent beating you by 51 points
Lakers would never
Blame Doc...oh yeah nvm
Imagine if fans had to sit in the stands and watch this 😭😭😭😭😂😂
nah, that's a wrap on their season.
Damn Mavs with the green Jerseys. I thought it was the Celtics for a sec
🤣😅🤣
The clippers is totally a Flippers!  They were just a background team in L. A.! 😂
Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiip
Clippers looking like threats for that #1 pick
When did the Mavericks get josh Richardson?
😂😂
someone: do you want to score? mavericks: YESSSSSS
These are just mavs highlights 😂
Dam fans left the game early
humm... the Warriors ain't that bad after all....
DOES MERCY RULE APPLY?
Dallas had 13 guys play double digit minutes. That's crazy.
Doc Rivers rolling over in his grave 🤣🤣🤣
Doc: ........
Isnt gRape not allowed on YouTube? Btw peep what they said at 0:22 lmfao
bro I really thought I was watching Celtics vs Brooklyn
Nothing without kawhi
That should count as 4 losses
Wow
LAKERS IN 6
But they didn't have kawhi🤣
I don't think PG can carry this team lol
51pts lead 😳
Noticed the 2 teams clippers beat are the 2 teams that had deep playoff runs and now with quick turn around, and are slowly working back into game shape?
Shout out to the commentator for saying "expect Paul George to carry the Clippers tonight" 30 seconds into the video.
..."WAAAY-OFF P" IS BACK🤣😂😅
YEEEE PANDEMIC P WSUUUP
Am I the only one Kept thinking is that Boston in the green 🤔
Commentator at the start: “Now that Kawhi is out, expect Paul George to carry this team” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mavs need to change their uniforms asap...UGLY!
How’d the Mavericks end the 1st quarter with 37 and then have 36 in the second quarter? 🤔
Oh here are the clippers
Even if the Mavs scored 0 POINTS in the second half the Mavs still would’ve won LMAOOO
6:28 this frame really sums up how this game ended.
The only time the Clippers led the game was with their first shot 2-0
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No one: Clippers: I'm on the x I'm on the codeine
Obliterated these boys OUT THE GATE.
Am I the only one that didn't know Tony Parker retired?
Mavs could have scored 0 points for the 2nd half and still win.
Stephen a we need to talk about this...
Score 62v18 😂😂 Yo! Pandemic "P" where is your Pandemic power? maybe you need some Vaccine energy drink?🤣🤣🤣
I thought this is a Mavs mixtape.
When flight reacts to this...  “They are literally losing by 460 points”😭
Pathetic P cannot lead a team! You remove Kawhi and they become a D League team!
Smoking on that clippers pack #MFFL
These comments are absolutely violating the clippers   And I love it
Clippers woke up feeling dangerous
NBA vs HS
Ibaka, If you were gonna leave why didn't you join the Lakers?
Playoff P
Oh mah oh mah oh mah god
Cant wait for Chris Smoove to react on this "Pandemic P back at it" lol
Season started way to fast....work them to death owners
Team USA vs China
Lmao clippers
...
Imagine paying luke kennard that much just to drop 7 points
Ibaka gonna regret leaving the NORTH.
Is this a mavericks high light
The Mavericks were playing on rookie with all the sliders up
Me: even though kawhi isnt here I think paul george can carry Luka Doncic: whos paul george?
This game means nothing.  Even if we don't make the playoffs,  📢 WE ARE BUILT TO BEAT THE LAKERS 📢
51 point ass whooping most ever for clips!     And they had ALOT of L ‘s
Luka just ended paul george career .
How much more evidence do we need about Paul George and his inability to carry any team ?  ...and this is the dude you Clippers faithful's are relying on ?😂🤣😂😅
No point guard clippers, asa lang kayo sa 3 points. Ayun puro mintis,GG hahahah
Lol thought it was brooklyn vs celtics 😂😂
one word: embarrassing
God bless 🙏🏼
What no one is talking about is one the clippers were down by around 25 we just gave up and put in our unit that plays “garbage time” while the nave were still playing their starters
Luka becoming more deadly when he's attempting mid range. Becoming more unpredictable 👍👍👍
Did the Mavs and Bucks swap jersey colors?😂
A massacre.
51/50. Dont need clippers
See this is how u suppose to play Mavs every game
I know damn well they didn’t lost by 50 🤦🏾‍♂️
6:48 Back at it again with Luka Magic 🪄😳
Paul can’t carry any team lol 😂
This is that game on 2K when you have it on rookie mode wtf?????
Josh Green !!! Give this rookie some MINUTES!! 🤯🤯💪💪
Every Clipper should be fined 10k for that lack of performance.
This is a Maverick Highlights.
Swear the Clippers only come to play against the Lakers
Jv vs varsity
Nah bro I was warming up. - Pandemic P
PG: That's a bad blowout win
Is this score even legal in the NBA ? Asking for a friend! That was embarrassing & shame on the LA Clippers. PG 13 should refund $51 million from his contract based on that performance!
“The second largest margin of victory in Mavs history”
PG just got 190 mill and Luka is better than him at 21 butKD gets the "baby" excuse for losing in 2012....the man was 24 LOOOOOL PG is cancelled
They fucking suck asssss bruhhhhh
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mavericks 💙
Lol and people said without kawhi the raptors weren't shit. Nope raptors are still able to play well without him that defeat is very embarrassing for the clippers
this is prob too graphic for youtube
Clippers are trash they have no one other than kawaii, pg is trash he not good anymore
Not even a terminator could stop that massacre
Ago ! Just remember Pandemic P & Kawhi lost a 3-1 lead. Fuck the clippers !
We're winning this year. - Clippers fan. RIP
Playoff George is back!
Kawhi was out because of Stitch Management
Mavericks playing on custom settings
I’m just here to like everyone’s comment and laugh in *kawhi voice* 🤣
Anyone notice Pat Bev been real quiet with the trash talk as of recently?
3rd String Came Out Balling LOL
did you know that bungee gum possesses the properties of both rubber and gum
Clippers garbage bags
How embarrassing
A g league team would’ve did better😭😭
Clippers paid $ 190 million to PG13 to play like this. Amazing.
Yall wanted ty lue over doc rivers. Ha
This is embarrassing. PG 13 can't carry a game by himself.
playoff george is embrassing to watch ,,,,  he might be better an fishing than pro basketball .,no wonder pacers dont want him or okc ...
This might actually help Kawhi's case for MVP. Really shows his value
Pg cant carry
Skip Bayless tomorrow be like : .......................
I feel bad for Camerman and the Floor Sweat Mopper who are watching the game.
Basketball is crazy. Sports period. You can be a 8, 9 point favorite and if a team.has motivation from a game in the past, this is sometimes the result. If you took Dallas straight up you made a nice little profit. Haha
"With Kahwi out, you expect Paul George to carry this team". That came across like a punchline.
Dame gonna go off on Twitter 😅
I think dallas is the real treat to the lakers... 🤣
💀 Man this game was bad, but damn brotha  8:45 this man gave up on life 🤣  this game broke him
Hmm, so the clippers ain’t shit without kawhi... okay 👍🏽
I blame Rivers
That was some 2k basketball 😂😂😂😂😂
Skip Bayless is now out on sick leave 😂😂😂
Is it weird that I’m not a Clippers fan but I still felt bad for them 😂
Skip has left this universe 💀🤣🤣🤣
Let's go mavs
So, without Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers are an NCAA team.  LOL
PANDEMIC PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE AT IT AGAIN!!!! hahahahaha
Covid 13 really carrying the team
Throw the damn towel!  🙅🏾‍♂️🤪🙃🤣🗑🏀 #clippersgotstrip
Clippers were up 2-0 at the beginning
If you really the clippers run LA, you deserve to be a clown at your own birthdays party.
Wheres trashass pandemic p exactly  garbage
Funny how i can hear people screaming for defense as if they can win
Kawhi like im rlly out now.. 😂🤣 and doc rubbing hands like birdman
Man, poor Steve Balmer watching his billions flash right before his eyes.
Paul George I guess this was Doc Rivers fault??? You Idiot!!! You sucked then and you suck now. I'm so glad this organization is pathetic. Idiots!!!!!
What a day to be a Mavs fan!!!
Lets goo babyyyy flippersss back at itttt babyyy!!! 🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I didnt know that Pandemic P was a regular season occurrence and not just in the playoffs.
Massacre
Lmfao doc rivers happy he ain’t coachin no more
Kawhi left Toronto cause he thought he was carrying the team and that they’d sink if he were to leave...clippers aren’t that much better a situation for him apparently and evidently
Clippers were better off with doc than ty
Kawhi was carrying this team way more than we all thought 😂
Skiiiip skiiiippp ... can’t wait till tomorrow 😅😅😅
Skip Bayless......my turn
Mark cuban had me weak
What happens when kawhi load manages 😂😂
Luka magic
There playing style is like european basketball type wow the ball movement  it is so  fun to watch
Wow. I wanna know PG excuse
Clippers can’t beat even Pelicans in a seven game series
79 points is so disappointing especially for the clippers  Mavericks got the easy win and didn’t earn the win  #RookieModeOn2K
Wasnt expecting that
Pandemic P has returned.😂😂😂
Pandemic P is back 😬
LA Chookers making history again🤣🤣🤣
When I let my baby niece play 2k
Everything happen for a reason Now that kawhi have a bigger mouth will be more vocal
I guess they only show up for the lakers where pat bev its not like they dont have a team
O O F
Clippers got beat like Nate Robinson
Luka: waiting for the ball to get half court Me: going half way in the basement
So sad seeing this playoff contender getting destroyed.. 😃😃
pat bev is so trash bruh.... get him outta here lol
Money well spent on Playoff P
This is why you need to get rid of Zens 2k
It happens
Mavs should’ve called game after their first made shot.
Imagine having 28 points AT HALF.... oh wait
120-63!! thats 57 points difference commentator missed that one.. Thats the largest final difference I’ve seen...Kahwi Injury depressed the whole Team?
This what happens when Kawhi opts out next season..LOL..
Luka too fire 🔥
anyone who came in here to making excuse and kawhi Leonard it was hurt KP didn't play either and if you say kawhi affects both ends of the Court KP affects both ends of the Court too by him being able to stand outside that three-point line and hit those three pointers keeping the other team big man at Bay at the three-point line allowing Luca and other guards to get to the basket on the defensive end he blocks shots rebounds and alters shots when people come into the lane he is a defensive nightmare for opposing teams so I don't want to hear that kawhi Leonard was hurt and the clippers were not at full strength because as I recall KP didn't play either and the Mavericks were not at full strength this was a even playing field Luca got the best of them boys
Good for you clippers🤣🤣🤣👎
Clips give up already on 2nd quarter 😂
Clippers better pray real hard they don't meet the Mavs in the playoffs.... or the Lakers.... or Denver....
Damn..... Kawhi really that good?
Paul George steady taking L’s
9:03 that girl is bomb
This does not seem real
Mavericks were really playing easy without hesitation
Clippers beat Lakers, Lakers beat Mavs, Mavs beat Clippers....
Clippers, this is just embarrassing
Paul George is Overrated
Ty Lue's Ass Is Fired Next Season For Sure😂
"My 2K-Rating is gonna be a 96 this year" -Paul George
Kawhi looked at the score and did that goofy ass laugh.😫😂
Good to see the Clippers are adjusting well without Doc Rivers
LA clippers breaking all the wrong records.So all you have to do is bust kwaid  up side the head and the series is over.
I guess dallas is still holding a grudge over the fouls on luka and the suspension kristaps got during the playoffs.
Yup repeat for lakers🤩🤩
Cant wait for Skiup to make excuses
Skipppppp
Love how everyone talking about how the Clippers got blown out when the Warriors got too
The clippers should have no problem with Kawhi having special treatment anymore after this game 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Luka chillin 7:26
Well clippers, y'all got Paul for 4 more years😫
why mavs do em like that 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Lol they got smashed, obliterated, demolished, manhandled, abused, destroyed, but les not act like they the only team to get smashed like this haha😂😂 The bulls got 50 balled by warriors in 2018, Hawks jus got 50 balled by Clippers last year 151-101 so les relax, plus they still have 69 games left, and beating sum one by 50 in a REGULAR SEASON game dont mean CRAP in playoffs, so if the Mavs beat them by 50 then? Ok we can have a roast fest😂😂😂
Can’t wait to see skip fight his one out this one
they should’ve forfeit at halftime 💀
This proves the clippers are not a threat to the lakers. yea u don't have ur best player but that doesn't mean you lose by 40 and trail by 50 at half. lol
2 minutes in I see how this is going
The entire clippers team should just load management for a few games after this one.
2:04 why they rollin the ball in with 3 min to go in the 1st 😭 they just fucckin with them
TIL there is no mercy rule in the NBA
Dis was sad
For every one sayin kawhi is injured porzingz is injured too
Maybe if you blow up the clippers now their squad will be somewhat nice when they get that new arena in 4 years. The clippers are an absolute travesty amongst travesties and the Mavs if KP is healthy will get to the second round. They at least hype up their players when on the bench. Jesus. Like did they even try? Paul George got paid how much ?
A great win by the Mavs. Luka even had an off night.
Now I'm Starting To Think Pat Bev's Defense Is Overrated
Bruh, they've should've let all the bench players play the 4th quarter, the worst that could've happened is they only win by 30 lol
Where’s y’all clippers at! Talking all that shit other day
Yeah I can’t wait till osn react to this 😂
" No Kawhi this finna be a breeze"-Mavs team
PG wanna blame Doc??? Go blame TY after dis sorry ass performance,what adjustments did he make tonight?🤣
Clippers don't you ever use your name in the same sentence as the Lakers as a great team, because you TRASH
and they say this team is a finals contender?
Even Pandemic P got that new strain sheesh!
Bruh they don't miss lmao
What happened to Kristaps Porzingis?
Wow!!!
Clippers looking like their in championship form today.   That was some solid lockdown D by them also.
Trade toxic beverly
so everybody just gonna ignore the fact that the Mavericks could of went scoreless in the whole second half and still won the game by a couple points😂😂😂
Pause. Quit. Restart Match
NBA vs WNBA.
Flippers didn’t have Kawhi and Mavs didn’t have Kristaps so that excuse is butt
Pat Bev is like Draymond but worse. Dude is Garbage and the Media over rates him. Fucking useless
Clippers played like they in Sunday School
My team Domination on pro
Kawhi is out it's time for PG to take charge... LMAO..
what did I just watch
Clippers make a new team after that
I did a triple check to make sure this is not Celtics vs Nets
Heard on the news the LAPD looking for Luka all over LA at this moment. Murdering people at staples....wtf
Absolute humiliation for the flippers😂
kawhi lowkey just elevated in the mvp race after tonight lmao a 51 point loss ?! what a DISGRACEFUL performance by the lac 🤦‍♂️
The title said there would be Clipper highlights...
Paul george without kawhi vs luka without porzingis
It's like playing 2k 🤣🤣
This is not PG13, it's rated R!
Mfs came in built like a varsity hs team 😂
The Mavericks  made the clippers look like a WNBA team 😂😂😂😂😂
why is that luka looks heavy but moves like a fckin cotton? just wonderin'
Great video, thumbs up 🤟🎯🎯
This is the preseason right lol 😂😂😂
clips don’t deserve to play in the holy grounds of staples bro
77 - 27  PG : We're just warming up
clippers had a great defense in the second half. Mavericks only outscored them 1 in the second half
Damn
Second  largest victory in Mavs history by 51 against clippers
Pandemic P to Useless P
The clippers did have the lead at one point... when it was 2-0 lolololol
Same ol Clippers...damn they suck !
I Love this ❤️
Mavs fans be like “see I told you we are a good team”😂
glad I missed this trash clippers pathetic defensively
Paul George down 50 at half: Those were bad shots
The Clippers should honestly delete their franchise after this game and no one would care
Come on man this happen to the Clippers in their second game. I was waiting for this to happen in Game 50 or 52.
Ty Lue was the answer! Lmao
This is what u get when u think Ty Lue is a better replacement to Doc Rivers lmao. Lottery coach
Clippers trash without kawhi 😭😭 pandemic p  showed his colors tonight lol
This only show that they really need Kawhi. They beat the Lakers and Nuggets, so it is impossible they cannot beat the Mavs?
Is it still preseason? Wtf was that?
Oh boy 2020 is not finish yet....massacre game
JHEEEEZZZZ and y'all want to claim LA, what a joke
Paul in kanwhi wasn’t feeling it tonight
T Jass men’s league team could’ve DONE BETTER than the Clippers
No champion for Clippers again this year after this game.
Paul George: “That was a bad game, I was in a dark place in Lukas shadow”
Down by 50 at the half? Only scored 27? The league oughta fine them mf's
We just witnessed a murder.
Lol don’t let the Lakers win tonight on top of this Clippers ass whipping cuz I can see Shannon with the ol Goat mask on right now 😂
Brick City Clip City
I saw the halftime score on google and I couldn't believe it. I tried refresh the page I thought the NBA changed the rules to make it take it streetball
T. Lue  will get us passed Lebron🤣😅
More like dallas highlights
Every nigga in the world scratched their heads at halftime, I was shocked when ai saw this on googel bruhh💀
Cuz of that dumb ass haircut Paul George has smh🤦🏼‍♂️
Luka with 24 points and Paul George with 15 wow luka is too good he always gets 20 points+ Paul George going to need kawhi  but kawhi injury so maybe kawhi will be back on Tuesday when they play another team and I am not even a Dallas fan or a clipper fan and Luka playing like lebron when he was in Miami dang clipper got blowout at the 2nd half
4\33 for a team from deep, 13 players touched the court. Average the 10 players who scored below 10 and the average is like 5-6. And the 3 that scored above 10 barely did. Amazing stats for NBA.
The Lakers could never
This was painful to watch
kawawa clepir u hahahaha
WayOff P is bakx 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️ Clippers are so STREAKY https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-cf5sldR-t0
lol Flippers😅
I came here for the comments 😂😂😂
What happened
Imagine hat Shannon is going to do to Skip tomorrow🤣🤣🤣
CLIPPERS aRe CoNtEnDers
This look like a high school game🤦🏽‍♂️
Ty lue what hapen to pg? 😅😅😅
This game adds to the case in point that PG is not that dude. He’s a front runner. He has hot streaks when he’s not required to carry anything in games. Otherwise we can’t find him on the court. It’s just one game. Third game of the season. We get it. No need to exacerbate  or overreact. But we’ve seen enough of this from him. The failures keep piling in the most important moments for him to show he’s worth the money.
LOL THEY GOT DESTROYED
Unsport manship🤧🤧🤧🤧
Anybody wanna see a dead body
Why does everyone put everything on PG. He didn't do great but holy hell his team sucked. The only people who tried to play is him and serge. I don't get it
The Mavericks look like me playing on rookie mode
If Porzingis played what would they have lost by?
Where is Kawhi?
LA CLUNKERS
pandemic p
Clippers fans after their team gets blown out by 50: 👨‍🦯
4:28 ... 🤦🏻‍♂️
they petty for even showing this
Chill out yal. As a Mavs fans, I’m happy for this win but KL wasn’t his game tonight
Honestly? It wasn't even PG this time. Lou Will had ZERO. PG could definitely have been far more efficient, but the others needed to do more.
LOL hahaha that's what they get for tampering and stealing players
I wanted the highlights of the clippers and Mavericks, not just the Mavericks *oh, right*
Score lookin like a 2K sim😂
This wouldn't be talked about if this was a team like the Kings or  Suns, but since it's the Clippers without Kawhi or Morris, they are gonna get dunked on. It's the same thing as last year, they don't give a fuck about games like this, the difference in how they played the Lakers and Nuggets compared to how they played today is incredible
Playoff P
Clippers will win this season..lol
Clippers needs to trade Kwahi for James Harden, if they want to win !!
Boston vs Brooklyn

Clippers hav 0 playmakers
This game shouldn't have been posted.
One of the saddest games ever😭
Looks like Bucks VS Spurs. ..wtf...I thought #5 was Ginobli....
I remember when clippers was a threat to the lakers. oh shit wrong timeline!
Doc Rivers has got to be the person who laughed the hardest by far.
Pandemic P🗣🗣🗣Doc Rivers is responsible for this loss😁
Me vs Rookie CPU on 2k
Fuckers decided to just not play today
The Clips beat Lakers, Lakers beats Mavs, and now Mavs beats Clips by 54 points? It's just bball man.
2020 has been a really weird year
Clippers in playoff mode already, ah Doc this all your fault
No khawi BIG PROBLEM
MY GOSH.
kawhi rolling over his grave
Can’t wait for skip and Shannon tomorrow 😂😂😂
No kawhi no problem seems like a problem 👌
casually scrolling thru these comments looking for PGs burner
Clippers lose one game with kawhi not playing and all of sudden these haters come out there closets.
I thought ESPN had made a typo when I first saw the final score
Even though Kawhi ain’t play this is damn near proof that if Porzingis was healthy and didn’t get ejected that the series would’ve AT LEAST gone 7 games
Clippers bout to get they lil a** exposed this year
Tyrone lue effect
close game
Dame to pg: thats a bad career, idc what anybody say
Can’t wait for skiiiiip
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
That authentic jersey gives my mavs superpowers
Pandemic p strikes again 😂🤣😂
At last they’ve got 73 instead 53
Embarrassing!!!
Im done watching nba its joke too me lol these teams dont make sense by how they play. NFL here I come
Dallas didn’t need to play in the second half and still would have won
Them damn flippers
nba vs wnba
Kawhi was not playing, they might have still lost but the score most likely would have been closer
This was humiliating for the clips. I just wish Luka was more consistent from 3. Hes 2-17 the last 3 games hes played
Mavericks got 60 and the clippers don’t even have 20. Lol
Lmao sit down clippers fans y'all team ain't doing shit. Hopefully y'all make the playoffs after that ass whopping
Playoff P Wayoff P Regular P Blownout P
3:28 is this a scoreboard error? How did the mavs go from having 37 to 36? There weren't FTs involved either
Thought this was a Nets-Celtics game when I clicked😂
I can’t believe the Clippers blew a 2 point lead to start the game
Flippers fans would probably be like: ITS JUST PRESEASON IT DONT COUNT!!!
It's around 5am here when I saw the score 62-18. I was like damn am I dreaming? Then I search for live streams and damn again, it is real. What the heck Mavs, have mercy lol
Playoff p preview 😗
Im gonna forget this game ever happened
If Luka's threes are even just a little more consistent, he could average 30 very easily.
You guys are not going anywhere,  it's a shame 😕.
The Clippers got waxed
This game went down to the wire. I was at the edge of my seat the entire 48 minutes
Btw why didn't kawhi play? Please don't tell me he's load management second game in
Wheres the loud mouth pat bev? Say somethin
Same old clippers. They are even getting evicted from Staple Center and going to the worst part in South Central of Los Angeles.
Garbage time. From first quarter up to 4th quarter...
Porzingis didnt even play and they still got destroyed
Don't worry, they got ty Lue. According to the liberal  media he's the goat, The next coming of Phil Jackson. So they're good
Pandemic P going nuts , literally.
That's nice as a lebron fan cool
Yikes, sorry but I truly believe this one game proves Clippers aren't winning this year either.
Shows how shit they are without Kawhi Leonard
I wish my Raptors could win games with this kind of precision and large margin of victory.
Clippers playing like toddlers without Lenard
The clippers successfully defended their opening and christmas day title so they don't care anymore.
Seen that score like wat is that glitch in the thumbnail 🤣🤣 Jesus christ
that green needs a lot more blue in it, lookin like the celtics out there
Clippers Fans after the 2nd Quarter "Stop The Count" Plz just stop the Count
I'm speechless.
last yr. Ibaka with Raptors  down 30 pts in 3rd qtr to this Mavs team cameback & won the game.. a 50 pt loss is so embarrassing, your team should be fined or something punitive
Without the klaw, the clippers are garbage
Pandemic P already in playoff form
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I couldn't click this link fast enough.... "Clip City Chip City"😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣. CLIP CLIP 😭😭🤣🤣
The Clippers definitely don’t deserve a title after this
Luka almost got a triple double
You mean "Mavericks Full Game Highlights" ??
Little brother squad better hope Kawhi doesn’t sit another single game this year or they are in trouble.
Might as well be a Mavs highlights, not much clippers here 😂
Oh yeah Clippers, triangle offense is gonna solve all your problems  XD XD XD btw, people were telling me the Mavs aren't gonna be top 4 in the West, what say you today?
I really thought I was hallucinating when I turn my TV on, and this was plastered all over my TV. Unbelievable.
In the words of the Great Project Pat, Good Googly Moogly that game was Juicy
I skipped to 6 minutes in and what the actual fuck is that
The destruction by the mavericks
Luka better get a 300+ contract
this is just mavs highlights
Pat bev hahahahahahahaha skip face tomorrow
Imagine if Porzingis was playing
My boy Luka 🔥🔥
Paul George: "That's a bad 50 point lead."
When you base your plays based on a croc baller leonard, it's obvious that the team suffers.
Luka should stop doing that “he fouled me give me a free throw” look every time he drives
Damn clippers got rotisserie style cooked
I thought I was watching 2k for a second
I'm fully aware that Kawhi was not present, so chill out LAC fans, but god damn. Didn't thought they werw this bad without him.
I'm sorry... but the Clippers are never going to win an NBA title lmao. Especially not with this team
The Clippers really scored 27 IN A HALF LMAOOOOO
Gotta love Marc Cubans reaction
I know it’s just one game, but THIS is why the Lakers are winning the west.
The clippers franchise and team just need to retire already
Sliders were on a 100 today
For a second I thought it was Nets vs Celtics😐
Clips got thrashed.
So Mavs first half points would have been enough to win the game? 😂😂😂😂
Bruh is Kawhi being out THAT serious?
Can’t tell me that Lebron’s competition is weaker than Jordan’s this west is freaking stacked! Any team can lose at any time.
Lmao
I like how when paul George does Bad they trash talk too much, but when  he does good people start Bandwagonning
The refs were horrible in this game. The clippers would have won if it wasn’t for a few calls.      Just kidding.
KP still not playing?
clippers deserve a 5 game suspension for what i just witness LMFAOOO
Pro team vs highschool team.. 🤣🤣🤣
2:02- Mario power up sound
Without Kristas 😂😂😂
That makes me mad about the Clippers. They only play hard against the Lakers and Nuggets. They beat the Lakers and Nuggets. That is it.
Luka moves around the court like Paul Pierce, they are not the fastest but find the holes like a patient running back, Arian Foster like!!
THAT'S WILD!!!
The Clippers are back baby, just like I remember them!
Lmao get whooped Flippers, that's what you get for spoiling the Lakers ring Ceremony. Suck on the Lakers Championship, Suck on blowing your 3-1 lead, and suck on getting demolished by the Mavericks.
Who would win?🧐🧐🧐 Gsw w/out Klay or LA Clippers w/out Kawhi
Now, what happened to the Clippers 🤦
Imagine LeBron being down 40 points at the half and as much as 50 in the third... There would be no expense on James y'all would call him every name in the book. But cool I get hit in the mouth and he has a load of manage but no one says a thing about them being down 50 points they're just going to say they ran into a buzz saw instead of George Paul and chubaka not showing up
Hey, Stephen A. Still think the Flippers are the biggest threat to my Lakeshow?? FOH! 😂
huh so this is what happens when kawhi leaves the clips for 1 game
Clippers potato defense
😔
I'm Single 😍😥
nothing I enjoy more than watching the clippers lose 🥰
Pandemic P second wave is back.
Luka Doncic want his revenge on the Clippers, especially Marcus Morris
We’re not gonna hear the end of this. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Clips fans are pissed
BREAKING NEWS: the Dallas Mavericks have been indicted on sexual assault charges against the L.A. Clippers!
WTF!!! No Kawhi ends in a 50 point blowout? WTF!!!! This has got to be the coaching
The Mavericks could had stoped scoring, and still would have won
ThE CliPpErS ArE LeGiT ThIs YeAr LMAOOO
Pg was feeling dangerous today 😈😈😈
mavericks vs 12 year olds with growth spurt disease.
Imagine 51 points lead? They're helpless without Kawhi..
Dallas needed this type of win, gives a lot of confidence to a young team like this. Now they just need to maintain this momentum and go on a streak.
THIS TEAM IS THE WORST IN THE LEAUGE WITHOUT KAWHAI
This is only one of many records this offense will break.   Luka MVP 2021
124-73 damn
holy...
Mavs would’ve swept Clips if only KP wasn’t injured nor ejected
This is just so fucking frustrating to watch, I can’t...🤦‍♂️
Yo can y’all like up the quality a little better lol
jesus christ how is this type of lead even possible. such a failure to score on LA lmao, holy shit. Even with kawhi theyd have gotten fucked
Luka 🐐
They really managed to get 9 minutes of highlights?
Mfs really thought Wayoff P was doing something after 2 games 🤣🤣
No kawhi, big problem
This should've been named a Mavericks highlight video because I didn't see anything from the Clippers 🤷🏽‍♂️
Go flippers😂😂😂
.........
we really need kawhi
DAMMNNN y’all are down 200 points- Flight probably when he reacts to this 😂😂
Sooo Paul George called out Coach Doc for what again...? 😂
I thought I was high when I saw that score and I don’t even smoke weed 😭
CANCEL THESE CLOWNS,Flippers are a joke,PG ain't gone carry NO ONE Uncle Harper😂🤣 #LakersIn4 😂😂🤣 No more excuses for these bums, there's no PorzinGod so don't even bring up Kawhi LOL
Nothing make my day seeing the Clippers losing 😂
If anyone ever asks why no one takes the Clippers seriously, I’ll just show them this video!
Kawawang clippers..
77-27 at halftime 🤯🤯🤯🤯😭 wtf
Facts: Flippers can't win without Kawhi AHHAHA lol
Blowouts are always lame
When I first open the game Clips were down 45 I thought my tv was glitching so I turned it off the restarted it 😭💀
When you play 2k with your sibling
I thought Pat Bev had “lockdown defense” LMAOOO
Damn....
Damn..50 point win. Niggaz ain’t shot without Kawhi😂😂😂
No KL excuses haha.. btw no KP on Dallas haha
Was so boring
The clippers wore all black jerseys to their funeral XD
PG getting ready for the playoffs
Yikes
This game was wack no Kawhi and KP. and it was a blowout. why even post it if it was this bad.
The Mavericks were playing 2k on rookie😂
51 FREAKIN' POINTS???
This made my day got to love them Clippers. Down by 51 without porzingis🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Plz tell me this ain’t a scrimmage clippers looked lost without kawahi🤣😂
Which member of the coaching staff paul george gone gone this 50 point lose on
LOL
Yup, it was all Doc Rivers fault smh
Lmao this is why the Lakers run LA
:)Mavericks-(:
Pandemic P in da house 🔥🔥🔥
The amount of points the mavs score in a half is more than the points the clippers score all game
The clippers are still the clippers lmao
The clippers activated playoff mode too early 😂
“Those were bad shots”
Clippers ain’t winning no ring without an identity.
Mavs really wanted to make a statement today and they definitely did. That shit was humiliating lmao
Mavs playing in rookie mode.
This was just downright sad one game without Kawhi Leonard and they get blown out this bad I don't even know what to say and it's not going to help the case for the Clippers when I know damn well annoying ass Shannon Sharpe and Nick Wright are going to rub this in
This is embarrassing
Clippers got barbecued.
An entire team of gym pick-up randoms could do better than the clippers
51 points?! 😳😳😳
PAUL GEORGE IS NOT A GROWN MAN, that is sad
Kawhi already load managing
I thought the scoreboard has been affected by the covid-19 also
Time to relocate the Clippers back to Buffalo as the Braves lol
Why did i think this was a celtics Brooklyn game at first
Shannon : “Pandemic P”  Skip : “.......” 🥴😭😭😭
Shows how much valuable Kawhi is to us
LONG LIVE WEED
Who else just here for the comments
Wow the Mavs played good against the OL
Wow! Well this game was a doozy. Breaking record for the wrong reason.
Varsity playing J.V
Kawhi already regrets load mangement (its a joke ik he got injured)
You know who the clippers could’ve used tonight ... a six man of the year player who averages 18 and 7 anybody have any ideas ?? 🥴😂😂😭😭😭
Is this 2k? lol
KAWHI DEFINITELY GONNA DECLINE THAT PLAYER OPTION THIS SUMMER LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

LMAOOOO AND THIS IS THE BEST TEAM IN LA? LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I TOLD Y'ALL DALLAS MAVES WAS GOING TO BEAT THE CLIPPERS.
Revenge is so sweet 👏🏽
And this was without porzingis
DESTROYED BY MAVERICKS
WTF lol I just saw the score! 😂
No kawhi no clippers
It’s time to start making trades after this one they will never be the same..
Idc PG is the most overrated “star” in this fking game
Can someone post Pat Bevs Stateline here? It was too impressive for words, dude really shined today...
Kawhi not playing is not an excuse to lose by 50 for a team that’s supposed to be serious threat to the lakers !!
Mavericks didnt even have porzingis and ik there was no kawhi but thats what makes it fair.
“Best bench in the NBA”
Only the flippers could lose this bad sheesh
How can this clippers get beat at halftime by 50? 😂😂😂🤣
Clippers suck
gggaaaaahhhhhlllllleeeeeeeeee
Well, this is awkward.
0
that was not a highlights it's a massacre
But y’all expect me to believe the clippers will make it past the second round of the playoffs
The game ended before the second quarter they could’ve just posted that
I’m top  30  here clippers suck
I can't believe this result because i thought clippers were better than last season 🤦🏻‍♂️ !
LMAOOO imagine when Flight reacts to this 😂😂
A legit massacre.
And people said clippers would win the championship.
It’s regular season calm down😂
Flippers are the most pathetic team in NBA history.
I can just see Kawhi laughing on the sidelines...
Mavs goated
Clippers were worse than Whole Lotta Red
I thought I was drunk when I when I saw the halftime score and I don’t even drink
clips need kawhi
Look at the final score? That shit is so damn stupid. I understand that Kawhi was out but like, bruh. The Mavs actually won by 51. I still can't believe.
Rename: MAVERICKS VS NEVADA STATE HIGH SCHOOL
This is by far the biggest ass whoopin I have ever witnessed in an NBA game 😭
Playoff P Back in Action
Coulda posted at halftime tbh.
Dame to PG: "Big Dawg..."
😂😂😂 LAC in Playoff Mode already I see.
51😬
A 50 point blowout
Clippers got absolutely slaughtered😂😂
This really shows how much Kawhi means to this team
Clippers fans after losing by 50 at the first half : Stop the Count 🗣 Stop the Game 🗣
Historycal lead in half time hahahahaha
What
Clippers trailed by 50 at the half and lose by 51! It's like the Clippers from their laughing stock years.   Largest loss in their franchise's history.
Clippers suck without kawhi 😐
Luka: You ruined our playoffs. Now we will ruin your whole career.
Kawhi goes out 1 game and this happens

Damn

This was the most lob sided game I’ve ever seen
Embarrassing
Come on LAC
