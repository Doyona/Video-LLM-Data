Ferran Torres deserved the Puskas Award Shame nobody was watching
Scott carson so bad
Fun Fact: Man City Beat Newcastle 4-3 At Saint James’s Park On The Last Day Of The 1967-68 Season Which Won Them The Title By 2 Points
Torres hasn’t quite reached the heights his early potential suggested he would
Torres HAT-TRICK at Newcastle!!! 🤑🤑🤑 | Newcastle 3-4 Manchester City | PL Highlights
Welcome to villa
My god I don’t miss that artificial crowd noise. It was so much better without.
Newcastle
Can’t wait to watch el cashico 😏
now he’s left us 😢
Came here after Ferran expected to leave for Barca... He's very clinical for his age and not appreciated enough, to be honest ...
Does Ferran Torres remind anyone of inzaghi or trezeguet?
Phil foden what do you think of jack coming to city
Someone needs to remind Ferran Torres that his first name ain't Fernando
He and Jesus could replace Aguero
Who's going to be top scorer at Euro Championships 2020/2021 ?  Answer : Ferran Torres.
I scored a torres flick
Torres flick was insane
pedro did that, no one gave him praise 😢
shelvey is the laziest player ive ever seen
Three of the best! He's made them pay!
Torres has the reactions of a cat.
What a goal by Torres
Torres making a statement that he can be the new 9?
Unpopular Opinion: Gabriel Jesus is a great winger and Ferran Torres is a striker. And Gundogan has his whip back!
I generally believe that if Newcastle can keep performing like this and score goals they can get Europe next season
Maybe some missed chances ? Rather than half the video being on a penalty ?
yey man city won ✌️ it was my team v my mate team
Only won the league because they have most money available. People say pep is the best in the world, all the teams he has managed are all very wealthy. Like to see pep go and manage a league 1 or 2 team, he would not be as successful
1:37  If you’re bringing out algebraic lines it’s not offside
I love Newcastle but Steve Bruce is awful
wow Jonjo Shelvey, a midfield dynamo, there was a bit in the second half,,when he almost, very nearly broke into a jog,,
Question guys Ferran Torres or Jadon sancho?
Damn ferran Torres back in form he's got a harrick for club and country at the age of 20 that's immense
garcia is a really horrible footballer. will be glad to be rid of him
FIFA is that you?
Man City have a 100% win record this season when Scott Carson has played, incredible statistic
Anyone else only watching this to watch Newcastle to the guard of honour
Great hat-trick by Torres. Certainly worth a shout for my FPL team for the next few gameweeks.
Sack him
imagine scoring 3 against man city and still losing
When I look at Ferran Torres, all I can see is Dave Gahan circa 1984.
City loved giving away penalties 😆 🤣 😂
Scott Carson saved 50% of his penalties since 2011. GOAT don’t @ me
Torres should be our 9 first choice, he’s lethal
Would it kill us to win a game 4-3 we always lose them
That flick from Torres should be named after him💙
You hear 'natural finisher' a lot but Torres is absolutely that
I found it funny when Pep said Torres could be the no.9 next season, but he showed striker instincts in the game, may not be as crazy as it sounds
Fernando Torres is getting back to his best I remember when he was in Liverpool
Newcastle have been loads better these past couple of weeks. Hopefully they can build on this next sesson
Look at all these deluded Man City fans salivating over the fact that Torres scored a hat trick
Torres just lifted his foot up, it hit his ankle and could have gone anywhere
SO Torres could be the False 9 or CF Pep was dreaming about, the Heir to Aguero and for just £20 Million in 2020 that is A STEAL 👏 👏 👏
Ferran=goat
Another Torres, they running out of names or what lol?
What a game that was
Why do Newcastle start playing well near the end of the season
New law: Fall over and you get a penalty.
Torres just scored the goal of the season
Really happy to see Scott Carson between the sticks again. Glad they gave him a run out. Good penalty save too!
Scott Vs Klaus
Who is this Torres?
how can you give a penalty when a defender goes to block the shot and the forward steps on the foot of the defender trying to block an incoming shot? these refs are retards.
The flick 🤮🤮🤮😭😭😭
random penalties and handballs killed off this game for me.
That first penalty decision was bs . Slow the footage down . Ake misses his tackle and Joelinton stands on akes ankle and slips . Clearly the ref and var are blind af
that 4th goal was offside and VAR just ignored it?
Without Diaz, they fall apart.
Torres is soooo underated
We’re gonna see top football next season from  phil and ferran
Joelinton with a goal Scott Carson in goal   You know something ain’t right 😂😂
Ferran Torres has to start in the CL final, no doubt
City fans will be saying ferran torres is better than Fernando torres now.
I feel like nobody is acknowledging the fact that Carson saved a penalty. Yes I know they scored the rebound but he still saved it
Always fantastic to see Newcastle loose.
Jesus Christ is coming soon    It isn’t too late to follow him
To be fair, it’s good to see Scott Carson in goal in 2021
Where's Shelveys free kick
What a goal
Torres might have the fastest feet in football.
Ferran torres? Nah joel older did it better mate
Yaaaaa
How was that first pen even given? He stood on Akes foot... VAR is a complete joke.
Newcastle were so close
"He was the sharpest in the box then" The ball literally rebounded straight to him lol
kyle walker giving away a pen. No change there then.
Torres was offside for the the goal at 2.55?????
Joe willock can't stop scoring
Credit to Newcastle They gave city a run for their money
0:54 any better goals this season? (Fr I wanna know)
This is the difference between utd’s & city’s second team.
Carson for the Euros
Can't believe the ake one was given as a pen, joelinton slipped and won a pen for it
Another Pippo Inzaghi or Thomas Muller :))
I hate this commentator
Move over Lanzini, that flick has to be goal of the season.
Willock is becoming a bit of a player 💪
I put my otw Ferrari Torres in an sbc 😭😭😭😭 it was his npn upgraded one.
Great one of the puskas goals coming in soon😂
As a buff fan I’ll take 3-4
Goal of the season from Torres imo
Torres gonna be a beast next season.. just like foden, b silva on their 2nd season.. WATCH!!
That backheal flick from the cross is disgustingly good.
Kyle Walker is so rash haha. Liability
That’s Ferran Torres goal is pure gold 🤌🏻
Game of the season so far
Mice goal 🥅
Class game
Man city trying to say we don’t need penalty’s to win
Sublime first goal by Torres........
Cmon cityyy. Great performance
That goal Torres scored I did that in a match
So many fifa goals in this
What a flick!!
I would rather have Torres on my team than foden
Cancelo it's just too good offensively
Props to Newcastle for putting up a fight
That's some terrible defending from Fernández
What a goal Torres
With all that money and u still barely beat the mighty Newcastle
Can't lie that first goal for Torres technique touch simply sublime 👌👏👏 .. Bless up .✌📿💯
what a game
Willock should not take penalties, he is not smart or coy enough to fool the keeper, I knew which way he was taking the penalty and i'm crap at football!
Scotty what a player
reborn  fernando torres  ~
I’m not a Man City fan but Ferran Torres was class
City City Best team in the league
Would it kill them to make these highlights slightly less brief when there's 7 goals?
Why did this feel like your watching a casual FUT Rivals match
Maybe one day, Newcastle will actually won one of the epic 4-3 games....Liverpool twice in two years....and now city?
Kyle Walker would have done a better job in goal than grandad Carson
Not even mad we lost
Ferran giving me aguero vibes considering he loves to score against Newcastle
New star has appeared for city
Gotta love the new ping pong ball.
Torres and Foden on their respective wings next season will be deadly
You can be awarded a penalty simply for asking nicely. Absolute joke.
torres is a straight up striker you can see it man city best side in the world
I mean let cancelo shoot more jeeez
If I speak I’m in big trouble
That goal reminded me of Aaron Ramsey’s goal against Moscow
Bruh was that Scott Carson in net for City?
When ya just put torres in ya dreamteam 👌👌🤣🤣
No t bad for the b team
With all the money Sky had, can't they pay someone to put the score up throughout these highlight videos...?
Willock is on fire right now  He’s playing really good
Goodness Eric Garcia is awful
I’m so confused about how the champions league final is gonna be like because Chelsea lose to arsenal and Man City concede 3goals against Newcastle
Peps job must be the hardest job in football, an endless pot of money to buy who & as many players as you want, on mind blowing contracts, ticking their millionaire bellies & rubbing their egos!
As a geordie I cant be sad with this we played well and they are just simply a better team
As a neutral watching this, hadn't previously seen loads from Torres but he was great here, fantastic reactions, awareness and finishes.
So genuinely glad for Joelinton that he scored that. Because in fairness it took balls to step up and take that, and no one was going to take it from he you could see it in his face. But I genuinely think that's the hardest I've ever seen him kick a ball.
And I was just about to add Torres to my FPL team 😭😭😭.
Torres first goal 😳 hasn’t played much this season but has shown absolute class when he’s on, city are so damn deep
Ake not good enough
Most possession from one team in a PL game ever
@AFTV -  he's done it agin that Joe Willock !!!
@Arsenal - he's done it agin that Joe Willock !!!
This is what happens when you have two teams with nothing to play for
Old enough remember 1968 ( in black & white on tv ) City winning 4-3 at Newcastle to win the title. Old 1st Division.
Torres are better than Sterling.
I can see this kid becoming ronaldo
I mean HOWAY there kinda clagy like
Is there a worse ref on this planet than Kevin Friend? Those penalties are just pitiful.
We were against probs the best team in the world so tbh I think we did pretty well
Man City: *concede two penalties*  Also Man City: Are we actually playing Man United here??
Lovely goal
respect to torres here what an amazing flying back heal my dad has been watching football for nearly 30 years and has never seen anything like that goal
I bet all the dislikes were united and Newcastle fans
Great seeing what willock do great at Newcastle . We need to build the team round willock , saka , Smith Rowe and balogun
No way you can’t do that Torres🔥🔥
Ferran Torres has more Hatricks than Messi this season
City paid 40m for ake???? They got done in...he got relegated with Bournemouth.
The maddest game you will ever see! Brilliant entertainment! Ferran Torres is a talent!
I'm sick of the sight of jonjo shelvey
Ferran just scored best pl goal of all time?😂
Newcastle are so dangerous when they are allowed to play and attack i dunno why Bruce played them so defensive all season. When i've watched them they were defensive and boring but if they conceded or were behind late they could turn it on and score. I think Bruce didn't trust the team early in the season to attack and it almost got them relegated.
Newcastle did great 👍🏼
1:03.... Watch... I dont know how it waa a boring shot????
Everyone saying city are boring.... Watch the goals... No basic bs style of scoring. 🤣😂 Different league 👌💕
If that was Phil Foden everyone would be saying he’s better than Haaland and Mbappe
Howay the toon... man City who
Looks like he’s picked up his form from his Liverpool days
Newcastle the entertainers once again
People keep saying "Man City bought 《insert player》 for so cheap!  Great recruitment!"  When in fact,  the city side has so much quality that anyone can grow into a fantastic player.
City's second string could probably finish top 6
city are fake oil chibaaii lllaaaa
a great match not your normal end of season  game and all end to end football hats  off to the champions Manchester City
Trent would have been crucified for giving that penalty away.
WELL DONE TORRES 🤓
Boring
Fair play too newcastle and Steve bruce team playing well having a good go against top teams recently 👏 👍
Gg ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
0:53 that flick goal was cold🤢🤢🥶🥶
Torres has to be in the first team in the CL final clinical and surgical in his finishing 👏
Premier league fantasy football taking 2 points off Willock for missing the penalty when won it in the first place *and* scored from the rebound 🤬
Torres’s first 😱😲😯
Torres flick, Almost, Almost as good as the Ramsey flick.
Congrats Citeh on buying the league again,👏👏👏👏 good game tho and exciting football u get what u pay for i suppose, but can win the big one having never been their b4 🤔😏 that bench tho today, Jesus that’s better than most teams 1st teams, ffp my @rsei can see another fine on the horizon but hey they just pay it or sue 🙄 and yes I’m bitter rather see somebody doing a Leicester and winning epl than the usual suspect year in year out!
Newcastle scored 3 goals against man City and arsenal have scored zero in two premie league games. Steve Bruce > ARTETA
Scott Carson’s diving even though he couldn’t reach for the ball is too hilarious 😆
Hope pep plays torres in the champions league not jesus and aguero... can not afford to lose to Chelsea 3rd time !!!
So just because they are champions they think they can willy! Nilly! Take people down in the box?
FFP cheats, game void like there premiership win
To suggest that first Torres goal was anything more than a quick reaction with luck is absurdly stupid
My man Torres scored with the Sunday league flick
Willock 👏
1:00 No! It had Ferran....🔥🔥🔥
Torres unbelievable game, can’t say the same for Ake 👀
Hope Mr Willock keeps this form!!!!
I don't know how Arteta rates Ceballos over Willock. All the players in the Arsenal roster that were loaned out are better than Ceballos.
the steroids man city have are amazing
Oil team, get out of my league, go to the farmers league, now!!!!!
Oil club, oil money, get out of our league!!!
hi fernando torres
Lingardinio pales into insignificance compared to the Goat that is Joelintinio
Joe Willock has been improving by each game. Arteta needs to bring him into his plans. He brings goals from midfield and that’s what we’re lacking rn.
Great Goals 🤓
That Torres flick was better than Zola's against Norwich at Stamford Bridge. 👊
Amazing game 🙂
I'm just here to see Scott Carson on goal
Might be a rival fan but I can still recognise talent when I see it. Ferran Torres take a bow 👏👏👏
Newcastle really missed Santiago Munez, he loves a goal against Scott Carson.
Ferran Torres, my word, what a hat-trick that was. Unbelievable with that flick. Jota did a back heel on the ground but that takes some skill. Good luck trying to recreate that myself 🤣
straight up - torres's flick goal is the goal of the season
What a game btw
Willock missed his penalty because he only scores goals for Newcastle from open play. What a lad.
That first Torres goal is sick, cant lie.. didn't realise how good he actually is
Why are they looking for the offside for so long for 2-2? “Best in the world” anyone with a naked eye could see that’s not offside
*What a way to start the weekend*
Didn’t expect this match to be this good damn have to give it to both teams
Great penalty from the Monaghan man Joe Linton
Jammiest Hat-trick I’ve seen in a while.
Newcastle were absolutely fantastic, they really deserve some credit for the performance this evening. Unlucky to not get a point fantastic game to watch
This game gave me Barclays Premier League vibes
Why is Ake still at the club. He makes too many mistakes. And good going from Scott Carson. Brilliant guy and keeper
how’ve they managed to get a 7 goal thriller into a highlights video of a similar length to a goalless mid table clash
Joe Willock dived and got a penalty but no yellow card for diving but when it's Watkins he gets a yellow card for apparently diving
Am I the only one that hears the name as Joe Linton like it's a English name from the 1940/50s
City struggling like Liverpool after winning
every goal ferran just free to do what he wants, no marking despite him being a danger
Puskas level from Ferran
Man City get a better goal keeper 😆
Decent game but jeeeeez Newcastle players couldn’t care less out of possession ... just walk around 😅
Can't believe teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid & Atletico Madrid didn't go in for Ferran Torres. He is quality.
So close god damnit, even a tie would’ve been nice
moment of silence for my fpl, I bought Mahrez instead of Torres
82% possession away from home in the Premier league.... Hahahahahahaha. Oh my days. Crazy stat. Newcastle only scored from set pieces of which two were penalties.
Joelinton taking confident penalties as if he thinks he’s good 😂😂😭😭
Struggling against Newcastle, shows that there title isn't deserved, but bought with oil money. Absolute scum of a club.
Torres bought for 20 milli and is excelling. Then you have joke merchants like martial bought for 50 mill......
ALL BOW DOWN TO THE CHAMPIONS MCFC
I am still getting my mind over that flick from Ferran Torres🤯
That flick by Torres was mad. Bro came on smoke no mirrors.
What a match!!
Anyone else wish the highlights were a lot longer
Don't sleep on ferran Torres was one of the up and coming for Valencia only going to city guna make him better look at that flick lol
Kyle Walker should be no where near the England team
Even a small club like Newcastle can play decent
Ferran Torres with the Ibra-inspired finish 🔥 Either this goal or Lamela's rabona nutmeg vs Arsenal for goal of the season.
Arsenal an Arsenal fan Willock needs to leave Arsenal. management bad at Arsenal
Torres first goal a bit special and staking his claim to any possible striker position
Var was made to win Liverpool the league now get rid of it
Newcastle fans:  We hate Steve Bruce, such boring football   Steve Bruce: you sure about that?
I don't understand why more players don't dive in the area more often. Very high chance of being given a penalty if you dive (because the mongs watching the VAR screens can't tell the difference between a foul and a dive). I think we are potentially close to seeing three or four penalties every match.
Ferrando Torres
VAR OUT!
We gave away more pens than Argos
Nearly as much excitement as watching my Dogecoin.
Fully expect NUFC to lose but I'm happy to see it was 3-4 I'd rather lose that way than a boring 1 or 2 nil
The best hat trick happens 3 games before the end of season!!! That was a quality hat trick salute!!! United and others will be coming for the 🏆!!! We need that!!! It’s overdue!!! 🔥🗣💯
How’s that a pen, he didn’t touch him, the Newcastle player put his foot down on top off the city players foot who was sliding past him.
Great reactions
This commentator must've thought this is the champions league final or something
I think playing Torres through the centre today was a great shout. Jesus and him seemed to work better that way. Cmon you blues💙
Like a game of fut champs
Every match is a “goal thriller” to sky sports
How did Torres do that?
0:53 Now that is a finish from a title champion. 👌👌👌
I admit I love watching city...but let's all be honest, they have simply paid for success.
Bare in mind im a UTD fan.. i still remember the fans arguing who was a better signing.  James, oh torres. LOL. were a funny bunch
Thought it said fernando Torres
Ferrando Torres
You know City have nothing to play for when they concede 3 goals to new castle but also score a hattrick with a bench player, they are just having fun now.
I swear whenever Ake is playing there's plenty of pens.
why would city pay silly ££££s for haaland, when torres can do the job, and the false 9 has worked so well this season ?.
What a goal by Ferran Torres, That was amazing
Guys, weve officially created the new skill move, "the ferran".
English Commentators are so over dramatic for pointless games.
Match of the season
Willock showed quality at arsenal when played properly
We may have lost but we were so good today against the champions
one of the games of the season
Scott Carson is such a bright player definitely one for the future 🙌
We need to play only on fridays
Why the hell are the toon deciding to play good football now that the seasons basically over. My club drives me nuts sometimes.
I don't understand why all goalkeepers fall backwards even with the most gentle of shot as if they are hit with a cannonnall! It happens in every game
I'm telling you guys torres will break into first 11. In fist season 13 goals and that in a city side top some top players.!!
2 unclear and amazingly soft pen,s
I don’t see city winning the UCL
Man  city is the best
Ferrando Torres
Pep loves instinct players just like torres
Why did Newcastle have to wait until we were safe to start playing like peak Barcelona 😂
Why did Juve let go of Cancelo again?
ake is class
Oh and from the beggining and throughout .. with so many .. biasses
I always feel a bit salty when I see top players who are so young :-(
Newcastle need to break bank for Willock or get him on another loan for season what player he is
It was not a pen . He was on thevfloor with both feet .. before he came running in.. he tripped over or INTENTIONALLY stood on his legs ..
As a Newcastle fan that Torres first goal was DELICIOUS!!!!! Well played lad!
Best football game in months imagine never having games like that because of super league
Ferran Torres Is better than Foden and in a short period of time he has scored more goals, the biased English won’t be happy with my comments but who cares the can f off 😀
John Otsemabor, MK Dons v Wimbledon. That’s how you flick a goal.
Ake =💩
Tell me another team that hav scored 3 goals past Man City this season ! Statistically Newcastle r the 2 nd best team in Europe 😂😂
Arsenal fan here. I'm so happy for Joe Willock
Quality flick
The first goal was well lucky for city.
What a player Torres is
How does Sky make a 7 goal thriller a 3 minute video
Ferran Torres fist year in England, 22 goal contributions at 21 years of age. In todays Market City bough him for £20 Million. Always rated him and him and Foden could be BRUTAL for The Premier League 🙏👏🙏
Torres channelling his inner Matty Burrows
Francis Torres was invisible against Chelsea 🤣🤣
Gotta rate Scott Parker he dived the right way in the pens and even saved willocks  pen
Even as a United fan, I enjoyed this match thoroughly, fair play to Newcastle for giving it a go against City but the quality City have always seems to win out lately
As a Man Utd fan Man Citys bench players play generally better than our first team icl🤦 We need to get the players we need to acc compete with City and not always be 10 points behind kmt
What the hell has happened to sterling he was terrible
Sky please put the score in the corner for when we’re fast forwarding though it
Beautiful scenes
Ffs City’s team now😭😭
City got lucky as they have a lot this seaosn, they played horrifically.
Willock looks very promising since he's been at Newcastle, hope he has a good career ahead of him. (Chelsea Fan)
Wonder where all the lads saying Walker is class are at
The first Torres goal has to be nominated for the next puskas award
Torres should to start ahead of mahrez
That first goal from Torres 🔥
How is no one talking about torres’s first goal 🤯 that could win the puskas
Zlatan is jealous
"thriller"
Nathan Ake is dreadful, been shocking in his last 2 games.
First penalty fair Second dive
Torres has reinvented football with that goal, incredible
Ake was awful tonight
Torres for the puskas award
Newcastle: safe from relegation  Players: okay let’s play like we should have been 😂
Cancelo 🔥🔥🔥
Ferrran! edit: Cancelo was something else as well! Cancelo is the best RB in the league hands down well if u look at this season!!!
Who else got on that 400/1 bet from sky??
Once again, Kyle Walker showing defensively he’s not great at all, always a mistake in him
7 goal thriller with many chances and sky sports some how fit it into a 3 minute video 💀
With Laporte now their player, Spain suddenly looking like a decent bet for the Euros
Hats off, we got more out of this game than I expected but city showed why they are champions 👏 that torres flick though, you can’t defend quality like that
What a brilliant goal frm Farren Torres 👏👏we got future 💪💪💪
Why can Newcastle suddenly score
Torres definitely one for the future 👑
Mad goals!
I will take a 3-4 as I’m a Newcastle fan we did well
If you told me there were going to be 7 goals in Newcastle v City, I would've thought it was 6-1 city.
Now Ferran Torres has earned the Spanish #7 shirt. Ladies and gentlemen. Introducing the new David Villa.
Never a penalty
That first Torres goal is the best goal I've seen all season
Willock for signing of the season
There not called jokecastle for nothing 😂
Did he score three volleys 😂 What a strange game.
Glad to be in the scoresheet today, hopefully can now win the champions league and euro’s to make it 4 trophies…..
So Sterling now behind Torres in the pecking order 😂 mate southgate should be dropping this guy not Trent 😂
Man City have the best CB partnership in the league in Diaz + Stones and the worst in Garcia + Ake
How Nathan Ake plays for Man City I’ll never know
Welcome to the party, Manchester City, you done a solid beating man urinal to the title, congratulations on your amazing season from Leeds United 👍👍👍
City fans saying pep is the best manager when his b team could easily make top four, oil club, never gonna be bigger than arsenal never mind Liverpool or Utd
Young Joe will 🥶
When the hell is var gonna stop diving for penalty, no wonder kids can't get into football its truly embarrassing that last dive for penalty
better than Lamela's
7 goals in 3 min, life is short.
Even though we lost it was an unbelievable performance from the lads to get three goals against the champions👌🏻… finish the season strong💪 ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
I mean...we put 3 past the champions, CL finalists 🤷🏻‍♂️ happy with that 👍🏻
that second penalty wasnt a foul
Ferran Torres is truly the future of man city💯‼
0:52 Ferran Torres’ sensational goal.
Wait a minute why tf is Scott Carson in net for man City 😂😂
Am I seeing things? Scott Carson finally playing a match for City!
Fair play to Newcastle, They put up a exceptional fight.
The ferran flick
Never seen reactions like that from Ferran. Everyone goal was like a ninja. Fair play from a Liverpool fan
no one gonna talk about ferran torres' first goal
Torres had a day to remember, lucky day for casual striker. He should never start for CL.
Anyone know what happened to the no penalty rebound goal allowed rule??? Like how did Willock's goal stand
Freeman Torres the future Fernando Torres
When Newcastle aren't full of injuries they can put up a good fight against anyone!
Become premier league champions Become champions league final Become FA winners Almost lose against Newcastle  I dont know what to believe anymore, I just want Jesus in my heart.
Seeing lots of credit to Man City but hardly non for Newcastle.. Newcastle did well for playing against Man City in my eyes.
Scot Carson getting mauled by his city teammates celebrations at the end of the match 😂😂😂  What a Classic moment
they could have long shots all goals keeper cant handle that..
0:52 thank me later.
fixed high-scoring matches to keep the punters watching from now to the end of the season
Aguero take note that’s how you take penalties
Ake has to be too 3 worst cb in the league
First class from Torres
How can the first Pena be given, you can clearly see Joelinton steps on Ake’s foot not the other way around.
Ferran Torres Flick was something else, its a shame I didn't have time to watch the game but im pretty sure everyones eye was on torres mostly in this highlights 😂
Ferran Torres could be the answer to Man City's new striker search.
“Krafth just scored!! Against the team that have just become champions!!” Fck off mate city playing they’re 3rd team with a Scott Carson that hasn’t played in a decade this ain’t a surprise pep didn’t give af about this game he’s got a champions league final coming up 😂
Dont let Torres become a Sane, Pep!! Give him the game time! Hes ready!
Ferrando Torres
If someone told me that Newcastle would've been involved in a seven goal thriller with Manchester City I think i would've punched them
Nathan Ake has no place in this team, he makes too many mistakes. This was a bad buy for City.
Unlucky Newcastle
Feared the worst again when I saw the Sterling, Jesus, Ferran front row again after three defeats with that spearhead...and as usual the first two were a waste of, but at least Torres showed he maybe does have something...
What a weird but brilliant game of football
Ferran🤯🤯🤯
That first goal from Torres is INSANE. If City can land Erling Haaland, we are facing the very real possibility of a front 3 of Haaland, Foden and Torres that could terrorise the league for the next ten years.
Ake is a championship defender
Missed the best man city game of the season out with mates
What a game by both team such a good game to watch especially as a newcastle fan soo entertaining
“6/7 goal thriller!” Literally the title for the past week
What a bloody goal Torres!!
Mcfc champions of England. 👌
Benjamin mendy..48 premier league appearances..3 premier league titles..absolute fraud
I feel bad for Scott Carson, he got rattled on goal with one of city’s weakest defences in front of him and got 2 penalties thrown at him
Van De Beek, watching Scott Carson get more premier league 90 mins than him like : 😨
So tat was one of the best hatricks I’ve Evers seen
What a goal!
Arsenal need to keep willock
This is 100 percent  fifa   career  mode
Wt a signing Dias and Torres 🥵🥵😍😈
Scott Carson with a peno save in every match in the last 10 years👍
To be fair to Ferran Torres, every time he plays he scores, brilliant natural finisher and provider, what a bargain for City for their future, good luck to him ( from Chelsea fan)
Ederson, Ruben Dias and Jonh Stones don't play and immediately Man City gets 3 their net by a bottom table team.
What a game
Basketball ball
What a game  and torres first goal was sick elite finish
Scott Carson is the best in the world. Only conceded 3 in 10 years. Insane player 🔥
Isit just me or sky sports are much quicker than bt sport for uploads
what a season torres has has had his underated im happy for him
Yes Yes City. Good game and Great Hatrick from Torres. CTID💙
Carson my keeper 🐏⚫️⚪️
TORRES fuego 🔥🔥🔥⚽️
I genuinely think Ferran Torres has the potential to be a CF, fantastic movement and instinct
People finally gonna realise how underrated Ferran Torres is. Natural instinct to score goals, so much better as a striker
Ake is bang average not good enough for city
If Messi,Ronaldo,Neymar,Mbappe,Foden or Mount scored that Torres goal we wouldn’t hear the end of it
Severn goals - 3 minutes, get out of here.
Here we go, city fans comparing torres to rashford…
Torres is an underrated player.
Scott Carson wahey!!!!
Ferran Torres take a bow I'd give u goal the the month and goal off the season for that m8
Why they acting like Torres’s third goal was amazing, it was a open goal tap in
Can we just appreciate how good joelinton penalty actually was
Come on citttteeehhhhh!
Newcastle have become the new Jack Grealish. Diving mugs.
What has pep been feeding ferran???
it's always a strange to see no celebrations in these end of season dead rubbers
What a game by both teams. Newcastle did just as well as City today and deserved a 4th but fair play to both teams both worked themselves today. UP THE MAGS ⬛️⬜️⬛️⬜️
Ferran torres > saka
Torres now has more goals than Werner 🤦‍♀️
Alan Shearer would be proud of that Joelinton penalty
Joe Willock is SHINING right now, so happy for him, he deserves to be happy after all the unfair criticism at Arsenal 🙏🙏👏👏
@0:54 - that finish though 🙂🙂🙂
They've really turned it around at Newcastle, what an effort. Hats off to Steve Bruce and the players.
Torres goal was... 😮
feran torres goal of the season🔥
Unlucky Newcastle, put up a real fight and a quality game of football all round
£40m for Nathan ake goes under the radar for flop of the season he is so gash hahahahah
I still can’t get over CITY getting TORRES for 25 million 🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝
Feran Torres Puskas Contender⚽️
What a crazy game to watch!!
Scott Carson is now a premier league champions.     What is 2021 in football anymore?
Softest pens what a joke is the ref a Man Utd fan
Pep needs to play Torres for the full 90 minutes. He got a hatrick against Germany with spain and he got a hatrick for City against Newcastle. What a player he is. At the end of the day he is 21 and he’s bagging goals. C’MON City 💙💙💙.
willock 5 goals 5 games BEAST
torres' first goal 🤩🤩
Ake just isn't good enough, everytime we play him we concede
And they say this game doesn't matter? ?
wow... that was a rollercoaster of emotion
What a goal
ferran torres is a good player, well done to man city to signing him and nice win for man city there after a premier league title.
Greenwood > Torres
willock is in mad form, underrated baller
They bought Torres for 20 million. Incredible recruitment
Scott Carson .. what a player .. saves a pen on his first appearance in 10 years 👏👏👏
Scott Carson easily motm brilliant performance by him
i feel so bad for the man city keeper, on his first start for the club and conceding three goals. couldn’t have done anything about any of the goals
Ferran is now the youngest player to score a hat trick under pep, who’s the second youngest you ask ????............Messi.
they posted this quicker than i finished in my stepsis
What a player Ferran Torres is only signed for 20m aswell (the same price utd payed for Dan James) 👀😂😂😂😂 Youngest player to score a hat trick for Pep along with Messi has a bright future ahead!!!
Torres hatrick🔥🔥
Joe willock with 5 goals in 5 games for Newcastle,this youngster has really come into form can’t wait for him to be back at arsenal next season 👍
Torres is incredibly underrated, shows his class every time he plays
Newcastle vs Man City never fails to entertain.
What a game can’t believe Man City had 3 minutes and 35 seconds with the ball second half best team in England 🤩
Torres and Phil foden both such amazing players the future is theirs.
What a game for Scott Carson 3 conceeded,faced 2 pens, 1 penalty saved and still won 🤣
Scott Carson da GOAT
Sky sports getting comfortable with ads
How are newcastle banging in so many goals lately?
Nathan Ake plays, City concede goals.
I Never Knew It Was So Bright At Newcastle
I personally think that Ferran Torres has received undeserved criticism this season. When you consider that he's come to a new country, has had Covid and not that much gametime and still has decent stats I think that he's had a very good first season at Man City.
Joe Willock scores yet again  What a signing he’s been for Newcastle  Would be a shame to see him leave
When you decide to not watch one match:
Joelinton has massively improved, seems so much more confident
About time we needed a Torres in the league!
Torres 1st goal was world class and no one is talking about it
Kevin bloody friend if you know u know
Flip sake... Now I’ve got to try and recreate the Torres flick! 🤦🏼‍♂️😂🤣
Ferran Torres    Imagine not liking my comment  I mean what are you doing broski g stars
Ferran Torres what a baller on fire so clinical 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Arsenals best player plays for Newcastle 😂😂
i really want sterling to be back in form he needs to cut down his AFK playstyle ASAP
Torres first goal was something else man
That Torres goal though 🔥🔥
Is Pep still drunk from the title party he had the other day Or has he had to much PEPperoni 😉   Starting a goalkeeper who last played a game in premier league nearly 10 years ago   And not even putting ederson in squad never mind on the bench
This football match was just simply incredible. Joelinton even scored to top it off.
That keeper nearly costed city the game😭😭😭
this game just shows how important dias is in the back with city
Man city should of let Newcastle win
arsenal’s willock continues to shine on loan ofc
Respect to Sky for uploading so quickly
City have become to first team to win 12 consecutive away games in England’s top 4 tiers
Premier League Game: Scores more than 5 goals Sky Sports Football: Thriller!!!!
who would have predicted: -Emil Krafth scoring a goal -J9 scoring a goal -Man City conceding 3 goals -Ferran Torres scoring a hattrick
Scott Carson the goat only conceding 3 times in 10 years🐐
I'm early
What a game
Ferran Torres is criminally underrated.
Great game tho
Man City pussioles
Man city
Me : I won't watch the match it will be boring  The match :
Yay
Mad game
I swear city have some of the craziest games
Newcastle have been scoring goals for fun lately!!⚽️
Willock having a great time at Newcastle
Hattrick against neuer wins a prem and efl potential ucl and scores another hattrick today. All at the age of 21. Future star💫
I swear, Ferran Torres is one of the best U21 players in the world, just watch him be up there as one of the best wingers in the coming years
Amazing performance from torres. Brilliant signings
Ferran torres is a beast
Early squad
The last time these two played cb together there was 3 pens conceded ..
First!! City have done so good this season
Ake and Garcia is one the worst centre back partnerships in the PL.
1
First viewer 😜
First
First hehe
Classic pep  Frustrating fantasy football players by not even putting ederson in squad never mind starting   A clean sheet for him tonight and he would have won the golden glove award for the season
Ferando Torres is such a baller
What a finish by Ferran Torres
First
That Torres goal was too good
Game of the season!
