Your new place is absolutely beautiful. Looooove the idea of stepping out of the shower and straight into your dressing room. Very Carrie Bradshaw of you!! ❤
A bit late to comment, but just found you and adore you! Adore your sweet parents too, such lovely people 🥹♥️
Your bathroom looks like a spa❤
So happy for you, you seem so happy! Hope you are okay if you and Manny have split <3 xx
Congrats on your new place 💫 dont know why but i think if you switch piano with mirror would look nice also
Love the new apartment, feels so homey already! I’d say move the mirror over abit and put the chair where the mirror is like a little snug part next to piano and window x
Congratulations on your beautiful new apartment and health to enjoy!!!🫶🏼🤍 I have just moved into my own apartment after being homeless so watching this has gave me a lot of inspiration!! Thank you for being you 😇💞 keep smashing it!!
Love your vids! I was getting single vibes from you but I heard manny’s voice lol
Beautiful ❤
Also congrats angel xx
Me and my bf move in a few months do I love this content
Cut your onions with you tongue out all the way, thats the trick :-P
Like I've never got THIS MUCH OF INSPIRATION from someone on youtube/insta like from her?      Never. I'm so grateful i found her somehow, she changed my life fr. Like seriously, i have so much motivation working on myself, like from appearance to increasing  amount of money on my cards doing some work just for SHOPPING and SKIN ROUTINE.   A need.
9:31 "oh, i look so scary this morning sorry guys" -  hearing from the most beautiful girl on this planet that I've ever fookin seen. Her skin is GLOWING 💔  LIKE literally  p e r f e c t     in all ways. I'm obsessed girl
You need some plants. Fake ones even. Maybe one by the piano window and some outside on the balcony
I love everything here. New subscriber :).. I’m 2 min into the vid & the only thing bothering me is the voice, it feels I’m hearing from far away. I suggest a mike attached to the camera 🫶🏻.
Girl your G L O W I N G ✨🩰

Gorgeous girl ❤
don't know if you're into house plants but that would be nice to add to your area where the piano is!
@14:36 Definitely a tall bird of paradise in a concrete-look pot near the window?! That would be beautiful! 🌿  Congratulations again! Your place is stunning. You’ll make a load of happy memories here. ❤
I'm in awe of this woman.
Sorry to be personal but am I the only one who was like the bf!!?!? He’s back ❤ well I don’t know… but I mean… I think? ❤ anyway congratulations. Flat is lush x
Omg are you still together? Wasn’t this Mani in the background having his hands on these tacos?

Congratulations on your new home 🎉. Run the peeled 🧅 under cold water.
Glad you’re happy, love the cute apartment! Was that manny you were having tacos with?
A recipe? Yes please 🌮🌮🌮
You remind me of Lara Croft in the earlier tomb raider games
Mads keeping her perfumes in her bathroom is giving me so much anxiety omg girly no 😭
Your apartment looks so beautiful ☁️🤍
Tk max have the cutest pumpkin candles in matte black and you can reuse the pot🥹 you need
Congratulations Maddie!! I’m so happy for you ❤
Can you do video about your favourite perfumes and creams and that kind of products?
I think a nice big houseplant would look gorgeous somewhere in the front room 💚
So happy for you ❤ hoping I feel like this once I move into after our house has been delayed 2 years 😫😭
Love.. please can u tell me where the jacket and joggers are from please when u went food shopping x

Tall plants in the corner of your living room and bedroom would look so cute! xx

It’s always a good day when I wake up to madison posting a video 🥳🥳🥳
I love you for wearing those sunglasses 😅❤
OMG EVERYTHING IS GORGEOUSSSSSSS 🤗🥹🩷 the cupsssss 🤭🤭🤭☕️☕️☕️☕️
Love this video, the house looks amazing! Tip for next time though, maybe don’t show your ‘main skincare products’ in the video where you also do an ad saying you only really use the product that you’re promoting xx
girlllll!!!! i discovered u a few days ago and i am already in love with you and the content you create <3333333
Light up a candle near where you’re cutting 🧅 ,it does help ❤️
love
❤❤❤
Love it! Congrats Mads🥳✨..God bless always x
Loved this vlog 🤍 my comfort YouTuber

Heard you say that it’s just you cooking for yourself now. Praying for the best in life for you bc you’re a gorgeous person inside & out. One day you’ll find someone that deserves you!
Congratulations on the new place🎉 it's so cute already!
Got to get real plants.
Is it expensive to live in 🇬🇧
Congrats on your new apt Mads! Question: as a beautiful woman, do you ever experience people treat you unkindly or give you mean stares, look the other way, or anything along the lines?
Where are the navy track pants and little tee from you are wearing please? ❤
I feel like (if you’re not allergic) you should get a cute little girly kitten! I feel like a cat would match your chill vibes, I wasn’t a cat person but then I adopted one from a friend’s litter and I’m obsessed! I feel so complete with a little furry friend 🐱 I think a cute little fluffy white cat would suit you! But if not maybe a fish? Haha
Your new place is perfect😍🤍✨
I wish my place looks like yours ❤❤
Is it just me or do I like the old apt better? Seems like a closed off layout but I do like the new dressing room.
Hi

❤❤❤

Hi Mads, your new apartment is amazing. I can't wait to see you decorate the different rooms😊..and Praise God for your Mum and Dad to help you with your move. Such a blessing 🙏🏾. Oh that wine is Snoop Dogg's brand. Did you like it? Lovely vlog Sunshine, thank you as always for sharing. Take care and God bless🙏🏾.
So happy for u girl 🥰 loving ur new house it looks so cozy and homey ♥
The candles in the window is a cute touch. And the supreme skateboard should go in the hallway that way if you decided to collect more it would be a pretty art wall.
I love the vibes in this Vlog❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats queen!! Looks like it has such a homely feel already ❤
Tacos & banana split is my Love laugage ❤

i put  your  white char   next to the  your  door u gud  sit  there  some time and read your books   it look lovey
put a big glass of water next to where you're cutting onions and it won't hurt your eyes anymore. the chemical goes to the closest source of water, which is usually our eyes. :)
I'm loving the new place! So cosy <3
I'm in love with the bathroom so elegant ❤🎉
What does your lash tech do for your lashes? Style/length/curl etc? Would love to know! You forgot to link in the description too

Girl i have been watching yt for the past 10 years consistently, I never watch tv (so I am used to watching a thousand ytbers). I get literally so excited each time you post, I have not had that in a long time <3 thank you for simply sharing your life with us without overdoing it, without being someone you are not. It is so refreshing.
I’ve been using Dermatica for 10 months now and it has completely cleared my hormonal acne :)
