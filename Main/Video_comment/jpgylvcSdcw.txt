I just got my first full odds shiny ever
14:40 this was my first shiny in this game
I get migraines like every other day and whilst I do find grunty boi funny his voice made me get a migraine so that’s fun
Watching this video later has been so fun, because I did vote when this came out! So trying to figure out what I voted for is really fun!
I want to watch in 2025
“you ever feel bad if you’re checking to see if something is shiny but instead you kinda just slaughter a family?” LMAOOOOOOOOOO
7:50
Valid crash out from Mike’s wtf where some of them votes 😭
16:34  JOHN THE STEREOTYPE IS REAL I LIVE IN TEXAS AND HAVE COWBOY BOOTS
Now a 23:53
I fond a shiny
23:57   He says while I’m actively playing the kalos enhanced version we have waited so long for
I wonder why Pikachu vs Phanphy was so close
ay lets go
17:27. Im with Michael on this one. WTF actually?
I caught a shiny Lolan Vulpix😊😊😊
I found a shiny murcrow, hit it with a ball, it broke out, and used memento and killed itsself
Snom my baby
Was that a Vegeta dragon ball abridged reference
Kalos enhanced version we never got... until now!
20:35 @MANDYJTV THAT IS IN POKEROGUE, VALTEN VELUZA IS IN POKEROGUE, DID YOU GET THAT THERE OR DID YOU MAKE THAT UP, TELL ME! love your videos btw and if you said it before POKEROGUE was made then that's cool they added that
On s Slither wing could be awesome
9:53 IRON BUNDLE BEATS IRON JUGULIS. THE STUPID DELIBIRD 🗣🔥
12:26 i love all the L's in that sentence xD
Me watching this video after Michael’s “Can I name every Pokémon.” Video and he lost his mind trying to remember iron Jugulis’ name . “Huh. That’s funny that he caught one for the I round.”
DK music! 24:05
Sonic music! 23:32
Smash smash smash
17:27 I kinda wanna know what he said
17:04 what is the song?
0:49 IT'S MY BROTHER!!!!!!!
bro mikey shoudlve got scizor not scyther
Snom is better
I would be lived if I was in the situation of snom getting more votes then scyther
19:56 gonna be so fr, I forgot Vaporeon existed. My brain was immediately on Volcarona because it’s one of my favourite Pokemon (so is Jolteon… I love the eevees)
7:43 I staring laughing really loudly on the way to the bathroom. I barely made it!
I'm literally hunting great  tusk I'm so mad right now
Mimikyu won
*Can't believe PM7 missed the Altaria in the middle of the group of Swablu.*
GO SNOM!!
how does iron bundle win!
Michael’s Shinnies 17:51 24:04
❤ Drowzee ❤ 1:36 1:53
John’s Shinnies 0:25 1:58 14:36 21:38 21:54
SNOM!!
I can't wait for season 4.
Jayden Wilson Right now:😑😵‍💫 17:51
16:54 The first thing I came up with for S was Sewaddle… which is in Kitakami.
Oi, Mikey, don't you dare disrespect Snom. The beautiful little guy.
What did Mikey think was going to happen a baby elephant or an adorable  chocolate sticky bun that has sure I it’s name 3:20
cloitsier is squishy boi
OMG what is John's shiny luck!
My respects you you guys for not catching Vaporeon! :3
Why does mikey sound so much like zygarde
Was that a pun? 16:52
For s someone should have caught silvion
12:50 who hears the metal pipe?
Clodsire is just everyones favorite derpie boy
18:33 Who agrees that that should be the new @Mandjtv intro (if you were on this channel for a long time)
Jon is such a green flag. How he enjoys every shiny Micheal catches, its so sweet ♥
Mikey, you forgot Iron Serpent.
When you subscribe to PM7, you get more shinies. When you subscribe to Victiniplayz, you win more Pokemon Battles.
3:57 I think grunty boi deserves his own mytey plush like there’s a team sky mytey plush so it makes sense that grunty boi gets one He’s also a fan favorite so  that’s a business opportunity mikey so consider or at least think abt it
And it was the best thing ever I was just playing Pokémon. Scarlet is about to hop on and I just found it right there.
Guess what? I got a shiny.zorua
Guess what? I got a shiny.zorua
17:04 Sylveon would've won.
0:18
I love the end when mikey's having a tantrum well john is doing a goofy dance😅😅😆
Don't underestimate the popularity of dopey little guys. People love that kind of Pokemon.
Mikey: I have slain the shiny gods! me and the rest of the Council of The Gods of RNG (we're working on the name): Does anyone here feel particularly slain? PM7? No?
14:39
0:28 that’s a shiny breloom( don’t know how to spell it:/
9:56 that is not true who is picking a stupid bird over a magnificent dragon
Him cladsire forget about Rowlet think about cladsire
7:24 why does the finizen's mouth match the music 🎶
M:I FOUND mine- J:MIKEY I JUST FOUND A SHINY MURKROW 2 mins later... J:WOAAH SHINY BISHARP
This was super super fun to watch :)
He didn’t get  slowpo
Get pikachu
A man a plan a canal panama
It would have been better if it is a shiny umbreon
Should have caught drowsy
Y’all god John 🥲
What idiots voted for snom over scythe lol
Quaxly is also start with q and you can hatch eggs to get them
Shiny good good
me like PM7 better
John has so many shinys
Electric boogaloo PVZ HEROS REFRANCE
Anyway this video is sponserd by raid got me laughing for some reason
krookidile exists guys
Are you using the expansion because f should have been froaki
Azelf is detr Then arcunin
see the deal with iron bundle is that people love a rags to riches story
23:09 "Number 7. Number 7 was the one who caught all the shineys."
how did you get the version exclusive from the other game?
SNOM? What?!
Azumarill deserves more love. It was never my favorite, but then once I learned how strong it is in 6 star tera raids, I just love it now.
I love how John and Michael act like father and son when Michael finds a shiny. Michael "I FOUND A SHINY *visible happiness*" John "Yayyyyy! There ya go!"
Bro proved the next game💀
I love Froslass. I started using it a lot in Sword and Shield because you could cheese a pre-gym Dawn Stone from the far end of the Wild Area and it was easy to get Snorunt in a 1-star Raid Den. Caught a Shiny one a few months ago too.
BROOKLN 99 REFERENCE AT Y?!?!??!?!?
30 seconds into the video pm7 got a shiny
For G i for some reason would go Gible instead of Garchomp.
9:14
I feel like the votes were a little rigged.
I play Pokémon every day and never find shinys.
3:24 lol
Well guess what Mikey we are getting Z
We want the footage of Mikey’s rant
Maybe it’s not that John finds more shinies than Mikey, but he misses less shinies than Mikey…
Wailord is massive you know what else is massive
For Q you could do the two different quill fish
10:42 hi everyone it’s a pleasure to be here
John looks so surprised on the letter h but Mikey is so sad😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What about syveon
I’m still here for the treasure planet reference
Me too PM7
9:39 great tusk in the same game as iron bundle? Lol
Yes I am a L for legend
Pokemon legends Z A
Ddd🌰🌰🌰
Is Arcanine assist Lord?😂😂😂😂😂😂
the believe instrumental had me rolling 😭
I really hate grunty boy
Glaceon should’ve been g
Eevee should of been 10 to 0 eevee win
Does anyone remember when mikey said my first two names are john michael WINGULL
17:38
Lol Mikey be crying In the corner
😲 why did it take me this long to realize GruntyBoi is a Team Rocket Grunt? 😂
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE KLAWF HE LITERALLY CARRIED EVERYTHING IN MY GAME
12:41 holy retcon

I agree, a stupid little snom over a icon gen 1 scyther is ridiculous by almost every metric.   Weak ass little ice bug (worst type combo), or a cool ass choppy boy. Shame on the voters.
Hey, I like cufant just fine, but clodsire is one of my favorite Pokémon
You know what, its nearly 2 years and another whole JMC later, but it just hit me that the pun leading into the C round 2:41 is made so much worse when you realize that the Pirate clip used is for a SPACE PIRATE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SEA!!!
Looks like John got 2 more shinies
I caught drowsy in Pokémon, scarlet and named it Mikey’s favorite Pokémon😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I caught drowsy in Pokémon, scarlet and named it Mikey’s favorite Pokémon😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Raquaza
Mist toedscool:<
And igglybuff
You forgot about lmpadimp
I wish someone caught Sylveon -
Eevee beating Elektross is crazy
Mikey going from the John's Shinies going from "OMG dude." to "I'm disgusted." to "I'm going to throw up, just projectile vomit everywhere." reminds me of a Pokemon evolution is hilarious to me.
I LOVE THE SHINY PAWNIARD LINE
21:35
Mikey being upset about Iron Bundle beating Iron Jugulis is funny to me as Iron Jugulis is probably the most hated design of the future Paradox Pokemon
Me😂to
Me being sad for Q they for got about the evo to the wooper
3:31  Mikey: I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction  Katie: But *I* will
Yanma and yanmega just travel to dlc
The video ended at 20:40 😂
Does anyone know the name of the song being covered while they were hunting for Z? I recognize it, and I'm guessing it's a Mario song, but I can't place it exactly.
I love how in season 1 John made the Raichu a love song joke with no hesitation and this season he has learned. But like also I think that is the least of the things you two have said that fuel that side of the fan base 😂
I live in texas
John John John 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
How do we vote
I have to say this after a while, I LOVE both heracross and hawlucha so much that I was thinking for about 35 minutes when I was voting for H but hawlucha is my absolute favorite Pokémon of all time big part cause of the anime and XY being such a good series
3:22 king clod lol
I love how Mikey! “ god darn it” when John gets a shiny but when Mikey gets one John cheers him on it’s hilarious
23:53 is funny to hear now
3:50 Dachsbun should’ve won. Dogs are cute and dragonite isn’t even one of the cool asf dragons.
Hey, the one who got a shiny who starts with a B get more shiny we want to see more shiny
One of my favorites in the new game, even if I haven't used one on my team yet, is Espathra. I think it looks cool and has a great ability :)
I feel like pm7 uses cheats to boost shiny odds
Did any of you notice a shiny breloom at the start of the video?
Why do I feel like Mikey is funnier when he is with John
Everyone loves eevee
Idea: Surprise trade the better Pokemon for each letter of the alphabet Rules: You surprise trade until you get a pokemon with the same first letter as the current letter your going for. Then you have us vote on the better one.
7:46 THAT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD WHILE I WAS EATING OH MY GOD?!
3:21 good..
As soon as you said no vaporeon I found a trainer with   a vaporeon😂
DUCK EEVEE I LOVE ELECTROSS
Mike it's gonna win
How did pm7 get a nuthatches siny
Starting to think dictatorship aint such a bad idea after all. Garchomp over Gyarados?! And with such a margin.. the f. Snom??
"Glimmerte" had me rolling on the floor 🤣
11:36 why was John staring at lechonk and making that humming noise
Mike boo he is the bloody baffon
Mickey mouse is a poser John is winner
No 21:36
21:37😂😂😂😂😂 what
When John gets a shiny  Mikey: I’m going to vomit. When Mikey gets a shiny  John: What did you get? Mikey: Toxicroak John: Nice  I think that he is jealous
pm7 You do realise the eels can’t walk because the fish don’t you use can’t walk because they are fish and fish. Don’t have legs.
Bro you get shines in all the videos
14:17 you should have put that on the poll anyway. The choices would be orthworm or orthworm.
If you click on this -> 20:47  you are a W
What music is playing at the 24 minute mark? It reminds me of an old Mario game or something and sounds really familiar
butcheeck snom <3
Bro justice  yevelter 😢😢 he was forgeten y round 23:04 to 23:06
How is pm7 keep getting shiny is he a game like him?????
Are used to like grumpy boy, but now it’s just like I see her because I  know. It’s a add
1:27 do you b leve
SNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
“The kalos enhanced version we never got”   legend za “let us introduce ourselves
0:25 1:59 John finds a shiny 😂
18:28 the best moment in all the jmc season 2
7:15 in the UK we actually do say ‘flip’ something quite a bit lol
Hey o finally got a shiny clodsire
7:46 WHAT THE HELL?!😂😂😂
“The Kalos enhanced game we never got” uhhhhhh….
Mikey: I’m not going to give you the satisfaction  Editor: hold my beer
0:27 not even a minute into the video
I was incredibly surprised when John didn’t pick Drowzee for D😂
They miss counted. In the S round, John was supposed to have 10 points (8+2=10) but they gave him 11 points. And again in the V round John was supposed to get 12 points (8+2=10+2=12) but they gave him 14.
John the king of shiny pokemon
Stop sleeping on Gyarados😢
Anyone else wish we could actually hear Mikey’s salty rant?
7:49 no no not really I’m doing the population of the Pokémon a favor by saving it form overpopulation
30 seconds in the video and dam shiny
My favorite Pokémon won the L round 😁 yay 12:26
i voted lichonk
I thought John was going for Drowzee for D
No feesh should win
Just catch Magikarp and nickname it to the letter every round boom you win
Could we talk about how the name MandJTV actually could work now with John being in many videos
"Are we to dumb for democracy?"  Yeah at least America is(looking at Trump)
K
K
K
A amarouge
Get your Eevee Lucians right or else I will I’m gonna Unsubscribe
Tell the world to follow Mikey till the day he names his firstborn and yell, “Name it Darven!”
18:53
I have an idea for a video. How about you have six Pokémon F and use those six Pokémon for the whole game
17:33  Miachel: IT'S A STUPID SNOM! Every snom fan ever: You made a big mistake mikey! You shall be punished for your sins 🗡
I WOULDVE VOTED FOR PHANPHY-_-
Mikey u won with killowatrel cuz it was a creature of THE SKYYYYY!:D
he won with killowatrel cuz it was a pokemon of THE SKYYYYY!
PIKABLUE:D
pm7 is best friends with gamefreak so he gets shinies every video
I love PM7
Mikey is so bad at picking Pokémon that people will like 😢
John found the shiny in 32 SECONDS
2:42 I’m glad Mikey knows that treasure planet exists lol it’s cinema just peak cinema🥹
I love how Mikey has to keep the voice with grunty boy but as the squeakiness of the voice fades he has to do the high pitched voice to keep up the grunty boy voice
7:46 “Do you ever feel bad when you’re checking to see if something’s shiny and instead you just kinda slaughter a family?”  -John
How is Justin by the way,it's been a while?
Arceus
0.40 im trying to find the original video of mikey singing it
Does anyone else try to guess the backround music? No, just me? ok
How did people do gyarados so wrong?? 😭
It was rigged
Whoever is voting Is being stupid right now
True
Could you get a shiny king ambit🤴
Me and the future of the legend z game being announced
23:54 welp, that aged poorly
Stop making fun of my name it starts with k
The fact that MandJTV is salty about PokeMen7 getting a Shiny( multiple rather) but when he gets one, PokeMen7 cheers for him is just disrespectful.
Be nice to pm7
23:53 “The round of the Kalos enhanced version that we never got….Z”  Well, well, well, how the tables turns…
15:37 there's also quagsire
When Mikey said “J”, I got a Jake from State Farm on
Funnily enough, when he said write you it sort of sounded like Raichu. So its like a Raichu and Drowzee ship.
wut
Document with the gosh darn Goofy ah grunt bro it's so annoying bro just stop it
Was hoping shiny umbreon but better than none
Too bad that wasn't golden karp
Imagine he found the shiny marcrrow again
Tinkle tim😂😂😂😂
23:55  that didn't age well 😂
Now do the shiny alphabet version on violet and scarlet lol 😂
23:57 hah
When Mike was singing  🎵🎶🤔🎵🎶     😆😆 <- John after Mike saying it was made up.        John wondering what he's singing. 🤣🤣
Would you look at that we finally got Z
I hate to be mean, but Katie's edits just aren't funny.
John got a shiny glimet and I got a shiny glimora
SPEAKING OF THE MISSING Z VERSION... This aged well.
they could’ve caught igglybuff for i i’m pretty sure
John's luck for shiny pokémon is so high that it's above heaven itself
I’m watching this after legends z a has been announced. Mikey was like “the one kilos game we didn’t get!” We got it Mikey!
No way snom wins over scyther no way
Tbh how did they not know Clodsire was gonna win? It’s one of the best Pokemon ever and its meme-ability is top notch
I thought they didn’t want Vaporeon for a different reason 😏😏😏
Are they not brothers? I always assumed they were.
that z comment seems to have aged well
17:28 I'm 100% with you on what I assume this rant is about. Scyther is and always has been my favorite Pokemon. I may like the idea of Frosmoth, but Snom is overrated.
Seriously tho, people have really bad tastes in Pokémon.
just lucario is best
11:34 but that’s what mikey takes       Ps I love the channel
I honestly thought snom would win by more
At this point im questioning if Nintendo is just giving John boosted shiny odds games
18:31 we do need more acapella
L+L=W
People who subbed to pm7 from start
Mikey's source of Content: Pokemon Grunty boi's source of Content: This video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends
There was qauxly
I have a shiny umbreon!
I got an idea, this exact same thing but randomized Pokémon :)
have John do pokemon violet with only shiny elephants and frogs please.
John legit missed an shiny orangaru
23:55 - Mikey predicts the future.
Imagine if the shiny donphan was a phanpy
EMBARRASSING 😂
PM7guara ntee
Mikey: Anywhere, Anytime, You and I can have the time of our lives Me: *vibing*
23:54 This aged well
the all mighty power of iron bundle
All I’m saying is d should’ve been drowsy
As Michael stood upon the blood-soaked earth where the slain gods littered the battlefield, their hands still clenching their weapons with their dying breaths fortold a prophecy about one to take on Michael  "Our power you have gained, but still there is one who remains. Strive against him if you like, in the end, he will take your shinning light."  And Michael looked over to the curse sayer "And what is that, to a non-beliver?"
I am subscribed but my entire life is still an L
That Z joke aged like a fine wine.  *2025, Legends: Z-A*
World record for fastest shiny in video 25 seconds
3:31 Katie: BUT I WILL
Oh boy do I have news about Pokémon z
Leave it to Texans to buy a firearm before cowboy boots
23:53 That didn't age well
Johns luck on these challenge videos is nearly a million times better than his shiny hunt video luck
People not liking cufant makes me sad, its my favorite pal😢
Nice joke for f
🗿
It’s funny re-watching this at 23:53 now knowing in 2025 we will have a Pokémon Z.
23:55 well this aged well
poor mickey
Michael read the future. Pokemon Legends Z-A
Pkoemon legends Z-A
@MandJTVPlays 23:53 YOU'RE EATIN' YOUR WORDS NOW XD
23:56 think again Mitch that got announced today
Anytime Mikey gets angry at John for finding an early shiny is hilarious.
I don't wanna be that guy but where is the seizure warning. (3:32)
ive never caught a shiny before so the amount of shinys they've found is astonishing for me
I have a question is this scarlet or violet?
thank you katie
Some of them want to catch them some of them want to trainnn them
The person that wins round y has to do ymca on a  I’ve stream 😂😂😂❤❤❤😅😅😅
Are you a Klingon from Star Trek milky? In Klingon mythology the heroes killed the gods
Watching through this again made me notice multiple songs that have been made into Juno Songs lyrical covers. Huh
Absolutely I hate when they respond with k
i was about to say “what about quagsire” then remembered that here it is clogsire
why no drowzee?
5:45 kerkasot
Can you stop finding shinny for 5 seconds!
PZ7 just has infinite, shiny luck
0:33 You mean 33 seconds?
S... I would've went with Sylveon
You guys only wanted John to win because you didn't like Mikey's choices
Boku wa doctor tony tony chopper
lechonk stood no chance against lucario
johns luck with shiny pokemon is absurd
I'd subscribe if you maintained the fast-paced speaking, but it seems geared towards children, deterring me from subscribing. Sorry.
Taylor swift is bad luck for me, dont say her name or your shiny luck will vanish
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
2:42 bet most people don’t what movie this is
How do they not realise how much people like clodsire 🤣
Not even 30 seconds into the video and PM7 gets a shiny
Pm7  is cool
Now do this in a different language
good
For S, Slitherwing would have dominated
For M i would do METAGROSS
I just looked at the sub count. See you soon miltank😂
SNOM IS THE BEST BUG EVER AND I WILL SHOW U  By the way this is my 4th time watching, I love ur vids!
seems like John got 7 more shinys
The fact that they forgot oricorio was hilarious
Shiny murkrow found. 30 seconds into the video
Snom over Scyther is CRAZY
naclstack is clearly not a frog, but an evil mutated minecraft pig.
You mist a shiny spionk mikey 😢😢😢😅
i have 15 shiny
0:25 seconds in, and John already found a shiny-
Why didn’t you get route bonnet because it’s a paradox Pokémon plus it’s also a B Pokémon
Who else wanted to hear Mikey's rant about Snom and Scyther? Because I did.
you missed a shiny
I love veluza because I got a shiny one
🎵I never wanna hear you say I got a shiinay!
Truly deserved
I mean let's be honest hydroidon isn't as good as Hydreigon.
Pokémon mario
I love you Pokémon videos
3:19 what did they expect it’s the all and knowing Clodsire (no seriously though, Clodsire is one of those Pokemon who go famous unexpectedly, examples being Pokemon like bidoof and snom) and at 6:48 it’s because of the it’s not cufant it’s the fact you put it up against the all mighty Clodsire
❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
P p Pikachu
I ❤ Pokémon
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 you two are so funny
You two have are so funny 😂 you have to
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I know Markiplier I’ve watched his channel. He’s so famous his jokes are funny.😂 do you know he plays Fnaf plays for naff find Colton toys?
Mandjtv is the REAL winner pm7 is a loser
You're catching an l😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Scyther is the best bug type in kanto and snom is literally nothing! How the hell did snom win!
Mikey when John gets a shiny:"I HATE YOU!!!!" John when Mikey gets a shiny:*starts a sponsor
I'm curious if people just vote all one side answers this giving John the win   Or if they figure out who caught what they are bias because it isn't switched up John's is always on the same side.  Just a thought
WE KNOW
Assists
HOW TO CATCH SINIES SO EASILY
I literally have a shiny bisharp that I evolved
Jokes on you pm7 I don't own cowboy boots but I live in Texas 😅
S For Sylveon
I’m happy for Mikeys shiny but I DESPISE GOLDUCK
In my first playthrough of violet I got my very first full odds shiny and it was nacli
Vr
I’ve played Pokémon for 10 years and my only shiny is a gogoat. John’s shiny luck hurts
It’s Micheal and Jhon tv
30 seconds into the video and John found a shiny
When Michael found a lucario I finished a riolu raid
It does make sense that wooper won because it’s cute and wugtrio looks Sus
On S, I think you're a garganicle again(a temple of salt)
I know I’m 8 months late on this vid but Snom beating Scyther is egregiously bad
The letter U round….      KNOW WHEN TO WALK AWAY!!! AND KNOW WHNE TO RUN!
I wish i got that many shinys that frequently
I and Iron Bundle beats Iron Jugulis it’s a Delibird
I got that garchomp
I’m surprised they forgot about flareon and sylveon
After coming back to this video, I remembered seeing shiny bisharp on there, and even though it didn’t say John caught it, I was more than sure it was him🤣

I have pm7’s garchomp
SNOM!!!!
3:25 Clodsire is best boy That derpy expression is the reason I'm suffering from not able to both buy the game and can't buy a Nintendo switch
Garchomp and Gyarados are my niece's favorite pokemon.
*yanmega yveltal and yamahama has left the chat*
who wants grunty boi to host a vlogging channel living with the sylvan watchers in the forest lol
0:35 I actually have a shiny murkrow, but I lost it😢
Nacly is a lil toasted marshmallow rock its cuter. Now vs the finak evolution might be harder
Because toxicroak is awesome
If Pikachu lost the P round, I would've been absolutely furious bc it's the literal mascot.
I got a random shiny Golduck with out having the shiny charm in my first playthrough of Scarlet
I... Don't know why he was so surprised clodsire won.... Clodsire is THE fan favorite pokemon of the game... EVERYONE pretty much loves clodsire
RESPECT THE CLOD >:D
It is true  John  everyone has a  pair of cowboy boots
Was john catching these shinys
I liked trying to guess what Pokemon they would pick (or What Pokemon would I pick for each letter). I loved it when I thought like one of them. e.g. E - Eevee, G - Garchomp.  Kind of sad that there wasn't a contest between Garchomp and Gardevoir for G.  But this whole challenge brings up another question. Could you teach the alphabet to children using Pokemon like this?
P,ease do this in a random izer
3:29 DEEZ NUTS
PM7: Mikey, I found a shiny Murkrow!  Me: Great! I found 3 of them!
John I have a shiny cooperajah
Clod is a fan favorite THATS why it won
Bro has to be eating sandwich before the recording started
Does anyone else notice how Grunty Boi and Mikey Actually Look like their talkign to each other by looking in the direction every time they say words
I rewatched it for the Final and i think Mikey lost against Snom because he made a playthroght with it and his fans thought he caught it XD
I won't lie a lot of these votes REALLY surprised me. Either people really wanted to make Mikey mad, wanted John to win or just like pokemon that I would not expect people to like more than pokemon I would expect a lot of people to like (if that makes sense). also clodsire 🐐
8:05 I found the exact same tera Garchomp
Why didn’t you get a drowsy for the d round instead of Dragonite
I think the scoring should’ve been done differently for this video. After each poll, your score increases by your percentage of the vote. Whoever’s total is higher at the end wins. If someone wants to calculate that for this video, go ahead, but it’s 3 AM and I don’t feel like it right now.
Why did Mickey not go for drowzee
I like how salty MandJTV gets when Iron Bundle won even tho iron bundle is wayyyyyyyyy better then Iron Jugulis both in looks and competitive. (but its dumb that snom won tho but its pretty adorable tho)
Snom is god. Snom is life.
You missed a shiny gla goat
If you visit someone else's game you can't find their paradox pokemon tho so did you trade the Paradox pokemon for the I round?
Why did any of them go for Lefeon for the L round
mikey got a  2 shinys
shouting all the eeveeuolons that went with each letter
The meme AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
Because you can not catch quagsire
New cave form mytey
Crystal onix
* *sigh** it was sponsored by raid shadow legends
17:33
17:32
Don’t you get lost
Do you have😊
for q do quaxly from an egg
17:52  😮😮😮😮😮 YES
14:37 again no I’m not doin this peace out bye :’*
1:59 and again…
0:28 28 seconds to be exact Mikey [ that is when it zooms in]
Hey mikey i wanted to ask if you know what the game bayonetta is because i hear it often in your videos 😊😊😊
In the y round you forgot yvetal
The disrespect to Gyarados
The disrespect to Gyarados
Michael forgot about Yuh-Vu-Tal
I subbed to PM7 and got a shiny larvitar without a shiny charm 🫢😱
My names darvin😂
23:04 what about yamper?
I named my pokemon violet team after poketubers. Mikey the Quaquaval  Rich John the ghouldengo  Hiphop the revavroom Truegreen the ceruledge  Gnoggin the veluza DeadSpread the Mirador
Does anyone else LOVE grunty boi(y) or is it just me?
Yeah pm7 shinys always
Charizard would've automaticaly gotten my vote for C being he's my all time favorite pokemon
I swear Mikey used some of the lines introducing the letters in the first episode of last season.... Not the first time I've heard the ones for C, D and G
FALINKS SUCKS AND FINIZEN IS THE ONLY COOL NEW MON WHAT IN THE WORLD
for s you pick slizd wing
What is the song at 13:05???? I have been looking for it forever and don't know what it is called lmao. Great video btw keep it up!
eelektross is one of my favorite pokémon i’m so disappointed
is it just me or did u guys notice that john has 69 quickBALLS?
my only shiny is golduck
Anyone else here actually want to hear Mikey's rant uncensored?
I would have gone with drowzee with D
Me having more shiny luck than mikey in most vids
Cannot subscribe
Having Bisharp be labeled as shiny was basically giving John the point
WOOPER!!!!!
If you do this again you should put 4 pokemon up. The 2 you both caught and then 2 random pokemon. Just so the fans don't try and cheat. Clearly at G it is no way anyone can sit there and think Garchomp has a good shiny. Bisharp would've won anyways but that Garchomp one made no sense at all.
Having rewatched this video a couple times, I had a thought.  If there’s only one Pokémon with a certain letter, you guys should set a timer for like 5 minutes and hunt for the shiny version of it.  First to find it wins the point and if neither find it, then the next letter is worth double points.
It angers me how John calls Nacli a mushroom, And then Mikey calls Naclstack a frog.
Xatu xurkitree xerneas have left the chat
I love arkinine and garrydos and drozy and Sandeshshry and Pikachu and perzin and Charzazd and Rawcsa and hondoom and sqwertil and donfan and either and bulbasur and lukario AND MEGA GROUNDON and garrydos and drozy
Same
GG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A to meet you
John Michael Cup Season=JMCS
What about æøå?
16:04 why does he look like my 1 grade school pictures?
Katie is best editor so good
krazy
John the shiny lucky froggy
They both have a Koraidon, so why waste your time catching pokemon
Jigglypuff sucks
When it was Di, I was in shock when it wasn’t drowsy
bisharp is my first shiny i ever cot
AND IT EVOLVED
I cought a Shiny Rolycoaly
Mikey is salty and is yelling at us because we keep voting the  wrong Pokemon and he's going to take away our voting privileges and I'm going to say something one thing why did you even give us just to take it away why you keep doing this if you know John going to win
1:58 2:17 2:27
33 seconds that's how long it took🤣
Nobody: Me: my name is vizaan
3:28 the editors got us
DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE…………. Z NUTS
Oh boy someone is Mr Angry today
Surprised that pm7 never caught drowzee for the d round
Haaaaaaa
I thought finizen would have slaughtered, people who voted were trolling.  18:smn: Already found 4 more bs votes  I actually hate vaporeons design, aslso i hate fhe salt rock pokemon except for naclstack
Team dog
Let’s be honest, they probably had an off screen agreement of not catching drowzee, whoever caught it would have won the round. And some pokemon are obvious who caught it despite not including it which could definitely sway the vote a bit.
I'm so sad that neither John nor Mikey thought of Luxray for L... 😢😢
Kilowattrel is my favorite budget Zapdos.  Also Numel is the cutest pokemon of all time imo.
Why didn’t you pick Iron Moth Mandjtv !?!?!
Pm7 should have gotten luxray for the L round
to be fair in the I round Iron bundle sees competitive play in VGC.
I will never be more dissapointet in John for not picking drowzee when it was D
You missed a shiny!
The Shiny Gods were slain by Micky, but they came back and punished him by John getting all the shinys!
Hey! Don't judge my snom nom
When pm7 got the shiny donphan I got mad because I koed one
I think there some shenanigans going on because when John found the iron bundle a frame previously there was a great tusk to his left( 9:39 ) If I’m wrong that they aren’t version exclusive please educate me
I think this vid is go- I interrupted this regularly, programmed comment to bring you to sponsor for today’s video raid shadow legends
24:06 His teeth tho
I feel like Snom won specifically cause of tumblr
What about Clodsire?😢
Nice shiny Pokemon Pm7
“You ever feel bad when you’re checking to see if something is shiny and instead you kinda just slaughter a family?”   Had me crying
I hate sponsors so no I will not download RAID
Mikey I didn't even vote
Threes an iron bundle one and the reason failings and EV and Klaus I are one is because for one claw zaire starts out as a chocolate wooper and everyone loves chocolate so favor chocolate whooper everyone loves it because because it’s a chocolate pooper and then Evie, you already know it’s a cute, lovable fuzzball iron bundle. It’s a cute little robot real life, Tamagotchi pet.
Garchomp is my fav and it won't change
You should do this concept and do a pokemon battle.
In 30seconds
Mikey looking forward FI fge rule 34 art of him and Drowzee sleeping together lmao
I think Iron Jugulis is one of the lamer paradox designs, glad I'm not alone
For a YouTuber Mikey has a weirdly small understanding of what's cool. I'm only at J now, if he comes back good for him, but I knew each time who takes the point, not hard to understand what's cool for people.
Three SHINIES in one video
I love froslass
Eelectross is better than Eevee.
I love totsugiri
I love shither

PM7 just ignored an Altiria at letter A lol
I stg if I see another god damn as for raid shadow legends I’m gonna flip this table, and then one of the legs is gonna stick up and I’m gonna sit on it. I’m so tired of it.
I dont know why i found it funny but 26 letters in the alphabet but the video is 25 minutes lol
epic rap battles of history ADHD (john) vs autism (mikey)
Let’s give a thank you to this sponsor for the video Me: starts violently double tapping to the right
lycanrock is better than locario tbh lol
To me snoms line seems like them trying to make another vulcarona
It'd now be surprising if John doesn't catch a shiny
J                                 A                                          C                                            O                                B
7:46 I'm glad I'm not alone in that
PM7 cannot have two seconds without a shiny
I saw altaria a letter
17:57 am I the only one that thought Scizor looked like it was gold because of the lighting or no? Because it honestly looks gold at this part to me lol
Bro. Michael talked about "Hail yeah" merch when he caught a pokémon that's 4x weak to ice! Was that a coincidence?
So he got 2 shiny😂
Treasure plant reference!!!
PM7 sounds like Jerry Seinfeld when shouting Pika Blue
14:35 meee toooo!!!! now we are shiny donphan friends John 🎉
Pls can PM7 give me shiny luck
i love how mikey gets furious at people's choices on pokemon in the challenge centered around fan choices
"Clodsire dominated"  ADMIRE THE SIRE
13:15 i'm assuming its from a song i just can't figure the song/ artist
WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE GARCHOMP??? I don't understand
Petition to make memes for Mikey forgetting the Eeveelutions
good 😃
Hmm you know Mike might have gotten a higher score if gyarados was shiny but who knows 😂
you are my favorite youtuber
If Mikey forgot about Volcarona then we should get Volcarona memes about Mikey
Mikey got screwed. So many of his Pokémon were better or at least closer than the poll ended up lol
Get a hondge and give it to misfit. Generation 9. Shiny
My dad played raid
22:00 I never found a shiny in the background while fighting another Pokemon but have while I was surprise trading. I was on a patch of sand out in the ocean where there were a bunch of Eiscue. With some pokemon if you stand and not do anything they'll surround you and just stare. A shiny Eiscue was amongst the group.  Also John's shiny luck reminds me of my own. I'm John and my friend/roommate is Mikey.
It’s been 0:26 into the video and that’s when he found the shiny
Is that iron treads shiny? 9:40
evee
Arces
I vote 100 for Arcanine!
I got shiny GOGOATTTTTT today.
Can we just talk about how nobody got farigaraff in both f rounds? Also, if John did actually go for it, he could’ve gotten a shiny one, which would decimate anything Mikey got
The best part is deez nuts
John and Shinies are unseparated
PM7 has better taste
They should have done garnavwor  war for g
U should have picked VAPOREON for V......... No reason!
I needed to know if there was fanfiction, and there is. Mikey, I am so sorry
I love the Pokémon you caught Michael
I just love your shiny murkrow
in the o roun d ithought he was gonna say ' "oh the misery ,every body must sub to mandjtv plays"
2:40 DEEZ nuts Mikey
Twice
17:25 I'm honestly surprised Snom didn't have a much bigger lead here, I know that's a popular one, and the main thing scyther has going for it is that 4chan meme of it being your favorite pokémon.
Irrelevant, but did anyone else think Dr Squatch Sponsored this video when they heard “Forest”?
There is fanfictions of Mikey & Drowzee wtf 🤣😂😅
We love an add leading into an add. Cmon Mikey.
Snom was highly liked thanks to PokeTips Mike, Nom the Snom
I feel everyone is voting for pm7 for him to win dawg like come on leylt Mikey win
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEERRRRRRRRR
I love your videos
Wugtrio is Dugtrio set to wumbo!
I love John throwing for content in the middle
I'm surprised that Mikey didn't catch Drowzee for D
John when micheal catches a shiny: Great for you man Mikey when John catches one: I'm never recording with you anymore
where would you subscribe to vote on future videos?
Hot take: You don't have to be a kid to enjoy these videos. Like I aged out of most Pokémon channels but I always come back here. I love the content here and with any of Mikey's friends.
Mikey is BIR a pillar I’d sale  Naclstack
can i come to mikey and drowse wedding
Wait is your middle name Michael and your first name is different and you go by Michael, or is your name Michael Michael *last name*
No offense Mikey, but with how popular Clodsire is, it was like giving someone poop and chocolate and asking what would they rather eat
i clicked on this video,i already watched it but i thought i would watch it again and the second the video starts i hear shinyyyyyyy because it started at the time that John found the shiny donphan because i already watched it
omg! how many times has john got a shiny before mikey?
I think John is consuming our shiny luck making it only 1/30
Now I'm going to name my shiny Scyther mandjtv
Psduck was my first shiny
Is Mr tinkletim the new drowzy?
I don't know if people would prefer Slaking or Sableye instead of Snom, telling as other S options for Mikey.
7:46 Can relate lol
The day I watched this video I got a shiny heracross 😂
17:14
My first shiny in scarlet and Violet was also a golduck I used in the league and was happy when Michael caught it
CLODSIRE HAIL YEAAAAAA
PUTTING THE PM7 GARUEENTEE
TREASURE PLANET REFERENCE
I got big nostalgia the moment I seen Captain Silver from Treasure Planet.
14:36 third one..feeling sorry for mikey
For the 2nd F you could've chosen Flutter Mane.
1:59 second shiny,bisharp.
0:25 WHATS UP WITH JOHN AND SHINY POKEMON MAN.
17:29 IT’S A STUPID SNOM! OVER SCYTHER! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The part where they just spontaneously went in vocalizing The Gambler and never mentioned it is awesome 18:31
How does Jon get shinys
PM7 guarantee, I decided to pick up my Switch for casual shiny hunting, as he finds the shiny Glimmet I stroll over to a Venomoth hoard and boom, beautiful blue bug before me.  EDIT: And then like a minute after finishing catching and informing my friend of that, I find a Shiny Heracross. What is my life.
Bro what is the shiny luck in this video
Hmm more shinys 😂😂
15:44
mikey: what is a god to a non-believer broly: *shatters all of mikeys bones* DO YOU BELIEVE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
9:53 “But it has a funny cannon”
17:36 HE IS BEST BOI HE IS GUMMY SNOM IS FOREVER
My favourite pokemon is garchomp
sandy shocks:
I really want to see a non cut version of Mikey’s salty rant.
The selecting one helped me out very mutch now my blastoise cant get jumped by 2 people and at least  you helped me perfectly thank you very mutch
9:12 cuz you're salty?
I like the treasure planet reference 🥰
Does everyone in Texas like propane and propane accessories?
Poor Eelektross deserves better.
How dare you rant about snom
Bro forgot great tusk for G
2:07 i actually what evolve to him in my first days playing the game
8:30 if this was the nuzlocke community Mikey would of won what’s great Pokémon iconic for its help
wait how did he catch the violet exclusives in scarlet?
why snom wins whith scyther
The bromance they have is immaculate
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Poooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Not even a minute into the video and John has a shiny
You past an altaria in the start
There was a shiny in 16:37 and he didn’t even knew 😢😭
gyarados is cool and all, but once you are cynthias ace, no other G can be better than you.
For y Pokémon think Michael forgot yamper existed too lol
Can’t believe neither of them caught drowzee for D
after y when Mikey was behind by at least 5 it was realistically over, no way to catch up
Virgin sudden ad bit: usually   Chad improv act involving an ad: this video
How on earth did Scyther not DOMINATE against Snom?! Scyther is awesome!!!
I’m currently drawing miraidon while watching this
Who wants to see Mikey get hired as a VA for the gen 9 series of Pokemon?
I hope he gets magikarp
On letter M I hope PM7 gets fresh
I won't be surprised if PM7 managed to complete a Pokédex of shines.
I think Mikey might need to consider that his opinions are bad. Also consider female voters
Pm7 should have caught drowzee for d
Not goofy gofy
Clodsire is my favorite.  Sorry Michael
9:13 idea: "I played Pokémon Scarlet as the saltiest Rock Gym Leader of Paldea" :D
bro found shiny in first 0:24 second of the video
I would vote  Azumarill Breloom Clodsire Dragonite  Electross Falinks Garchomp Herracross Iron Jugulis John Jolteon Klof Luke-Car-Rio MJTV Mimikyu Numel Oth Niether Pikachu Froslass Roaring Moon Snob Tatsugiri Umbreon Veluza Wooper Cyclazar Nacli Zwelius
Mike please defeat John on caching shiny Pokemon good luck
How dare you do that snom is my favorite old Pokemon
I feel like the voting wasn't based on just pokemon but the fan favorite youtubers the viewers preferred tuber
Can you please put your mitey plush in England pls😊
❤❤❤ love it this vid is amazing ❤️‍🔥
Garchomp is wayyyyy to overrated i prefer noibat/noivern
My heart grew in rage when my boi scyther lost.... What has this world come to 😭
i feel like Iron Jugulis is literally the least popular paradox mon i have no clue why mikey went for it
Can we just appreciate the content these 2 put out! Easily my 2 favourite PokeTubers! Thank you Mikey and John - And Grunty Boi!
Whattt!??!?! People prefer falinks from a LITERAL DOLPHIN that we've been waiting for agesss
Fish
Thank you for catching jolteon on j round jolteon is my top favorite eeveelution and my name starts with j so im happy
12:23 There's still hope for the internet
Cannot believe Zweilous beat out Zangoose 😤
Grunty Boy is the only reason I ever watch ad reads lol
Looks like John got a nether shiny
17:31 he's releasing the salt
Was watching this while playing violet and found a shiny steenee :)
As someone whose favorite Pokémon of all time is Phanpy i am SO LIVID about the results of the P round 😡😡😡
do you like Eevee Because I LOVE IT
Snom is our lord and savior. You dare question the majesty that is Snom?
What is grunty boy in every video
Bro lol I take L all the time my name starts with a L 1 like = 1prayer
G is for gardafour
3:35 i was excepting john to catch drowzee
Jigglypuff deserved better
1:52 Ao3 search of MandJTV/Drowzee
This video begs me the question. DOES our alphabet start with A or do WE start with A?
Natalie probably one because it looks like a mushroom from Mario or people just like small rocks
it was 33 secs when john got murkrow lol
18:56 chills literal chills
****** those who voted snom over scyther
Mikey is better than PM7
I'm not taking L's
SNOOOOM!
Change ur strategy and change the pokemin positions cause people tend to click on the closest to the mouse 😆 so change the positions is a winning strat
No body says flip cause u don't want ur chat to flip the finger on u , flip is used in a bad context
My dad has raid shadow legends
the new saying is haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaail yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
So I didn't vote, but I probably would have voted for snom in the s round.  Almost exclusively because there's a tumblr account of i-am-snom and it gives exclusively good vibes and serotonin, so I have a positive correlation to the snom pokemon.
I appreciate other people think toxicroak is much better than tatsugiri
14:40  micheal- im gonna throw up im just gonna projectile vomit
You are so lucky PM7!!!
Grunty boi, don't you remember the incident?
While watching you guys I just found a shiny gogoat
Look at Eevee’s entry and tell me there won’t be a radiation-based poison type evolution
You shouldn't get a Quagsire
Wdym only one Q pokemon  Quagmire was literally caught erlier in the video Edit: I forgot it’s clodsire
Im pissed nobody did drowse for D it woulda been a insta win
I also ranted for like 2 mins when Scyther lost to Snom i mean i love Frosmoth as much as the next guy but over freaking Scizor C'mon
PM7 caught more shinies in one video than I have in 3 years.
Mikey in that video turned into kratos from god of war
Frankly I'm disappointed that Mikey didn't catch a Drowzee for D
Shiny
17:37  John innocently loving Snom forever
I feel Gyarados vs. Garchomp definitely shows the average age of the audience/voters
Glimmerete has been born!
And I thought getting 3 full odds shinies in a month was absurd…
24:34 Zveilous.
Yessss I ❤️ this
Bro Electross is the goat
Go PM7!
Why this is not on the Playlist i thought you guys didnt wanna continue the cup already 😂😂 I got pm7 Playlist and it was not there 😅
"I'm gonna Raichu and Drowzee a love song." 🤣
The salty rant about snom was dang funny
I’m putting te pm7 gantries Johnson is gonna won buys good luck mickey
Qurtl?!
im just here to say i caught the sonic heroes menu music in the background at 23:13 and it pleased me greatly. thank you.
how many times have you made sponsor with raid shadow legends?!?!?
Snom over Scyther I'd rage too
no cause when I saw the florgress markiplier clip I full on spat out the pretzel I was eating
Hi Michael What spin the wheel do you use?
JOHN MISSED A SHINY FIDOUGH IT RAN INFRONT OF THE DASCHOUND
This is solid proof that  S N O M  I S  G O D ! ! !
Idk why them both catching my favorite eeveelution made me so happy.
Tatsugiri won
For N try  N ee time N ee place  N ee where
I have an idea for a jmc video: you and john race across Paldea, and your goal is to get as many pokemons as possible. Each pokemon is 1 point. If you get a shiny its 3 points. When one person gets to the goal they get 5 extra points,  and the other person has 5 minutes to get to the goal. If they don't they lose 10 points. Once a pokemon is caught, it is off the board. No fast traveling.
Mandtv can sort if sing  The low notes
Tatsugiri lost only bc it's so goddamn op and they're salty abt their competitive losses
If you flip something  It means giving someone the middle finger 🖕🏻 in the UK
23:11  "it was him! number 5 killed my brother-"
My jaw actually dropped when i saw SNOM. BEATING. SCYTHER. I prefer Snom, but damn-
18:34 Amazing musical capabilities
I think John should have gotten DROWZEE
15:30 what is the music here? It’s driving me crazy
I love how livid Mikey got for 6 consecutive rounds🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
U two should be on a music band😂😁
Why did people choose a SNOM OVER A SCYTHER!  Yes, I am a Mikey fan over John, both still make good content.
That is just mean because I am already a l
SNOM
I voted in this! And it looks like most of the things I voted lost lol…
Well I can name an alphabet  Alakazam,Barboach,Cloyster,Dragonair,Espeon,Falinks,Gible,Hawlucha,Igglybuff,Jolteon,Kadabra,Loudred,Marill,Nidoking,Orbeetle,Pachurisu, Quagsire,Rayquaza,Syther,Turtwig,Umbreon,Voltorb,Wooper,Xernias,Yyveltal,Zerua
John being so kind to Michael when hed get a shiny is awesome
"Do you ever feel bad when you're checking to see if somethings shiny, and instead you just kinda slaughter a family?"
John must have the extra shiny charm or drowze must be cheating on Michael and helping John.
1:05 How does it feel the editor wanted PM7 to win?
21:18 don’t worry I love wugtrio
add is over at 5:54 / 24:56
How did the fat diabetes dragon win over   dashbun
I’m really sad vaultin valuza didn’t win 😞
Nice video boys! Keep up the good work
lemme see cetoddle
FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
I SAW SABLEYE AND EEVEE TH ONLY THING THAT COULD MAKE IT BETTER IS YOU SUBBING TO PM7 ANDMANDJTV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For the ones where there is only one pokemon or you both catch the same thing, you should've just but both in the poll and made them vote the right one
Sythers cooler!
Great video!!
You should do this but with types and then with generations in a single video! That would be neat.
I cannot skip your ad reads fast enough. They’re impossibly annoying, especially when you’re watching this to go to sleep.
I hope MandJTV wins. Also Pm7 has to much shiny luck.
Hi❤
I would have voted for "VAULTIN' VELUZA", but I knew Volcarona would win as well...
That Mario Odyssey music slaps
I Love You guys William Slater Hedgcoxe Elementry
J is for joslyn  and John
All this makes me want to do is boot up and try to encounter some random shinies. Its how I got a shiny skiddo, was traveling to a greninja raid and it was literally my first family spawn
For q there’s quaquaval
I too feel bad loooking for shinys lol
the luck that pm7 has with his shiny hunting is out of this world
These two men celebrating over Michael finding a Shiny Golduck during this is really wholesome to me.
If I had a nickel for every time that John mentions Drowzee, I would have nonillion nickels, which is just… wow that is a lot
9:53 I mean iron bundle is at least different than delibird while jugs is just a robot hydregon
tp                               pm7 missed a shiny
Honestly I'm kinda surprised that none of them caught Slither Wing for S. I'm pretty sure it would have dominate the other S Pokémon
Common Clodsire W
The "C" round was no surprise who won when PM7 caught a Clodsire
Toxicroak sucks!!! This is bull to the crap!! Theres no way john should win that point!!
Pseudo legendaries should be banned in these challenges period!!!
Thats complete bullshit; shinies shouldn't count as the damn poll option
right now qwilfish is the only q pokemon qagsire why are we here just to sufer
I found MandJTV when the 3rd ep of the JMC season 1 came out. I feel old
6:42 let’s go Eevee!
I am frankly appalled that there were 2 C rounds and Cetoddle was not in either one!
Should I write the mikey drowzee fic fr tho? someone tell me, I have too much free time
People probably voted snom and Nacli Because there cute. They probably dont care about the strength of the Pokémon Only how cute or beautiful it is.
do it by base stat total
7:46 no I don’t, it’s still free materials and exp
TREASURE PLANET REFERENCE!!!!!!!!! THE BEST DISNEY MOVIE!!!!!!
Barely even half a minute in and John got a shiny  Edit: 2 things 1: Is this Bromance or Romance? There is too many bromance moments here  2: Easiest way to win popular vote is Eeveelutions.
"B-lieve in" the magic in a young girl's heart
The "Q" round was waifu v waifu
I feel you, (scarlet/violet) My friend got a marked shiny nymble early in his playthrough then got a shiny sneasal as well while I have no shinies.
pm7 is hacking
on 2,40 you put a clip of a pirate with a robot eye pls tell me the name of the movie i remember watching it when i was younger but i do not remember the name pls tell me
Bro I just love the Zelda music and my 2 favorite game franchises combined in a way is just amazing
I'm gonna wait for the ghost form of mytey, if there's going to be one.
Bro I want Mikey to win but he made so many bad choices
I still think Mikhele won
9:57-10:00 the entire republican party rn
No more shadow legends please no more I'm sick of it.
Mike have you not learned anything from your country's history of online voting?!Dont make others vote for you they'll always troll vote!!
Can you do a team sky video in scarlet and violet
I found that tera Lucario myself at complete random, but it became the heart and soul of my team when i named it after my baby cousin
You should make an intro to the John Michael Cup.📣🔔
Fun fact: Mikey used the same joke for C as he did in another alphabet and didn't remember haha, classic mickey
Very happy with the Treasure Planet reference
Soon, i will starting to take bets on how many shinies John gets on the video
Made me happy seeing the Treasure Planet clip!! One of my all time favourite movies!!
Can I tell you something funny whatever I found out you had that fire parent of the mighty got his I got me to shiny fire type on Pokemon go
*_NEVER_* catch Vaporeon once you're at it.
9:20 go to Austin John playz trade code video I comple Pokédex except palafin
I love noirvern, it is my Home Screen pic
PM7, I know you won't probably read this, but since you were singing a Christian song, are you Christian, just like the music/song, or is it just stuck in your head.
bro jhon is a shiny charm this is insane!
Treasure Planet!
I’ve been playing this game since Christmas and I haven’t gotten one  A shiny
Scizor could beat Snom. Scizor is also not available in the wild.
I agree with Mike, Scyther should have won
OMG ITS THE MARIO 3D WORLD BOWSERS CIRCUS MUSIK!
WHY YOU SAY THAT NAME!!!!?
I guess Mikey isn't that in-tune with what the people like, Pokemon wise that is
Thank you Mikey for B”elieve in life after love” made my heart sing xx
Why are calling me John Michael I'm trying to sleep lol but gn John Michael
I caught mine through field research but I’ve encountered about 200 lol
Just realised that it would've tied of Mikey remembered Volcarona
WTH was that shiny gods rant flashback from?? That was oddly scary.
He remembers Markiplier being horny for Florges and yet didn't try to manipulate the vote with the Gardevoir horny. What?
Subscribing to one of these guys really does bring shiny luck because I just subscribed a day or two ago and today I got my first ever (random) shiny. First ever. I’ve been playing Pokémon for over twenty years.
8:59 Bro sounded like text to speech 💀
Okay, I call bull! Gyarados is my favorite Pokémon of all time it, and is awesome, it should have been closer to Garchomp than that! Come on!
18:31 this is my new ring tone people
ive watched like 10+ hours of these videos and I just realized grunty boy is actually Mikey
bro why didn't they chose cetoddle for c
Snom😂😂😂
I got so thrown off then unbelievably excited at the Treasure Planet clip
That Batman vs. Superman edit had me in tears
Never understand the power of the less menacing Pokémon in popularity contests.
watching this video while doing a donphan outbreak on the side right when you got to z a shiny popped up
You two are both nuts. You should also switch to decaf
i think at 3:39 there is a shiny fidough that is missed though i am not 100% sure. that fidough looks a bit different but it could just be lighting?
YOU GOT A SHINY, NOT BIG SURPRISE
My first shiny was a shiny murrcrow
the john michael cups need their own youtube channel
Mikey, John could have picked any pokemon for V and it would have beat Veluza. That thing is the bane of all water hunts (That and the framerate).
Mikey it was 36 seconds lol😂😂😂😂😂
Mikey IS NO Powerline!!!
why didn't he go for slither wing
I put a meme about this video on the subreddit by the way
the mystery destiny from bayonetta playing in the back at 1:57 is wonderful
I 100% agree with Mikey on the Scyther vs snom one
Pikachu vs phanpi is definitely a question of how do you fans feel about Pikachu
Mikey has single handedly enraged the entirety of the Pokemon fanbase with that snom insult
john is better
the amount of taylor swift references recently are making me so happy
Out of all the pirate clips you could have used, you have earned my forever love and subscribe for using treasure planet.
John reminds me of Gene from Bob’s Burgers
Did Mikey make a dbz abridged reference on purpose
Never underestimate the Clod. It is baby, and it is adorable.
I hate Veluzaa
Mikey: you can get mytey wildfire  Me:MOM!!! I NEED THIS!!!!!
I love the Lechonk Hmm zooming
POOPSIRE
I don't know what was the point of going on after John got 14 points but atleast that mikey got a shiny Great Tusk
F for Flamigo
Do I get an "I voted" sticker?
Why was he surprised that Snom won that vote. Snom was memed to death
i respect that they had two opportunities to catch cetoddle or cetitan and squandered both of them
I kinda thought the mikey rant was gonna be him do the morshu thing
I love Snom. I always used it in my Sword/Shield play throughs. Snom is one of the cutest big Pokémon in my opinion.
That iron bundle shouldn't have won, everyone else made sense
I hate raid.   I dont get the hype behind clodsire
I can understand going for Iron Bundle in the I round, what I can't believe is that no-one went for (in that order) Valiant, Thorns, or Moth.
JOHN DIDNT CATCH DROWZEE???!?
Can I battle against you now in scarlet also I am subscribed
When pm7 got the eevee I got a shiny iron treads
You know the interesting thing about Vaporeon
Not long ago i was shiny hunting for glimmora in area zero the first shiny i got was a garganacl and after that i got a shiny glimmora and in the same shiny hunting session i was doing i got 5 shiny glimmora . (I don't say that to flex , i just want say this.) I'm sorry if i have a bad english grammar , english is not my native language so it's normal if there is grammar mistakes. I love your videos there are entertaining.
Fitst shiny of mine in scarlet was falinks just got it 3 dats ago and i have been playing scarlet nearly everyday since its release idk why it took so long im not a shiny hunter but still
John: gets a shiny Michael: "ffs"  Michael: gets a shiny John: "ey congrats buddy :D"
Mikey: D.......... I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction. Editor: But I will! GOTTEM
Another video… PM7: Guess what I found? Mikey: a shiny?
Goofy movie is amazing.
Clodsire is best mudpuppy.
21:00 I was initially surprised you guys kept going after John got 14 points, but then I remembered you recorded the catching first and then the points.
You guys should start a band.
Cerulege
John you have failed me you get 3 shinies in a video and I can't get shinies from massive mass outbreaks what is wrong with this game💔
Hawlucha should have won
I was surprised that no one went for cetitan
5:54 skip the sponser
I'm surprised you two didn't pick gardevior and gengar in letter G
Iron Jugulis is kinda bleh tho.
Don't underestimate the power of Naclstack. All you have to do is catch a Sturdy Nacli right at the beginning of the game and evolve it, and then you can sweep all three strongest titan pokemon by heal stalling. Orthwurm, Iron Tusk, and Dondozo/Tatsugiri all faint in 4 turns if afflicted with Salt Cure.
Clodesire is bestest. We all like horseys.
Mikey do NOT accept sponsors from raid as they are a scam mobile game 😢
John: I love democracy
Haven't tried sandwiches yet, but having more shiny luck than Sword and Shield. Just found a shiny Cubchoo just chillin.
I got a challenge to suggest why not have a battle against each other but you have to make a team out of Tara raid Pokemon only
Typical men problem of finding Cloister
Hay mikey can your trade me shiny and I give you a shiny please because with your luck I see you must have alot of shinys
Now you know how we hate your opinions about Pokemon,, huh?? 🤣🤣
Learn this Snom is the superior!🫠🫠🫠
Who will win: Skydios vs Arceus (Flying type)?
mikey wondering why cufant lost to the best pokemon in existance
Treasure Planet clip at 2:42...respect! Absolute gem of a Disney movie and it's a shame it didn't do well in the box office. John absolutely slayed this. He unleashed his inner Cynthia, as shown with his Garchomp destroying Gyarados. He knew exactly what the people wanted when he caught that Clodsire for C...Clodsire is love, Clodsire is life, and Clodsire is a whole vibe. Rika having one on her team is based. And Dragonite is cool and all, but I love Dachsbun so much.  I have a senior dachshund with several health problems named Bella (despite her health problems, she's a trooper and still going strong) so I love that it's based off her breed.
Hey Michael! I know you probably forgot, but the ultimate survival world from trixyblox is done. I saw ur comment there
Id rather phaphy be the box art mon then picka😊
how did the might FEESH not win
can someone make a song that mikey sung that he made that would be great
snom is just objectively a better bug
Snom is quite literally my second favorite Pokémon, it’s the cutest Pokémon by far imo.
HOW DID JOHN GET LIKE 7 SHINYS I HAVENT GOT 1
I still haven’t gotten a scarlet and violet shiny
I love Mikey's made-up song, it sounds like it could be real "Anywhere, Anytime, you and me can have the time of our lives"
"Chills.  Literal Chills."  "It was number 5.  Number 5 killed my brother."
DAMN YOU JHON WITH SHINIES
At this point it's tradition that John finds one shiny at the start of the video
I saw a shiny yungoos today but I didn’t catch it because it would break my streak (I was doing one too)
YAY! MIMIKYU!
I got my third shiny two days ago and was a shiny I genuinely wanted and was excited I yelled and my parents looked at me scared as they did not know what happened
Mikey do a team sky video in scarlet and violet
8:03 Well I've name mine Gabe
ALAKAZAM Bellsprout  Charmander  Dragonpult  Eevee  Flareon  Golduck Haxerous  Igglybuff  Jolteon  Kadabra  Lugia  Mime jr  Nidorina  Orbeetle AGAIN Psyduck Quillfish  Rayquaza  Blah blah blah
Oh damn, John Michael won! I thought John Michael would win! edit: the joke is they’re both named John Michael.
Abra BONSIL Cranidos  Dratini Espeon Fartfetch  Growlith Herracross  Iron Jugulis  Jigglypuff  Klawf  Luxray  Mewtwo  Nidoking  Orbeetle  Persian  Quagsire  Riolu  SQUIRTLE Taros  Umberon  Voltorb  Wurmple  Xeneus  Yyveltal  Zerua
my middle name is Michael as well!!! lol
How in the world did Scyther lose to Snom?
Wait, yeah, how *did* they get from college to X-Games?
No more Hail Yeah, Mikey. It's Snow Yeah now.
Noivern is my favorite Pokémon so if it lost I would have screamed
Before even beginning the video: Let's go Mikey! Let's go Mikey! Let's go Mikey! Boom-de-ay!  Also my votes are: Arcanine, Shiny Bisharp, Clodsire, Dragonite, Eevee, Finizen, Gyarados, Heracross(though prefer Houndoom if possible), Iron Bundle, Jolteon, Kilowattrel, Lucario (though if Lickitung was an option would've chosen that), Magikarp (because love it's evolution), Numel(though if Ninjask was possible would've chosen that), (Orthworm is ok but prefer Octillery), PIKACHU!, Frostlass, Roaring Moon is perfectly fine though really like Raichu if possible, Scyther, Toxicroak(though if Tentacruel was possible would prefer that), Umbreon is perfect no other preference, Volcarona(though prefer Venomoth if possible), Wooper(though prefer Wobbufett if possible), Cyclizar(though yes Cloyster is better), Naclstack(though still like Ninjask more!), Zangoose.  Yay, we love Grunty Boi!!!
I would like to know when you post these polls though and how i can get to them  xD
I have nothing against Pokemon based on elephants, but I AM against the Cufant-line! It’s quite ugly. Gen 8 barely has any decent Pokemon designs.
mikey is haveing hard break down the scyther vs snom really made him threw a bad fit
Snom will always win…
Why can’t I get this Shiny luck?
Dont forget R
Snom is perfect. The only time "snom" and "stupid" should be in the same sentence is when you say "Snom is not stupid!"
Oh
I love that they still say "I got a crit catch" When every catch that you get on a Pokémon you already own will be displayed as a crit catch
i am frankly disappointed that john or mickey didn't caught drowzee for their d pokemon
im surprised neither of you went with tinkaton for the t round
It feels like when Mikey wins it's usually because of skill and game knowledge and when John wins it's usually because of luck, but John apparently is more familiar with what pokemon are popular.
He got shiny in first 30 seconds
Snom over Scyther is insane people.
The beard looks so good
bro i love the grunty boy parts but if its raid shadow legends i gotta skip the ad cause raid shadow legends is every sponser ever.💀
I’ve caught two shiny pokémon since watching this series
Hey it’s alright Mikey he’s shiny luck doesn’t match your abilities to make us smile
Tell me whyyyy
MedMen Stock Moving Up Today!! Best Brand in the Industry! Set your Family up! Buy MMNFF stock today.....
You guys should do find your pokemon based on pokedex number!
Dedibird was busted lol
Wtf does h in my shoulder mean
The God to a non believer quote just reminds me of Team Four Star Dragon Ball Z Brol Abridged. Vegeta screams it to broly
Nice video
For S, how likely do you think it would be for Slither Wing to win?
20:20 Timestamping this so I can watch this as many times I want
Just realised wugtrio is shaped like an W (kinda) And love 🐘COPPERAJAH🐘...... and cufant
Bro in the beginning John was DOMINATED in the first like 6 letters LOL😂😂
If one thing is for certain, John will once again find a shiny, likely many, next week
Stupid snom???? Unsub :)
Your voters were so very wrong and Jigglypuff is just the best!
i love the elephant pokemon, they are cuties
you missed the swdish letter å ä ö but there is no pokemon that begins with those
Video idea: (pls consider)  Idea 1: Catch Pokémon according to their colours and post them online. Then, like this video, add your scores up and then the winner will get another point in the John Michael Cup.  Idea 2: Catch the heavier Pokémon to win by alphabet. Same rules as idea 1.   If this comment gets at least 10 likes, can you make a video one on if these ideas? Thx 😊
“What was going on with the elephants?” Uh, John, you won a round with Phampy. Literally a baby elephant
Does no one realise in a mikey found a shiny breloom but dident encounter it?
00:28 shiny hawlucha back of Mikeys screen
This is if sweet and sour were people
Tyler: AKA the John Micheal Cup Editor,  PLEASE edit a video of the funniest moments of the first season!! Bribe Micky with birds and John with frogs if you must
mickey sonded like a robot 9:08
Will there a Mytey for every type?
I love how John just needs to do a challenge with MandJTV to shiny hunt
Don't be mad at your audience for having good taste, Mikey.
On the C round, as soon as C was said once, I said cocklesmurf and I think it was the dumbest thing I've ever said.
Michael are you sure you’re so the peon seven you’ve only found one shiny so far in the John Michael cup season two and there’s quite a few episodes
Scyther should have beaten snom, snom is a dead meme
John's shiny luck so insane, I wouldn't be surprised if his trophy ends up being shiny too (regardless which one it is) xD
Does anyone know where the song that starts around 17:50 is from?
PM7 has to be using shiny sandwiches. 🤦‍♂️😞😭
I just got my first shiny and it was a skiddo.
Has anyone else had to clutch a battle with kilowattrel?
Clodsire winning the C round was a given, no one can beat the happy boi
Every time there is a new John Michael cup I always 100% sure John is gonna get a shiny.
Still funny how when John finds a shiny Mikey is completely disgusted yet when Mikey finds shiny Pokemon John is just genuinely happy for him.
HOW YALL COMPLETE THE POKÉDEX SO FAST IM ONLY AT 295 LOOKING FOR PETILIL😫
Damn wish i could find shinies like that ahhaa im still tryna get the violet exclusives and trade pokemon to finish the pokedex
no
Where do people vote for these I never get notified where should I look, when the next happens
It took me like a full 15 seconds to understand the H in my shoulder joke 🤣
Within 2 days!
The people who voted in these polls have trash taste.
Was there an accidentally cut because you didn’t say who won? D
Wait, Grunty Boy is leaving his team skull 'friend'?
would love to see you play pokemon infinite fusions or grunty boy play the fire red rocket edition so that you can steal pokemon
As if any C pokemon would have a chance at besting my boi Clodsire.  Also I freaking love the running gag with Drowsee. It is hilarious.
It is required in The John Michael Cup Season 2 that at least 1 shiny Pokémon must be caught! -John Michael
3:36 You missed shiny fighdough
Me no tak L’s
12:32 M for the Monh Jicheal Cup
Stop being salty Mikey. John’s Pokémon are just better
I found a zangoose and 5 secs later there is a siviper!  Is this lucky?
Lmao the shiny luck. I guess we wont see in the competition on who catches more shiny
Not the fanfics
15:54 jaiden is quaking
Surprised none of you two went for the surefire win on Z with Zorua or Zoroark.
Sounded more like grunty boy in that last little rant
Electric Boogaloo
I'm surprised Snom vs Scyther was as close as it was.
Congrats on trending! Again!
Mike turned into kratos
What mandjtv want to say.  Deeeeez nuts
I don't understand the K joke, whats wrong with it?
Im sorry for voting against you Mikey.
im so happy this challenge is back i loved it last season!!
John, Why didn’t you catch Drowzee for letter D? I’m not mad, just disappointed.
Cetodle vs clodsire would’ve been a match for the ages
Both you and john chose the wrong I Pokemon you should have picked iron valiant also snom winning over scyther ticks me of alot!
Who I chose for each: Arcanine Shiny Bisharp Clodsire(Obviously) Daschbun Eevee Finizen  Gyarados Heracross Iron Bundle Jolteon Klawf Lechonk  Magikarp Numel  Orthworm(I mean WHAT ELSE!?!?!) Pikachu QFroslass Roaring Moon(Again…WHAT ELSE?!?!?!) Snow Tailow because it my favorite and I don’t care if they didn’t catch it, but I would I guess choose Toxicroak  Umbreon(WHAT ELSE!?!?!?!?!) Veluza W…I couldn’t choose Xatu duh…But for real, Copperajah Yungoos, duh fr Nacli cuz it looks like a Mario power up Zweilous
People need to like a wugtrio more it has been on my team sense the begging of the game
Bruh they should have done drowzee for D
Did anyone else alomost pee their pants when they saw that flashback or was it just me?
When are we getting a Miteys game
I'm sad that for d he didn't catch Drowzee
how many shinies has john got?!
At 18:19 timestamp Micheal was talking about tatsugiri and I went to a terastilize water den and I see tatsugiri pokemon coincidences am i right
Imagine if Scarlet DLC gives us past paradox Eevee that can evolve into a new dragon or rock type Eeveelution.
In my homeland off Norway this video World be 3 turns longer with æ ø and å
Competitive Mikey gives me life
Mikey, how did you not see Clodsire's landslide victory coming? Everybody loves Clodsire. Agreed on Veluza, though, how did that get so few votes? It's so cool!
YouTubers need to stop doing merchandise
Why are you playing a children's game.
Mikey there rookie evolution that start with Q
Every time there is a new John Michael cup I always 100% sure John is gonna get a shiny.
Pokemon Violet but team sky when????
The call back to Mikey's AAAAAAA xD
Hey, how's Jack?
i too have a shiny murkrow
23:04  "Its Number 5,number 5 killed my brother" "Oh my god i forgot about that part"
When John got a shiny murkrow I just saw a shiny sudowoodo staring at me lol
Tera type azumarill, dude. PM7
nice
Syyeri randomly found a shiny Kilowattrelwhen john found his shiny bisharp. THANKS JOhn :D
Keep up the good work and highly amusing videos, I am entertained each time, also the salty rant had me nearly in tears cause I seriously thought scyther would win the S round but didn't, can't wait to see more (and maybe another salty rant) videos from this channel.
Pm7 I got my very first shiny in pokemon After SUBSCRIBED TO YOU
5 shinys in this video lol
22:00 I got a shiny while I was in battle with another shiny
3o something into the video and shiny and I found a shiny magicarp
Cause picking John gives me more shines 😂
22:08   "WHAT IS A GOD, TO A NON BELIEVER?!"  Shiny gods: Do you believe nos?
the edit of Mikey going AAAAAAAAA really gets to me 😭😭😭 it’s so funny
Where can I found the votings? Instagram?  I always miss those 😒
12:41  FINALLY! THE MYSTERY IS UNVEILED! Though why have we never seen him feature in a video tho if he is a part of the channel name??
I am actually disturbed and impressed by the community's taste in Pokemon. This is WILD.
Yes pikachu won pikachu is my favorite Pokémon
did you all just realize we got no fossil pokemon
Video idea: 'Bloopers and best funny bits from John Michael cup for season 1 and 2' Not sure if this has been done already, but I'd love to see it, maybe have first half of the alphabet on one channel and the second half on the other channel??
nothing bettr than seeing manjtv geting mad that we still voting for john despite not knowing whos pokemon is whose
The R has been avenged
I swear PM7 has some sort of prototype rigged shiny game or smth
I just vote for cooler pokemon
The fact that clodsire only got 90% is disgusting
Mikey getting salty killed me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am genuinely offended you guys didn't go for Gogoat at G.
Does anyone know where the music at 17:52 - 18:29 comes from? My partner and I are wracking our brains, trying to remember. We think it's from Sword and Shield, maybe? Please help, we're going insane!
8:36 Are You Okay?? Having An *H* In Your Shoulder May Cause Death! You Need To Stop For A Year And Ask Dr. Dumas For Help!
Did Mikey kill that girl’s brother 22:59
I like how you are using chemical plant music for your videos
I love watching JM Cup, so ridiculous sometimes but always makes me smile
how did mikey catch up so quick
Imagine like in 5 years we get the video “meet my new son Darvin!”
...why was Snom chosen? It's neither cute nor lovable. It's just...boring (I think)  Also, Zangoose is infinitely more cool than Zweilous. it's not even close (again, in my opinion)
50 pounds John won't get a shiny before the 2 minute mark next john Micheal Cup video
This is the season of Jon and his shiny luck
When you look at your profile and it says 1 shinys battled  🟩▫️🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩▫️🟩 🟩🟩⬜️🟫⬜️🟩⬜️🟫⬜️🟩🟩 ▫️🟩🟩🟩🟫🟩🟫🟩🟩🟩 ▫️🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 ▫️🟩🟩🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟩🟩 ▫️🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
Next time instead of voting, just catch groups of 4 ABCD, EFGH, IJKL then do a double battle with your letter's Pokemon.  Then even when you both get the same Pokemon there will still be a winner. After 6 battle rounds if it's a tie just roll 4 random letters for a tie breaker.
PM7 has the shiny gods blessed on him instead of Mikey which will make John win a shiny challenge in The John Micheal Cup
I LOVE EELECTROS
John I'm starting to dislike ya, just a tinzi tiny bit.
Raid has secretly assassinated all other sponsors so they are the only ones who can sponsor Mikey, I swear
What is it with John and shinies?!
For g next time do greninja
I miss Grunt Man
I want them when they have the same Pokémon  they put it open the pole anyways and just answer
8th on trending
Rip grunt man
Mikey : there’s only one Pokémon with q    Me : yes qurtel  Mikey : quilfish   Me : … oh … torkoal … I forgot qurtel is the German name
a lot of these wins were people being biased with pokemon they liked
Let’s be real, Pikachu and Phanpy was only close because people voted against Pikachu, rather than for Phanpy
... HOW DID ZWEILOUS BEAT ZANGOOSE???
Fun (and problably useless) fact: My first shiny (and last) Ive found in lets go Pikachu its Rattata when I was looking for Ekans like an idiot because i didnt know Ekans is special in Eevee.
I seem to have experienced deja vu with Mikey's dialogue after catching their G Pokemon
5 shinies for john i only got once in entire liife
As someone who would forfeit all mortal possessions for Clodsire, I am proud of everyone who voted for the boi
i’m not a L human😊
The  waffle house has its new host
5:50
John should of gotten drowzee 😂
Iron Bundle is best bird and paradox. Also, Delibird is great too lol
Very glad toxicroak won the round. Since it's a top 3 Pokémon to me
Iono moosic 😎
Grungy boi never gets old😂
Mikey  everyone simps for gardevoir should of picked that
Pm7 threw some rounds to keep it interesting for sure, especially in the middle of the alphabet
I love the use of the sonic generations OST
I am happy John Michael won I would have still being  ok if John Michael
PM7 should've gotten drowzee for d. It probably not win but it would be funny
Does anyone know the name of the song that starts playing at around 12:53?
Samthepokeman wants to colab with u
Mikey:What is a god to a non believer??  Vegeta: He just copied me or he just said by         own?? Immeasurable
I vote for next time that when they have only one pokemon to catch that they race to catch it. Whoever catches it first gets the point
How dare you steal John's shiny golduck and great tusk, he needed them to be with his shiny psyduck and donphan to make shiny families.
I was able to vote on the poll and now the video’s here! I hope I can vote on more polls in the future
idk how scyther loses against snom.
Me watching this while finishing my Mikey and John fanfic...
I find it annoying that PM7 didn’t pick drowzee for the D round
When Mikey finds a shiny John celebrates with him. When John finds a shiny Mikey gets salty because it happens every 10 minutes
Quaxly brb
I was hoping that duplicates would still be voted on and leading to just a random point~
I understand Mikey’s hatred for John getting shinies, I don’t even have a shiny in my Violet account and I’m like 2/3 of the game already, I’m sick of seeing random people getting shinies before the game ends
Can we all just appreciate Mikey’s singing, like it is on point
Team sky plssssssssssssssssss
They should flip the script and hunt for the least popular Pokemon and the one with lowest votes is the winner.
Are you not aware of the popularity of Clodsire?  Wow, I can't believe the dolphin lost so bad.   So many shinies! I think John got 6!?  And Mikey 2, which is still a lot!
just wish i had pm7s shiny luck, ive been playing pokemon all my life and still have yet to find a shiny other than the red gyarados in gen 2
I officially hate shiny Psyduck first my first shiny and I failed it and now it appears and taunts me
Asked if he ever feels bad for checking for a shiny but end up murdering a family immediately laughs his ass off saying yes he does I’m not so sure about that
Why did neither of you go for Great Tusk for G?
The psyduck gave me nostalgia it was the first shiny I ever got
John knew Michael was losing so he catch delibird to give Michael some point but. He won again 😂😂
9:50 Here's the thing Mikey, THIS "Delibird" is SO much better plus its more interesting looking than Iron Jugulis 17:35 This one is easy cause Snom is adorable
Quagsire where?
Psyduck was my first shiny in Pokémon violet and it’s now a shiny goldduck
Mikey killed the shiny gods and took their power. The shiny god's power is to provide other trainers with shinies. Hence why John keeps getting shinies whenever they make a video together since mikey has the power to "provide other trainers with shinies"
Mikey need help coming up letter starters so heres new ones: "Now what letter should we start on?" "Shouldn't we start with-" "AAAAAH" "Do you Bees" "What?" "And Go!" "Now we will C what Pokemon we will catch next" "You are used to catching D's aren't you, John?" "What's the third Letter of The Alphabet" "C?" "No, E is the third letter of The Alphabet, T, H, E!, A, L, P, H, A, B, E, T," "Time to be the most f-icient catcher" "What did the Alphabet seller say when all of the stock of the seventh letter was stolen? Aw, Geez!" "Hold on I need to sneeze, a-a-a- Aych (H), ooo" "I know what I will catch, I just need my Eyes to f-I-nd the I pok-I-mon"
Mikey just became Kratos there for a minute
Pokemon 7 will win
The fact that even when Mikey manages to find shiny Pokemon, John still manages to find more. Maybe Mikey shouldn't have ticked off the Shiny Gods.
Mikey brought in Marky
Mikey's frustrated breakdown next to John doing a Miss America Thank you is killing me holy smokes
at this point john just gets so many shinies in vids to the point that people might start gambling to guess how many he might find in a single vid
No take the gambaling song back so many years of pain with flmy father singing that. Oo
Its funny because John won as soon as he got 13 points even if Mikey got the last four he would only have 12 points which isn't enough to win
Mikey found a shiny Golduck in this video, and I found shiny Golduck last week!!!!    It was destiny for us!!!!!
I wove snom
At letter j was it a hermit craft reference
If Mikey can find what specifically I voted for that would be neat… because I’ve genuinely forgotten and I feel bad!!!
Mikey are you okay in this video? You don’t sound like yourself
In what world did Mikey think Cufant was going to beat Cloudsire I love the little elephant but come on.
I expected John to pick Drowzee for D round FOR SURE, genuinely surprised he didn’t. I’m sure it would have got more votes because well, *you know.*
Mikey! I found a version of Arkoos you’ll hate. It’s Arceus fused with Miltank
Me at the start: “John’s gonna get a shiny in three… two… *on— ok, there it is.”*
It's been so long that i even forgotten what i voted for 💀
NomNom the Snom ❤❤❤
Petition to go back to the different types of challenges, such as higher base stat, higher level, which type would win in a fight, etc
Mickey gotta learn that cute beats cool 9/10 times
Hey! The super secret poll!! And, by the way John, why do you not pick the cute Pokémon huh?! Cute ALWAYS beats cool (Cufant is not cute)
I’m surprised pm7 is still excited for shinnies
Now pm7 has a shiny psyduck and Micheal with a shiny golduck like my brother.
Where was the poll?
PM7?
Can we get like a sitcom with Mikey and Grunty Boi and maybe other characters? I think that’d be cool.
Tomorrow is my birthday!
I wish there was a cup where John, Michael, and Jack were participating. Kinda like the video where they had to get the pokemon with the lowest BST
I actually would really like to see random tidbits like the rant Mikey did all in one video that don't really have a place in the current video.
I also live in texas, but do not own a pair of cowboy boots
Snom fricking  sucks
Ima be honest, i expect them to catch tingkaton for the T pokemon
It was number 5 number 5 cheated with drowzy
Phanpy is so much better than PIkachu
Now I know why I've never gotten a shiny, John has all the luck from everyone else haha
17:08 nice
disappointing that they didnt mention the accidental raichu a love song pun :(
i want a grilled cheese
Can't lose what you don't use, lol...specifically voting privileges.
anna ANNA Anna brother BROTHER Brother idhayathulla hidhayathulla IDHAYATHULLA HIDHAYATHULLA
Anyone else besides me got a good laugh after seeing the results during the S Round?
Yo you the best
The Brooklyn 99 reference is perfect 😭🙏
There is no reason for the alphabet to be in the order that it is in.
I got a fidough named it pm7 garantee
Mikey should play Pokémon this gym of mine but it’s a rom so it’s very unlikely if you don’t know what it is you can search it up
Cufant isn't bad, however, Clodsire is our lord and savior
You should do this but you just get 30 minutes to catch the whole alphabet instead, so you can change your mind and stuff. (But John would probably win because, shinies)
“I thought florges would do better.. markiplier liked it” I’m admittedly surprised as well that it didn’t win against froslass just bc of markiplier LOL
Wait so if he is moving to the forest, what will happen to his team skull roomate that he had a crush on ? Did he get rejected 😢
At least you guys remembered R this time :D
As a gyra fan,I think 25-75 was a terrible ratio for us and I’m sad,bare min 40-60
F = Flareon and you would've won XD
John just passively cheering for Michael when he finds the shiny Great Tusk, "Oh. That's nice"
Bro is on trending at 7 rn on mandjtv plays
10:39 And I took that personally.
Crazy how much shinies John has gotten in the videos of the JMC. Suprised John didn’t catch a drowzee for the letter D lol
My first thought for F both times was Farigiraf lmao
How many shines has John gotten this dang season alone? Heck how many in this ep?!
Sorry mikey you just don’t catch the most popular Pokémon
you should’ve said “never gonna give U up” for U
I feel like Iron Bundle won because it got banned for being too good in Pokemon Showdown
ngl iron jugilus was stupid
why have you not acknowledged that john lied about luvdisc not being in a gym leader/elite 4 members team?
Was anyone else also annoyed when John found the shinies? Cause i was
Don’t forget a letter again
Un Fair I hate pm7
Hi
Here is a fun idea. “Catch the Pokémon, but you can’t damage it.” Or “defeat the Champion only using metronome.”
Did PM7 modify his game to give himself multiple shiny charms that stack with each other?
The shiny gods bestow players with shinies. He killed them, and took their power, and bestows John with shinies. It all tracks.
My favorite thing to do is shiny hunt while watching your videos. And John’s. I just got a shiny dunsparce!
What I've learned from this is that John either A) has taste more in line with the fandom in general or B) is more aware of and willing to pander to the fandom's taste. RIP Mikey.
If it makes you feel any better, I much prefer Cufant and Breloom. Shiny Breloom is better than shiny Bisharp.
I think people vote based on design n cuteness, not better competitive or in battle haha
I pray that one day grunty boy meets pm7 idk why but i do
"The Unsanitary Hideout" bro got me
If mikey is a garganical , what is john?
Contest: catch the Better Pokemon Mikey: maybe this pokemon that isn't a super widely memed/loved pokemon will be a good one to go with
Why did John think Azumaril would get more love than Altaria??
How on the world would people vote kilowattrel over klawf? I honestly don't believe that vote
i feel like theres no way that 'deez nutz' wasn't from katie
Isn’t Azumarill more of a Raiblu instead of Pikablu?
What has always made me laugh is whenever John finds a shiny, Mikey is filled with unbridled rage, but whenever mikey finds a shiny, John congratulates him with the biggest smile on his face
Im dissapointed in PM7 for not catching drowzee
I'm starting to think John is making sparkling sandwiches offscreen because  he's getting an ungodly amount of shinies
love the vids and whats so funny is that john always happens to be getting shinies within a min but as i said love the vids keep it up
eevee only beat eelektros because its a mascot its a pretty boring pokemon eelektross is sick
New fire mikey:POG
17:35 unsubbing
Next time for letters like Q and X, maybe instead do any pokemon with that letter anywhere in their name
20:45 Mikey forgot about the only Pokémon who has a different Paradox for each game lol
Day 50 Of Asking For A  Team Rocket version of Mytey for Grunty Boi
Since ur just amazing I made a team in scarlet in violet of team sky I beat the game with it it was sooo fun I picked the water starter and named it “Bird?”
21:57 The first shiny I saw was a shiny in battle and it despawned right away.
I believe I can answer the Tatsugiri hate: Competitive battling. Dondozo/Tatsugiri
Hawlucha is my favorite pokemon 😁
The end of this made me laugh so hard I almost passed out cause that was so funny. 😂
I'm Really Rejoicing they Remembered the Round with R... but Really? Both Really caught the same mon, I didn’t Realize it would be so easy to do so...
The value of a shiny has become little more then. “Oh hey. Funny color.”
The idea they employed for Q, X and Y is dumb. I mean, I get it but... Why revisit another letter rather than double up and move on...
More pixelmon stuff
In the next version of this they do the letters J M&C should all be worth double points
The moment Jack got the V round; Mikey knew he lost. He just wanted to finish the Video so we see how badly he lost
The fact that mikey thought that clodsire *wouldn’t* beat cufant surprises me
Grunty boy sounds gay
I wonder what shiny John gonna find in the next video
Why did you not catch drowze
Somebody write a fanfic about mikey and drowzee and post it to his subreddit
MIKEY GOT POOPER 😄😄😄
Scyther is my all time favorite Pokemon you should have won that one im sorry everyone else is wrong.
Once upon a time, there lived a young boy named Michael. He lived with his grandmother in a quaint little town. Michael, who goes by Mikey, aspired to be the greatest pokemon trainer and wanted to catch them all, as he looked up to his hero Ash Ketchum, who almost caught them all.   Mikey went on to grow into a fantastic pokemon trainer and even became the new champion. However Mikey wanted to find more meaning in life. Fast forward 2 years, Mikey gets invited to an awards ceremony for his championships and one of the performances was by a Drowzee. Drowzee hypnotized Mikey and it was love at first sight!   Mikey dreamed day and night of the Drowzee and knew he couldn't spend his life without Drowzee by his side. Mikey was able to get in touch with Drowzee and they went out for a while. Mikey then proposed to Drowzee and now they are happily married!  The End!
Don't forget R this time
How was there iron bundle and great tusk next to each other in the same game? Are these tampered with games? Does that mean shiny odds are boosted too? Is everything a lie? 😱😱
Seeing pm7 in 2 video in the same day 😆😂🤣👌
That it jon not allowed any shinies until Mikey gets a shiny at the beginning of a video twice. This is getting out of hand.
Loved how you used a lot of Sonic tracks for the background
Pls I like to vote for the guy with more then 3 shines
14:47 the next time you do this, prepare in before hand(ex pm7 is left and mandjtv is right) and do the poll anyways to see who gets the point.
it should have been drowsey for d
John getting a shiny reminds me that I got a shiny kilowattrel and shelter within 5 minutes of each other
Not even 30 seconds into the video and John finds a shiny.
Who else wants to see Mikey's salty youtuber rant?
I just seem like a meme 7:43
wait wasn’t this video already uploaded?
There is a person in my game named Ultragruntyboi
Wow seeing those votes has told me that people are 100% brain dead! Some of those votes are insanely stupid.
I need John's shiny luck.
no L's here mikey
As a person from Texas I can say not every one has cowboy boots
I feel like John gets to always win in these types of challenges, lucking out on getting Pokémon that the public would vote more, and to the surprise of absolutely nobody, he gets another freaking shiny!  But its insane that Snom had more votes over Scyther
I love Zoroark
The thing about John's shiny luck is the fact it isn't scripted. He doesn't just go to the spot before recording and says "here's a shiny", It just happens. Every. Single. Time. Without fail.
Michael: you know who take L’s Me: You
Okay I have a genuine question. Is John using the shiny charm? That luck is absolutely nuts if not.
Why don't you mix it up. Like top and bottom would be different in voting.
FINALLY ANOTHER JMC EPISODE
It's funny that John didn't try to put up his shiny murkrow that he caught at the beginning of the video
My favorite part in this video is Mikey slowly, but risingly losing his mind from his subscribers constantly voting against him
There is nothing wrong with Cufant, Closire is just a very cool fellow
The main issue I saw was that Mikey kept catching the new boys. While understandable the old 'mon will naturally have more have fans
Congratulations on Trending!🎉 Can’t wait for more awesome episodes of the John Micheal Cup!
Omg is two shinies in like two minutes into the video a new record for John? And yes there probably is fanfiction lol there is fanfiction of everything. I love these challenge videos excited to see who will win the season two cup!
i just caught a shiny feesh
I have an idea every pokemon of the alphabet but its decided by its japanese name
I remember seeing Magikarp on the poll and immediately knowing that it was John's.
John's shiny luck is insane. I agreed with Mikey that Syther I thought was going to win easy
I caught my first shiny yesterday in pokemon moon and it was a shiny torkoal
snom cute tho
26 letters, the second John got to 14 he won
hey john just to let you know i will kill you if you find a shiny in the next vid  edit: if mikey doesnt
Mikey should stop with Challenges using popular votes… second one he lost in this season 😅
18:29 I would have gone with "never gonna give U up" and Rick roll everybody watching lol
For the letter K I was surprised neither of you used your korydon
I am pleasantly surprised and glad that Mikey at least got two Shinies this video! As opposed to zero and John getting a shiny right off the bat like usual
I love how everyone knew the shiny Bisharp was PM7
Tbh PM7 seems like the kind of person to be a short gremlin ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
Imagine doing this but with a different language. Like set your games to a different language and use their alphabet and blindly find the Pokémon
They forgot r again
As someone who voted for Snom, he’s just a little guy don’t be mean
How many likes to get the full YouTuber rant
Fun fact: clodsire was voted the second most popular pokemon in scarlet and violet!
I really wanna know what went through Mikey’s head when he picked the worst of the Paradox Pokemon, expecting it to win.
I just thought Grunty Boi said guys instead of guides 💀
Uwu
Uwu
Uwu
Uwu
Uwu
Uwu
Uwu
Uwu
Uwu
U2u
Yeah it dosen,t suprise me ethere
I'll be honest, this whole shiny thing is starting to get a bit dry :/
I'm fairly certain that John doesn't play these challenges to win, but uses them as opportunities to shiny hunt.
Ok at 22:17 I look away for a second and look down and I don't know what's going on help
I love Democracy
Aww man! I missed the poll! I didn't know there was one aww well still a fun video next time baby next time
At least you know none of your fans have recency bias bc almost every Gen 9 Pokémon has lost🥲
This one was really cool :)
So……should the comment section start betting on which shiny Pokémon John catches at the start of each video now or?
of course pm found a shiny straight away and its one i realy want to get lmaos
I knew the questionnaire was for the alphabet challenge. I feel to smert rn
They remembered r this time
noivern slaps
The thing is that I think PM7 stole your shiny luck
The fact that Mikey lost S is insane. The voters are bugging lmao
How did John not go drowzee for D
I did not vote in this, as I did not know it was going on, but if I had to guess why you kept losing ones you thought you could win, Mikey, is that they were all Ice types. Iron Bundle, Froslass, and Snom are all Ice types, and Ice types are the best, so they win. My advice? Catch more Ice types.
anyone else watching the ad just to hear brunty bois voice?
9:56 Donald Trump after he somehow gets back into office in 2024
I’m extremely disappointed that PM7 didn’t catch drowsee for D
I remember participating in this I kinda of like it because it makes the video more unique
John dominates when it comes to audience vote. Mikey knows pokemon but John goes for rule of cool, as does the audience.
Why didn't john get drowzee
22:20 what on earth are these cyclizar on?
W editor for putting the meme on the d
Merkiplier smash
Q should have been a race to who could catch it faster
Anyone else expected John to go for a Drowzee for D
Okay, John has hacked the game. He has too many freakin SHINIES!
Okay Katie, admit it, you’re a Swiftie!
Don't read this comment if you didn't watch half the video  How ironic I just watch the batman vs superman movie on tv
URINAL TROPHY. URINAL TROPHY. URI
13:42 distant cry on the beat?
A pirate's three favorite letters: The C RRRRRRRRRR- P, because without it they'd be Irate
I mean if it exsits...
This means John (pm7)is more beloved by the community
Normal people when reading the thumbnail: AZ ohh the first and last letters of the alphabet   Me: AZ !!!!!!!!!! The flower obsessed KING!!!!!!
When grunty boi said “I’m going to move to the forest” I thought it was that one soap sponsor lol
Lol wow....except for like 2 rounds every single pokemon I voted for lost haha.
Congrats you remembered R this time
Bruh I got two shiny lechonk in the same 20 minutes when I was trying two catch shiny scatterbug
To be far to Mikey, that N song sounded like an 80’s song; I was convinced 😂😅
Dear RNGesus,        Please give Mikey more shinies in the next John Michael Cup for I fear for his sanity if John's luck continues.    Sincerely,                      A Concerned Fan
Im going to get a mighty plushies for my birthday 🎉
John has enough shiny luck to share with all his subscribers and still find at least one shiny every episode
9:13 wat
23:54 what if the dlc for scarlet and violet is Pokémon Z? And it adds zygarde into the game?
The other day I went to pick up an item but got suckered because it was a  Greavard.  Plus side is that it was shiny.
I caught 20 shinys
Nacli won because Nacli looks like a mario mushroom
I love that Mikey didn't even give John the chance to ruin his pirate joke this time 🤣
What happen to the only Y Pokémon
Snom is my favourite pokemon (:
I’m stunned that John didn’t go for Drowzee. TBH we would’ve voted for Drowzee for the memes.
I'm surprised John didn't get Drowzee for D
I like how the Bisharp vs Breloom one wasn’t a sweep. You can tell people were really pitying Mikey on that. But just imagine if Mikey did end up catching it.
Okay... PM7 John's shiny luck is unnatural. We need to have him investigated 0.o
22:09 (LOL) It still cracks me up watching Micheal go insane in that video.
Clodsire is friend shaped
im glad they both had shiny luck more then once, congratz guys
Really surprised that John didn’t catch Drowzee for D. He definitely would’ve won that round if so lmao
I missed the voting 🥲
Can you to trade the alphabet and first to get all wins?
Dude Johns luck is stupid lmao
Why yall so damn fruity?
For h you both got an ash Pokémon
I've been hunting for a shiny Psyduck for YEARS and have never caught one. John seems to get one in every John Michael Cup video 😭
Ngl, kinda disappointed that John didn´t catch Drowzee
NOT ANYWHERE NYWHERE. I DID NOT EXPECT PIKACHU AND PHANPY TO BE SUCH A CLOSE VOTE PIKACHU IS THE POKEMON MASCOT.
Was so hoping one of them would catch Cetoddle for the C round, cause Cetoddle is one of my favorite new pokémon, and I wanted to see how the precious round boi would do.
How the heck did Scyther lose?!
Why did you keep the video going when John won before the W round
It's fun watching Mikey slowly lose sanity as John finds shiny pokemon 😂
I actually got to vote for this one so I was excited to see it~ Definitely knew PM7 got the shiny Bisharp xD
Down with Mikey! Down with Mikey!
John’s shiny luck😂
We need to start doing polls in the beginning of videos to guess either how long until John gets a shiny/how many he gets
Can someone please make a compilation of every Shiny that appears in this season
“glorious beast” my wooper is caught in a beast ball. youre so right.
I'm genuinely shocked that snom beat scyther
snom??????????!!!!!!!!!!Snom  won against scyther???????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards." That actually just killed me.
Did he switch the order of who caught what, or was Mikey's pokemon always at the top because if he didn't switch, people could have just voted for John
I'm surprised John didn't catch a Drowsee for D.
If wugtrio won, I would have unsubscribed
John's always so happy for Mikey when he finds a shiny. Wholesome.
at this point it almost feels like they should just ban eevee and eeveelutions in popularity poll competitions- would really help shake up the entries for those spots!
“Lechonk is lovable, but if it lost to Lucario I’d be livid”  Ha, almost alliteration.
Gosh, I love Grunty Boy. TA TA~
If it's a comfort, there aren't any fanfics on AO3 of either of you yet. Don't know about other sites though.
Me waiting for the c round for one of them to catch ceruledge: 🤨🤔
*When you're Team Mikey but picked Iron Bundle* LOOK. Okay, I'm sorry but he's a sweet metal boy with a sack of goodies! He could have candy in there!
Of all the future paradox Pokemon to go for, they chose Jugulus and Bundle? Not Moth, Thorns, or Valiant?
Micheal needs to understand that when putting the vote in the hands of the people, act as though your trying to appeal to a pack of 5 year olds
john got like 5 shiny pokemon
WHY THE MARKIPLIER CLIP
My plush was being delivered today, unfortunately the post room is only open on weekdays so I have to wait another 2 days
I'm honestly surprised one of you didn't do Zorua for Z.
What is that kass’s theme remix because it is awesome
This was great! I am having a rough day haha all my Arceus, Sword save data and shinies got deleted. 😢
How did elephants go 0/3? didn't they only appear twice?
iron bundle is cooler and iron jugulars dumb
My mom got mad at my uncle for just messaging k  for a while, so she put her foot down...the he just stars sending potassium instead...K
Oh my God 😮
Vaporeon hmmm....DID YOU KNOW?
Who I voted for. A-Arcanine B-Breloom C-Clodsire  D-Dragonite E-Eelektross (Frye!) F-Finizen (I dislike Falinks) G-Garchomp (Shiver!) H-I don't remember, both are so cool. I-Iron Bundle (Bundle is better than Delibird, Jugulis is worse than Hydreigon, who I already didn't like) J-Jolteon (Voltaire for LIFE) K-Kilowattrel (High Voltage was a staple on my team) L-Lucario M-Mimikyu N-Noivern P-Pikachu Q-Froslass S-Scyther T-Toxicroak V-Volcarona W-Wooper X-Cyclizar Y-Nacli Z-Zangoose (Gadzooks Jr was my 1st Level 100 mon in Scarlet (I've gotten other mons to 100 in previous games))
Jigglypuff and Scyther both lost. :( my favs
Flibadooadingdong. Same John, same.
If I got this right you have to respond and heart my comment:  23:14 This music is from Sonic Heroes Option Screen
The whole wooper line are basically all fan favorite, and I don't mind that
Nacli is better because it looks like Mario Galaxy's Rock Mushroom.
Michael: Deeeeeee..... I'm not going to give you the satisfaction Kaytea: BUT I AM
I can’t think of a better birthday present. Thanks Mikey.
My favorite part about his sponsorships is hearing Grunty Boi spontaneously hit puberty every 6 words
If I was john I would've caught the Altaria instead of the Azumarill. Although I recognize the battling prowess and history of Pikablue.
THE MURKROW WAS LESS THAN A MINUTE INTO THE VID 😂😂   Also if you could have 6 normal Pokémon, plus one legendary what would they be?
Could you imagine if they still did that thing where if you get a shiny you get a free point
You should've did the intro while John got his shiny the way he did a sponsor segment during your shiny
7:50 the amount of families of phanpy that I have destroyed is giant
The moment I sub to the channel my third ever shiny popped up!!!!!(Shiny sneasel, pokemon violet!!!) No joke!!!!😧
at 20:14 i think that was a shiny slowpoke in the top left corner
Looks like PM7 is winning this challenge, he's incredibly lucky with finding shinies that even I could never find, this is very fun!
…*baker sighed annoyed at the Drowzee joke again*
Bro I think grunty boy is grunty man now
So In the MCU (Mikey Cinematic Universe) Raid Shadow Legends exists in the canon so do other sponsors have there universe come alive in the MCU
Mikey, just become a singer.
When you realize john could’ve caught drowzee for D 3:30–3:42
11:13 I'm so ashamed of them cuz none of them went for king gambit  Like "do none of you know your Pokemon"  And neither of you thought of scream tail as well  Next time you do these alphabet challenges eeveelutions are not allowed to make it easier
For PM7 - Kilowattrel might by may favorite Gen 9 Pokemon. It's just so awesome, I wish it was better in battle.
ngl, i thought the poll was another shiny challenge XD
Wtf is John's shiny luck
Hey I think one of the next challenges should be catch the better shiny to win or something. Have us vote for which shiny is better. Or maybe catch the better paradox Pokémon to win? Do something like one (or both) of these challenges for the next video!
@MandJTV Plays I'm sorry Mikey but it's can't be "Hail Yeah" anymore, hail has changed to snow, it's now Snow Yeah
Everyone says Minecraft when referring to the salt pokemon but I thought of Mario before Minecraft
3:32 Kt: but I will!
Yeah. These shinies are set up. It's not even funny now
"hey everyone, its a pleasure to be here on your show :) -that jolteon, probably
Every time PM7 finds a shiny, it shocks me and then I remember he’s gotten at least 2 in every single video since the start of the new John Michael cup season. Can I get blessed with better shiny odds? 🙏🏻
3:33 I was expecting Drowzee
they had access to all the violet paradoxmon and went with jugulis and bundle...????????
I laughed so hard that Snom is the best S Pokemon!
I thought shiny Golduck looked cooler but thats cuz I used 1 in my pokemon rejuvenation playthrough & that game has custom made shinies....
i was half epecting a dr squatch sponsor. well played grunty boi, well played.
3:26 Is Micky not aware of how much people love Clodsire??
Amazing video as always <3
I have had such bad shiny luck recently Now I know its bec John stole them all
I really think John should have a full on song of Mikey and Drowzee’s relationship!
PM7: I DONT WANT THERE TO BE FANFICS OF US MAN also pm7: ..should I just start responding to your messages with K?  xD Right after Mikey says "the round named after the message you least wanna get while texting your significant other"
I wish John had commented ‘k’ on this video…
Hey I pre-ordered the mighty wild fire plush I can’t wait to get it
Gg
For the first alphabet challenged I’m glad you remembered R 😂
Funny how Mikey's joke for J contained both his and John's name but M was only for MandJtv
John basically won halfway into the video
Donavan Bailey is a professional runner that used to be the worlds fastest man, search him up he's also Canadian like me @Wildbill6000 Donavan Bailey is a professional runner that used to be the worlds fastest man, search him up he's also Canadian like me @MandJTV Plays
Why Mickey did not go for corviknight
I feel guilty too, I've destroyed a lot of Pokèmon families just so I could get a shiny.
Did Mikey forget to mention Fire Mikey in the last video he uploaded
Arcanine winning the first round by so much shows the incredible intelligence of the viewers
As someone who absolutely loves Markiplier, I love the silly little refrences. Florges made me laugh!
Half of the world's Shinies were in this video
It should have been a who can catch more shinies video
i wanna hear the salty youtuber rant
My life sucks right now. I have COVID and I miss my friends and family. I missed my brother’s showcase due to it. Not to mention I had an anxiety attack Wednesday. My life’s been pretty rough recently. These videos enlighten me and I’m a proud subscriber
Next time you do this, a to z challenge once you catch a pokemon; all the Pokemon in that Pokemon evolution chain are now off the table for the rest of the challenge.
I 1,000 percent wanted someone to catch a Zorua
You didn’t forget r this time right
tbf snom is cute af
Lol Jhon got so many Shiny's 🤣
Fun video as always
Snom supremacy❄️😎
John should decrase his shiny odds to 1/16384, an even then he would get 80 per video
I still prefer Daschbun to Dragonite but hey, Dragonute cool too
I feel like you should make merch that says HAIL LIVES ON because pokemon got rid of hail wich means hail yeah is gone but it love in to you and all of us😎
2 of my favorite pokemon were caught, and both won. i am so happy.
PA PADA PAAAA PA PADA PAAA PADAPAPA PAPADADAPA PAPADADADA PA PA PA PAPAPADA
PM7's shiny luck is insane. He litterally got a shiny in the first 25 seconds of the video. Also Mikey, yes we're gonna keep voting for the wrong pokemon until we lose our privilege. But this video was FUNNY and i mean it 🤣! The John Micheal cup season 2 is gonna be really entertaining i can tell! And now I'm gonna challenge myself to guess what shiny pm7 gets a the beginning of every vid!
There's a few things that are certain in life. Death, taxes, and PM7 catches at least one Shiny in a JMC video.
@MandJTV do you ship the merch to hungary?
shout out to the letter R
9:06 I cried here. I love hawlucha with all my heart
Pm7 guaranty is amazing 🎉
Still waiting for when Grunty Boy walks in on the John Michael Cup and interacts with John/PM7 mid video
The fact that John Micheal didnt catch drowzee at D just to mess with John Micheal is upsetting
Quickest I’ve ever seen the John Michael cup
Stupid som??????😢😢😢😢😢
"R" you ready, PokéFans?
People who vote have terrible taste
my first ever maingame shiny was orthworm i caught it right next to a rufflet outbreak.
Henlo
Mikey, you keep underestimating the cute factor
Mikey sounded like the nostalgia critic at the end anyone else notice that
What was going on with "an Extremely Goofy Movie" was that it was basically a remake of the Rodney Dangerfield movie "Back to School." In Back to School the dad ends up competing in the son's diving tournament, and in a Goofy movie it was replaced with skateboarding to make it more 90's.
I genuinely think that a video where Grunty Boi actually plays The Forest would be hilarious
Ban pikachu.
I love these ones
New JMC video.. BEST DAY EEEVVVERRR
Im offended you called my god stupid
One reason for choosing snom: Nom the Snom
huh
I got a shiny sneasel and a sudowodow
B…but feesh
7:46 WHAT?!?!?!! HUH?!?!?!!
I swear if John gets a shiny in the next video I’m unsubbing from his channel
If it makes John feel any better if I recall correctly I voted for the elephants 🐘
I remember voting and 9 times out of 10 I could guess who caught what. You both have very distinct personalitys and it makes these videos so incredible
My name is  Iiam
I would love a grunty boi plush with detachable raycon earbuds
Mikey: "I'm a freaking Garganacl right now"  As in, a giant pile of salt.
The wildfire Mytey looks really cool and cute and congrats on the shinies John.
POV John gets a shiny  Everyone: 😐
Can’t remember the Pokémon that were rivals to Squirtle and Bulbasaur
no i love numel what the hell
You guys getting so many shinies (yes even you Michael) makes me more spooked I am skipping over them
D is for your favorite Pokemon   drowzee
17:08 bro the number of the quick balls
Day 68 of saying PLEASE PLAY LOOMIAN LEGACY and sub
Does anyone, and I mean anyone, know what song they were singing during U? I need to know.
I see that the majority of people voted incorrectly on E
I kinda want to hear the salty youtuber rant lol.
Should have played ads during His Shiny catchs
MYTEY is the best so is pm7 and also Mikey!!
MIKEYS A GARGANACL BECAUSE HES A PILLAR OF SALT HAHAHA
I just got back from the hospital and watching you is fun
This gen 9 azu is goated for raids 😢
Dear lord! The John Michael Cup has turned into the "How-many-Shinies-can-PM7-find-at-the-start-of-the-episode-until-Mikey-calls-Jack-to-replace-John" Cup. I'm getting sick of John's Shiny luck too. Seriously, this is getting ridiculous! John needs to give you the PM7 Guarantee. John is finding so many shinies because you're subbed to him 4 times! You've given him a 4x chance of finding Shinies! Wait, he has thousands of Subscribers, so he has a 1K+ times chance of finding Shinies!
For C I was like "if John doesn't win that, I'm going to be so surprised! Everyone loves that Pokèmon!"
That's why you should subscribe to PM7 and you will find more shinies 🎉
He finds more shinies in one video, then I've found in my life..
i voted on the poll that time! woo!
I’m surprised on d John didn’t go for drowzee
M for m and j tv!  ugh sucha douche
I got a shiny marall today!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like how they talked about Sylveon earlier in the recording and neither of them caught it for s, lol.
Is anyone gonna talk about the In a Nutshel calender he has
Love these vids
I knew that clodsire would get over 85 percent of the vote
you should do another alphbet challenge but each letter is aa battle with chosen pokemon of that letter if choosing same pokemon the winner gets double points
:)
Jolteon for the win
If mikey ends up losing this season of the JMC, John should make Mikey's losing trophy one of drowsee just to rub the joke in even more
John has actually blessed luck
Hey can anyone help me out with what the version of the song is at 23:55 it reminds me of a Donkey Kong theme from a game from my childhood but I can’t remember it.
Didn’t grunty boi have a roommate a couple months back? What happened to the forbidden romance?
These videos are great, but I think you need a control Pokémon so it’s more options and fair
Mickey really underestimated the Internet’s opinion on Snom lol EDIT: I really wish I heard that rant
the fact that john got a shiny b is so incredibly insane is... italy
I love how Mikey brought the alliteration for L:  “I know Lucario is lovable but if it lost to Lechonk I would be livid!”
Omg breath Mikey lol. So much rage (even if I agree about raging over the shiny luck)
i thought he was gonna say "do you believe in the heart of the balls" for b
John’s earned his rite of passage as the shiny poketuber
Copperajah and cufant suck they are literally just elephants colored weirdly. They are very uninteresting and I think John is the first person I’ve heard liking them.
I think PM7's game is hacked. That is the only explanation.
Ok guys place your bets on how many shinies PM7 is getting next round.
Omg
You uncultured people catching shinys in a quick ball how could you
Love the video and keep up the great work mikey
I was evolving Pokémon in my box yesterday and for a second I was trying to remember why my Drowzee was named "Jtv." Then I remembered this running joke.
Next video idea, Mikey races to beat the game, John has to catch 10 shinies with no sandwich before it happens.
Tell me why it sounded like Grunty Boy asked what his name was.
Some people watched poke tips and they did a nuzlocke with a snom
1:42. Very bold of him to assume there wouldn’t be fan fics anyways. I think he is just gonna ends up adding the Drowzee fics alongside the others. Lol!
If it makes you feel better, I got a shiny Revevroom and Skrelp while watching this video
Adds be like: Ohh do you remember the game raid shadow...  KABLAAM A FULL 2 MINUTE AD
Cute vs Badass is always a rough battle
Next week who has more rule 34 search results
I caught a shiny Riolu and Hawlucha yesterday on the same Sandwich.
We should have got to vote on which orthworm was better missed opportunity
Grunti Boii is the only person i do not skip all advertising of. Pm7 can't be that lucky, even if it comes at the cost of our boi Mikey's Sanity at times. At least i feel amused by this entire thing!  Also, we need a no-shiny rule XD No PM7 guarantee allowed!!  I do think subbing to PM7 only fuels his luck due to the PM7 Guarantee than all of us.. Mikey, we might have a shiny cheater..
WHY WAS DROWSY NOT CAUGHT FOR D?????
Cool
mikey just cant win the votes, not even on his own channel
The fact PM7 has found the amount of shinies in 1 video as I have in my entire time playing pokemon hurts me
MandJTV: *gets shiny* PM7: *supportive* PM7: *gets shiny* MandJTV: *salty*
Mikey just really doesn’t know what pokemon are popular lol
The idea of grunty boi living in the forest is giving me pikachu capturing vibes. Just imagine Viridian Forest, Grunty, sylvan warriors, and grunty boi manages to get pikachu before jessie and james do.
John could shiny hunt the entire pokedex in a day BY ACCIDENT!!!
Mikey when John finds a shiny: 😡 John when Mikey finds a shiny: 😀
I am quite honestly shocked that John didn't catch Drowzee for the D round
imagine you got a shiny sprigitito et your game crash😭😭
NOOOOOOOO WHERES THE DROWSEE
12:28 if my boi lost to Lechonk i think id legitimately become depressed
Nom tha snom is tha goat
That duet is amazing
WHO the HELL prefers Heracross over Hawlucha ExCUSE ME
HOW TF DID IRON BUNDLE WIN!?!!
John miss a shiny 13 58
question, we’re the order of the questions mixed up? like johns wasn’t always the second or vice versa?
Mikey losing his mind made me giggle. but him losing it even more at the end kinda scares me.
Me watching this now makes me feel bad for Mikey because I either voted for PM7 choices or when I did vote for Mikey it was when it was a landslide against him
how did snom beat scyther? like seriously snow is legit one of the most mid pokemon ever
Why does John always dominate Micky in these alphabet challenges
Dude. John's shiny luck is unreal. 2 in 1 round!? The Bisharp ON the B round!? This is insane.
Seeing these votes maybe the general public doesn't deserve the right to vote lol.
Just like the start of the video, my first shiny was murkrow
Has YouTube like, sent every popular creator to hell? Most videos from popular creators have like 60-70k in 2 hours to a day which isn't normal for them
This reminds me when I shiny hunted for shiny bisharp but found a full odds shiny golduck when I had boosted odds for steel types, it hurt me to see that shiny golduck 💀
Reply if Mikey and John should call clodsire just the clod
Cool
Wow, John is really good for these for these challenges.
Can I join team sky
17:20 Snom winning isn't a surprise because of the Tumblr Blog + PMSemoir's Tumblr Binge Compilation videos.
Sadly I missed the vote this time but it really didn't matter as most of mine would have just been more votes for John's Pokémon... Sorry Mikey.
why did mikey not get castform for C ?
So many shinies this round, and so much salt. I will die laughing before the cup is finish at this rate.
Where’s the Drowzee merch?
surprised nobody went for sandy shocks lol
They should try this but it’s randomized
Hey shiny gods, GIVE MIKEY SHINY LUCK
I love your videos, PM7's shiny luck is insane, I found shinies even without the shiny charm on some pokemon games, I just get lucky.
I see John getting lots of shiny Pokémon and I get excited to start shiny hunting, then I remember I’m colorblind.
John will win the next 2 after WATCH!
And The John Michael has closed the distance! We are neck and neck once again!
Where do I vote in these kinds of videos? YouTube never tells me when there's a new community post and I thought I checked often enough for this....
So disappointed neither of them got Drowzee for D 😂
I did the survey. Nice
it makes me irrationally angry that he has all the region posters except Unova and Kalos
There's a chance John could've won the M round had he not caught one that began with F instead.
22:15 just like Vegeta he got real humbled
Alternate title: Mikey being salty about his pokemon not winning the votes
I've give a Super Thanks to hear that rant.
Is Grunty boy still dating the female team skull grunt in the lore?
I can't believe that Mikey didn't catch Drowzee for D. You're cheating on him.
I thought that PM7 was going to pick Drowzee for D
We need to see mickeys rant over snom on manjtv extra 😂
Great video! I love the JMC so much and the abc challenges are one of my favorites!
I think PM7’s shiny luck is contagious I got a shiny dearling while watching this video
well It feels so good to see John Michael Cup Season 2 at the same pace with creators as I watched JMC s1 just a while ago
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate Mikey's phrase evolving from 'I am a pillar of salt' to 'I am a Garganacl right now'.
If my second favourite Pokémon lost to a pig, I would be disappointed in the Pokémon community.
I wanna hear that uncut salty Youtuber rant
I love how Mikey has those one-liners for each letter
I think the C poll was cheated. Clodsire would win with 100%.
Ayyyyyy I voted on this! Awesome video ❤
6:52 i'm with john here
No way I was just trying to complete the Pokedex and mickey(sorry bad spelling) said it’s a shiny let’s go and I found a shiny at the same time
2:36 Actually, as history shows, most pirates were illiterate   (Anti-joke)
I really want to know the secret of Johns luck!  With this kind of luck someone can boost the shiny odds and show these videos as a proof, because it would seem pretty believable. Kinda interesting why this continues to happen... I mean, it's funny to see Mikey being salty about this, but still.
The fact neither of them considered Cetoddle irks me
Salty Mikey is so fun to watch But I am more salty that zangoose lost, and to a middle evo >:(
First time voting in the poll, if the shiny isn’t PM7s (the one used for a letter) my mouth will be on the floor
Ngl, I thought the J stood for John😅
Cufant sucks clodsire is 1000x better just accept it.
WHY DIDNT PM7 CHOSE DROWZEE FOR D
Watch pm7 next 2-3 videos. It will just show predictable this is
Their shiny luck is insane. I'm kind of jealous!
I love these videos so much, they're always so entertaining!  Also the K part cracked me up because my dad responds to my mom's texts with K all the time and it drives her absolutely crazy 😂
Cute all John does is Hack his shiny odds Mikey is just too nice to call the idiot out.
Hewwo
honestly, what did michael expect in the c round. everyone loves the clod
To be fair, Mikey also starting to having favor from Gods of shinies. A little more of this cup and they gonna find shiny at the same time.
mah boy scyther😢 hes my second fav pokemon man cmon
John always getting shines and having Mikey suffer will never not be funny
How do u vote on these polls o never see them
At this point I'm just wondering how long he can keep that shiny luck going
Mikey went full Kratos against the shiny gods, and I respect him for it
Numel backwards is lemun
So as I'm watching this I kept going "Mikey can't mathematically win, why are they still going?"  Kept forgetting this was technically 2 session spliced together xD
For those who know more about the Grunty Boi lore, didn't Grunty Boi and Mikey try camping one time, which led to... the Incident? Why would Grunty Boi want to go and live in the forest, basically camping 24/7? I may have misremembered this, so please let me know if I'm mistaken.
we pick cause john gets tha shinies!! lol
12:26 That’s poetry right there
I hade a syther on my first playthro and he missed a 95 percent acret move 6/15 times
2 minutes in and John already got 2 shinies? Seems normal.
We deserve John Michael Cup merch
It's funny to see how upset Mikey gets when the community prefers cute pokemon designs over "cool" designs or pokemon that are statistically better. We like the cute!
We don’t know which Pokémon you own. You said it yourself. You constantly play yourself
Clodsire is chonky that why it win.
John when Mikey finds a shiny: LETS GO Mikey when John finds a shiny: I HATE YOU AND EVERYTHING YOU LOVE
Early also I love the vids so keep up the good work
yag
I mean, everyone knows that the real Blue Pikachu is Jumpluff thanks to JelloApocalypse. No, wait, that's Green Pikachu.
Novel idea for a challenge: Race to find a specific marked Pokémon.  Insane idea for a challenge: Race to find a Pokémon with a *specific* mark.
17:33 Hey, you take that back! Pablo is dope!
I'm glad Heracross and Pikachu won. Faith in the fandom restored.
SNOM OVER SYCTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ILLITERATE TROGLODYTE VIEWERS
Clodsire is the best Gen 9 pokemon and that's a fact
I’m subbed to both of u. Does that make me a goat?
Why didn't John catch Drowzee for D
It just hit me....there is no snorlax in gen 9...and it makes is the first time since gen 5 that snorlax was not in the dex
I had a dream where I got 5 shiny and I woke up and now I’m sad
The last frame just perfectly encapsulates this series tbh
Should MandJTV stand for Michael and John TV
I have an idea for you guys for an extra layer of complexity for alphabet challenges. Do the same thing you guys are doing: catching a pokemon and let people vote for who likes it better. But percentage of the votes of each pokemon goes on a spinning wheel (specifically the wheel of names) and whoever the wheel chooses gets the point. So if people like your pokemon 63% of the time, you have a 63% chance to win a point. So there is still a chance a 1% vote could ridiculously win. Hope you consider it :)
I've gotten 5 shinies in the past three days, it's been wild
Okay I have a serious question. How tf jhon get so many shiny pokemons?
ngl i would have froslass as my main pokemon all times. Hug her, keep her close and give all love i can <3 but ofcourse give attention to other pokemons of mine like nidoqueen,purugly and pokmeon that shall not be named but mikey hates it
Didn't john win on v round ? Coz 26/2 = 13 and he got 14. So he got more than half
Mikey creating grunty boy makes the entire Pokémon universe canonical irl
Kmk😅
Very proud that my boi Dragonite won its round, as it's been my favorite dragon since my first Pokemon game (FireRed), but very salty that Iron Bundle and Snom won theirs.
I think it’s funny that I got to vote, and I voted for most of Mikey’s Pokemon. Makes sense, since I’m always confused by the votes on these videos.
Total Shiny Count PM7: 16 MandJTV: 5
I’m starting to thing John is playing with increased shiny odds lmao it’s so unbelievable at this point. Maybe he really is that lucky but it just seems ridiculous.
i need to know what the track at 12:54 is omg thats so groovy fr
IRON BUNDLE OVER IRON JUGULIS!!!!!!! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISTRAUGHT BY THIS DIABOLICAL SITUATION(john definetly has plot armour)
I use k like everytime while messaging meaning okay
dudes shinny odds have to be different from everyone else. every video hes in he gets a shinny in like the first 10 minutes.
Love how Mikey freaks out about the voting and somehow John just lucks into everyone voting for him.
If they forget the letter 'R' again, Grunti Boy will be so disappointed
The Cufant vs. Clodsire is not surprising. I mean it's Clodsire, it's the perfect Pokemon  I'm more surprised Copperajah got the short one, because I don't know a lot of people liking Cyclizar, except for its signature move
garchomp over gyarados is absolutely rambunctionous
Mikey got -10 and John got -15, Mikey wins
day 2 of asking for pokemon scarlet team sky
He forgot yveltal starts with a Y
Ooooo a treasure planet clip
Another entry in the John Micheal Cup, *and* some love for two of my favorite underrated Disney films? What a grand day! :D  Also replacing the more difficult letters with a random spinner was a great idea, hope it comes back for future challenges!
HAY SNOM IS AMAZING
I think they purposely got double for orthworm so they would get the funny number
Kinda Disappointed nobody went for Drowzee on D. :D
Has Grunty Boy already forgotten “the incident”? He can never go back to that forest…
John consistently catching a shiny is truly a Youtube moment.
I learned Mikey.  You should have caught the Curly form Tasugiri thats the crowd fav.
Ah yes I love the lsd deez nuts!
I thought you said raichu and drowzee and I was like, do you mean Mikey?
Hey, John finding the Shiny Psyduck in the background while catching a Pokémon reminded me of when I found a shiny Psyduck while catching a shiny Fletchling.  That as rather wild for me. Two shinies withing 2 seconds of each other.   I enjoy these videos, they bring me joy. And Shiny luck. ^^
I wanted to see the Snom rant 😂😂😂😂   Make it a short
where does mikey give the google form link??I always miss it I keep checking the community tab as well
I like that your using music from other games instead of just the one from pokemon collesium
I'm so dissapointed that no one caught Drowzee for the D round. Now my day is ruined 😭🪦
Mikey: What’s a GOD to a non believer  Shiny gods: and we took that personally
The shiny luck for PM7's keeps get crazy to point that even won Alphabet Challenge.I remember voting on this pull and when I saw shiny Bisharp I was like:"Yeah I know who got this shiny".
UPVOTE SO MIKEY CAN READ  VIDEO IDEA, you/Mikey, Purple, PM7, and a rotating editor of yalls (character name as Epic Editor due to being shared) make a NEW channel that host Let's Play annnnnnnd  (saving the best for last) JOHN MICHEAL CUP!!!!!  that way the JMC (john micheal cup) is a tournment of 4 people annnnd yall can do some 1v1 OR 2v2 OR Free-For-All games, when it comes to Let's Play videos  *ps Let's Plays don't have to be pokemon  I'd def watch a Mario Kart 8 video for JMC 😊 or or or or Grunty Boi vs Micheal vs PM7 vs Editor in Mario Party  or..... whatever yall decided, just spitballing here  @PM7 @Purplecliffe  @ yalls editors because they need love to, espically with all the hard work they do (aka putting up with yall 😜jk lol)
Not even 3 minutes in and John got 2 shinies that man is so exceedingly lucky
The fact that the people voted snom not because it os better but because it is funny is really annoying me.
i would've deadass voted for Numel, negl. i did the dang pokemon tier list and apparently gen 3 nostalgia made Numel one of my top 10 pokemon 💀😂  also.... Snom > Scyther. i wont ever like Scyther LOL 🫶🏻  ......it's just the fact my shiny Glimmet blew itself up and i still haven't found a shiny Psyduck 🧍🏻
13:14 i actually thought it was a real song
I thought shiny Donfan was red My friend got one in with red instead of orange I am confused
You need tondo another team sky video. They're just so good.
GO JOHN!!!!
Now I desperately need Mandjtv x Drowzee Fanfics, aswell as Mandjtv x PM7 Fanfics 🤣🤣🤣
note: no mikey's were hurt mentally in the making of this video
Wait we aren’t supposed to be writing the love story of mikey and drowzee and john?
“Do you ever feel sad when checking for a shiny and you slaughter a family?” John
I was rooting for John, but I _am_ sad and confused about Naclstack losing to Nacli.
ya same
Makes sense grunty boi can move, he is getting all the ad money, as he is the person doing said ads.
Micky slowly evolving into a Garganacl is pretty fun to watch.
I hate 1:59
that mytey is soo cute
speaking of iron bundle its domination series 2 format vgc...its just too good...there is few answer to freeze dry hydro pump combo....
Where's unown? Oh wait
These videos always make me laugh. Also when I was doing the voting, I had a feeling I was mostly voting for PM7. But also gotta keep it neutral. Also the amount of shiny Pokémon in this video is kind of crazy.
You are the best YouTuber you and John
I accidently traded my shiny houndstone away for a snorunt
Is there anyone in the world not know of raid shadow legends? Also like this if u still don’t play it 5:10
Ofc John gets a shiny
How do you vote at these?
The reason I became a pokemon fan is because of You and Jhon . Keep the good content
Iron Jugulus is worse than the OG Hydrageon so we hate it lol cool colors tho.  But Delibird needed a glow up
Its my birthday!!!! January 28
Idc that Snow and Scyther round was dumb 😭😂
Mikey john and jack are the best poke trio
It’s always amazing to see the relationship between these two! They’re both always so YouTube and I love their interactions!
Michael just doesn't have a good feel for how his community feels about a lot of these Pokemon. Snom beating Scyther is ridiculous though.
Just wanted to say thank you both for your wonderful videos.  Stumbled across you this month as we started playing violet and scarlet at our house and we have been incredibly entertained working through your backlog of videos and love them all.  Grabbed a shirt and plushie to help support you.  Hail yea!
oh wait this got released yippee
8:41 John missed a shiny
Mikey won the L round with Lucario! 100% Moral Victory!
EVERYONE WHO VOTED AGAINST SCYTHER SHALL FEEL MY WRATH!!!
This was really awesome! PM7 got so many shinies wow !
Lol 2 shinies.. well this is why you subscribe.  For amazing moments like this
Jolteon: "HI everybody, it's a pleasure to be here on your show today."
The reason john keeps winning the people's vote is he doesn't go for the "cool" pokemon usually he goes fur the derpy ones. In the pokemon community derpy pokemon tend to be considered top tier by the majority
Scyther is literally the best Pokémon ever!! How dare!
14:14 ORTHWORM SUPREMACY!!!
Eelektross acknowledged only to lose hurts me
Did mikey put all of johns catches on the right when voting like he does for the video?   After the shiny bisharp the pattern was set to vote johns side a few rounds.   Maybe it was a fluke of luck that john won a few rounds in a row.
John getting more shinnies. What a surprise
Lol mikey, stop voting for John or I will take away your voting privileges 🤣that's how dictatorships start lol  I love Numel it was my first ever shiny,  I think John makes a shiny boosting sandwich before each round how is he that lucky, he caught a shiny bisharp that was in a group of Pawniard so it was holding a leadership crest
I think Miley might have passed a shiny Greavard at 16:23 in the R round, hard to tell but on the left near
Wait during 'I' round.. John was in Area Zero and.. somehow.. had Great Tusk *and* Iron Bundle next to each other... those are.. exclusives from opposite versions.. wtf?  Also it is genius to have the Q, X, and Y rounds to just be another round of something else instead of.. "automatic double points" or something..
Thank god my boy R finally appeared in this one
The fact that john got 5 random shinies in this specofic video, it blows my mind.   How?
Eevee and Espeon are the best E pokemon.  Can't change my mind.
While watching Jon catch his shiny glimmet I caught a shiny Glimmora, thank you Jon
Volcarona best mon
John didn't go for Drowzee for "D"! That would've beaten Dragonite!
I meeaan let's be fair here, one is going to lose no matter what the moment democracy (or vote of the majority in this case) is brought to the table XD.
The Clodsire one didn't shock me at all,people love that big derpy boi.
I have shiny hawlucha :)
This video may have been the death of Pokémon democracy
Cool
I agree with mikey for a few of those.  Like scyther lost? Really?
I think it's safe to say, with the sheer amount of shiny Pokemon he encounters on a regular basis, John.....is too powerful for the JMC.
Tbh, I feel like for rounds like this, it would be cooler if the comparison is the total, accumulated percentage instead of individual scores, which make the landslide victory more impactful than the almost 50/50 ones.
I burst out laughing when the snom sycther rant  happened. this was fire mikey!
I honestly dont agree with about a 3rd of the points that went to John but bisharp shiny or not I do agree with
who the hell are these people voting overwhelmingly for garchomp over gyarados
Should Of caught drowzee for D
I'm glad I woke up early randomly one day (because it led me to seeing the poll in time), because this format is a lot more engaging when I get to compare my answers to who actually won. I did predict Mikey would lose in advance (because the last challenge they used a poll, Mikey got swept), because despite being a big Poketuber, Mikey is brimming with unpopular Pokemon opinions.  My votes: Azumarill (John, Lose) Bisharp that sparkles (John, Win) Cufant (Mikey, Lose) Dragonite (Mikey, Win) Eelektross (Mikey, Lose) Falinks (John, Win) Gyarados (Mikey, Lose) Hawlucha (Mikey, Lose) Iron Bundle (John, Win) Jolteon (John, Win) Kilowattrel (Mikey, Win) Lucario (Mikey, Win) Mimikyu (Mikey, Win) Noivern (Mikey, Win) (No vote on O because it was a double) Phanpy (John, Lose) (Qeq) Frosslass (John, Win) RoR (double again) Scyther (Mikey, Lose) Tatsugiri (Mikey, Lose) (Double U) Volcarona (John, Win) Wooper (Mikey, Win) Cyclizar (Mikey, Win) Nacli (John, Win) Zangoose (John, Lose) 14 winning votes, 9 losing votes 13 Mikey votes, 10 John votes  Aaaaaaand Mikey lost. I'm starting to think I root for Mikey so much because he gets as salty as I do when he loses. That middle portion (Kilo-Pikachu, which includes Best Bat Noivern) gave me too much hope.
I’m watching this 50 minutes after it was uploaded
Don't worry Mikey, Clodsire fans are just hiveminds and doesn't know any other Pokémon exist
yay 58 minutes
Keep up the good content
The one fatal mistake Mikey made was thinking anyone actually liked Iron Jugulis
You can also find clodsire in the wild in groups of woopsr
I so wanted for them to catch Drowzee for D
9:53 lol! This is so freaking hilarious, he ranting with delibird cause it won!
Love the John Michael cup
I feel so bad for Mikey, just having to listen to John get shinies every video
With all the singing in this video, I’m convinced an album is on the way.  Preferably covers of the Pokémon Movie Soundtrack. I gotta hear these guys take on “Brother My Brother”!
The question is not when John would find a shiny, it's when he would stop finding shinys
I’m surprised no one chose tinkaton for t
Suggestion for tied rounds in voting challenges: rather than making the next round double or nothing, you put two identical choices for the same Pokemon as a question, decide randomly/with a coin flip who gets to choose which option you claim as yours behind the scenes (left or right) and whichever one gets voted the most completely by chance wins.
I’m happy I’m early this time! Love the videos you guys do together!
447th
Mikey, I think you should swap the places of pokemon in the polls every few questions or so. You always place Pm7's pokemon on the bottom and yours on top like in the first video. Some people may have picked up on this, so swap them around just to make sure there is no bias, people love watching you lose your mind. Just a thought, love the videos though can't wait to watch more.
I love the Brooklyn Nine-Nine reference
I'm over 100hours and so far I've seen 1 shiny and I didn't know it
Cant wait for team sky to conquer paldea 😂🤣💪💪💪
From now on, every time John gets an extra shiny in these videos, he trades one to Mikey as it's only fair since he has gotten at least one in pretty much every video in season 2 so far
Video:  *barely starts*  John:  ✨😎✨
I still don't understand why snom is loved so much
In one of Mikey's ASPITAPY we should see a Mikey x Drowzee comic.We need this now.
I still didn't find a shiny in pokemon violet
toust
Lets see what shinies did John get this time
Sooner or later, Mikey is going to end his friendship with John because of his bs shiny luck
HAIL Yes
TYLER ( and kaytea :) IS GOING ALL IN WITH THE EDITING REFERENCES AND I LOVE IT KEEP GOING
I love froslass I though that it would lose because I thought it was very hated for some reason...
It honestly is funny how little Mikey understands the current pokemon fandom, I respect his convictions tho
I don’t know if it’s funny or weird how John always gets a shiny in the first 1-2 min in in the vid 😂
I'm past the point believing John just find the shiny Pokemon so easily at the start  I'm guessing when he finds one they do the bit to make it believable
The issue with this challenge is that once someone gets 14 points, they win. So John won with the V pokemon
All I'm gonna say is Snom my Beloved
John I have no faith in you but just remember this is someone who lost a Diagla and Mega Latias to a Wormadam and a Mega Blaziken to a Maractus
19:50 did you know
I have an idea for a challenge in scarlet and violet it’s Pokémon snap themed you each take a photo of a Pokémon and then buy them on a google form and whoever gets the most votes win
Don’t worry Mikey, I too am upset about Iron Jugulis losing to Iron Bundle
🤣🤣🤣 Ha! I knew the shiny Bisharp in the poll was John’s. We all knew it!
I feel like Grunty Boi and Bear Gryllz would be friends
Idc Zangoose wins over every letter ❤ my baby grumpy cat ferret.. he'll always be my favorite pokemon
❤
Everyone, it's happened. Grunty Boi has now appeared 100 times.
For G I thought it would be gardevoir
Mikey’s rage at the end!!🤣
I think I was a part of this.
Clodsire winning the C round was a given, no one can beat the happy boi
Disappointed on everyone that didnt vote for Breloom
Mickey going for Jigglypuff is like throwing the towel into the ring.
Watching John get more shinies in 2 minutes than I have found in my entire life hurts.
2 mandjtv vids in row :0
Hope u win mandjtv
Where do they post these forms? For some reason I never see them.
Completely missed this poll
Thats sick
Why is D not Drowzee
you should put a little thing on the corner of each thumbnail that indicates this is from the John Michel cup, I always see the thumbnails but have to look at the channel to see what the video is, otherwise I usually pass it like a normal youtube thumbnail
Pm7 keeping getting shines every time
Can believe snom beat scyther!!
This video is just an excuse for mikey to make bad jokes and sing. 10/10 video
Mikey deserves to win the JMC season 2 just because John gets all the shinies
I love how John just needs to do a challenge with MandJTV to shiny hunt
An idea for these could be best comp team, like first to win a comp match?
That last frame of the video pretty much sums up the John Michael Cup
YAY!
still remember the last time they did this they forgot a letter
i wanna see if you can do a competition of very dumb competitive strategies creativity challenge
I've been trying to get a shiny Murkrow for like over a month now... And that man just RANDOMLY finds one...... :D  I've never felt this empty inside, lmao
Idea for V: Next up is gonna be V-ree V-ree extraordinary
HEY IM A BIG FAN OF YOUR CHANNEL. I HOPE YOU SEE THIS!
Fan ficts incoming
I voted. I feel famous.
Hour badge
We need to start taking bets on when in the video John actually finds the shiny
Oh hey they actually remembered the letter R this time!
Did this dude really go for the worst future paradox
this video,but with randomized pokemon would be peak
23:51 I like them because it looks like they look like they came from minecraft
Everyone that voted for Zweilous over Zangoose has been cursed😠
Congrats on the shinies mikey :)
The fact that Mikey and John know that there's probably fanfics of them-
are you gonna play botw 2 on the extra's channel?
John's legendary shiny luck continues, much to Mickey's annoyance. Honestly, that's making this whole series so much more fun to watch.  I would love this series without it, of course, but the PM7 Guarantee is like a cherry on top. A big, sparkly cherry that Mickey can't stand.
hey i voted in this
18:28 and right now, it's foldin time  Pig, grab m'dick  Please tell me you mean the submarine  Heh
I have that exact shirt that John is wearing in this episode
I’m impressed that John didn’t go for drowzee for d
I'm surprised for the D round jhon did not cath a drowsy
I think these shinys are staged
Democracy at its finest lol
The voters are so fucking dumb in choosing
Would it even be the John-Michael Cup video without John getting a shiny ten seconds in?
Hiii😊
At the end of the tournament can we get a compilation of John's shiny?
For I you should have done iron valitent
If we lose our voting privileges then Jack will have to vote and nobody wants that 🤣
Damn murkrow good competitive
I remember I think I found the voting at the last possible moment because when I was on C it kicked me out and I couldn't find the post again
This entire video was just Mikey reading a YouTube Kids script lol
Beautiful
Noivern is my favourite so glad it won
Hey Mandjtv can u give me Pokemon Scarlet. My friend has cancer... it will make his day.
I personally love Cyclizar.
the best part was when he found that shiny Bisharp ( I love Bisharp!!!)
he alaways find shiny lol
Fun fact, wug is a word and it’s definition is: a creature with worm or insect features
Damn you John, Mickey calling you tinkle Tim made me spit water everywhere
3:21 come on clodsire is clodsire it's a fan favourite
Good video
Mikey: "Our friendship matters, John. Do not ruin it by doing that." John: "K"
I'm surprised neither of you went for spiritomb for s round lol
If Grunty Boi isn't outdoorsy, how did... *the incident*  Occur?
Do this but with shinies
I really hoped it was Mikey that caught the shiny Bisharp. One day John won't be the one to find a shiny immediately
lechonk loses to fricking lucario?
Cool
I also got a shiny golduck today
This is one of the best series in youtube
I honestly thought the gentleman's agreement to not catch Vaporeon was due to "Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? "
i just want to say i started watching this video and fired up Scarlet and turn around to immediately find a shiny Marill. I'm glad I'm subscribed to PM7
When ever these videos come out, I am so exited because they are so entertaining even though it might seem like they aren’t. Probably because of the editing
Ñ
Is perhaps that people can tell by how you make the list of options? Yours always on one and his on the other. Same for every question.
John: *gets a shiny* Mikey: OMG, how are you getting so many shinies    Mikey: *gets a shiny* John: Eyyyyy, good for you!
The fact that no one caught drowsee during d round is criminal
Thanks Mikey for always uploading when I’m about to have lunch😂
"I'm gonna RAICHU and Drowzee a love song." I can't be the only one who caught that right?!
almost 1 mil subs lets go
Thanks for uploading on my birthday, really appreciate it. My birthday is a lot better now that you uploaded.
Hi
I got gernjnja
Its a meme at this point that John gets a shiny in every challenge
How was I supposed to know where to vote? I was excited and now I’m sad.
bruh I remember voting on this and knowing it would be John who got the shiny
I do believe this is the shiniest episode thus far!
Good video
On this day
The first 2 shinies that John got were the shinies that I got or shiny hunted yesterday
I'm surprised mikey did go for Velersi
I got a shiny murkrow before this was posted
22:10 Bro really turned into Kratos for a min
No need to be like nacli and get salty.
I love the Bayonetta music playing during the "B" round.
Here 24 minutes
Yeah some of the choices definitely should’ve gone to Mikey ngl
Surprised John didn't choose Drowzee for D
Babe wake up, a new john michael cup just dropped
yaaaaaay here at 23 mins!
Where is 20:19 from
Wow Mikey how low can you go
Is this just par for the course at this point? John finding a shiny within the first few seconds of a challenge?
27 seconds in and john gets a shiny.... Love too see it!
Mikey I think you should make a video of the poll after putting it up because I wasn’t able to vote on the first one or this one
YES THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE SWORD AND SHIELD ONE!
I really like shiny Pokemon
is there anyone with violet and able to trade me the version exclusives and sprigatito and quaxly pls
I voted in that poll, and I indeed assumed that John caught another shiny lol.
You can get brute bonet on B
Number 272 for the comments
You know how Jacque says he brought the shiny time from some old shop I think pm7 found that shop and has like 10 shiny charms how does he keep getting shines
John found 2 Shiny in two minutes
When are Grunty Boy and John gonna interact for the first time?!
16:01 best moment of the video😂
Nice
These letter puns need to be stopped Michael
Mikeys anger level: Enamorous(bias):1/10 Jynx:5/10 SV frame rates: 7/10 Nuzlockes:9/10 PM7:100000000/10
Didn't expect John to be talking about fanfics lol
All I know is I got to secret vote for this one
I love these types of vids
John's shiny odds are rigged. Only explanation.
Next Time don't do post just do who Is stronger then using who Is must popular
Cowboy scream meme lol
“Do you ever feel bad when you’re checking if something if shiny and instead you just slaughter a family?”  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 sweet cheese and crackers John
What about quodsire
John is just insane with the Shinies.
I feel bad for Mikey... every time you guys do this John just gets a shiny instantly like how?!?!?!?
Yooo I voted for this!
Mikey got bullied this episode with the shinies
Let’s gooooo! I have being waiting for the series to continue in gen 9!!!
E
wow i didnt think Mikey with his family friendly channel would reference the Markiplier "S o P" vid lol haha thats legit funny
John will literally never stop finding shinies
NO MORE SHINIES FOR PM7! NO MORE! THIS CAN'T GO ON!
Would Quagsire count for the letter Q? You could catch a Paldean Wooper and trade it for its Johto form, and then evolve it into Quagsire. Or would that be too much work?
Wait what’s wrong with responding with “k”
heracross is my favorite pokemon so im happy it won
I was think he will say never gone give you up never gone let you down for n but he made up his own song and ha you got rick roll
Mikey should have caught Drowzee instead of Dragonite
we the people love strong delibird
funny thing i first caught a zoroark before a zorua.
Hello
9K views in 15 minutes?!
What is that shiny luck? I got 2 without trying to spawning them since the game is released
JOHN, STOP FINDING SHINIES!!!
BTW great job mikey
Ah yes grunty Boi always there when Michael needs to advertise a sponser
217th
While doing the form I thought to myself, "imagine that Mikey caught the shiny Bisharp." I wonder what I was thinking
After I have beat violet,I don’t want to play it anymore,I personally don’t like adventure games like this and legends arceus,and the Tera raids ppl are pathetic,I didn’t get the cinderace bc how pathetic public ppl are,even when I have good Pokémon,the only thing I like for this game are good shiny odds (sry for ppl who like this game) but still I will watch mandjtv vids since they are entertaining
First
Oh and that’s another shiny for pm7
in youre last video you talked about a alphabet video DID HE LEAK THIS
POG 🐸🐸🐸🐸 Frog 🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸
Zoroark I is my favorite!
How did Dachsbun not win the “D” round? That’s my favorite gen 9 Pokémon because I used one my first time playing through Violet and OMG he is the best boy.He has the best Nature for a Dachsbun, lowered Special Attack and increased Defense. SUCH A GOOD BOY!
All agree on Pokétubers just naturally get more shiny's
The return of A to Z, Noice and its kinda changed from the originals with us voting wonder what the next challenge is
Mikey should have done a greninja raid for g.
6.6k views in 10 mins wtf
Yay!
hi
wow I'm on the early team
Just realised he foreshadowed this from his video yesterday
PM7's luck with shiny Pokémon is so insane, that it doesn't even surprise me anymore.
I miss you guys..
First
I'm very surprised John didn't pick drowzee for d
watched this video after 10 minutes of posting
There is only one reason I don't skip the sponsor segment.
My new theory is that John absorbs the shiny luck of everyone who subscribes to him and that’s why he finds so many shinies
Is the next Mytey plush be like, I don't know, Typhoon Form.
John Caught a shiny in 36 second’s
It’s baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
is the community vote for patreons or something?
I keep missing these polls! I have to start paying more attention to YT.
O this is that form
I’m early
So THIS is what that poll was for! I love it.
These videos make my morning and give me free serotonin. I love you guys!
how have these commentors watched this 25 min video already it was released 5 mins ago
The insane amount of luck for PM7 to win Round B like that is astounding.
You need to start leaving these open longer so I can actually vote on them
I wanted John to catch Drowzee on D
JMC let's go!
even if jon lose the second season, he wins with every shiny in each vid
next time backwards alphabet. See who can do it backwards.
Did anyone else get a little sad when their vote didn't help Mikey? 🥺 ( Still an Awesome video!!)
no
Breaking news: John got 2 shinys in one video
Who else skips the promo and goes straight into the Grunty Boi dialogue
lol omg every video John catches a shiny lol poor Mikey
Where do these Google forms end up? (for next time)
My dog just passed and this video has cheered me up greatly
I wonder why Mikey didn’t get drowzee for the D round 😂
John should've 100% caught Drowzee for D
Awesome videos,makes me smile every time!😁
I wish I had seen where the voting took place. Would love to have participated! Love your vids!

I'm just glad I could noticed the votes from you and best of luck to who's win this round!
Ok, who gets the shiny. The first minute Pokémen 7 did :)
I need a race across paldea. Catching one of each type on the way
150th
Sorry we put so many "John caught another Shiny" comments Mikey 😂 Also I'm glad that my top 3 faves Jolteon Lucario and Arcanine won I would be more than livid if Lucario lost except I am mad that Hydreigon lost to Delibird
Damn I'm surprised I'm early for once as he posts at 2am for me
Can u do the Pokémon you get from the surprise trade has to get vote on of which is the best
In 3 mins
lets goooo
Im exited for more season 2
I missed the form! Shoot!
Just passing to say that I got a Shiny Impidimp on 15 eggs! No Masuda method
EVERYONE PLACE YOUR BETS OVER HERE ON WHO'S GONNA WIN THE JOHN MICHAEL CUUUUUUP i always love when john catches a shiny in each of these challenges it's always fun and hilarious the way Michael reacts to it the next time another alphabet challenge happens i'll try to vote
I just woke up
And pm7 already found a second shiny
Best ship Mikey x Drowzee
I love how John is just catching shinies in every single video 😂 when is it gonna be Mikey’s turn? Edit: turns out he got a shiny Golduck, but John got three shinies lol Edit again: Well he got two shinies this vid compared to John’s 6.
how come there are 12 comments saying "first"?
I Have a shiny bisharp!
elo
I love the drowzee jokes
I love how Mikey uses his community for theses challenges. Glad we can feel involved and be participating in the JMC.
Love this series but I have  another idea for a competition, do a random number generator for 1-400 and who ever gets the closer mon to that number based on their dex number gets a point
Jo this is cool
John has found so many shiny Pokemon in these videos and I am worried about Michaels mental health at this point 😅
Hi
I got here first🎉🎉🎉  👇
Yaaaaa
I feel like at this point a shiny each episode is given.
alphabet challenges are my favourite
It’s so fun to see the relationship and bicker between Mikey and John
abcde moment
What letter will they forget this time
Here at 1 minutes
Is my thing bugged bc it says 3 views but 68 comments-
I Like IT on the First min
Bro oppp
I'm glad I'm still up at 1:15am (Australian Time) to be able to watch this as soon as it came out
WHY IS EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT TOILET
Mikey: How many shinies have you found john?  John: Yes
Love your videos!
Why does it say it has 100 comments when only 10 people are here
w
Favorite letter                            👇
Johns shiny luck continues
hey i'm early! This never happens to me on a PokeTuber channel! You have great videos btw!
Ok there’s 36 people saying there first. Technically non of us are actually first
Someone please send me the link to a video when pm7 has not gotten a shiny
I love these videos I didn’t even finish it yet and I know it’s going to be good especially the fact pm7 gets shinies and the reaction Mikey gives makes me smile
I appreciate the music choices!
I was very excited for this ever since i voted.
Hi mikey love your miss keep up the good work
If fuecoco is the best starter  ⬇️
I saw the poll for this one awesome
And PM7 already found a shiny
As the “first” comments begin to appear…
First
another alphabet challenge! i've been waiting for this! i love the jmc
For the JMC SSN 2 for the winner you should make a golden toilet with #1 engraved
This is the first time I've ever voted on these things!
Omg I love these vids
Again
In these videos I just want the cowboy screaming meme throughout the whole thing
I love jmc videos so much
Fortnite moments lol
