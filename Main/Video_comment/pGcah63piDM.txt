Till this day I don't understand why Chinx (os) was removed on this tune. Cah his verse was fire ngl🔥🔥🥷🏽👑👑
I didn’t run to the net when I hit up their ends I done it with a browning that’s high power 💥
Mskum still got the coldest verse
1:43 HE GOT CHEFFED WHERE

When I was on E Wing in Wormswood Scrubs. I clocked Digga there but named him DigDat.
Straight to playlist without hearing single verse and no regrets 🌋💥🧨 Dem man ain't got no bad song 🥶
DD🔥
We’ve got depth in all positions. We got the chemistry. And a lot of quality. But this is football one team can take advantages of a next teams disadvantage. Chelsea looking like a threat btw.
TY n SavO had similar bars on the tune guess who's back

Real ones know about chinx missing verse. It’s a shame he would of got bagged if he was on. But he goes off🔥
Even DC8 have more bodies or have been involved in more killings 😭
Dey just dissing woo 💀💀💀 they can’t speak on anyone else
I get Digga wants to bring in his boys, but this is working backwards. Just another dash away tune.
What happened to the Chinx feature? Was too keen for that would've preferred just Digga and Chinx but I understand this song was made to represent the gang. But this bruddah legit had Chinx on this song and now he's not...
🔥🔥🔥🔥1011 is backkkk
