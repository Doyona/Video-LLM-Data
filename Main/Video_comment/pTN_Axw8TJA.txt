How I began to like rap?    This guy:
Fucking masterpiece
Prodigy vibes
Somehow this reminds me of Korn
I'm honestly impressed how he managed to take numerous genres and make them all awful in under 2 minutes
So this is who mickey mouse is copyrighted to!
THIS IS A FUCKING BANGER LIVE
is it Metaltrap kind of genre?
Pedrada
What do you mean😢
Ta enojado no quiere ciudadanos listos

Yuck Innit
Lazarus right here love u bro bro remember this..... Darkness cannot exist in the presence of the light... Remember the little things and the big things will take care of themselves.. right is right thing because it's the right thing! Jesus saves only by the blood let us all repent this message is true by faith in Yahoshua meaning "Yah is salvation" we return from the fall back to the paradise. The cross and the blood he died for us all... No one is greater then Yahoshua. He laid his life down for us! Come on understand! Don't make light of the truth when it's deep waters and that light in context of weight or photon alebeit the two are interchangeable words but different... Don't be confused... Discern
Ахуительно
everything on fire and in the middle of chaos just Him <3

THIS IS THE BEST SONG EVER GOOD SHIT GHOSTEMANE
Who like this song,have good taste in music
Wow...watha fuck is that?!?!?
All you have to do is sell your soul and promote satanism and they can make you famous. This guy has zero talent. You think he makes his own music?! Naive much?
я балдею

Fed up
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂
Está refea  su canción jajajajja
You are a ghost god
Great visuals
Minds me of early days Industrial.  Cool but a bit derivative to be honest.  Probably better wi NIN or Ministry, Fear Factory.
brasil? k👌kkkkk
"FEAR NOT! FOR I AM WITH YOU!!"  Throw that "gat" in the river, stop listening to Satanic messages, inSUUURTTEED N Da MIIINNNDDD, of innocent men. Stop killing yourself, and accept your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!!  Seriously. Demons write these songs by infiltrating these Mens minds! And then make them think they are happy for doing it?  Would you believe me if I told you some of them don't even actually feel happiness, in their body and mind? They just THINK they do!!  Ever heard of bypassing a circuit? Anyway, if you dismiss what has just been read, maybe pause the song, then reread, or question if there isn't a literal "stonewall"(before that is triggered, think!!! think!!! wake up!!! you have a chance in accepting Jesus Christ!!) in "your mind that is blocking this message from reaching "you.   Just so you know, demon, Jesus Christ offers you savior too. Please became a Lamb of Jesus Christ! These men and women were NOT meant to be YOUR "toys", to "play" with. Wait... did a demon just get triggered too?!?!  Do "yourself a favor, and turn to Jesus Christ, with all of your being, no, not "your "toys" heart and tears! Those do not belong to "you." You have to stand alone, turn YOUR back on YOUR oppressor, and accept MY AND EVERY MAN AND WOMANS LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIst, the Son of God. Notice that capital G. I know you know what that means. stop "thinking" that you are YOUR God, god. Don't fool yourself. Turn your back on the devil, RIGHT NOW, and accept God's will, and accept his son, Jesus Christ, the Lord of all Lord's, and King of any and every King.  Do you notice capital letters, man of God? Do YOU notice capital letters you, inhuman? My savior, Jesus Christ has a place for you! Become a Lamb of Jesus Christ, and throw away your horns, and strange eyes. SAVE YOURSELF!!! And in turn free those you have placed in bandage for YOUR enemy, my enemy, and the enemy of my Savior, the Lord of all Lord's, King of all Kings, Jesus Christ.  DO YOU notice capital letters? Wake up, and turn your back on the Devil.  I wonder what happened to this intelligent, handsome, young Man!!!

this song is fucking good
I don’t know why, but today seemed like a good day to play this about six times in a row.
I listen to a pretty hefty amount of rather heavy music, but I must say that 1:24 is one of the coolest drops. So well executed.

Ghostemane's music is the love of my life. I'm 24 and nothing ever hit so well until a few years ago when I started listening to his songs. Exactly the type of shit I wanna hear all day every day ❤
If you watch the Kreep Street video then watch this it’s actually amazing how much he’s changed.
I guess the statement of the video is clearly: Fuck Disney and its conformist World
This is like Industrial, Trap, Metal, Hardcore, I Love it!!! 🙂

Kinda crap...
This feels like the intro to a song. I was waiting for it to start the whole time haha
Ahh... this is the Millennial Slip Knot. I cant wait until they come out with their; "Wholefoods hot-bar is not open" single.
AAAAHHHH🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Wow!!
333🖤
crash test dummies was already taken
TO ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING GHOSTMANE INVENTED HIS OWN GENRE, YOU PROBABLY WEREN'T ALIVE WHEN NUMETAL CAME OUT. korn papa roach limp bizkit just a few examples that incorporated "metal" into "hip hop" (even though this isn't either of those genres) yes its a banger but you all seem to think ghostmane just imagined the genre and it came to life. Google the word "inspiration", it will make you all seem a hell of a lot less fucking dumb.
wow nice
where the hell this gem been hiding?
Fucking Wicked. 🤘🖤
lmfao what in the fucking hell is this garbage?  Is this supposed to be music?
WOW ⚔🔥😱🔉💀‼‼
When he whispers it sounds like static-x
🖤
ghostemane: how much blood? poppy: all of it.
Hard to the bone. My style somebodyn has to too many have the guts to gontherm
ghostemane: AAAAAAAAAA yo: *llora *
No les pasa que ✨ Ghostermane ✨

WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE THAT LMFAO
na.to/snapxhotekfjj        Ecco un vivido esempio delle tendenze moderne: la moderna metodologia di sviluppo contribuisce alla preparazione e all'attuazione della fattibilita economica delle decisioni. Il percorso verso un progetto nazionale socialmente orientato e una tappa qualitativamente nuova nel progresso della comunita professionale.Cosi come la costante crescita quantitativa e la portata della nostra attivita predeterminano l'elevata domanda di un sistema di partecipazione di massa. E difficile dire perche le azioni dei rappresentanti dell'opposizione saranno soggette ad anatema socialdemocratico.. 一般的に信じられているように、インターネット分析に基づいてなされた結論は、機能的に独立した要素に分けられます。既存の理論は、感情よりも精神を優先する可能性について語っています。 行動の主要なシナリオを考慮に入れて、社会志向の国家プロジェクトに向けたコースは、社会によって設定されたタスクに十分な機会を提供します。現代の技術は、幅広い資産との協議が既存の財政的および行政的条件の形成への幅広い（専門家）参加を提供するようなレベルに達しています。

This sounds like the soundtrack to a snuff film.
No sé que dice pero todo el tiempo tiene razón ❤️✨

hi gise
this is Edward Scissorhands going to a Limp Bizkit concert and asking Wes Borland out on a date.
since the beginning he was like a metal singer making trap, this seems like his natural evolution
Hino

And even God herself has fewer plans than me But she never helps me out with my scams for free, though She grabs a stick and then she points it at me When I say nothing, I say everything Yeah, when I say nothing, I say everything They threw me down in a lazaretto Born rottin', bored rotten Making models of people I used to know Out of coffee and cotton And all of my illegitimate kids have begotten Thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nothing Quarantined on the Isle Of Man And I'm trying to escape any way that I can, oh Any way that I can, oh
Jack White also released a song titled "Lazaretto", but 2014...(wow has it really been that long) and do you know what album that single was from? Yup Lazaretto was also the title of the 2014 album...

BIH TF OK
TELL EM
evolving  as an artist for sure !♤♤♧♧
that's was gay
My intestine just vibrated
There is some serious Prodgy influence here.
Think he sounds better doing this than rapping. Just my opinion
Man I've been low-key into Ghostemane for a while now but this is some next level shit. Holy crap. He takes everything good about the '90s and the '00s, gets rid of all of the crap, and blends it all together into a beautifully disgusting mess. I love it. This speaks to my soul.
La sangre de cristo tiene poder

I feel bad for the people barely finding about Eric. He's an artists that you'd have to been listening too since his starting point to see how he's actually evolved as a person and artist.

I came here prepared to shit on this, and was v impressed production quality on point!
Кстати круто что он развивается. Хотя очень много моментов не оправдывают ожиданий (например дроп после такой читки), вообщем флоу начинает звучать уместно. Но... НО блять, этот ебучий басс, он же действительно звучит как пердеж - причем ни тот который получается от дисторшна, а буквально как семпл пердежа из вк

I swear the whispered "show me the way" lyric is sung by the ghost of Wayne Static.
Sounds a lot like Mindless Self Indulgence, to me.
Ghostmane actually doing what I wish he would always do, and turn his aesthetic into sound
It's ok.

I think if ghostemane makes a horror movie, he wins a record . Creo que si ghostemane hace una pelicula de terror sería la mejor XD.
After Nu-Metal metal was really stagnant. This is the direction metal needed to take.
😈
industrial metal. been done. yawn.
Slowly starting to like this guy more and more
Great video. Love your style.
Has anyone ever heard of the band Training for Utopia?  "metal" band from early 2000s that got lumped in with "conventional" (at the time) metal bands, but really sounds VERY relevant now.  I'm impressed with what Ghostemane is doing, but it/ he reminds of my Training For Utopia (although the certainly have their differences - but similarities, too).
Qual a origem da palavra lazarento?
Is this a band or is only the vocalist Ghostemane?
*Music: lazzareto* *Brazilians: lazarento*
A lot of people doesnt know this but the dream of Ghosti was having a metal band...now its not a dream, its true
Wasn’t this the name of a jack white song .
Le clip... wahou 😱🖤🖤
Ghostemane: always singing about "IMMA KILLE MYSELF" and stuff. fans: BRO DONT KILL YASELLF
we shoulda never let hardcore kids rap...
Whoa. Code orange is getting weird.
Omg! This is what I wont to hear!!! Ghoste stay be Better!
so so so good
I discovered him through Corpse (on spotify) and I'm so glad this was the song that introduced me to him because I fucking love it
too many stuff wants to happen but they do not
CENOBITE MICKEY  aprobes.
A$AP ROCKY?????
Te amooo♥️♥️
Cool
Now i feel good for listen this song
You know a ghoste song is quality before even listening when the russian fans are loving it.
https://youtu.be/xShoSeLbTkg
Ooooooooooh!!!!!!!!!🔥🌋💥
Rob Zombie approves... That bass is filth
He literally makes Breakdown music
Um I went from artists like Pink, to artists like drake and a boogie with a hoodie, to artists like t3relemento and Christian nodal, to bad bunny and jbalvin, to Melanie Martinez, to this...

Ахуенно
am i the only person who likes the older stuff better? this just reminds me of early 2000s numetal rap shit. feels forced.
When nu metal, Industrial and deathcore meet trap
Best ablum for 2020 for sure
Si antes la música de Ghostemane me excitaba ahora los vídeo clips me producen orgasmos
чепуха...такое ощущение...что дальша видео гавна и своих раних трэков пацан не прыгнет.
I just wish one day GHOSTEMANE would scream me to sleep 😴🖤

Where is Ghostemane?
This song makes me want to bring a mattress to a pillow fight

(Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, to find I'm all alone Oh no, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all the pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid (Not good enough, not good enough) (Not good enough, not good eno-)  [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up?

its the frequent beat drops and whispering that always gets me hype
Arruma esses dentes
When I heard bonesaw, I thought ghoste could totally make a metal song...now I find this, which is pretty damn close. Rock on ghoste 👻 🤘
Es increíble la capacidad que tiene el ser humano como para tomar un género que ya es una mierda (Black metal) y empeorarlo mezclandolo con trap y electrónica medio ciber punk o industrial. Prefiero machacar e los dedos con un martillo, antes que escuchar esta mierda de nuevo.
His music has always brought me some kind of comfort, seeing him grow into his new form is also so fucking dope. This man is a real one and there's no one in the music industry at least I know of who comes close to ghostemane. Thank you for giving us weird kids  who have no one and who were uncomfortable in our skin a feeling of release through your music.
my new favorite song <3
Checking that I can't stop loving their music and they are really so aaaa They drive me crazy xD ✨🖤🔥 I love him amo

lowkey tricking trap listeners into becoming metalheads
Amazing!!
I think I like this even more than the Russians do
The best rock metal ever! Best regards for you Ghostemane from Latvia, you are the best rock artist ever, I like you, thank you so much for everything your songs 👍👍👍👍👍
00:45 BEST FLOW HEARD FROM GHOSTMANE  IF HE USE THIS FLOW OFTEN 🎇🎇🎇
If I'm gonna like it.. I gotta believe it.. the bang of fake ass phase jumpers offa this is sad.
🇮🇷❤️🇺🇸
Teacher: why you dont go to bathroom? The boys:
Oh my fucking god!!! Keep it going pleeeewaassee

😨💔
Noss evolui pra krl acompanhei ele a 2 anos ele tá com uma pegada mais punk rock agr
ESTO SI QUE ES MUSICA
You can tell ghostmane is trying to get into the youtube's algorithm when he puts mickey mouse in the video.
Dude usually i listen to lil peep and jon bellion and stuff but this just hits too hard
I think i know where he’s going when he dies.
Uff, que flow 🔥
Korn's child.

Это что, инди рок?

Se giochi a Lazaretto, t'arriva nel retto. Cit
No words.... apart from wow 😯😯
Not long enough x.z
omg demora a lança mas quando lança se ta doido algum brasileiro fa de ghost?
whose line is it anyway
Lazzaretto is basically the Italian term used to describe the place where people where quarantined during the period of the Black Plague. If you visit Venice, (I live in there, it is a mess) there's an island disposed as such. It is really beautiful, but that place has a really grim aura when you visit it. Still there's no guardian keeping the place in order, it is said there are restless ghosts around that place.
Director : poppy...  👀
What the hell happened to him yo
wait what happened here
GG ghostlemane

В натуре чётко

*dates poppy for six months* *this happens*
Trap Metal good mix
Somebody knows what type of music this is????
Anti-Icon is that kind of playlist that makes you think you will hear horror rap and then trick and hypnotize you into loving metal.         fyi: it worked, now I really like metal goddammit!
Fans of horror rap: Okay, let’s listen to this playlist, shall we. Also them after listening to the whole playlist: Okay nice, but why do I suddenly like metal music?
Well who hurt u man u are monater or what man
🇲🇽
Yo wtf just happened       That was dope as hell
I was listening to rap a month ago I swear.....
GHOSTKNOT.   OR...  SLIPGHOST?
cringe
Who's still watching in October?

I love how he is embracing his style. Couldn't be more impressed with Anti-Icon
Rap + Rock = 💩
I never thought that i'd live enough time to listen trap and heavy metal at the same time
trap, rap, rock, metal, screamo, electronic, madness....
Coca cola espuma

so um...i can see how the video might be interesting but where is the musical talent here? i'm sure there's someone out there that will be more than thrilled to inform on this?!?
"Ghostemane is influenced by Southern rap groups such as Outkast " Wikipedia :DDDD
Nice bro

As a metalhead, this tickles my pickle.

[Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, to find I'm all alone Oh no, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid (Not good enough, not good enough) (Not good enough, not good eno-)  [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Outro] (Don't let the pain do you in)
the video looks like a scene of outlast
From Memphis hip hop to nu-metal. Love it.

If you are thinking you are psycho then i think its a good way to open this link.                    ForoGore.com
GHOSTEMANE looks like Lucius Malfoy after 10 years in Azkaban.
damn boiiii
Insane video. I'm here waiting for Anti-Icon to come out today!
🖤
LANÇA ANTI-ICON NUNCA?🤠👌
Is it just me or does anyone else thing ghostemane is becoming mainstream?
Lazaretto é teu pai
I'm kind of sad it dont sound like rap so much, but this is still good .
"Ты втираешь мне какую-то дичь, но меня прёт"
Metal 😎😎😎
Sounds a LOT like early Korn albums....with some electro glitch sounds. That dudes vocals are Jonathan Davies.
Это будто рок метал и реп ()
Buenardo
Завтра будет жарко 21.10.20
I mean, okay
We need an encore for this!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
re capo el fantasmita
This is hella fire
Everytime I want to feel needed I just think about ghostemanes band that has to pretend they are playing the guitar 😂
У меня соседка бабка которая верит что такая музыка это музыка дьявола. Кажется я знаю как можно развлечь себя))
I wasn't sure about Ghostemane at first but I have to admit his music definitely grows on you 🖕😎🔫🚬
It's actually laughable how trash this shit is. Like wtf....
This shit fuckin fire
Im here

I’m not a fan of rap metal anymore, and even though half this shit sounds good the other half is kind of shit. Rap metal was sick as fuck in the 90s.....now it blows. This is just my opinion, and it’s correct as fuck.
Wow!!! Yesss!
че пацаны, как вам новый стафчик от народного артиста российской федерации?
des français ?
What is not to like about Ghostemane???
PESO... VISSSHHH
I LOVE SONG
the first time I heard this song I didn't like it......................Now I cant stop to say uh uh uh
The 90's Limpbiztik 😈🤫🤘
Cool visuals and Ghoste rocking a sweet look ...but, ...., the music factor is lacking for me.   At this point it's just a shock factor and fancy production for guaranteed views.  I like some of his stuff and style but ima have to listen to this one a lot more for it to grow on me.
The new year
An eu sou homen mais eu acho o Ghostemane muto bonito kskzkzkzkz <3

This sucks. Sounds like early 2000s emo music with bad computer beats on it. Nu Metal and Rap rock is dead.
Can be please, on less rap, more METAL!
Less than a week away
I see why they had to make this video an ad
I’m mainly a metal listener but I love the way in many songs he mixes it
I never liked this type of music but this slaps..

Brabo pra krlh🔥🔥
A lot of people don’t get this type on of music and I’d just say screw them I love Ghostemane and I love the people who love him as well to me this sounds like rock, medal, screamo and rap I just don’t know what genre it’s in can someone tell me

This the new vein track?
👌🏻
I take he didn't like Mickey mouse

Че пацаны, ню металкор?
You full cenobite.. you're never supposed to go full cenobite.

this song is alright not much replay value but still a good song
Ghostemane Don't sing about death and that you're dead because you don't have a pulse because death will get you too soon
This is the sound I need in my life.
Metal resurfaces in a modern form, and will always do.
If you watch the video closely this is a Disney sponsor
I am Mexican and I like it
ты чертовски талантлив ghoste, like fr ♡︎♡︎
Hey

(Posting these for myself, but if you benefit by all means) [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not good enough, not good enough) (Not good enough, not good eno-)  [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up?

Don't let the pain do you in.
Вот, оригинальный текст, Гост на самом деле писал на русском   [Припев]  Я не знаю с чего начать, я думаю, что я (В нескольких минутах ходьбы) От всего, что рушится вокруг меня, так что (Покажи мне путь) Из глубины, теперь моя спина (Кланяясь от боли) Я мог бы прыгать с пистолетом, я мог бы прыгать с пистолетом, я мог бы прыгать (О нет, позор) Где я окажусь? (Э-э-э-э) [Пост-припев]  Если я не проснусь завтра Я позволил боли сделать меня  [Куплет]  Разбуди его посреди ночи, я чувствую, что совсем один И, о, куда он пошел? Куда он делся? (Иногда я думаю, что никогда не узнаю) Говорить всю боль и все, что заставило нас ненавидеть его "Что за эго" (Думаю, мне лучше, чем я знаю)  [Флоу]  Теперь ты боишься, сейчас боишься, сейчас боишься, сейчас боишься, сейчас боишься (Недостаточно хорошо, недостаточно хорошо) (Не достаточно хорошо, не очень хорошо)  [Припев]  Я не знаю с чего начать, я думаю, что я (В нескольких минутах ходьбы) От всего, что рушится вокруг меня, так что (Покажи мне путь) Из глубины, теперь моя спина (Кланяясь от боли) Я мог бы прыгать с пистолетом, я мог бы прыгать с пистолетом, я мог бы прыгать (О нет, позор) Где я окажусь? (Э-э-э-э)  [концовка]  (Не позволяй боли причинить тебе вред)

Bruh wtf happened to Ghostmane and the ending is like child sacrifice shit using Mickey Mouse
I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it)  I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up?  (Don't let the pain do you in)

0:21beat, I've heard it before somewhere. Someone knows the song ?
Gostman

The most I like about Ghostmane is he's different doing his own thing and his music is rad too metal roots
bru hes actually ugly now im miss the OG ghostemane
Micky Mouse Obsession

Гитары черезчур грязные

E ESSA EVOLUÇÃO DO GHOSTEMANE?? MEOOO
GHOSTMANE should had kill micky with a mouse trap
Es perfecto🥺♥️
Youtube: Huh this is a rap metal song with disturbing masked figures, this doesn't look advertiser friendly... Also youtube: Oh it has mickey mouse in it, obviously this was made for kids.
What would you even call this genre, cause I need more baby!
Reporting from Vancouver, Washington, U.S.A.
Mom: go make some friends at school Kids at school:
TOOL... a perfect circle & the GHOST Should make a song toghter 👻 would be straight sick
Mickey Seem different then usually

Busco gente qué hable español
Los morros de mi edad:mi cama suena y suena   Yo:*ghosteman*

СТОП ЧТО? ГОСТМЕЙН НЕ РУССКИЙ??? А я там столько смысла слышал...
um poppy snapped in the filming wtf
I like this a lot better than his previous work this feels more natural. This is evidence that he was  metalcore vocalist that couldn’t find good band members and now it looks like he has them.
Arte en un solo video😍
Me encantó la parte que dice مرحبا انا احبك
Firee 🔥🔥
👩‍🦳
круто
❤️✔️🤩😎
Tight tight
Who else watches all his videos with a straight face lol
Ghost can we get the lyrics?

Ugh... Why are GM songs always so short? "Hits Repeat" more please
Felicidades encontraste un comentario en español
вот это частушки!
So he in a band now or what? 😂 plus I see hes changed his looks a bit looks badass
I didn’t know Jeffery star was into BDSM.
FUUUUUUCK I LOVE IT
I pulled up next to a guy at a stoplight while blasting this. He rolled his window down all the way and started yelling and thrashing around in his seat and we had a session before the light turned green. Wish all the best to that guy.
Привет. Блин если ты это прочтеш я вопще оху*ю... Ты просто топ и делаеш топовую музыку в том числе реп ну просто у меня много твоих песен в моём плейлисте мне сильно нравитса твои песни как на пример Mercury или AI и так далее. Ты очень класстный
🖤
New flash 😍💣
at this point ghostmane is a metal band. and its great
Algún peruano que le encanta esta joya de música? :v
look at the desc, *director: poppy* when you realize that his *gf:* 😊
https://youtu.be/wFYjNYNv1dU
And hear we observe the continued return to what once was considered unpure by the metal community... "neumetal." Just don't call it that...😆
Hi Ghostemane am love you music
Почему так часто пропадаешь?
Awesome
Can't wait for your next one video
Your music is getting better 👍and so are your video clips.
I LOVE GHOSTEMANE ❤️😻😻😻🤩🤩
пиздец, хочу совместный рок альбом фары и госта
Ля
Seems like Mickey didn't have the right mousekatool for the job.
Заходиш такой в Канализацию к черепашкам ниндзя Пиццы похавать, а там гоуст трек ебашит
Hold on sleep cannot
Если бы ghostemane фитанул бы с sagath и overlust в одном треке ,то было бы саябись)))))
Hey Bro
Why am I getting massive 2005 korn vibes here?
Музыка,которую мы заслужили!
Клипы теряют свою сочность без постоянного поправления волос
0:52 to 1:03 is super fucking unsettling and i love it
0:19 Waylon Reavis from mushroomhead in 2007
*my mom when i don't fill the water bottles
Si o no??
Yo soy mexicano y me gusta la música aunque no entiendo mucho pero viva, GHOSTEMANE!!!
Poppy directed this!
Não achei comentários brasileiro então aqui ó meu 🤭

Сука вроде должна быть страшная локация . Но все так чисто и прибрано . У меня в подъезде  страшнее . Отвечаю если бы он снял этот клип у меня в подъезде ну или школе , он бы залетел шо бан .
Беспонтовые нескладушки, так себе.
Nice
my favourite artist & my guilty pleasure are most certainly a thing and this video, as well as Poppy's metal transgression, definitely shows. can't wait to see Ghostemane's new album and how the relationship will show in Poppy's upcoming music
i just give the russian comments a like even tho i have no idea what there saying
Nooo don't kill Mickey, those were the best videos
Nice 👌🤟
How could I order a hard copy
Will never understand the dislikes on this.
Reloko
This song needs to be a couple years longer.. thank you! Fuckin awesome. Peace
Fucking insane
Fuck yeah!🤘🏻
Why are there so many Russians on here? No offense...
Mickey?
Directed by Poppy 😍😍😍😍
Digging these djent/deathcore vibes
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS FIRE WTF
🖤
Хотелось бы услышать Гостмейна и Скарлорда
GHOSTEMANE should make a song with Trent Reznor or Corey Taylor.
Shit too fye
This is like despacito but for Russian gopniks
Русскоговорящим салам, остальным соболезную
Us esta super
Crazy video!
are there any other girls here that listed to ghostmane 🥺🥺
Me: Yeah! New track from ghosty! Meantime Ghostemane runs from Mickey mouse in canalisation...

ASCO METAL Y TRAP
Schrecklich
Yes more of this!!!
Damn I love it 😍😍😍😍
Que rola más buena, pisado más guapo :3
ROCK AGAIN IN POPULAR!
oh no mickey mouse bleed
Anything that pushes back the idea that to create music you actually have to PLAY INSTRUMENTS with some mates is a big up for me. Well done Ghostemane
Sei cattivissimo
Lowkey put references towards the creator he didn't think was there last few years it sounds like? Did the Carnival reveal something to you Ghoste? Scholars boggle at the mind of Juggalos...
Linda cancion😍😍😍😍
Отличное развитие событий, вырос как артист, очень бодрящее звучание, до мурашек!! Спасибо, продолжай!!!
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Shortest metal song I ever heard, still fire tho

Poor Mickey. All he wanted to do was play with Ghostemane :(
mushroomhead vibes
Sos un capo 🦉
This don’t sound like rap anymore. It sounds like dark industrial nu metal. And I love everything about it
Collab with korn PLEASE
If Machine Gun Kelly and Edward Scissor Hands had a baby.
Metal bender 🖤
I love this so much
Here before tiktok ruins this
i love how he incorporates nihilist type music fuckkkk nut
Ghostemane should collab with Mushroomhead that would be killer
Балдёжжж
Not one of his best

Папочка зол

He looks like an extreme emo phase Jeffrey star
Did Mickey Mouse approve of this?
This song leaves me wanting more
This better not be a sub frfr bro! You know the mob gunz Micky mouse and you started when I did so lmk what's good?!
Едвард руки_ножницы решил закосить под Мэнсона
Producer: So how much beat do you want? Ghostemane: Yes

Ghostemane el grande :3
لمغربي يبان هنا
爽
Why did I think that was Jeffrey star?
Заебисъ
the meanest
me: reject playing blue whale 7 days later: 0:56
im a fan of 80's/90's/00's industrial, ebm, metal / alternative & have really only been introduced to ghostemane since his latest couple of releases, but i really like this direction hes taking, as it is fully reminiscent of those genres & that time. itd be awesome to see where he evolves to & if he does turn rap/trap kiddies onto metal & industrial stuffs.  new fan. im super keen to see where they go/he goes from here.
Жизнь поматала
Damn it i wish y'alls videos where 2x longer. 😩 love wat y'all do 🤘🤘
Amerikans-New track!Cool!I love ghostemane) Russians-Zaebis',Oxyeno

There is so much message in this video. Hes getting chased by Micky Mouse because he is always associated with these Disneyvideos and he wants to let this image die so he hangs Micky Mouse and kills him to do his own thing. Idk that´s my opinion on it.
Bien suavecito, e escuchado canciones mas potentes

Ghostemane: it's time to change nu metal rules
Чёт мне старый стиль больше по душе был,а щас просто шум,но всё равно чекаю его обновления..
We all agree that Ghostemane is bringing out too many good subjects? 😻
I'm minding my own business one sunny afternoon and YouTube drops me dead center into someone's f'd up nightmare
OMG OMG
What a joke compared to Prxject lol
He majored in astrophysicist. But I’m happy he does this instead
goddamn this slaps
Not my type of music at all😶
Heavens gate gots the best punch
Rap shit better g ghost mane is sick but dang g to much head bangin
Ghostmane - "I'm going to modernize nu-metal!"   Me- You are BMTH meets trap/mumble rap...but  you get paid in hot topic gift cards.
slipkont vibes
🤘🏻🖤
Ghostmane will one day be crowned as a great keeper of peace between Americans and Russians.
GHOSTMANE AND POPPY COLLABORATION PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This has a Mudvayne feel to it. Definitely with the Whispering parts. I'm a metalhead. I've been a metalhead for over a decade. I'm mostly into Technical death metal and dsbm, but I love Ghostmane to. I've been listening to him since 2018.
ghostemane runs with mickey mouse in the sewers. It's so cute: 3
Не шедевр конечно
НЕПОН. А ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МАЛО ЛАЙКОВ И ПРОСМОТРОВ? ААААА??
Блииин это шикарно)
Ghostemane: ALJKSKLDJALSJKDKLASJDKLKALSJDKLJSDLÑJA Fans (yo): Poético

Насколько же охрененный альбом выходит...
The album isn’t even a available in Canada...bruh why?
Y’a des français ici ?
Круто, что Ghostmane стал делать такое метальное звучание. 🔥🔥🔥
KILLED IT
Im christian, can i listen to these type of songs? What about IC3PEAK?
Огонь 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
production value off the charts. Good for you Ghost. "quality over quantity".
Agora é rock? Ou ainda é trap?
наш! славянский реп! решил черепашкам ниндзя концерт устроить
хорошая работа,всегда на высоте.
When Ghostemane's Mickey Mouse animation videos gets real
Anyone else see the "director - poppy"? That's fucking amazing , love them
As soon as I heard the drums at the beginning I fucking knew this would be amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wow i love the song 🤘🤘🤘
Wanna see a vid of the disney legal battles 🤣🤣🤣
That's it?
Mickey Mouse been popping to many pills and smoking dat meth.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Re bueno maan Puede ser paaa, simon re bueno el tema
I showed this to my Iguana..        Now its a dinosaur
The ending of the song from the breakdown onwards reminds me of  Chelsea Grin - Recreant This makes me very happy indeed 😂
Imagine this: we are talking about russians how they are always lissening to ghostemane but imagine if they are actually talking the same about us americans/europeans
😍😍😍😍
In Soviet Russia, Metalcore plays you.
Let's see this guy do some prodigy covers

Is it the same band that was touring with Poppy too? Are they going to start touring together?!? I am getting insanely excited by these two.
Stick to hip hop man..
This is fucking fire. Poppy produced the video too? This is good. She needs to hop on one of his songs. Having her in the background just being herself would fit so damn well with this. Please 🙏.
Every time he whispers in his song I get CHILLS I STG

Pure art my king and queen
I wish I could talk to Ghostemane one time.. I have so many questions
Vein definitely rubbed off on him for this track. The breakdown at the end is ruthless.
This is hard as fuck dude!
ghoste: *posts music video*  russians: **его бесплатная недвижимость**
Best artist he ever collaborated with was DjKillaC and that’s straight faxxxx 🔥
Bad edit is noob
I fucking love this.
lazarento
Oh I bet he's a Mindless Self Indulgence fan
Emo music sure has changed

Ghoste sing deathcore better than deathcore bands
wow wow wow <3
Brasil
My speakers are bouncing up and down right now
People : GHOSTEMANE IS SCARY Micky Mouse : hold my beer
I guess rap didn't work out for him
Раньше нормально качало его музло, а сейчас вторичное говно делает, я это слышал в начале 00-х. Короче, сдулся ваш арлекин.
wh cums Prodigy ft GHOSTEMANE

You don’t have a single million in your bank account to make mention of millionaires in your songs consequence free.   “In the hollow of worship” needs to be removed from every platform by the 29th of November.   You don’t live consequence free as someone who isn’t a millionaire when you’ve made mention of a L***F*R a millionaire just to compensate for how unintelligent you are.

I snuck out to one of his concerts and my mom found me and walked into the concert and walked right out 😂
Hablo español y no me gusto
[Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not good enough, not good enough) (Not good enough, not good eno-)

Parece que o Mickey se revoltou contra o Eric
Как раз искала, что на будильник поставить. Теперь вставать будет весь дом
Fucking amazing
I imagined if Ghost and Мanson would make a song together. The explosion, blow up my mind!)
It’s like Twiztid and Skipknot had a baby and the baby would be awesome if he wasn’t always trying too hard to convince everyone he’s so scary.
Mmmmm 🖤
🖤 🖤🖤🖤🖤

LYRICS: [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not good enough, not good enough) (Not good enough, not good eno-)  [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Outro] (Don't let the pain do you in)

Ghostemane's music went from dope, dark, gloomy vibes to Powerman 5000 meets Suicide Boys.

Perfeitoooo
alguien habla español? xd
Wtf very much Russian people
La concha no hay nadie en español?
Ghostemane, I know im a day late but I wanted to give you all my support and to let you know that I needed to hear this and see this to get through a really hard time in my life,  and its crazy you have shown up when I really needed it and had nobody, not even my own family. Honestly, your work has impacted me and given me an outlet when I had nowhere else to go. I suffer from PTSD, anxiety, crippling depression and ive never ever been able to freely talk about this but from the bottom of my heart you are my hero. You saved me from a dark place, you helped me realize I am never alone, and that its okay to express how you feel. For so long I was critised into thinking it was bad to feel negative feelings and never was able to emotio ally connect to others. I relate to feeling numb and dissassociating and I feel like you send amazing messages that only those know just know. You have come so far and don't ever stop. Your music helps keep me going, and you really have brought a new meaning into my life I have been missing and thats to truly be yourself. I love the realness of it. So thank you, and keep making BANGERS MY DUDE. Also congrats on being engaged to Poppy, she is amazing and everything you and her deserve.

Ghostemane lazarento
Ya no queda nada del verdadero sonido Ghostemane, que decepción. Esta es una canción mas del montón, hay miles que suenan igual, que no cambie y siga con el estilo que lo destacó. Mucha sangre, cuchillos y cuero, pero no veo a Ghostemane.

El ghostemane me da miedo ja
Ghostemane está passando por uma grande revolução na música dele, não que não fosse esperado, aqueles singles de metal, não me enganam, o negócio dele é metal.. mas honestamente, gostava do trap, prevejo uma grande mudança no estilo musical dele.. talvez não veremos mais músicas como Andromeda ou Mercury mais, uma pena, boa sorte com sua nova empreitada!
My neck is broken 🔥🖤

This was his plan the whole time. Get famous by rapping so he can do whatever kind of music he want for example this industrial/nu metal
The intricacy of this song and evolution of Ghostemane is absolutely incredible and I love it
Buen video me sirvió mucho 👌👌RECOMENDADO:,)

Evolution in every new album
Normal people: *wtf is that, I'm not gonna sleep after that*  Me:  *a good song to relax*
Tu música no es tan buena amaba más el trap core que la que haces ahora es como una mezcla de rock punk experimental y electro no se lo que estoy haciendo por que la gente me sigue aún a si y ganó mucho dinero

Эрик, а чё там с альбомом?
Romans 3:23-26 (KJV)  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.  John 3:16-18 (KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  Believe in your HEART on the Son of God before it's too late!!!   If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your HEART that God raised Him from the dead. You shall be SAVED!!!

It's so great to see ghoste become who he is now, to where he started with schema posse (which would have ultimately held him back) Makes me miss peep even more watching how well ghoste came out.

Nice metal background and stuff but it's still shit imho.

This gives me anxiety
Brazil is looking forward to its return.( Mg- Minas gerais)
It’s like every 5-10 years they recycle all the elements of heavy metal, repackage it, and sell the same shit to the next generation of 8th graders.

I have liked 99% of your shit Mr. Whitney. This didn't make the cut. You had the chance to make your own style and basically create your own genre of music. Now you are making 90's industrial? Not to mention it sounds terrible. What happened mane!?
The tour for this album is gonna be wild

DAMN ITS FIRE 🖤
Reminds me of the album "The Grudge" by Mortiis. September 2004. Goth/industrial rock with other influences mixed in, from a man with a black metal background. Similar aesthetic in the music videos. I was so addicted to that album. Way heavier than Mortiis had ever been. I'm getting the same vibes here. Hyped!
МЫ РУССКИЕ С НАМИ БОХ
Слушаю метал, мне зашло. Чел хорош
Why I see ghostemane-flesh in my head
I love those metal background sounds
No one : Literally not a single soul:  Mfs that skateboard: this video

By far my favorite song by you know friend! Keep up the amazing work and release those emotions into your music! I feel every bit of yourself you put into your art!

It looks like rock music escaped the USA and made refuge in Russia while the U.S. goes through it’s Mumble Rap stage
Продюсер: гост, сколько басса нужно? Гостмейн: да
This is my new god now.
Это конечно все превосходно , но я написал комментарий , чтобы добавить количество российских комментариев хахахаха
Дисней после этого клипа просто в ахуе, Гостмейну похоже придётся судится
Классно😂😁
Ahh dostum mükemmel !
Шикарен, был Гоуст ты палкой я бы побил им крапиву и принёс бы его домой.

Ghosty made a song with a Russian "trap" band known as Pharaoh, that would explain all these russian fans. The song is called Blood Oceans, it's very cool. (Sorry for bad English, I'm Italian)
2 million subscriber face reveal no makeup or anything
[Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh) [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know) [Bridge] You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it) [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? [Outro] (Don't let the pain do you in)
The Russians seem an angry bunch sometimes.
Goosebumps.
this is jeffree star boss level.
I thought this was Jeffree star lol
THIS IS AMAZING ✨💐

I Luke this Love music the GHOSTEMANE
[Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it)  [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up?  [Outro] (Don't let the pain do you in)

Wow as someone who has kinda fuced with Ghostemane for a few years I think this is by far his best song. It's more complex and way better produced. It's super chaotic but stitched together neatly. Fuck yeah
This is my new favorite ghosty song
lol
Puff es arte

Musically, I find this fairly hollow. But it could work for a movie action scene or something like that.
rip mickey mouse he did nothing wrong
Phantom
instant spinal chills
This speaks volumes to me and is metaphoric in so many ways based on what we are unveiling in this evil world including Disney!
This is pretty much Nu-Metal 2.0; elements of modern hip-hop (trap) incorporated into metal
Ghost
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ждём альбом так-то
He’s gonna be directed 37 min films that are a blend of the devil rejects with jarring music and obscurities sprinkled in. Thirty called arson on HGH and K-Holing
I LOVE 🖤
Please be careful, I hear the Turtles are having another turf war against the Shredder, wear you where filming.
Metal will always prevail. Even in dark times. 🖤

hell yeah someone finally got the creppypasta mickey from Mowgli's world.
buenardo
Я не знаю русского.  Я просто хотел вписаться.
Guitar tone just makes me think about all these 9 string, 14 string, 30 string guitar players and how they're always searching for that perfect low end sound... its not the guitar that makes that sound. Its the effects, production, amp, tuning. I feel like this track just jumped like 10 years forward from where the Stephen Carpenters of the world are right now. I mean, you can only get it so low... and bass guitars can be distorted as well totally bypassing the need for a super heavy gauge guitar string anyway.
UwU
You always serve us with these godly songs 😏
Donde quedo el trap obscuro :'o
It's weird usually associating him with hip hop artists
Fucking awesome, looks a alternative metal!! Foda pra caralho, parece um metal alternativo

Ghostemane is the best thing to happened to rap Fans from Algeria Africa
Actual Ghostemane is lame. I miss him in 2015 , when he was a Underground Beast and dropped only fire..
All the movement tho😭 I kept trynna appreciate his outfits but I could barely see them
Русских больше сдавайтесь
Fucking love this man. 💀☠️
I know most won't agree, but in my opinion his best video yet. Big fan of his more rap/industrial sounding stuff, but I love Metal and I think he has a bright (or dark) future in it.
You and poppy dating?
Where are the die-hard Ghostemane fans at.
This guy needs help, this is trash

I’m a metal fan and like some rap. But I honestly wish he went a more “To Whom It May Concern” route. He’s so much better at that style than he is in metal. This isn’t that good imo. Points for creativity but it really isn’t the best Ghoste.
His trying to hard.
y poppy lo dirigio:0   love it!!
Chale puro ruso por aquí 😔🤙🏼

Damn 🤯 This has to be the best Ghostemane song ever. The insane rollercoaster of artistic dark sounds, the extreme display of emotions, the ammount of energy kicking in multiple times throughout the development of the song and last but not least the deep-cutting lyrics....💫😳  Huge respect Ghoste, this has to be a strong 10 for me!  THIS IS PURE ART!
Trippy Mouse

I waited this song very long time
Rap so hard it accidentally turns into nu metal but it’s not really on accident only a little bit
Pog
If AI and this are just singles we get to hear from ANTI-ICON, I can't fucking wait for the rest. 🤤🔥 This is sick asf already.
Very hard song👹🔥
Ghostemane brings metalheads like me into rap and rap listeners into metal, genius
Nice.

TE AMO
Dope hito
great work eric
sorry the dislikes are from everyone within a 5 mile radius of me
if this with ai are the first and second song i cant imagine the entire album
Went from straight rap to black rap metal
GHOSTMANE:2018 LEIPZIG GERMANY   ME IN HE PIT:WE LOVE YOU ERIC  GHOSTMANE:HOW DO THEY KNOW MY FIRST NAME
Claim your 'here before the russians' ticket
I'll preface by saying i think with the direction these songs have shown him going, this album could be my favourite.  additionally, eric's standard is so high, and so many of his songs are my favorite that to say one is better than another doesnt mean any of them suck by any means.  that said, there are at least 4-5 songs off each n/o/i/s/e and hexada respectively that i like much better than this and probably AI. Neither of these releases are likely top 10 ghoste songs for me. I prefer AI to this song, although the quick 'ugh-ugh-ugh" part that shows up twice in this song is up there with my favourite bits of audio he's created.    I hope he doesnt stray too far into metal, even tho id say i might prefer metal to hip hop overall, tho barely, i think eric's strength lies in blending the two in such a unique way.  the NIN influenced songs are awesome, and eric is clearly a massive Trent fan, as am i.  I love the songs where he combines both the hip hop and metal tho, almost equally, where one isn't totally dominating the other.  Both songs are amazing, way better than nearly anything else coming out right now.   Ghostemane is arguably my favourite music project of the last few years (Nihil being one of my 5 favourite songs of the 2010s, i am so happy that song exists. seriously, thanks eric), along with POPPY funny enough, and was the case before they even started dating.  I am always chomping at the bit for anything new from eric, tho. He's probably the most consistent artist going right now, out of whom I listen to.  there are songs by others that have come out that are up there with some of his stuff, but the whole project isn't as good.  eric never misses, and even tho i have favourites i can truly listen to his last few albums from front to back and listen to his singles that didn't make the album as much as any song on the album, if not more.    So psyched to have someone exactly my age, from my generation, who has been through so much of the same psychological things i have to make music that speaks so directly to me, what i feel, how i feel it, and how i feel about feeling it.
Uuuhy idolo saludos desde argentina
Love the metal kind of taste too
The Russians are coming
Dude what a fucking BANGER🔥🔥🔥
This album is going to be fucking fire

Гост окончательно сошел с ума, но это даже лучше. Я вот вообще не любитель роцка, но он превосходно звучит от Гостмейна, в общем респект, жду антиайкон с нетерпением
Крутой Микки Маус

[Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it)  [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up?  [Outro] (Don't let the pain do you in)

Страшно
Director : POPPY
🤘🤘🤘
I can't believe Ghoste has honed his sound to this. I went to a show a couple years ago and was kinda surprised at him bringing a drummer and guitarist out for the set, because they didn't have much to do. Yet. That's around when I got excited for THIS sound.
God I love this man
Meu ídolo 🖤💅🏻
🤘🤘🤘
Birader yorumlara indikçe şaşırıyorum, sadece ben ve arkadaşım bi' Türk olarak Ghostmane dinliyoruz zannediyordum..
I love anything Ghostemane has to offer

Bet this dude doesn't even know how to make a bad song. This is hella fire🤘🔥
This song makes me wanna kill a bird by throwing it off a cliff
Matou
dou
Все русские здесь???
Is it me, but I think this could have gone harder if you took the high pitched tones and threw it straight into a deep growl.    I feel like he should explore more deeper tones and pitches and combine it with what he has rn and it would be absolutely bangin.   Just feels like something is missing.   Visual wise, knocked it outta the park. 🦇
Does anybody else love how poppy directed this, they are couple goals💓🥰🥰
My class when the teacher left:
Eu tava esperando por isso muito 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Разъёб! 🇪🇪 🤘🏻
[Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)  [Post-Chorus] If I don't wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  [Verse] Wake him in the middle of the night, I feel I'm all alone And, oh, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes, I think I'll never know) Speaking all pain and all the things that made us hate him "What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)  [Bridge] You're afraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now, 'fraid now (Not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it, not-not get it)  [Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up?  [Outro] (Don't let the pain do you in)

This tape is gonna be unreal bro🤯
te amo
Unno if  i enjoy the direction   he went  with this.. i really  enjoy  metal music  but i listen to ghostmane   cuz  he isnt  that he isnt rap or real trap music  either its  more of a fine mixture  but this  misses the mark of  his  other stuff  i guess an artist  has to evolve  and more forward   but  its  a sound  i can  say i have heard. This almost  sounds   like  mushroomheads  music
Russia and Italy love you bratan 🤟
This is the cat's pajamas man its the bee's knees

I don’t know where to begin i think i’m Moments away From everything crumbling all around me so Show me the way Out of the deep end Now my back is Bowing in pain I might be jumping the gun i might be jumping the gun i might be jumping Oh no, the shame Where will i end up?  If i don’t wake up tomorrow I let the pain do me in  Wake up in the middle of the night to find in all alone Oh no, where did he go? where did he go?  Sometimes i think i’ll never know  Speaking of all pain And all the thangs that made us hate him “what an ego”  I guess i’m better off than i know  I don’t know where to begin i think i’m Moments away From everything crumbling all around me so Show me the way Out of the deep end Now my back is Bowing in pain I might be jumping the gun i might be jumping the gun i might be jumping Oh no, the shame Where will i end up?  Don’t let the pain do you in

[Chorus] I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away) From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way) Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain) I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame) Where will I end up?
