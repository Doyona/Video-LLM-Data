For the love of bikes !!!
That motorcycle is fucking insane. Damnnn
I love Indians
How the hell did he take of that sunglass with so ease?
AMMAR IS AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING HUMAN
So cool
I didn’t know the where friends with and lmp1 driver
But he didn’t tell him that it was a loan.. I did hear that.. right .. a loan of a bike ?? I’d love someone to tell me I’m wrong and misheard.. but don’t bull crap me.. I need the truth.,, I can handle the truth
not gonna lie but thomas need the lightmode helmet
Now: 145k views            145k subs
Getting a license in the US is a big frigging joke anyway, so he will have no trouble getting it.
Indian Bikes... you need to be in the Philippines where the traffic is hell and  millions are shifting to bikes for convenience.
WHAT! LOL! I would love to ride that bike too! Sooo sexy bike! Happy Birthday Thomas!!!
Wtf is up with amars hair
1:22 is that the girl from the blind date?
Such an awsome bike dude❤
Ammar is such a good friend. Where is Matt by the way?
Ammar said they are loaning the bike. Is that mean its not for him to keep? Wont he will be sad when he find out?
Friends with an LMP1 driver. Wow
Wow that bike 😍😍😍
What's the name of the bike?
I love it how Ammar is actually as excited as Thomas just because he's surprising him and also just love how pure the whole reaction is.
Where is Matt????
Matt

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

Wow
Where is Matt?
My dream is to get a macbook Pro

As a motorcycle lover that's the best gift man. OMG 😍😍
Few Days Later:  Mr.Beast buying Thomas an Island so that he can ride his bike without license.
True friends
welcome to the club bud!
I feel there’s a lot of motorcyclists in the yes theory community, and it would be the most amazing thing to set up the First Yes Theory Bike Ride sometime with Thomas leading the pack!! 🧡
Indian Motorcycles... DREAM!!
Drive safe ma dude !!
That is such an awesome bike I plan on buying one when I wear out my current bike.
10/10 on removing the glasses
https://youtu.be/oTGYa5nbMwM🔥🔥🤣
Where is Matt??
Trending here in the Philippines 🇵🇭   Love,  Philippines ❤️❤️
This is day 1 of trying to talk to and meet Yes Theory by just commenting, and tweeting
Ammar is literally THE SWEETEST
Sweet ride Thomas!!!!
i hope he's an experienced rider already. Yes, some people can start riding with a 1200cc motorbike, but it is HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED. Especially an Indian FTR 1200.......
Ugh you guys are so wholesome and cute, I wish I could have friends like you
WOW!!!
Hope Everyone is having a great day! Just need 77 more subs to reach my goal!
I am ready for Ammar’s surprise video....
I’m so confused cause I thought all you guys lived in the Yes House 😂
Woahh this got on Trending and the video on your main channel didn't??
beautiful
I’m a simple guy I see a yes theory video and I like it
can someone please help me? ive ordered the same shirt thomas wears in this video but im still not sure if i chose the right size. Usually i wear L (im from Italy) but the last seek discomfort shirt ive ordered was way to big so this time ive chosen an M. But after some research it looks like the sizes are different from product to product and im very confused
I love you
Hi my name is thomas too and i am a leo
I cant be the only who is smiling like an idiot lol
so the gift is they rented a bike for him. lame
Does he know how to ride? Because I wouldn't suggest learning on that nice bike.
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have a great day.
The 1% who read this comment I pray you become successful in life🧡🧡
What an awesome gift!! Can’t wait to see it in action 🏍

*Now that's HOooOooOT*
Belated Happy Birthday Thomas! Lucky Birthday Boy. Such wonderful and supporting friends. I wish my friends were like this. BTW Where's Matt? Nowadays, he is nowhere to be seen.
Love it!!!
It`s a indian scrambler ftr 1200 ----- * flighs away*
_Indian FTR 1200_ 🔥🤩
Ammar is the friend we all need but we don't deserve 😂
That's so awesome!;
Is that lexi limitless in the background ?
So wait is it his or did they only loan it to him?
Who is that girl?
Where is Matt?
These videos and their friendship melts my heart
Binod
Wait what were the first 2 parts of his bd gift?
Happy birthday brother
Anyone heard of Binod 🔥🔥🔥
Why are you saying its his when you said they are loaning him the bike ... So its not actually his bike...
The Bike goes :"brrrrrr"
Happy birthday thomas💙
I'm so annoyed that they don't wear masks.
Petition to get Derin back
my birthday is on 10th of october!! And I have the license already, just short on $$ :DD no pressure but I'd like  a suprise like this
Didn't know Thomas was a fellow man of culture 😶👏🏽👏🏽
BINOD
Not gonna lie he aint getting respect in the biking community cuz of that indian. Harleys and Hondas get more respect. 😂😂🙌❤
where is matt
You need a license in the USA xD wauw who knew they had rules hahaha the USA has become more of a lawless banana republic hahah
I'm not a car or a motorcycle guy, but goddamn did that bike give me a boner.
This is so wholesome I can't deal
His reaction is sooo priceless
This is called "Jumping the Shark" - Yes Theory I love you guys, so take it for what it is worth: You're hitting the sellout point, please walk the line with integrity. I hope your videos don't continue in this vein of advertising...bless <3
where is matt guys! im confused
Omg this is sick, also crazy that not a lot of people have watched this. I feel like this extension off of Yes Theory is SICK I love it! Hopefully more people subscribe.
There's no way you get a motorcycle and you are going to wait for DL. He must have driven it off camera.
So you support BLM but don’t give a fuck about native peoples? My people are not a logo/brand! We are alive & we are being erased!!!
Huhu my dream 😞
He needs a fab28 on that bike! Hmu boys. Let's do something!
Where is Matt?
Did they actually buy it or just rent it ?
Why you ruin the suprise in the title :(
Nyet
I spent 2 hours finding the location of your house 1:06 and other vids were my clues
How tf did he take of Thomas’s sunglasses so smoothly.
Woo hoo
yo was Ammar holding a stizy at the end
i reallyy realllyyy hopee they suprise ammar with even better things man... that guy deservess some intense amount of happiness by now
God I would kill to have mates like these guys. They all seem to have such a genuine love for each other. Its so positive.
bro these guys inspired me to start my animation channel
Wow!
where's matt???
I want to see his face when they tell him it's only rented 😅
Wear masks please, I had more faith in you guys ☹️
please post a follow up once he gets his license!
🏍️🔥 Hi boooys! We are Italy's best motorcycle riding school and we'd love to invite Thomas and all of you to our classes! We've been following your inspiring work for the last two years and it's awesome to find out we share not only a mentality but also a passion.  Get in touch if riding a bike inside one of Italy's wonderful tracks with a professional rider teaching you how to do it is enough discomfort to seek!  Here's our website: www.PortamiinPista.it Email: info@portamiinpista.it Phone: +39 3280562328
Wait thomas in not living in yes house these days
Love the love😍 would love to visit yeslandia🤩 you guys have such great energy thanks so much for sharing😁
IDEA: Yes Theory starts their own country so that Thomas can ride his bike without waiting for the license.
Jealous
Does he get to keep the bike...?
No one else gonna mention how hot Thomas’s girl is?
Where's matty poo
I need friends like these haha
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THOMAS!!!!🥳🇵🇭
i know the feeling of getting a new bike (two wheels down thomas) ride safe
Make a video of him getting ready to take his test!
Soooo.. Wheres matt?
It's amazing how much I love this guys jaja regards from the city that makes Pacifico Beer 🇲🇽
BE CAREFUL THOMAS. Please wear a jacket and helmet at all times I'm only 18 and personally know 2 people have died on those things. They seem super fun but even if you are the best driver ever a car can always cut you off
So I really had to go to a whole other channel for 3 minutes that could of easily been put on to the original video?
only 2:56 minutes video☹️
Why would you dislike the video?
That is a gorgeous piece of machinery!
Thomas will die on that motorcycle in 13 months
Where do I sign up to get surprised like this?
I have a Yamaha mt-125 and watching this just made my mouth water
Some Constructive feedback :) could you try feather the outlines form the rotating plus symbol? it looks to crisp and looks kinda out of place because of that :)

It’s nice to see the guys at Yes Theory get treated sometimes, they do so much for the others 😊
https://youtu.be/jekgZCeBnhQ A big fan of yes theory from India
Happy birthday hope you have a great day
if you thought that face reaction was amazing, just wait til he finds out the bike is only on loan lol
I think Thomas should suprise Ammar for his  by flaying Ammar family after Covid 19 to meet Ammar as Ammar is not allowed to visit his home country!!!
Wait does Thomas get to keep the bike or was the company loaning it to him?   Also always wear a good helmet
Thank you for sharing!Hope everybody here becomes successful on YouTube :)..
Beautiful bike!
yo guys where is Matt ?
I’m new to this yea theory plus channel but these guys seem awfully familiar? Idk just me? Something about traveling and will smith I think.
That’s one of the coolest birthday gifts I’ve ever seen!! Happy birthday Thomas!!
Plz trim your beards
Hey yes theory, I've been trying to get in contact with you guys but you won't respond!! Please see this
Hahaha Dude I Love You Guys!!❤️❤️❤️
I just finished the main channel episode and it’s so great to come to another little video over here
I think we all wanted it to be a giant cup of coffee
You guys should take Thomas to a wave pool for his next birthday!
do pov driving
Wooo😍😍 that muscular body🔥😍👌#mechfix
i like how they used the first video to promote their second channel. I thought I would have to pay for Yes Theory Plus
Being an Indian I've first time seen this bike lol
2 posts one day!!!!
Why don’t you guys wear masks
Congrats and welcome to the club! Please don’t be like some other riders and wear shorts and sandals and no helmet! Too many watch this channel lead from the front! Last now let’s get some miles on that thing! Enjoy!😎🎉🎁
Omg that's my dream bike too...
you guys r amazing!!!!!!!
Have fun, Safe travels!
:)
For sure he went for a ride off camera ahaha
bury the lead my dudes
Why not have an electric bike... I'm a bit confused...

Get this man a license 😤
Thank god he's till with lexi..  He deserves everything. 👌 happy birthday.
Ammar: “I love surprises” of course he does lololol the extrovert
The vid starts at 1:43

Thomas should start Motovlogging.
It is name of my country
wtf! get me some friends like this!!!!  such positive energy and everyone is on there toes 24/7 bc u never know what's going to happen. like " i don't know if i'm being pranked or supprised"  that just summed up there life. luv u guys!

#Ammar4president
That Indian bike is so beautiful
One of the greatest strategies implemented, let the 6 million subscribers be unsatisfied with not knowing what surprise is on the main channel diverting them to this channel and making them all aware of the this channel, great strategy ❤️
Indian Power Babe

Yes Theory: uploaded  Yes Theory Plus: uploaded   Me: I don’t know what to watch first 🥺
❤️❤️❤️
The bike is freaking beautiful
SWEEEET!
Happy birthday Thomas 😊😊
Anyone who dislikes this video must have their attitude adjust and stop bringing negative vibes.
Congratz Thomas! but ay ay ay Ammar, Indian? are you serious? and here I thought HD is American pride
Stop 'bragging' you just loaned a bike!
Happy Birthday thomas!!! You truly inspire me to go seek discomfort each and everyday. Have a good one.
Ride safe Thomas
I want to get a motorcycle but my family says no😔
That face 😂😂
did they buy this bike for him or Ammar said Indian 'loaned' them this bike?
He probably doesn’t need a license if he goes to Mollosia
Next birthday... Thomas gets a plane
100th
YOU BOUGHT HIM AN FTR?!?! HELL YEA!!!  Edit: Well I guess getting loaned one is almost as cool lol
Binod the name of bike
Yah, no tyrannic masks!
whoa nice one! Cheers!!
Thomas : WHATSSS!!! 😲😲😲 His Face so Cute!!  Yes Theory Bringing Happiness in this Pandemic. Love Lots Guys.  From Philippines 💕💕
Love this happy belated birthday Thomas
Thomas’ face was great, his jaw literally dropped. To bad he has to wait and get his license, the anticipation would kill me.
But isn't he rich enough to buy that himself?
Where is Matt
He is speach less, get a royal Enfield
You guys....2 videos in a row...you just made my day❤
Get a man like Ammar who takes off Thomas's sunglasses with such ease.
I love this Bike ❤️
Indian one of my dream bike .🥺
