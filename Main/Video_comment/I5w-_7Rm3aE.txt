How to create mod = step 1: scrape around as much andesite as possible. step 2: I N D U S T R I A L I S E. Step 3: Vanity
Hi shaIz i know this vid is from a year ago but I love your vids I have Minecraft but I can’t seem to download it on my computer and you give me crazy  idea’s for my base in create except I don’t have it yet but I love your vids there awesome and keep up the good work
Rare footage of the Stephenson Rocket being built.
Hello Shalz can you please tell how you can see what's in the item valut
man omgg. i love your videos so much. thanks for making my day happy :)
6:43 tip: use controlled tnt explosions (or not idc)
1:52 😂
thank you
finally a awesome youtuber that only uses the create mod
so good
1 year late and you are still amaizing
so how actually did you use the display link because mine doesn't work when the items enter the brass tunnel the display link won't display the item in the display board, i had all of them running and facing and the right direction but it seems like the display link won't read the brass tunnel and it didn't send it to the display board
I love you ❤
1:52 yahiamice burrito factory incident flashbacks...
this create looks... suprisingly old
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I think the best way to stay playing on a minecraft world is to keep thinking larger and giving yourself more stuff to do
Holy shish 😂😂😂 17:58
I would love to be able to play in this server
It looks like you eat the crystals lol
Love the series pls keep making more 😁
You are the best minecraft player. I am from the nederlands. Byebye. you most sobescribe

Is there not a Create way to lave a lava farm become an Obsidian farm?
omg This is so good.
Wawa, Gooba
What are the mods and the server IP?
Reason they are growing so fast is because in Java when planted in rows everything grows faster which comes in handy when making automatic farms
22:56 funny
love the block placing edits when in a building montage. Very clean
W!
I am stupid how do you see the amount of things  in the item vaults? on my screen nothing pops up in the top of the screen with the numbers.
6:55 how there isn't any comment talking about the vsauce music
I'm going to admit is that he just likes to overcomplicate things and like in a funny way like oh no I ran out of stone stone Farm oh no I ran out of and decide and decide for him oh no I don't have enough copper copper Farm
Y is there more tree farm then trains
24:18 ayo
I like your video dud keep it up.
18:18  thank goodness current Create changes this.  andesite funnel still outputs one at a time, but it will allow input of any size stack.  nice quality of life improvement and save material early game.
My brain hurts
Shalz never disappoints with his music-synced montages. 6:20, for an example.
i’m sorry? episode 3? how?
My prediction of how his series will look in the future when cactus finally joins on ep 28 of series:   🏣🏬🏢🏨🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🏭🛩️🛩️🛩️🛩️🛩️🚈🚈🚈🚈🚔🚔🚔🚔🚔🚔🚔
how did you make the server?
Hey there, don't know if you know this by now. but you can change the gantry contraption to "never turn solid" using the create wrench
Nice vids shalz
What hostinf service do you use?
You can just change the gear box to a vertical  gear box by just right clicking with a wrench
Looks like a server i spend a lot of time... And i love it, keep going 😊
22:35 I was wondering if he would include a liveleak logo lmao!
Create Mod
You do enjoy making yourself die in dumb ways.  It's hilarious! 😂  R.I.P. to the pickaxes though.
The fact that Shalz knows how to make anything automatic but doesn't know the OG way to make a cobble generator amazes me
if you will love me i will sub
imagine if there was a death message for getting stuck in many mechanisms like a saw and a drill at the same time called: (name) died of stupidity and intelligence at once
why is it that the youtubers in the comments feel so different from the actual video
make titanic
Put goggles on the beef shop’s one and only underpaid cashier
survival create new age would be so cool

What Server Hosting Service Do You Use For Your Survival Create World ?
the creeper destroyed     everything XD
Shows the word “subscribe” how did that get there? 😂
1:23 GODDAMNIT KRIS YOU BROKE THE COBBLESTONE GENERATOR!!!1!!1!1!1!!11!
you sound like mumbo jumbo
i absolutely love this series im could ik whats your average upload between vids
If you haven't already come up with a new system for it me and a friend made a decently good good way of semi-automating sturdy sheet production. The big gripe with the design is that you need lots of magma which we don't have automated but if you find a good way that's not an issue. You put a ton of magma blocks into an item drainer hooked up to the spout and have a chute or funnel next to it to pick up the obsidian, the obsidian gets crushed into obsidian powder. (on the world its on it just goes into a barrel so idk how hard it is to compact sorry if that's an issue) That gets put onto the depot under the spout and gets sprayed with lava with a smart chute or brass funnel hooked up to it that gets put onto a conveyor belt with two mechanical presses. Hope this helps and keep up the good work on videos!!
Why didnt u just stoped windmill of your glass factory? Do you messing with your cabels at home while energy is still on?
11:55 you could have just put another gearbox to invert the rotation
when are you going to upload another video its been 4 months
Could you give us the schematic for the tree farm house? Im trying to make one for myself but im just too bad at building and I thought yours would look super cool in my server
@Shalz i wonder, how do You Power Your Saws And Drills On Carts ? Please i Dont know How :(
17:29 I subscribed, when is our date.
you should put chutes above the fans so that other people cant pick them up
Trainsgender
For the wood warehouse, if you rotate your storage 90° you can have it be an even number of blocks in length.   This variability means you can always center your storage.

Dogo:Finn,max or winston
you have the best videos I really like the train mods and monorail and like when you show cactus what you have done i have subscribed👍
I love how during the speedbuild segments with music, you do it in sync with the music, it's incredibly satisfying.
CAN U PLZ Make a world download for the sand and tree farm?
What is the ip?
He cut down trees to make a tree farm…
Wow, It is like factorio (Automate everything), but 3d

Bro makes a factory out of everything
Hello. Shalz can i somehow join the minecarft server

auto miner
6:55 Hey Vsauce, Michael here

I love your videos and would love to see more of your videos and I hope you have an absolutely amazing day.

4:52 ,,Okay i might onto something here" *Meanwhile shows what looks to be a failed attempt of a new person to this mod making a tree farm*
hey shalz did you know that you can use an empty schematic and turn on a setting in the cannon and it clears blocks for you. (it dont drop them tho)
your videos are the best
I tought you were making part 3
since this video is 2 months old, youve probably already figured this out if its possible. I played a mod pack where i was able to use a lava pool with drip stones dripping into cauldrons and then used a pump from create to make infinite lava.
i want more pls
When is episode 4 coming
Pleas make an nother part
dude this is my first time watching I LOVE YOUR CONTENT SO MUCH i can finally watch a create series without being bored out of my mind and i love how you curse but you dont over-do it

It was 2 weeks and 5 days from ep1 to ep2, then 2 weeks and 6 days from ep2 to ep3. I hope Shalz is doing ok, it's been 7 weeks and 5 days since ep3. We aren't going anywhere, but we love survival create mod
svensk?
13:23 could you have used a weighted ejector instead?
From 6:19 to 6:41 shalz is doing stuff according to the song playing
wheres acacia
Loving the series man :D
you have adhd
If you were to use a brass tunnel and filter the steak to go out one side and the leather to go out the other, you could probably use that to keep the raw beef and leather out of the food dispenser because the raw beef can’t go out either side until it turns into steak
Title MAKING TRAINS! Him today we are going to make a tree farm

Episode 4 when? Do the other ppl on server also post on YT?
Your copper needs himet
The episodes are quite short but the amount of stuff you do in the episode, It's just so fun to watch.
6:51
You don't suck your good i can't even play Minecraft survival i even bet your so good you can make anything 🙂
can i haf more videoz pwease
How is possible that Shalz have his items shows (small pic)(number)x (item)? i do have it only when there is little of it.. more filled storages just show huge pics with that item + 1-64.. so i does see (item) 64 50x+/- its pretty annoying :D will love to see also like Shalz have it with vaults.. also for some reasons... those vaults are really small (in storage) How i can fix both problems?
😮
You can use saplings as a fuel source, maybe feed them into a furnace system
Looking forward to ep 4 :)
1905000 that is how many subs you would have if every person sub.

Yo post #4
pls more
this is so cool! i no joke wouldn’t even have youtube if u weren’t doing this!!! also what is the ip for the server? i would love to be part of this if you want! (please 🥺)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I might have missed something, or you may have a newer version, but in my testing I have run into a problem with deployers on tree farms, since everything on the minecart contraption shares a single inventory. When you drain all items through the portable interface, they run out of saplings and the farm stops working. If you leave the saplings in, the inventory eventually fills up with saplings, and the contraption can no longer pick up the other items, leaving them on the ground. I use a rotating design with independent chopping and planting arm. The chopping arm collects everything, and the saplings get filtered out of it's output until the planting arm inventory is full. I'd just like to point out this risk, to prevent an accident, or find out what solution you might have come up with.
i cant wait for episode #4
Wich mods are u using
i love your survival create series, an your transitions are super cool☺. keep it up buddy!
Why it feels like Satisfactory video?
I really really can’t wait for ep 4!!!! Might even start doing this stuff my own!! This looks awesome.
i love this series. but when are you going to make more?
Pls Never stop i Loge this series
create is so entertaining i love the content made from it
Traiiiinssss
If you use a system like the one for xp but with an source of more that 10 000 buckets of lava you will get infinite lava
A few quick notes:  Place flowers inbetween spruce and jungle saplings so they dont get stuck trying to grow as 2x2 trees. Flowers wont get destroyed by the saws (unless you deactivate the mechanism) Im 90% sure that the trees on the lower levels of your farm cant grow, whether it be height or light level, but correct me if im wrong.  New subscriber, I love the editting of these videos, I hope things get better for you! <3
Bro is crying after this vid.  Shalz: *sobbing*
You are perfect.👌
You should make tunnels or sewers underneath the town.
10:27 The reason why the trees were growing so fast it's because usually the tic speed Varies depending on how many players are on the server since you were the Is only 1 On the server the trees grew fast
Can you automate the train casting by making a obsidian farm and crash the obsidian and Jake the casting automatic
Can't wait for the next episode
when will be the next one will be done
3 weeks late
where is 4
13:15 really great factory! You’ve Lilly already heard this but if you place chutes on top of fans it transports the items up.
Keep up the good work my man, cant wait for part 4!! Edit: OMG I GOT A LIKE LETS GO
The fact for that cobble gen at the start there is a way more efficient way that makes a dub of cobble in like 30 seconds

Plz tell me i am wrong Doesn't tree growth needs 22 block clearance to grow??????    Ummmmm tell me plz 😅 I need help Tell me   If that's the case then the tree farm is inefficient 😢😅
7:55 how did the guy who built that get all the prismerine like I know this is in create mod but can't you like not craft prismerine?

Ya ok
Trains.🚂🚉🚅🚝🚆
I would like to join the server please.
Hi! Im a super Fan of your content, I wanted to play the mod on a server Aternos with my friends, seems like the modpack does not allow project distribution, is it possible to turn it on? I would really appreciate it.
I actually love how you build with unaged copper. It's almost refreshing to see it actually age in a build for once, so cool
You need players? Ill join :D
Call this series, "The Industrial Age"
coolll
does this series have a playlist and if so can someone link it?
when another vid
Wow so simple but really good timelapse of the wood farm
WHEN IS PART 4!!!!!!!!!!

Train
10:25 no no it’s the correct tick speed proceeds to make the tick speed 3 instead of 1
Can you make a link for all the mods you use
Amazing series
ep4??????????????????????
you can make 2 andesite by combining cobblestone from your glass farm with some diorite from under your tree farm, and iron by washing gravel from your glass farm with the fans from your glass farm, or super smelter
this is why i want java so badly
andesite farm and iron nug farm that will solve your problem
I like it when you placing the blocks on music
Now the fun part, seeing if shalz will get past episode 3 before giving up on survival create
The create mod should have working garage doors and vehicles
shalz what are the mods that your using beside the create mod
Hey shalz im going to keep posting this comment on ever video i see of this series untill you acknoledge it, ! CRUSHING WHEELS CAN BE PLACED HORRIZONTALLY  and the items can go thru using a conveyor belt. also hope things get better for you youre like the top most entertainting youtuber i see nowadays! (im too lazy to correct my spell errors)
22:58 yo... thats sus...
I love the editing! Great video!!!
IS there a way to get a schematic of your tree cutter?
Can you provide the mods in a modpack if possible?
Loved the video @Shalz! Can't wait for the next video man! Not gonna lie though, Whisper's Base looks like something out of 2b2t LMAO!  If you need a Very, VERY Big Brained way of Getting Power for your Area, try doing what @TangoTek did on the Server he's got with Keralis, GoodTimeswithScar, Zedaph Plays and BDouble0 where he built a Infinite Lava Self-Powered Steam Generator. It pumps out Massive Amounts of Power since it's got 2 Banks, each with About 2 sets of 9 3 × 3 × 9 (I think they were 9 blocks Tall) Boilers heated by Lava-Fed Blaze Burners, the Lava coming from an Infinite Lava Pool that's been Pumped into an Area a Chunk of Two over and then Pumped into a Tank which then Pours the Lava into Buckets, which then get Moved along a Conveyer belt and then Grabbed by Mechanical Arms that feed the Lava to the Blaze Burners and then Send the Buckets back on the Belt to get Refilled with Infinite Lava. The True Meaning of *UNLIMITED POWER!!!!!* with the Create Mod!
Ok
Keep up the great work please love you're videos
HOW IS HIS INVENTORY SO BIG

If I buy membership and then join the minecraft server does it matter that I joined really late?
Nice vid

I know this is just 2 minutes in but, how long did you spend procrastinating on the development of the glass manufacturing before getting around to starting the tree farm?
When is part 4 comming out?????
What if you did Minecraft create mod in hardcore👀👀👀👀
what is the seed?
Yo @Shalz, can you put the world up for world download or put links or schematics, i really want to use some of these in my create world
its a cool serie but i like create live 4 more
Could you make a tutorial video of the  pirate ship ride in Minecraft while using a crate mod
you say that there might be some new people joining your server. this might be a bit too much to ask but would you mind if i joined? im a fan of your content and have struggled to make my own modded server so it'd be AMAZING if i could join the server. I'm a huge fan of the create mod too btw :D. oh, and I can make a new yt channel for that server. it'd be my dream to join.  please consider this
So what you are try to say that the tree farm build is like an automatic car wash
Which modpack are you using? (i wrote all 3 ep pls answer D:)
what server hosting do you use?
Does ur smp have valkierien skies
Any plans to put out the world file for us to download? Your greenhouse is exactly the kind of build I was looking for. Great video as always too, keep it up!
Are you on Java or bedrock
Can any one share the full mod pack name, or the mod list?
When will part 4 come i want to see your new plans
What mods do you use?
Hi
Hey, what kind of modpack is this? Is it on Curseforge or TechnicLauncher?
I hate these videos😢

Русские ставьте лайки под комментом и мы узнаем сколько нас здесь :)

Great video!
Make 20 more plz your videos are the best
Bro just make an iron farm
1:50 I felt that on a personal level.
when you want to do an smp similar to this one but money and friendless status wont let you 😔
Is that java or bedrock cause I want the create mod how do I get it?
Should probably have made the tree-farm first and then built the greenhouse around it.
Hope it does not take long but it is always a good video
How did you download the create mod?
what are the mods shalz?
Name mod ??
And can I be a member of your server
I subscribed you are my favourite YouTuber can you please show me how to get this mod
Modpack/questpack release?
Can you give the list of mods you are using? ik you're using create, but idk what else.
i love how you makes farms to make farms
I see u make a lot of work in ur videos
hi shalz!, is the thing guide in your right side when your crafting part of the mod? btw nice video cant wait to the next ep!
sweet
i like this series and i would like to play this modpack with my friends , someone know what modpack is it?
You need to make a miner train😊
This is literally "I built a farm to build a farm to buuls a farm to build a farm"
19:38 my singing monsters be like:

this is one of the best survival series on youtube right now
Why you doesn't use schematic?
Thank you to my nanny BP, is I wait for a train?
i see your vidio from india
this mod should be on public servers, if it gets laggy instead of it in a open world maybe it could be a skyblock type of game where everyone has their own island they can go to when they are working on their base and than they can go to 1 of a bunch of different overworlds so that resources dont run out and blocks placed by players in the overworld would be deleted or theirs a block limit for each player maybe? if its possible, I dont do developing but it would be a cool concept
Great😊
I recommend composting the saplings to get bonemeal.
очень круто!
1:24 ...makes cobblestone generator in correctly lol
I had an idea for you: Simulating civilisation using the create mod
I like how this first train looks like mine

Shalz waht is the mod list i want to do the best create server
Hej
Do anyone knows the mods his using? I really want to try it out it looks smooth
This series has so much engineering
BRO YOU MUST INVITE ME PLS I would love to be on ur sever
Hey Shalz! I really love create and survival series with create, I really enjoy play it,  but i'm without a good modpack to play, so i'm asking you if you would mind to share the modpack, i really am interested in your modpack that you're playing in this survival create serie. Since the first episode i've seen mods that I didn't know them and that i liked them
question about the essentials mod(since im like 20% sure that's what's being used for hosting), is there a way to keep the server up, even without the host constantly online?
You know how you said train factory what if you made a factory that actually built trains like placed down the trains build the train, do everything to make a train that would probably be a lot of materials though
Halfway through I forgot it was about trains
Man I wish I knew the create mod as much as you do
make 3D printer
Är du svensk?
24:18 best pick up line, try it.
How are your time lapses the best
legendary video 💜 still love this series
You do know the second layer of trees is not going to grow I'm saying this half way through the vid so if you fixed it later on I haven't seen it yet
What version of mc is this?
Bro your content is so cool. I am always so excited for new things. I love that modpack so is it possible for you to upload it?
can i play with you
this is really cool
23:00 hmmmmmmmmm
What mods are you using? Or is it a modpack?
Can you upload your tree farm? because I want to build it to.
Does anybody know modpack this is? It looks so fun
what modpack are you using? (as you are probably using more than just Create)
Are you from Sweden?
Imagine being good at Building 😅
You are making me mad make voed
I've been looking for a while and I need to know. What is that mod used to see the crafting trees? like when he was automating sand and looked at all the ways to obtain it
Bro is Vinicius 13 of create💀💀💀

What mod is it with the support beams and big chains? I want if for my own world
What create mod type are you useing? create above and beyond?
This was interesting but sadly there was no actual train
3 words bone meal farm
Depending on what version you are playing on, you might be able to add the immersive railroading mod, adds a ton of trains and train stuff, not automatic but sure is amazing.
What mod do you use to show what is inside your vault at 9:03 please ??
laughability subscribe reminder lol
Hey what mods do you have in this? Like for the quests and stuff telling you what to do. GreT series btw I’m loving it so much I’m trying it myself.

Wish I could be part of this amazing series
You should start making trains and sell them like cars to make money
You can do sideways water wheels... Like, so that they do vertical output.
You should make a public server
I love how your build actions are synced to music. I am sure that takes forever, very well done.
Use a wrench on the gantry shaft to stop it from placing the blocks when it hits a block!!!
You just became my new favorite youtuber
Hey shalz huge fan but what  if u create  a working  battleship  or a giant rail gun in your next  video
Pro tip: if your not worried about resources, you can run a empty blueprint on the cannon to clear out a big space. It may be slow but it’s useful to run in the background.
Which mods do you use?
I like shalz  (shalz sounds)
train
Based youtuber
What is the mod to display the block’s name you are looking at ?
To make a farm you need a farm that makes farms
jag vill ju va med );
12:02 or you could have just had the other set going the other way, rather than over-engineering something
Could u send me a link to the mods that you use, please?
I maybe sound dum but Is shalz Swedish?
can i play on it? I am quite good with the create mod
What mods?
The wither storm mod
shalz you said maiby there gone be new members of the server is there a way viewers???
20% moment
i'm part of dat 20
I love the create mod and i would like to try survival create myself, do you use a certain modpack? Better yet, wich mods are you using besides the create mod? I see optifine, but also a minimap/waypoint mod i don't recognize, so i was wondering if there are any other mods you use.
You could just reduce the blocks between those two “garage doors” in the warehouse and then it would be centered
Good video im new to your chanell im subed  your amazing videos!
I have never seen this channel before, and i love it. The way you sync the music with the placement of blocks is amazing! keep it up.
man these videos are the best
hey Shalz pretty cool video love this series, but i have a question can you send or link me the minimap you have? pls it looks so good
Cheater he goes in createiv
Shalz is like i am going to build a train oh i need a tree farm for it he. The tree farm need glass I will make a glass farm I have to dig for the farm I will make a drill 😅😅😂
Which mod are you playing 😊
You are a very good bulder
The crushing wheels give.... *but they also take*
i watched all videos and is just wondering if i could get all mods or the modpack
guys does someone know which modpack he is using
But im already subscribed..... lol good work on the videos.
6:00 You guys ask for subs?
Could we get the world download?

Once you finish this series you should try create: above and beyond. This series is great though, I hope it lasts a long time!

Can i join the server if its ok?
Short form of the video: - Wants trains   - Needs wood      - makes glass farm      - Make drill machine      - Goes to cows      - makes wood machine
i love how he copied youtube germanys most viewed series create live 4
I think you should instead make shorter videos but upload them more frequently
"Behold the man who could easily solve all his problems but for some reason chooses to overcomplicate everything to the point where at the end of it all he has more work to do then when he started!"  "W-Why does he do that?"  "...I am still unsure"
I absolutely LOVE this series. Keep up the good work! ❤🎉
Love you
Time to eat pizza "pizza comes alive and pizza time music plays"
I wish I could Join I am good with the mod but not with the building thing of buildings
13:05 u may always place chute over fan and it will work at any rpm

Hey I've been watching your series for a while now. I was wondering if you could teach me how to play create. I tried to learn with tutorials but its pretty complicated. And i could be a fun member on your server. I hope your life starts to turn around. I'm sorry about that.
HOW ARE U READING WHATS IN ITEM VAULT? ecit: hacker
Next video, make a giant shop where the smp members can get stuff from their factories to the mall; basically a shop hub
can i have a shout out i subed
Best series
Behind the nice, create-steampunk themed builds from people like Shalz that are amazing builds is an alien fever dream of a base.
I just love it when a build just comes together and just works so good
11:54 but… you can please it on the other side… why…
:  warning cat puns :Thanks shalz I love when you post you awalys make my day purr fect
hello how do i become a server member? P.S i like your videos
I love this series bro ❤
Shalz the part where the fan shoots the wood up if u could cover it it would be better bcs if u miss lighting a part a zombie might pick the wood and prob be stuck in the fan
Shalz is the type of person to make a farm to build a contraption to make a farm to make another farm that makes something cool... I honestly relate :)
HOW DO YOU ALL HAVE SO MUCH BRASS??
You should make a delivery train brings people supplies and takes non important items and burns the unimportant items
Just subscribed
How do u have the patience for this xd, I have no patience
Is it just me or dose dried kelp look like an unbrella
Dude, I love these videos. Are you able to give the most that you were using?
Shalz, your other two episodes have a bracket surrounding the numbers in your title. I will not have this, please fix immediately.
Shalz make a train House
This makes me want to do a steampunk style smp...
The reason it grew so fast is because minecraft tick speed is also influenced by the amount of players on so because you were the only person on they grew really quick.
Warehouse=Ikea + I know you are Swedish
the vsauce sound sent me flying
Can u build an infinite iron farm next tine please ?
You should make a video where you make a factory for every single item (maybe in creative or the server)
Okay I found my favorite series!
hi
I, no joke, just found your channel and have been looking forward to this all week, please continue to make quality content. Also, there is no rush, take the time that you need in your life to make suer your happy. God bless!
He deserves more subs
What do u need to do to join the server?
Don’t push your self shlaz
hi shalz. ive been watching every episode i mean like the 3 episodes haha. But u learned me alot of stuff on this mod and i got the mod myself and play singleplayer world but that is boring but u said maybe a new member stuff. my question is may i join the server and also i hope u gonna feel beter soon.
Nise 9:32
what modpack is this?
shalz is starting to become modded sandiction
I wanna ask, how many people are in the server? Also you could make a transport train for players (so if someone is too lazy to go to let's say the nether by foot, they could take the train to the nether and have a nice view of Minecraft's nature)
I haven't used the vaults from create but couldn't you make a pretty small vault above round connected to a big vault underground. So you can store way more items but still fit the vaults in your building you could use create logic to keep the vault above ground always full. This is just an idea I had you do you :)
OMGG WE NEED PART 2!!!!!1"""!1!!!!!!!
The construction with the music is extremely good
My friend probably thinks you're not doing the world anymore that's why
can you cover up the transportation thingies with glass blocks or any block to look like a magnificently big transferring pipe over the factories you made?
Can i join?
what kind of mods are you using? I would really like to try this out :)
would the gantry shaft work on the outside of the tree farm?
How do you get the create mod on the phone
I love you editing style, it's so cool!
13:01 you could use chutes, the items can go up if directly on the encased fan, doesn't need as much rpm and su
YEEEES, FINALY, bro, this videos just make my chair more comfortable and the food tastier
Does anyone know all the mods used? becasue i tried create above and beyond however the recipes were different and it didn't have trains
YHHJKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Oh yeah  and I hope you get better
Blocks being placed to the beat is amazing
Maybe you should make an automated Builder so when people pay money you can Set it up and you could build them their house train or whatever
Did he want the copper to oxidize 🤔
what do you use to edit?
i f-ing love this series, keep the content coming you legend.
Ill join the server I’ve been playing the create mod for about 3 years now
Dude your time lapses are soooo cool
Use the Little Logistics/Contraptions mod or you have to pay taxes.
Love your vids ❤
Can I join
What mod is extending your inv. like that?
Is there a link for the modpack you used? i loved this video btw
I love the survival series

20:27 U can also use deployer lol
MUMBO JUMBO SHOULD JOIN all tho he is somewhat busy with hermit craft
Bro is going faster than my dad buying milk. dam
surprised the fan thing worked. if you just use chutes in top of the fan you don't need to run it at a super high speed and it's more reliable.
im subbed
WIth the fan for moving items from farm to storage: Have you thought of using Chutes? They can transport items upwards with fans and nobody will be able to wander into the system or pick up ranodm chunks of wood
you are legends
What mod pack do you use?
New member in the future? Why do i hear a british voice?
did you know the create mod actually comes from blizzor so a german youtuber who brings out the new mod every time if you write in youtube blizzor you know the creator
can i join your server
Making train tracks without an assembly line looks horrible
Shalz should join HermitCraft, because his buildings are gorgeous
use fans bellow shoots to  make items go up
WHAT ARE THE MODS/MODPACK IN THIS SERIES
Cool
make a delivery track system that nobody can steal from
you make me so happy
loved the music in this episode
what are all the mods you use in the server?
Hello Shalz im a new subscriber, I love your videos. Im Spanish so sorry if I make spelling mistakes, I would love to make constructions like you. I allso have a few questions. Do you play with subscribers and do you have an uploaded list of mods? Its a pleasure to see your videos, thanks
you should test create broken bad
People that scroll down to the comments. How do you make a multiplayer server for the create mod???
This is probably the best series on YouTube. Your editing is amazing, humor is amazing, Create builds are amazing everything is just perfect. I hope this series never ends.

Hey just wondering what mods you are using?
You are so good at building geez
jeg vet at du er svensk
This is probably too complicated there's no way I can actually build something like this
12:55 THE FAN IS FANNING
12:00 when hehad the waterwheel problem he could have just changed direction of the waterwheels on one side, it will still work.
9:30 i would like to join, but my create mod builds are probably maybe 7/10 (please reply @Shalz )
Just a hint if you want to clear an srea just use an portable drill with the digging enchant! It can dig 3x3 per block very fast! ❤
anyone know what mods he uses?
can you link the other smp members
Could you do a video on how to download the create mod. Thank you😊
I subscribe

Build a elevator, Yes
I love this series and btw. what are all the mods you use in the series?
Can anyone join the server?
man i hate crafting sturdy shits
Yay part 33333333333
13:00 instead of having those items travel by air you can place a chute on top of the fan and it will reduce the risk of items spewing out into places they dont belong. that and when you right click the chute it can look pretty cool with the items flowing upwards in a glass pipe
Bro you’re tree farm don’t have light so it don’t grow
14 years ago
I'm here for the music syncs and ONLY the music syncs
wow
If you put a fan at the bottom of a chute and make it blow upward it stays in the chute which reduces the entity lag while pushing the items up
Daniel give me coffee
YES NEW VIDEO FINALLY!!!!111!!!!1 LETS GOOO!!!!!!! Best series EVER!!"!"!!!!!!!11!
7:44 just make an andesite farm i have made it and its budget on new worlds plus it gives a lot of it even to much if you dont use it
I have no idea why, but I expected shalz to not be super skilled in building. Amazing house and now the greenhouse!
Hey Shalz I’m loving the series but I was just wondering which mods/mod pack you are using.😊
Best Series on youtube rn!
I just started watching your channel but i already think your awesome! and whats the mod name?

Great series I just think that you need to play more with the other "creaters", cause I want to know why in the timespan of the 3 episodes a city was build
Yay lets gooooo
youtube for me has reached peak interest. i finally get full 10 minute videos that are interesting and i havent touched shorts in weeks! thanks for making videos on this smp series.
Yeeeee
What is the music at 6:30?
a lot of progress
To make train he needs tree farm. To make tree farm he needs a place to put it. To make a place to put the farm in he needs glass. To make glass he needs a glass farm. To make glass farm he needs sand. To make san he needs gravel. To make gravel he needs cobblestone. To make cobble he needs cobble farm. Oh my.
Why you so long before you upload some vid?
Trains are the best!😊❤❤❤❤❤😂❤❤❤❤
I lik the siries
23:00 AYOOO SHALZ???

I would gladly play with you but I barely have time for my own SMP lol

Shalz stop saying I need to subscribe I am already subscribed
I like this series, make more of it, and great job with your videos😃
WHATS THE MODPACK PLEASE
Is this the above and beyond version or just the normal create mod? Also what can you download it from? Great video, I'm really enjoying this series!
normally i dont usually subscribe to any channals but since you're a man of integrity you deserve one my man
I love your videos. Keep it up!
could i join the server?
When is episode 4 coming out
YEASSSSS! MOREEEEEE!!!!!!!
Shalz I made on my smp a super smelter based on your version from episode 1
BEST 25 min of my life!!!!
I'm wondering what the sound is called, that played after he said "But not by hand" minute 6:56
I honestly love this series so keep up th e good work
In regards to the fan, you didn't necessarily have to make it spin faster, you could have used chutes - they maintain the air current generated by the fan and also prevent items from spilling everywhere. Loving the content, hope you're well, Shalz!
i like that it is visible that you are improving, like the edit mainly... your vids just feel so much more.... planned i guess than the previouse ones on your channel
You have too much motivation it scares me.
yooooo he is back! Holy shi-ihs
shalz if u continue the series for long add create aeronautics when it releases i cant wait to see that
is this a custom modpack? and if so its it publicly available?
0:43 is a legendary sound
YES SHAALZ!!!!!
16:27 this is where the fun ends😂
If you put a wooden slab under the deployer it will make a track with wood planks from Steam n' rails instead of the gray ones.
Sometimes I wish I could time travel to watch all the Shalz Survival Create series
you encouraged me to start a create world with  my friends, thank you!
thank you for this video
can we play too on the server ?
You can make an Andesite Factory 😅
How do I join🤔
This series is really amazing!
Shalz can you put the download links for the schematics for your factory in the description cos I really like your designs
10:12 Shalz: Ohh ok don't stand in front of the sauce!  Great videos btw)
you know when you like a video at the start but then try to re-like it during the video, i need a way to double like
I like conveyer so much
I joind the 20% subs yay
Hey, could you please tell me a name of your modpack (if it's public)?
I really love your videos
Why did the music feel like a Diskney movie(yes i cant spell)
There a create mod add-on that add meth please play with it
Shalz. Your better then every create mod creator. Also imagine trying the trains With the Pekhui mod.
YES YES YES YES
Shalz have you considered streaming?
faf
I luv shalz(no homo)
Finally a new one I like this series the most
Consume 6:18
Modpack pls.
What mods are you using? Besides the create mod, I’m interested in for example big chain
"I'm gonna farm every single tree type" I'm pretty curious how he deals with mangrove trees..
You can use chutes over the fan.
I love all the videos that Shalz posts. They make me happy. You're doing a good job making content.
I love the fact that whenever Shalz builds something the music is synced with the placement. Keep it up Shalz
Mmm he is a calculator of designs
Shlaz got that Franklin Clinton fit ong😂😂
FAN IS FANNING!
I was wondering why you don't use schematics and the schematicannon to cut down on manual building and free up your time for more efficiency, but I realize now that that's probably for 'timelapse-ability' as I've dubbed it.
Man i luv this series bro, btw why don't you and uh the others like cactus work together to make it easy ig?
Love this content
I subbed recently but still ur content is amazing
What if you remove modpack in the world??
Just a heads up i skip the "plz sub" for most videos  i watch lol
hello!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shalz, come join the create addon hub minecraft server, see the builds there...
Sick

I love the video, incredible editing. Man the progression of your channel is crazy.   Whats the modpack youre using, I know u have create mod. But I assume you other things running.
Yesss finally 😊😊😊
shalz in this video: i wanna get a train! so lets make a wood farm, aglass farm, a drill, a mini train station for said wood farm and make some insane planes for next episode... this is very normal! (btw shalz its honestly impressive how much you got done in the episode and am excited for ep 4 also i hope life gets atleast a bit better!)
Hi
I made 100 stacks of train casing in my world just as a funny flex
Seeing people make factories in the create mod, makes me want a server inspired by 1920's industrialization, like imagine someone owns a company but they need a new factory built so they hire people to build it, then maybe some mafia breaks into a factory to steal your resources, idk I just think this would be a cool idea
You know its a good day when Shalz uploads
17:04 Your splitting method is flawed. If a stack comes out, 32 will go to the first one, 16 will go to the second, 8 to the fourth, 4 to the fifth, etc. There is no even splitting.
Trainnnnnnnnnnns 10
Some possible improvements: Cobblestone can be generated at higher speeds if instead of placing a flowing lava, you place a mechanical pump looking into water and a fluid tank with only a single bucket of lava. the lava particles the pump makes functions the same as a flowing lava, but appears with no delay, increasing cobblestone output. the lava wont be consumed When you powered the water wheels with a gearbox in bewteen, the simplest solution was flipping the second set of water wheels to spin in the other directions, but that`s unaestethic. if you need stress units of a few thousand, the easiest way is one or two passive steam generators, very quick, can power themselves, dont need blazes you can more precisely use a fan to move items up if they blow into chutes. this will also remove the height limit lava can be produced by placing dripstone with lava on top of a cauldron now, to mine something the quickest you dont actually use a drill, you either glue it into a minecart and remove the minecart, or you place a minecart with a block chunk into the area you want to destroy so those blocks get overplaced
w video interactions
Train
Make them different types of saplings other than just oak
this lad needs more subs
Next you should make a plane
For the record I am watching this 5hrs after upload
this is honestly some of the best minecraft content I have even seen!!  Keep up the amazing work!
13:00 Shalz you can use chutes here, no need for the ludicrous speed
oie bro... me puedes pasar el modpack con todos los mods??
Tip - Waterwheels are directionally placed.
What is the name of the song he used around 6:40? It just gave me a SERIOUS wave of nostalgia and I HAVE to find it. I have no idea where to even look.
Crazy series man keep em coming its so cool
Nice vid, can we get a mod list?
EEEEEEEEEE
Finally!
Let goo daddy another vids❤❤❤
day 20 of asking to join
6:56 Bro I got PTSD for those few seconds.  Edit: This series is the BEST. I love it!
I know that tango tek and zedaph knows how to play Minecraft create, and both have a solo survival create world. Maby they would like to try/join your server(?
1:24 my dumb*ss thought it was a vertical slab
I love this series you can also see the effort put into the editing! gives me hermitcraft vibes which I love!
The link to the video says that the channel is 8-BitRyan for some reason. Just thought I’d point that out  Might be a bug that I have, idk
I love how in every episode shalz makes plans to do something and the gets completely sidetracked for most of the episode
Its so cool to me to see Shalz Do all this tech stuff in minecraft
Best video
14:22
You're using chassis very inefficiently using radial chassis you don't need to place linear chassis to connect with mechanical saw you don't need to use that much chassis in fact you can just use linear chassis replace radial in the middle and connect it to mechanical saw in one direction since the contraption will move back and forth anyway I know my English is not good but i hope you understand what I mean
Good editing man
Okay. The editing is so amazing. The way the construction blends with the beat of the music. Please man keep it up, your enthusiasm is perfect for the unlimited potential of Mincraft create.
you can waterlog the drill :)
I would subscribe just for this......too bad I already subscribed                      JUST INJECT SURVIVAL CREATE INTO MY VEINS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I LOVE THIS SERIES! I do want longer survival create videos. Maybe even hour long videos??
I love this series so much! Keep up the good work 👍👍
I love how more then half of these videos is shalz preparing for the main attraction
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR POSTING I ENJOY UR VIDS SO MUCH!!!!
Oh my god a new episode thank you
6:57 *DONG*
You are mumbo jumbo but create mod
Last time I played this mod, there wasn’t any trains and stuff. How much has this mod changed since then?
I love your videos and I hope you continue to make amazing videos
Please keep making more of this series!!
within 5 hours!
You can super glue a massive area of land and put it in a cart contraption for easy terraforming.
1:58 Let that wandering trader in!
You should use a furnace engine to power the farm, because then you can keep fueling the engine by smelting wood into charcoal and using that to smelt more wood
You can use the saplings for fuel for a steam engine
As soon as I saw this video I gasped and immediately tapped it
I hope you have better times in your life because I feel bad and so does everyone else ❤ u never stop you are the best!!!
I mean hermit craft is cool and all but ur server is an amazing series I love it so much my new favorite also ur building skills are amazing ur sooooo good grain has nothing on u lol
Did he just cheat whit too see randomtickspeed?
i subscribed
Good series. Like all of modded Minecraft, the biggest threat is your own hubris, lol
Can you post a mod pack?
Btw u can use the schematic cannon to mine out large spaces… just doesnt collece the cobblestone or anything
After watching 3 episodes and being entertained for all 3 (which is honestly rare when I watch a minecraft series), you have definitely earned my sub
Bananas
do any of the other players have youtube channels? would love to see more of this world
I've been checking for the next part of this series every hour IT IS SO GOOD! Keep up the good work!
Amazing work dude keep it up!
You messing with the millstone and crushing wheels was amazing!
you actually are able to use fans at 13:05 but u just need chutes. theres a mechanic where a fan under a chute pushes item up the chute
Contrary to popular belief, item vaults actually hold less the chests at 20 stacks per block by default as opposed to chests at 27 per block. Vaults are only good because they are huge multi blocks with lots of space for funnels and chutes for sorting and what-not.
I LOVE THUS SERIES PLEASE CONTINUE
For a tree farm I use redstone contacts at the beginning and end of a gantry with deployers and saws with a single channel in the middle breaking placed logs below the trees. 1 saw, 1 deployer for the center channel, and 1 deployer for each row that can be as long as you want. Best part, the deployers are underground, so it’s practically invisible. The redstone contacts automatically flick a toggle lever on a gearshift, a storage interface pulls out everything because it places the proxy logs and saplings on the back-stroke.
I luv this series so much even tho I might never play the mod due to: not owning a pc. I love how Shalz just powers through the grinds  and it’s really funny.
this should turn into an smp
Seeing people make factories in the create mod, makes me want a server inspired by 1920's industrialization, like imagine someone owns a company but they need a new factory built so they hire people to build it, then maybe some mafia breaks into a factory to steal your resources, idk I just think this would be a cool idea
You are the most underrated youtuber ever seeing how much work you put into this I think you should be over 1 million subs
an observatory around the glass/sand farm would be cool
number 3 pog
Help
I have been waiting for years
Shalz “Who carry’s lava buckets” Pvpers “Am I a joke to you”
How do people not your vids I love them
what modpack is this? will you ever release it (if its not public)
im 3-2-4 hours late
can you upload modpack also love you shalz have yup <3
Whoo! 20% Club!
I like your editing style, how long does it take? _Not a lot right?_ _right?_
17:30 loved moment, much love to you and your amazing content
How did you get the mod ??? And I like your videos they’re really cool and there’s really good so yeah❤❤❤
@shalz plz more videos your content is very good and i waiting 2 weeks for this vid pls moooooooorrrrreeeeee
your question about the train  turnouts name it would be called a spur line
22:59 🤨🤨 new lore?
I love this series I'm just happy you made it
You should make a railroad. For... reasons.
I have been watching you while I have a broken arm and also PLZ PLZ let me on the server
if you want to move a lot of blocks quick just glue it and pick it up with a minecart
Shalz in my eyes it the god of create his content is just sooo good
I can't wait to see a war with this mod. The trains with turrets will be so cool. It'll be just like the war trains of WW1 and WW2!
yet another quality video W
YESSSS I love this series, I randomly found one of your videos and I binged almost all of them when I was sick, please continue this series. and maybe let me on the server
Don't know if its confirmed but normally when you die in a crushing wheel all the stuff survives so if you have a chute or belt to pick up the glass, did you check where the sand goes for your pickaxes
And can you also stream it sometimes PLZ
Hey shalz big fan I was wondering if you could make this a public server for your viewers so could you
man u can use an andesite exoeskeleton from the create stuff an additions mod it gives u haste 2,if u have that mod in ur mod pack of course
you are the only person who can hold my attention for more than 15 minutes.
Personally I think that mining a big area is relaxing  Once I mined a 66 by 66 area That was 7 blocks tall Took a long time but it was relaxing
Team trees
OH DEAR GOD MATE ITS *TOOOOMAS* THE MECHANICAL MINECRAFT TRAIN HE GO CHOOGA CHOOGA CHOOGA DELIVERING FRESH *COW MEAT* INSIDE OF ANNIE AND CLARABELL *OH DEAR GOD MATEY RUN*
You should make a massive blacksmith forge like lord of the rings type forge in your survival world.
Woooooooooooo
This is a great series, I would love to take part this series so that I have something to do.
that was fast-
I wish I was subscribed so I could subscribe to u again, Mr :) also yay choo choo
I'm a big fan and I like the create mod but I'm on bedrock edition and I can't get the mod
I love this series I wish I had a pc just to play with this mod
HOLY SHES
Wait you have the Create enchanting add on
u shud hev 1 myllon sobcribers
This server has the potential to turn into create hermitcaft.
Let me play on the server and I'll give you a cookie
Nobody, Shalz: I have a wood problem. Proceeds to make everything out of wood.
I lik trains (HOOOOONK)
3:04 bro sounds like film cow
any chance you could share your mod list for those who want to play along at home?
I’ve been loving this series
i love that incredible building sync with the music
6:10 laughability clone
Maybe make the train factory attach to the tree rail line and have it behind that area.
Enjoying the new style of video. Keep up the good work!
12:40 excitement
short offshoots on railroads are called "spurs"
awesome vid as always this is 100% the best minecraft series right now cause everything else is just hardcore this is unique.
Any chance you’d release the schematic for your house?
The get rich quick machine in the start: 💀💀💀💀💀☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Shalz your creations are beautiful but I was wondering can you make them blueprints for the schematic cannon?
You could have just made the other water wheels turn the other way
What's the name of the mod you using?
Quick someone I need the whole bee movie script
I would fix that steak farm factory problem soon cause if you keep putting it off, the. Eventually it may completely fill up the chest
forgot the square brackets around episode number lol. apparently I have OCD :p
EPIC
How to get create mod
Shalz: there may be new members 9:30 My mind: ma boi this is the chance
lol 52 minute club
Hollo
Watching this content just never gets boring
What video editor do you use?
This guy’s videos just make me want to play create mod every time I watch them.
Firefly Door
By the way, Shalz is a really good builder with create blocks
Every time you upload a new episode of the series I just stop whatever im doing and watch it. Never stop making these, they keep me alive man!
I could still get to it, I'm looking for a few players who play create mod with me anyway
love the transitions
Amazing plz keep on making  them!!
What mods do you use?
love your create vids and immersive portal vids too your my fav youtuber.
Loved the music synced to the timelapse impeccable editing my guy keep it up 👌
Train production begins with wood automation
Big fn of the musical cut scenes!
Hey hey hey hye let me be in the server it looks interesting
yay a new episode yeppie :) i would love to play with mods but i play on xbox and i have to pay for the thing you use to use mods :( i love your video
I do not know if you have the means to do so but hosting a seperate create mod server/mod pack open to your community here wouldnt be a bad call. I have a personal modpack and server. I can help you with setting up hosting either on your own hardware or using cloud server hosting. Could be a neat way to grow your community and you do not NEED to be present on it
I watch this while playing Minecraft
60m late 😢
Add the electric create mod addon to the server for more machines
These episodes are amazing. Keep up the great work
One thing I love about the create mod is that when you make a factory, you realise you need to make another factory to have the original factory work, normally this continues and eventually you become 1880s London just so you can build a burger factory.
You can use chutes or pipes between the fan and the out chute to make sure items don't get knocked out of the system.
Shalz is doing everything😂
I love you
What is the song called at 1:42
Looking forward to the next episode 👍
I thought you was gonna build a monorail  but is awesome
Love this
bro copyed laughability with the asking them to sub in half the vid
where can I get the modpack?
love your building style
eating subway while watching this has made me realize how much i want to marry you
nice
I love ur content
First hour crew
you should make a train shed (same design as the building next to it) for the trains to be loaded with stuff
6:13 Im so glad to be apart of this exclusive club
This is awsome. I have played with the create mod but nut in survival. My head would explode if I wanted to build one thing. Because you have to do this and then put it in the crusher and then flatten it with that one thing....  You just say: I need glass. Lets spend an hour making a glass farm. I would rage quit after even thinking of starting something like this. HOW DO YOU DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! o ye. Dont forget to protect your factory's  with cannons :))
can you put the modpack link in description
hi
Made my night, cause it's like 11pm and and can't sleep
Am I the only one that thought he said weed farm?
IP?
I love this series
Whenever Shalz posts, it feels like Christmas even though it’s not.
This is a great video!! I love your content so much!!
Amazing episode once again, you are amazing Shalz :D BUt, my apologies, I didn't quit understand what you said at the very end ? (I may not be subscribed YET, but I'm sure nothing wrong will happen to me c: )
Shalz... Ur best
Hey could you link the place where you downloaded all the mods so I can play with my friends
6:54 the Vsauce jumpscare got me💀
Missed this series. Glad you’re back. Hope you’re doing well.
Love your vids
can we get the modlist for this server? I have a survival create world and would like a couple of the mods you have on the server please
Finally
I love this series! but I wish you post more often
This is fun inside shalz:😭😭😭😭😭
I love you
I like your editing with digging/building because it’s satisfying
Balls are square confirmed
Tjenare
Hello
I want to play with that modpack, can you share it?
i LOVE factorio and i love Minecraft. by the looks of it this mod combines them! im installing this mod
I like how he starts building the trains in the last 5 minutes when the title of the video is"Making Trains in Survival Create!" Most of the video is not even him making trains
nice
NO, ONE OF MY FAVORITE YTUBERS IS STREAMING   better watch this later
Who else was just waiting for the new video to come out lol 😂
Yes
USE A MILLSTONE TO MAKE THE GRAVEL
“The fan is fanning!” Shalz 2023
12:53 THE FAN IS FANING
can you please release the modpack?
23:00 no homo trust, it was just a sleepover!
I like creat mod I would love to join the server and make videos on it with you and the other members
noice
I say you should make two more crushing wheels so that disaster won't happen again
I think i have a solution to your off center vault. You could rotate the vault 90°. (If that makes sense.)
YIPPE!!!!!
These videos have become a staple of my week! I always stop what I’m doing to watch the entirety of your next survival create episode! Love what you’re doing and sorry if you aren’t doing to well. It will get better!
Thought he said weed farm 💀
bulls hit
9:20 bruh, i know how that feels😭
ballsak
Bro I honestly love this! I REQUIRE MORE!

Hello! I am writing from Russia. I really like your videos. My English is not the best, but when I watch your videos I can understand and translate every word. You're incredible. I've watched a lot of your videos and sometimes even laughed, and I laugh extremely rarely. Thank you for your creativity, I really like what you do. Your videos are the best I've ever watched. Thanks again for the good mood. I hope everything will be fine with you.With love, your foreign  viewer ^_^
Fantastic, please don't stop these

I really love this series! I hope you feel better soon. Its fun to see you get better at both editing and create! Love ur vids keep it up! :D
im an og subscriber dont worry
Hey shalz how are you?
You should make a train system when your friends pay to ride it
this series is honestly the best minecraft content on youtube right now
I would like to go on this SMP
make laws and if people don't follow them, exaction machine , torture or any other kind of punishments
YEAH HI
This series is helping me get into the Create mod. I'm pretty sure you're only marginally better at it than I am, but it's still helping me nonetheless. Looking forward for the next part :)
Single player server go burr
give us the quest files shalz But I do hope you feel better.
11:50 just switch the water to the other side 💀
Hope more people join, cant wait to see more!
You can use the small canon also known as the schematic canon to build large buildings and machines. You just need to put in the schematic and put blocks in a chest next to it and it should build the schematic itself
I like trains and are glad to see them in minecraft
Another crate mod video, these are great
I just found this vid I love it
i have allready subscribed, why are u still asking funny pumpkin man?
