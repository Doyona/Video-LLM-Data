The USA shouldn't leave nothing there they are USA tax dollars paid for I would destroy every single thing there I mean everything and let them crawl back in their caves and deal with it
Biden just created the most well equipped terriost fighting force in history.
None are American choppers. Some are American made choppers. Theres a difference. Our inventory is not affected in this case.
Sad to say that the most powerful military in the world lost the war in Afghanistan to an army of cowards. I’m embarrassed right now to say I’m an American. Sorry to the Afghanistan people for abandoning you and to the rest of the world for disappointing you. The American Government has failed all of us. I can only hope that God has mercy on their souls.
Those famous Western Values and Human Rights Concerns........After getting full security and facilitation for the departure of all Western Forces.....Kabul Airports Civilian Infrastructure was destroyed by the U.S. FORCES including Air Traffic Control Towers,  Runway,  Radars/ everything else ( without exception) so that no humanitarian Aid can arrive by Air for the 20 million Starving Afghani Victims of War.....Western Values.....Western Values and the....Western Values.
why are they distorting facts. The choppers are american made, yes. They clearly have afghan army painting and markings! They would not take these!
The funny part is the Taliban checking out the copters left and seeing they’ve been vandalized.
you lost the war get over it
USA lost the war, get over it.  the Taliban are the world's most mighty and toughest warriors,  if they had the same technology as USA military,  they would have taken over the world, they fought the tough Russian army and now the USA , by the way Russia did a much better job in Afghanistan than America.
If these equipments are useless but i believe talibans will make  these equipments for used again
He is a HAZARA and Taliban hate Hazaras people in Afghanistan if they have a chance they will kill all Hazaras people ,this reporter is very braves and all Hazaras people proud of him
Joe Biden gave the taliban the best Arsenal money can buy👎
USA are cowards & losers
Where are the American shoppers? :)))) Oh Choppers. Just joking bro. Thanks for the reporting
Bring it mrs. taliban we r f*cking ready 4 y'all this time! Bring it COWARDS!!!!!!!!!
Three days gone by. Still alive ?
They dismantled a couple peces of the equipment to take pitchers so they could try to make us think they disabled everything they really think we are dumb these people need to be locked up for treason
Once you address 9/11 and all the fall out from that day, then you can clearly see we are all being used has pawns in a global conspiracy.
A slap on the face of falling imperial empire..🇺🇸🇨🇦🇬🇧🇮🇳 Now Keep licking your defeated wounds for coming centuries 🤣😂😁😎 Glory to Allah !!!!!
I'm deducting all that equipment on my taxes hell yeah
You middle easterners just remember we left because we wanted to leave. I hear it stinks like hell over there anyways. Like the smell of death and the constant fear of death. Dont make us come back, got it?!
Hope you are really proud following CORPSE BIDEN! 🤮 🔥 🇺🇸
Those aren't aircraft the "Americans just left behind." the are the ANA's aircraft. The United States along with other allies, equipped the Afghan National Army with military equipment. The first give away is the paint.
Peace to you and your household human. The kingdom of God has come near to you. Repent of your sins of lying and stealing and hating and fearing men but not Jesus and greed and lust and murdering and idolatry and false religions for only Christianity is true. Buddha shall not save you from hell. Mohamed shall not save you. Shiva shall not save you. Only Jesus can so repent be baptized. Read your Bible. Obey Jesus commandments in the new testament and ask for the holy spirit.  Hugs and kisses
Good for them its their country they want it ran the way that they want to run it ain't none of our business what they do in their country
Sooo we did leave dogs?
The elicopters left were destroyed inside or rendered “demilitarized” to use a Pentagon terminology
At one point he just rambled non sense 🤣
They left the dogs huh?   We should be mobilizing a rescue mission... ASAP!
Lol, only a French accented English speaking guy can make this tragic situation funny.
Homeboy looked like negan for a sec
The US didn't even kill Osama Bin Laden either.  He died of natural causes (kidney failure) in December of 2001 in the caves of Tora Bora.  He knew he was dying and wanted to go out in spectacular fashion, and 9/11 was his last hurrah.  The US wanted the public to believe he was alive because if he died of natural causes, then he escaped justice.  The raid of his compound in 2011 was of his surviving sons, and the US lied to the world about it.  Note that since December of 2001, there have never been convincing photos or videos of him.  Before that, we see many videos of him from all angles, moving freely, in various environments.  After that, we have very few videos, and they're all of him barely moving, and from a single angle.  I mean, could it be more obvious they're faked using a look-alike?
Cyril, you have all my admiration! Quel journaliste!!! Bravo et merci!!!
So wasteful . I mean that’s millions of dollars and we just are cool with leaving it there? We pay taxes for wastefulness
For the US to evacuate and leave stuff behind you know what comes next start dropping bombs
WELL  Hopefully THE USA Will no longer, TRY to save the world, and Money will be spent on the  USA, instead of anybody else
How about the other countries in war….we been at war it’s been bad pick and choose
Trillions dumped in a useless war yet here in America we can't have universal health care. Honestly, Europeans are smarter.
They took everything and we paid for it
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
Are the helicopters and the other weapons compensation for the twenty year occupation?   So now they are better equipped and even more dangerous?  America baby!!! Yeah!!!
The benefits of religion continue. 😪
I thought  US went to Afghanistan to destroy the Taliban not to give them arms for free.
Trump will be back don't get comfortable❗😜💥
Afghan Government lost the war. Period. NATO and US achieved killing Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Let peace and cooperation take place, with economic commerce.
We reform great therapy program! Wow you go we built bridges 🌉. A band of brothers and sisters 👏❤
Thanks uncle Joe, you idiot!
It starting to look a lot like a Taliban Christmas! Isn't this the 3rd time having to run from the truth history has taught us?
The Taliban will be killing each other in a short time. Infighting for power and control.
Usual American military trashing a country with dangerous and littered supplies.
All the us equipment have been made unserviceable
May it stay deserted forever.
The result of a doddering old fool disguised as a US President….
Couldn't he rescue the dogs.
Don’t look at me I didn’t vote for Biden 😅
Be safety first....please ! reporter take care
We leave and arm them super
I think they’re just waiting to see who shows up and somebody somewhere will press the red button
Callous biden pinocchio and his imbecilic political slogan about ending ‘the forever wars’ is making world less safe,  jihadist groups sttonger, afghan women and men suffering.. usa an untrusted ally..
After Taliban takeover I have started realising that Trump was better .
Excellent job France 24 the world needs to see this.
dude honking his horn: Yo man, we ought to get the F*** out of here...
So basically, US goes to Afghanistan. Evacuates people, withdraws and leaves a lot of their aircrafts like their helicopters? Come on it’s like giving them a thank you gift for giving America humans
Thank you brave journalist, God bless
The US shown no dignity or honor , ISIL is part of US and it’s run by the CIA funded , Hilary Clinton said in a news conference at the congress.
i'd turn 1of the air craft into a nice apartment
How funny, the U.S. military leaders claimed that all equipment was destroyed, and would not be able to be used by the Taliban???? LIARS!!!!! JOE HAS TO GO!!!
The equipment is decommissioned. If you look up closely to the helicopter you will see that all the guages are destroyed, windows are broken. The reporter is safe as long as he sells the Taliban narrative.
Obamma and biden making the tailiban strong smh not my president
Those are Afghan Air Force helicopters, not American.
🌜Sundowners🌛 Dr🩺 Jill ☠
The military should have set explosives to every military aircraft.
Jesus Christ died for sinners including you, on the cross with his own blood for your personal sins, repent and get saved or perish with the lost wicked world. God's word is coming to pass, it will only go downhill
Correction: Those are ANA vehicles, not American. Without constant and proper maintenance, those are nothing more than giant paperweights.
American should destroy all their plane helicopters  vechie  and other equipment
Vietnam 2.0
May God make the talibhan soft hearted a D rule over with kindness and justice.
And still MORE helicopters and armoured vehicles sit around as parting gifts to the Taliban and their Chinese friends, no attempt to destroy this equipment and render unusable at all? I wonder how the Taliban is going to celebrate 9/11 this year? I would stay out of tall buildings in any American city.
Psaki, "He chose to stay."
I think we should buy helicopters from Afgabistan...they maybe cheaper there hehe
wonder why he wouldnt stop moving....
Ground force is found more powerful to combat air force.
MV rất hay, i like it 😙🙂👆
And the yanks leave all their trash behind. History repeating.
Real Americans would have destroyed each piece of equipment and detonated every munition. Jus sayin.
Blunder Biden 😂
Eh, let them keep it. I'm not there.
A lot of Toyota’a
Who’s working in the airport?
Still many military equipment left behind by joe biden.  Some might be damage but China will buy over and produce a bitter product, hahaha!
Je syis du Québec et je n est jamais comprie..quoi le rapport de laissé des véhicules et arme de DESTRUCTION MASSIVE sur place quand l armé crisstof sont can..sa na AUCUN sence!!c est comme si ( tien rendu trop tranquile ont va donné une chance au TERRORISTE  ) moi je trainerai l armé Américain en cours MARTIALE pour  avoir laissé des armes DANGEREUSE SANS AUCUNE SURVEILLANCE SUR PLACE!!ILS ONT FAIT EXPRÈS POUR QUE LA GUERRE CONTINUE! 0 LOGIQUE AUX PRIX QUE SA VAUX ET que les armé gaspille l ARGENTS DES CONTRIBUABLES DONC NOUS LE PETIT POEPLE!!comme si ont avaient que sa a faire avec notre argent..dans le fond c est comme si ont auraient payé des armes pour les terroristes
Hats off for reporting In this Situation
How many Afghans were killed when US marines opened fire on a crowd of people after the explosion? Or don't their lives matter? ...
They’ve got guns pointed at my head here on the news crew too. But we are ok yes! 😂
And meanwhile, in my country we don't have medical helicopters for emergencies.
Americans always leave their toys behind.
Show us what you're talking about!
In theory all those military craft have been disabled ...but then why would the religion of peace need weapons?
Well I guess all the idiots who have been claiming that Biden was leaving Americans and allies behind must feel pretty stupid about now. He cleaned up another DUMPH mess and got us the hell out of that sh*thole. Any transports or uniforms or even advanced weapons left behind are not going to do them any good. They won't know how to use them or repair them or maintain them.They won't be getting a penny from any country except maybe Russia or China. If those countries want to spend billions there fine with me.
Now the Americans have departed, the rival waring tribal leaders of Afghanistan will resume their 1300 year old blood feud. It is also worth noting ISIS and China have their eyes on that space.  There will never be peace in that country...
masyaAllah if that heli in my country it will quite sell for selfie tourism 😁
USA as stated they are not gonna get into any more nation-building Wars in the future... so basically a campaign slogan 'Must end the forever war" turns into a military disaster which then drives the foreign policy shift, you really couldn't make it up.
I've been watching TV of the flooding and downed power lines in Louisiana. This happens quite often, might even become more often. Could the lines between Sub Stations, be put underground? "Tornado Alley" might also benefit from this.  The US Government now has no excuse for pouring money into Afghanistan. It could give the states money to do this.  Undergrounding power lines might be a bit radical.  But there is still plenty of room for political corruption to make it an attractive idea. The citizens of the area would appreciate it. Possible more than the citizens of Afghanistan appreciate our efforts of the last 20 years.  The cost might be less than our adventure over there. It would employ lots of local people. And of course, that investment might last more than 20 years.
Saigon’s son
反对战争
Great job biden...in hand over every sweat....given by the people to equip the military....now it's talibans... nd leaving hundreds behind to be slaughtered by the weapons you just gave to them..GOD BLESS THEIR SOULS...
What has the American achieved after 20 years of war ??? What the biggest highlight ;they removed from power to replace them with Taliban. Plus +++ the gifted the Taliban and airforce a complete fleet and latest weapons .
Taliban sponsored by the U.S government and Toyota
The good thing is the journalist  is covid sevure he made a choice and went to Afganistan to be free from the mask and vaciness :D
Why the need to dress up, do your reporters wear kilts reporting from Scotland. Adds nothing!
Why this guy seems to be happy? The way he reports  feels like a Taliban propaganda news reel
Why the hell is this Frenchie smiling?  No, respect for the KIA French soldiers many of them were FFL that were killed over there!
They hate America BUT they want to live in America and Europe
Who is a terrorist USG or Taliban?  They destroyed everything as they evacuated!  Shame on USA It's allies.
Russian Hind helicopters?
Some international arms dealer is about to get FILTHY RICH. Look at all that equipment.
nice choice of clothing by the reporter
Did they leave our military equipment and trade for gas and oil
These weapon were given over a long period of time. They were not given to Afgan forces in last 6 months, but in past 10 years.
Why do we get so upset that our enemies use our weapons like they stole them? We do sht like this. What can we even get mad about?
america@looser
Rush to Craigslist US Helicopters for sale
none of those vehicles work
Enjoy your stay with the Taliban.  Careful,  they enjoy and get a thrill out of Terrorism killings
It's funny how everyone thinks the vehicle s will still work 😂
the yanks had to go home get there vaccine shots, dont worry they will be back, poppy picking time
What a waste.
Taliban Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
FALL OF NATO: A picture speaks.......
No they will leave for a while they just wanted taliban to become stronger. Then war games starts again. Money money money.
Based on what the reporter is saying it had a small ceremony of some kind when a team of US special force shook hands with Taliban and handed over the airport before the final fight took off, perhaps thanking Taliban for safeguarding their safety while conducting the withdrawal.
Now is the time for the USA to strike!  Air bomb that country 24 hours a day 7 days a week for 30 days till the sand turns to glass!
Biden making us look weak..
Peaceful atm I hope it will last forever. Talibans new toys looking good or were disabled already?
BRUH taliban out there flexing like it's an episode of cribs with US military equipment 🤣
This is all done by design. Leave weapons and gear as to have an excuse to continue the wars! NOTHING can be taken for face value. My heart goes out to all  military personell and Afghans who had hoped for a better future.
Unfortunately, this reporter identified one of the Afghanistan Blackhawk helicopters as it an American Blackhawk. The Afghan markings are the same as the Soviet-built Hip-14 in back of him.
Nobody wants to take responsibility so this is what happens
The new Taliban, sponsered by Joe Biden and Toyota Land Cruiser.
I love how they were all destroyed before they were left. They will never fly again. Those dummies can barely read let alone repair million dollar aircrafts.
Why destroy all the aircraft instead of flying them out of the country? What a waste of American taxpayers money.
Could have burned this equipment in addition to disabling it.
Did the Taliban really think they would have left that equipment in proper working order? I am disappointed that they didn't have thermite on a delayed fuse in all that equipment. As for all the working equipment they have, good luck getting spare parts for it.
Taliban used junk yard now open
Reporter very good English very clear
Yes, the beloved pets and service animals that were left to die horrendously at the hands of sadistic, psycho terrorists.
Good luck Afghanistan.
Dear reporter plz give my msg to Talibaan
Ask Talibaan plz dont do any wrong to ur people. Lovingly assure them. Love them. Dont go against education. Dont heat people children ladies. Distribute love to them. Do progress in the country. Let educate all the people may be boys or girls. Let them become Dr Advocate engineers nurses teachers etc. If no education then third power can attack. And grab. So be power ful with education plz.
Love that they trashed the planes
The only thing that these Aircraft are worth is The Taliban taking pictures in them, 😂🤣🤣😂 Good luck trying to get the parts for them, 😆😅😂🤣😭
Who won? We are victorious? Looks like the Taliban did ok too. Billions worth of equipment to sell or use.
Afghans r born warriors. Shame on usa n nato, they fled like cowards. Dirty "War Capitalism" of west
That's crazy they got free military vehicles,weapons,aircrafts,dogs,technology
its very smokey around there common weather
They want a few western reporters to be there to show the I ages of the leftover equipment and the fact that the Taliban own Afghanistan.  Then when the Taliban don’t need the western press anymore they will kill them.  This man in Afghanistan is a puppet.  I pray for his safe return to his home country.
Thanks biden
I just do t get it.what was the point. So many who fought. I support our troops but don't get it.......
they should destroy these weapons and air crafts which are cause to million of people's death.
😁
Taliban doing inventory.
Bomb the equipment
I mean if you dont need those helicopters Ill take one
It seems as though when the media continues to push a narrative for clicks, people think they actually care. Ask yourself, do you really care about that country? That country will remain in the stone ages.
Look at his english.. learned english and got free airport 😂👍
The defiant seal morphologically muddle because chef cosmetically scream absent a cautious character. superficial, worried sheep
good job biden way to give all our taxes to the enemy 😀👍
WeThePeople Will NEVER Forget 8/24/21
i get it now... "build back better"; it was never about USA.
It's one thing to take over an airport and government. Wait until they have to govern that mess. 39M people. That should keep the black pajama guys busy.
U.S.: *leaves* France: lemme come and report that
is he okay??
What I don't understand is why did the Americans not blow up the weapons. The Taliban have allies that may help them rebuild build those planes
sussy amongus
Hahahaha
Of course the left behind equipment is payment to the taliban for something. For allowing the US to draw back without fighting and for providing security?
Why thought they hate everyone and want everyone killed
Tribal people can't form a national govt.
Can I get a rip in the chat
so the country is evacuated?  k, the nukes are overdue, turn that sandy cesspit to glass!
I don't know how anyone can defend this president anymore im sorry but looking back trump wasn't that bad after all
I'm so glad we left all that stuff behind so next time we have to go back and fight them it will be more of a fare fight now...
Maybe now WW3 will turn nuclear...
"We can see that it is completely empty, just over there."  *Camera person does not pan to show wtf the reporter is describing that is just behind them....
This might be the worst loss in American history
Will the Taliban face any challenges against the ISIL-K ?  I guess they will now realise how hard it is to control and form a government
USA we didn’t lose Afghan war we quit n going to start another war ? so to make weapons companies richer why ? Congress senator president n major general get kick back become multi millionaire
When are we going to impeach this President this is ridiculous.
The most ‘powerful’ army in the world taking L’s in wars continues. US not in my top 20 powerful army book.
I’m glad they pulled out what a waste on those peasants no education no government keep that money here for all us working class citizens.🇺🇸😃
Biden and everyone else who pushed this abomination of foreign policy should be in jail.
Military should have burned all the helicopters,planes,humvees etc.
His last week of his life.
come in play with all the free toys.     BOOOOOMMM!!!!!
Biden left the Taliban 85 Billion Dollars worth of weapons, everyone who voted for Biden, this is literally on you
Thank you Mr. President Joe Bidren....it looks like you can plan your retirement sooner than expected.
We, The American People, must HOLD those who needlessly sent our sons and daughters to DIE FOR NOTHING while they wasted trillions of US TAXPAYER dollars accountable and they must be punished!!  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!
*The West had a watch, the Taliban had time*
What is being done by the Taliban security forces to ensure the safety of overseas journalists still in the country?
Nice of our government to fund and arm the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Stupid of eveyone on capital hill involved . I say fire them all Biden is not a good president.
nathan4567  NO, Biden is NOT the cause of it, try some actual research
News report thats that the US Military is not airlifting Canine Soldiers?? This guy mentions dogs being left at the airport, very disturbing to hear.
They could’ve flown those helicopters to wherever the US was evacuating to
Biden has left  $80 billion of US Military equipment to Taliban, and now making deals with TERRORISTS. I mean f*ck me if this was Trump the world would be in Outrage, he always looked out for America's safety. The world wanted him impeached for less, Trump wanted to leave but do your research Biden ignored month on months of Taliban advances on Afghanistan leaving $80 Billion in weapons, if you think Trump would ever do that your Delusion is Sickening
the press are kind of getting on my nerves to be honest.. they seem to be getting such a buzz out of getting a scoop.. and they are terrible at presenting context.. like there must be afghanis who are more qualified to present there stories authentically with facts .   Journalism shouldnt need these tourist reporters any more
now pakistan and iran can deal with the taliban
Can't give healthcare to US citizens but can give the Taliban millions of dollars worth of guns, explosives, vehicles, technology, aircraft... Nice job, USA.  What a joke.
Funny guy…laughing all the time….lol
Biden hat Amerika kaputt gacht
Looks like a dismantled engine bay on that one. The others look Russian. None of those choppers are airworthy methinks.
Leaving those weapons behind legitimizes the Taliban. No way the Biden administration doesn’t have something bigger going on behind the scenes, they can’t actually be that unbelievably stupid.
After training and giving arms and ammunition they left.
Completelly humiliation for Nato and U.S !
Am glad they destroyed those shoppers
This reporter somewhat look and sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger, not sure if he is the younger brother!
The US Service dogs have been abandoned at the Kabul airport.
The Taliban should make the US embassy a museum. Lessons to be learned with a marker: It's easy to swallow the Afghan bone until it gets into your ass and rips it up within
Cowards run away claiming to be the most powerful military in world history. A people with Faith AKs and their lives defeated 54 nations. Faith in Allah and His Messenger proved them right
ISIS will overthrow them shortly
It is extremely ridiculous to watch them running like that
I really enjoy reading the poor grammar and spelling from all the commenters on this channel. Also, trying to read them in English using their native accents.  "Are you French? Of course, why do you think I have this outrageous accent!" - Monty Python and Holy Grail.
Drop a few bombs on the military bases to really render them unusable. That should put a cap on any major use of the billions of military resources we happened to leave over there. It's not like we held any bombs back when we were drone striking before. What would a couple more do?
Usa could have helped less fortunate countries with all that money (charity) and today they wouldve had peace of mind happiness. But they took wrong road killing thousands of innocent people soldiers both sides. İn İslam tells us if you save one life you save whole of humanity, and you will be rewarded by Allah(God). But if you kill one innocent  life you kill whole of humanity. USA done it wrong and so did terrorists of all kind. They will sure answer for this to Allah(God) just terrible.
Selam to Taliban and Afghan citizens will DUA for them for better living all the best, we will help them  financially to get the homeland well again. america just used them for their own gains. Good bye forever USA trouble makers.
OK Taliban ball now is in your court.
Why people from other countries have to dress like them - and when they go to other countries they don’t?
The difference between American soldiers and Mujahideens is " They rely on CREATION, We rely on ALLAH (the CREATER).   Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah 😠👍. Haters gonna hate,but truth is truth.
So America just left those vehicles and weapons just like that?...The  US has a lot of money to waste
Weapons of war left behind to be use against one self. Idiotic move!!!
Just leave them with billions of dollar worth of military equipment, crazy!!!!!
With that amount of money every homeless person in America could've been homed.
Dude got guns on him smh
I've heard of the Taliban, who is the Talibans? Oh nevermind he just doesn't speak well lol.
they didnt leave them. they sold them to the taliban for a knock down price as all of afganistan money is in a bank in new youk
Reporter: “Are you safe ?” Guy live at Airport: “Well, this is the key question. “
Biden:  finally, we got our fat a$$ out of that sh*thole afghanistan.
This reporter body language  obviously shows that he is a pro taliban.
These aircrafts and vehicles have been confirmed to be non-operational. They basically have junk!!
Those who are crying for the destroyed equipment left behind US armed forces, please help Taliban by taking those trashes to your home. France Govt. can airlift them to The Élysée Palace.
This is power of Islam
Americans arming the Taliban for when they are ready to attack Pakistan.
Seems like everything in control . Good luck Taliban
They want the world to know our SHAME
See reporter dress....quickly adapted talibani dress code for men
I'm ashamed of my American government, not my country.
Looks like Afghanistan military helicopters to me…
Why they left choppers for the taliban at Kabul Airport :D...loko
It would have been a very simple order to burn or blow up the vehicles. Just a simple, military order.
U.S abandoned all service dogs / their locked in plastic pet carriers/ in  hanger behind reporter right now. Troops were going to humanely destroy BIDEN said no.
The inside of Kabul airport looks like the inside of Biden's mind.
Biden another total boob elected by Democrats.
Welcome ISLAMIC EMIRATES Afghan
Afghanistan is better than usa
Professional army to ragtag army: We will equip you with some aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and so on.
The airport will probably get bombed when its full again.
It took 25,000 military personnel at DC to transferred power from Trump to Biden but run like a dog with its tail between the legs when dealing with the Taliban
My views about US has changed for the worst .Even psycho Kim Jong Un sounds more sensible than US politicians .
Couldn't they just take their toys back ? Shame in name of superpower
you know that all those aircraft have been destroyed and are not operational
Give them more things to. Create terrorism
Taliban  won war
No plan just cut and run.
America lost  war
Why just leave millions of dollars worth of vehicles to your enemy , but look every place The USA has been just fu$ked the place and left     Gee you Americans are voting the wrong guy for your military, all that money ,one helicopter left behind could feed millions of Americans . So sad
Afghanistan pepal Halp
Why weren't the choppers flown. Out.   all had to have pilots. Well i guess Bidon wanted to leave a gift
Why they didn’t blow the cars and choppers and weapons 🤨🤨
It seems that President Biden made a deal with the devil
Nukem
Here you go. Some old guns some cheap gear. And yes transport carrier helos that have been disabled.  Relay off
Joe Biden being the US President, could have changed it. Is US not capable of that, being a superpower against a Terrorist Group?
Free of Afganistan 💪💪💪
Lesson for USA , stop invading ,  stop invasion to other countries ...
Muslims are not crusader our forgiveness everyone
They also left a bag of shit in the broken toilet for the Taliban to collect.
They might have been left with aircraft...... but who’s gonna fly them??? Where’s the spare parts and maintenance? Ain’t gonna be too much use to them....
There is another military airport meant for Afghan forces to use and was operational but not a lot. Besides, I doubt the Taliban has fighter pilots or the mechanics to keep them operational. However, they can sell them to other terrorist countries.
We are paying too much taxes to idiot goverment who pisses it away.
In spite of such massive criticism of US abandoning high tech arms into the hands of Taliban for days, yet US forces scooted leaving all weapons into the hands of Taliban. Looks like an intentional act. To destroy peace of Asia forever. If US thinks this act will not reach US shores, then they are sadly mistaken. Sad.
Why the hell did we leave stuff there? Granted, I’m more concerned our troops get out safely first, but leaving choppers there doesn’t seem all that smart. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Hope those birds are destroyed.
Arnold Schwarzenegger reporting 😂😂😂
Afgan people buy this,  old technology anyway
Hopping I will see a great tax cut . My adulterated girl friend got :  The house The car  The bike The motorcycle  The boat The kayak.
Hahahaha
We had lost this war to the Taliban, inconceivable.
Elections have consequences! This is what happens when they get to dupe the public with manufactured wokism and racism and distract them- innocent pay with blood and sweat while the ruling elite laugh at the stupidity and enjoy their privileges on tax money. This would never have happened under President Trump.
America to afghans: we will be back Afghans to America:u hv already shown ur back😤
Will the Russians and Chinese be able to repair these helicopters?
People now is sad. because the war is at end.
Pentagon has a new budget every year.
So what about the Northern Alliance? The Tali are having there arses handed to them by the Northern Alliance.
Afghanistan 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Friend of mine said place smells like kfc..... The stink of chicken is starting to fade now.....
Taliban and Afghanistan are perfect together
taliban bragging, because biden is a coward. his boss obuma made a dea with them,l when they where turned loose from getmo.
I wonder how proud of himself China joe is. Now that he has armed the enemy
What stupid report is this? He is not saying anything important
The US marines leave no one behind. The American president only leaves Americans behind. He is a criminal.
Those aircraft have been rendered inoperable by US Forces, they’ve been gutted and destroyed.  👍🏼
Dont understand why they did not blow the whole shit up ?
Please check the Indian map & make it correct.
Cyril is brave for being there.  At the airport.  With the Taliban.  It would be difficult for me to take this assignment as a reporter.
That's how you speak when you're scared as shit....a lot of blabla but nothing new
Imagine how the soldiers that lost limbs and the families that lost family members in the war to take over Afghanistan during the early 2000’s feel. Seeing that all their effort was for nothing but to empower the same enemies they fought.
They could have used a half dozen C5 Galaxy aircraft to load the equipment on. Not sure why they wasted these expensive aircraft/vehicles.
We would like to volunteer Jo-Joe to  go check it out, in hope that he will certainly forget his way back home.
As we left the taliban weapons and technology tactical trucks and black hawk helicopters 👍
Trouble maker degrade
The US left departing gifts :) how nice!
Why can't USA send a missile destroy all of these
Love u taliban
Why doesn't the cameraman show us the surroundings rather than just holding on the reporter? Dumb!
It will Become a Taliban paradise, maybe a new vacation spot for the French.
This hurts, leaving all our equipment over there.  Billions of Dollars and Americans struggling everyday trying to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads.  So Wrong!
muricans have always ridiculed  how quickly france surrendered in ww2 ,  this is your chance now    :P
Bet left many ammunitions, choppers & etc...leaving Taliban's more weapons, free cars & weapons. Thanks to our leaders now supporting talibans to stronger foes & army ! EVIL reign indeed...
Thanks US for gifting a terrorist organisation with aircrafts , modern guns , armoured vehicles , night vision kits etc
Victory my ass🤣 taliban would have been wiped out if usa was after them in the first place
When will Russia and China walk on in
Why didn't they blow that shit up
When reporting you have to show the areas and situated place not  your reporter 🙄
Whats with the night shirt look?
Nice job Old Dudes Biden.
Useless toys, if you can't fly or maintain it...
Doesn't look like the Kabul airport is victorious itself.  its a real mess there.  Looks to me they don't know what to do with it, logistics & operation.
Well- not a single mural of George Floyd anywhere ?  What's up with that?
What if taliban enters usa with a US 🇺🇸 painted chopper n attack...
I've heard alot of helicopters and vehicles have been demilitarized
That money could have been given to the population of the United States and helped many families in need.
The US is paying for an excuse to fully invade the middle east.... give them weapons to be a threat so we have an excuse to attack
A Wiseman will not give a weapon into the hands of a madman. Is Biden is not.
US tax payers should be upset
Why they didn't burn the abandoned equipment
They should now bring some Chinese and Russian expert to reverse engineers whatever the American left so they can create better version
sad!
Examine Trumps plan and Biden’s plan. Trump not only had conditions but would have left the airbase intact with additional support if needed from the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet. Biden cut and ran.
Question:  if talibun takes over, wouldn't there be a power struggle vs Isis?
Just wished President Obama remained the US President. Under his planning, SEAL's took out Osama Bin Laden, just imagine if he was still the President Of USA, this would have never happened and US forces are very elite, he would have ordered them to push the attack on them
Can’t believe they left army supplies behind. Absolute stupidity by Biden.
The democrats  planned this crisis they need to be hold accountable
Celebrate victory 😂 yall didnt win shit our boys and family came home after 20 years making sure your government doesnt kill innocent people, welcome home fellas,
भारताचा नकाशा चुकीचा दाखवला आहे
Helicopter is going to be a museum piece 😆
Why US left their weapons,bomb it  destroy weapons with talibant
And out stuff is still there why?  Ugh.
Someone was paid a lot of money to leave this stuff behind. Choppers could have been flown home
That equipment will be very useful to the Taliban and no one thought about that?
The only reason why the Taliban allowed news press to report in the airport especially on the tarmac was because they knew the image of all the abandoned equipment would bring more humiliation towards the U.S. they’re practically flexing to the media
Those are not American helo’s.  You can tell by markings...
Backstreet Boys reunion.
Mr reporter you are more happy and excited  than Taleban..
The world is owned and run by filthy rich psychopaths who dont give a rats ars about yours or anyone elses lives. These are the pigs in power. Work for them , bleed for them, die for them ! But never wake up to their machinations and lies . Long live Man dead !  !
Vallagche sobay akhon taliban er dress poira ghure It’s funny everyone is now wearing taliban clothes  #Aladdinmothafuka………
For Biden, the top priority is to use the 20th anniversary of 9/11 to take a victory lap as the president who ended America’s longest war. He left Americans and allies behind, collateral damages of his cynicism.
白左的同情心泛滥，迟早要引火烧身，它们人少的时候会努力争取权利，一旦它们的人数众多的时候，它们就要你遵循它们的一切。你们不愿意遵循它们的意愿，它们就会选择杀掉你们。
The thing is no matter how advanced you are, Afghanistan can never be conquered. It's a money pit not worth the attempt. Hopefully this can signal US politicians to stop sticking their noses in places it doesn't belong. Too much man power and money wasted on this never to change country.
All these equipments helicopters- waste of tax money. Politicians don’t care because it’s snot their money , it’s people money
白左的同情心泛滥，迟早要引火烧身，它们人少的时候会努力争取权利，一旦它们的人数众多的时候，它们就要你遵循它们的一切。
🇺🇸🇺🇸🎩🎩🎩💩💩 gamers
After 85 billion usd equipment they leave more chopper wow just wow
The best way for us to have disabled the choppers would be a small satchel charge. Preferably with a full load of Taliban leaders aboard.
The CLOWNS are everywhere.
What is with the American English and all other allied countries equipment  and gear you can't rake it cause you don't have the time or equipment to do so fine but atleast disable it so it can never be used again
im surprised they didn't destroy everything there
All my taxed dollars just left behind
More gifts for da Taliban
Now let's see the Talis fly 'em
Lol american taxpayer money arm dealer in white house will be happy with new order
gonna be getting nice lovely airsrike soon by the RAF
Entire base gets shut down for one peace of serialized gear but it's OK to leave millions of dollars of equipment in enemy territory.  😕
USA! USA! USA!
Hey I paid for those vehicles!
20 years later, Taliban is much richer, thanks to American taxpayers. The transition is on time and peaceful all considered.
Now bom the shit out of it
Value of Military Equipment s and Armaments left by the US in Afghanistan 78 Billion USD .
More like Far cry 4 game.  Now we need an American born Afghani to destroy the Taliban force.
They should of destroyed  our equipment
If anyone is concerned with the taliban owning old US military equipment, look up the advances in technology that american military contractors like Lockheed and Northrop grumman are doing. 🇺🇸
Biden should be left there
I feel like they're leaving some of those expensive choppers there as some form of a gift to the Taliban or something
Could the Americans possibly have been brilliant enough that those left behind vehicles are packed with explosives and when the Taliban goes to use them we can donate them and blow them up?
He looks more happier than those who left the country.  Talibans must be going a good job than the Americans.
Destroy that damn air field!!
The Americans humiliated themselves and continue to do so with their comical rhetorics. The Taliban did what any freedom loving people would do if invaded and occupied. The rest is all propaganda. Humility and patience has been the hallmark of the Taliban Leadership interviewed so far. The Taliban seem determined to rebuild their country and get back on their feet. Any sane nation having suffered for such a long time would want that.
The Taliban has captured a 1000 young Afghan girls-has tortured young males by breaking fingers reportedly!
those choppers have been demilitarized and will never fly again.
They left the dogs. Just like Saigon.  Makes me sick.
Should have scuttled those choppers 1st
Somehow all western journalists are free and safe to move around and report on how bad it is 🤡
All helicopters and small planes were disabled before the last american planes took off.
all is deception from all sides !
Now Taliban purchase spare parts from USA.
World police bowed down to a terrorist group.
Should of thermite grenade each vehicle and bird left behind.....the US left them "inoperable" but yet left enough of them behind so they can piece them back together with all the spare parts
the repoter is sham all aircraft and military vehicles have been disabled
Those aren’t American helicopters…
Afghanistan defeat, A Vietnam repeat !
US hawks are looking elsewhere to save their superpower image. Venezuela, Cuba or Iran. They can't afford to touch nuclear capable North Korea. China is a different menu to handle. US must just focus on building shelter to their homeless and poor in USA. It's worth spending billions or trillions from people's tax.
Don't worry, one of those countries, china, russia, iran would be more than happy to sell weapons to these terrorists.
Loser America. Mass murderer biden.
It's so bad. that pos biden lert them all this and they still took lives and will never pay for it. i am just sad
I love this reporter
Trust me usa won't understand until other countries start bombing usa
I hope in my heart that  they have changed and will look after their people and their beautiful country
Help to panjshir.... Help to panjshir... Help to panjshir... Help to panjshir... Help to panjshir... Help to panjshir...
Mass migration OUT says a lot…
Our military working dogs were left there in kennels!
Great reporter i see him in French version too.
They didn’t win, when the us was leaving the taliban came out of their hole they’ve been hiding in for the last 20 years. The war was pointless, mind you that the Afghan military is the one that lost.
Free Palestine
Hi
Why the hell is the military leaving helicopters, that's blatant waist of military money. We pay to much taxes for military to give away our equipment.
Russia hate Putin since the United States government is a worthless piece of f****** trash can you please fly over there and drop some bombs and blow up our equipment before they try to come anywhere else in her people we need the military equipment destroyed please Putin
It not there it belongs to us military I hope American go back and collect where there's
They don'nt know how to fly them but they know how to force the piolts to fly them now they don,nt need to hijack a plane Now they have planty of aircrafts for sucide missions
USA 🇺🇸 was not our friends the were killers of Afghanistan 🇦🇫 it’s shame on USA 🇺🇸
Nah america leaving that is kinda suspicious?
Ya can you imagine. We left all them service dogs behind. And what makes it 10× worse they are still in the cages on the tarmac out in the sun.. No food. No water... Not only did Biden disgrace the World. Some American Soldiers are disgraceful also.. Shame on them...
Should have blown the airport up.
Remember only the military industry in the murdering terrorists who make money off of wars wants to continue wars and killing of the human race the military industry needs to be eliminated off the planet earth. For the human races smart enough now to bring peace among humans. We must move into the universe with intelligence honoring dignity the military industry must be eliminated from the planet Earth
That's not an American chopper. But yeah sure
Those are American made but handed to Afghanistan Government which now left behind "abandoned" by afghan forces
So they hooked them up with even more vehicles and weaponry
How about the REST of the Americans there??????
Allot of armored vehicles just roaming around🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Afghanistan is the unique country. Afghans will wait for some time...may be even returning to the normal life. But once they realize Talibans are not doing good, they will kick Talibans out.   This has happened repeatedly in that country.
USA and is people I give One advice if usa investment Taliban 20 year before not spent belion dollar wrong people Hamid Karzai asharf gani because Taliban Sport Afghanistan people My question USA why not sport people gornamant always USA loses anywhere why because onligle people trust Taliban before 1980 fight under USA but Zero knowledge Bush make wrong policy make Taliban enemy USA .
Where are the Afghan people
Is covid in this country  ? Good health to all. Let's be safe out there EVERYONE.
I will go alone!
Biden Admin is only getting started with chaos and death .. that's the Dem/RINO party for you .. thx Biden voters for voting this madman into office .. TDS freaks.
Hope no more war to this beautiful earth planet.
Can you imagine, Russia left loads of kit, America even more. The Taliban must be right up there with other Nations and I suppose if they wanted invade another ones, they could. That is highly unlikely though because they will first consolidate their own land and second, unlike others they don't seem to want to push beyond that. Never the less, anyone wanting to invade again will have a lot more to face then the highly successful gorilla warfare seen. I look forward to seeing China trying to wipe their eyes like they have with Montenegro and others for land grabs legally, when the Taliban is in power lol
They left a bunch of helicopters for the Taliban, but hey at least they knocked over the port a pottys....
So, it's not enough to leave 80billion including jets, we now leave more helicopters and equipment.
All the US military equipment have gps tracking that the US can locate and destroy with targeted air strikes if the taliban were to ever use the equipment against the US
Unbelievable left even more equipment ?
Why US leaved all these assets, this is a very dangerous.....
government of thugs
People would be stunned to know they shamelessly left 61 service dogs crammed up in crates at the airport.
d due process they know is kill kill kill
Mr president ur a joke since u took office it's been out of control wat have u done to help the united state s not a dam thing but destroy it while ur eating steak s an shrimp spending money living with no worry's a monkey can do better then u ......
Peace for both Afghanistan and America
alluding to the talibans
Those afghan national airforce helicopters (Mil-17 and UH-60's) look partially sabotaged, but done very rushed.
Retarded NAZI Biden just made the Taliban the 28th largest airforce in the world.
journalist flee u will be slaughtered by the thugs
Breaking news! Us to bomb Kabul airport
ALLAH HO AKBER Alhamdolillah
Those helicopters will be useful against Norhern Alliance for sure 😝
They have not taken full charge of the country, panjshir  the brave still left
Indians criticising america is quite hillarious
They must be saying to themselves now look it’s the Americans let’s take all their stuff they won’t do anything about it What a shame
Blow them up ffs
Biden WILL lose the next election
Oh joy!  A new government!  All is ok with the world. Thank you savior Joe!!  🤔🧨
Even reporter dressed up like Taliban 😂😂
Arnold Schwarzenegger reporting live from Kabul international airport.... 😄😄😝😝
Aren't those Afghan choppers, pretty sure US doesn't use that paint scheme.
I don't understand why all that military hardware needs to stay behind, makes no sense.
Them choppers have bombs in there on a timer
GOD America 🇺🇸 and the one’s who are with in this conflict  all good people we praying 🙏 for love one lost  fighting still all who’s trapped there keep it together  there going to get you home. Children of God   Now is the time
The Most humiliation ever seen in American history to be easily  defeated by TALIBAN
The choppers have been made useless, not that Taliban could fly them anyway
Great America has surrender to the enemy  I am so disappointed.
After all the wars we've fought in the past, we've never left Anything behind... something is up my my American friends
He look like mexican
Wow! Bad bad Eagle ran away from their machines!
You make people headache blah blah.
I find it hard to believe that all the gear left behind was just accidentally left there. If they really had no option but to leave helicopters and tons of explosives, they would have destroyed it all, avoiding that Taliban would gain strength. But with the doctrine of the military industrial complex, they will probably have lots of money to gain by creating an enemy with a moderate firepower that they can destroy with the latest generation weapons of war.
Biden is a true Taliban!  He is dangerous to the free world!
Yeah bring back all those military people that's committed murder and put badges And guns in there hands than cut the killers loose on the streets....... military people or veterans should never be allowed to be cops
Taliban May become super powerful from that weapons left by US.   Seems that Biden link with Taliban by giving free weapons to Taliban by this way.
After 20 years they couldn't even improve or grow stronger to protect their own people  really
Every terrorist trained in Pakistan and for  each terrorist activity, Pakistan is responsible, world community have to take note of this.
Hatsoff For Reporting In This Situation. God Bless All Of Them🙌
So after 20 years of war, taliban have more weapons than any other country. And it was left behind.
What I would like to know was the helicopters and equipment destroyed or somehow made not to function? And if not then that is just stupid on our part!
So why didn't we load those choppers with people and fly them out as well?
For all the idiots who voted for Biden save this video . He will leave you stranded in all fronts.
It's going to become a tourists oasis soon
They must burn all the equipments before they leave!
Afghan soldiers are the most weakest military in the world!
Can't see any tarmac where he is standing. That apron looks like cement to me.
First it was USSR .. Then USA  Next 🇨🇳 CHINA 🇨🇳
Cyril? A good strong Afghan name, 🤔
Good bye USA from Afghanistan
Abandoned service dogs are still there???
Maybe, the reason for leaving the equipment is to have another war? Who knows, when the wind blows?
I want one chopper.
Full control lol ok
joe gives em billions in weapons, at the same time wants to take mine.....lmao... yeah, sounds about right for this illigitimate fool in charge.
It starting to look a lot like a Taliban Christmas! Isn't this the 3rd time having to run from the truth history has taught us?
The wee shite bags come out of there rocks 😆
Seems the news anchor man's on their nuts. Or better be? Lol
Is this reporter in debt that he's risking life for France 24? lmao brave guy ngl
Ouch free helicopter too
now everyone can shut the hell up and take care of local affairs.    If the US army needs something to do they can find a road or a bridge to fix or something
This reporter in the dress seems to be excited to report that this is all going on.
taliban sell to china for reverse engineering of US weapon
they put sugar in the fuel tanks !
Everything essential was disassembled, what was left was low jacked & rfid'd down to their britches. 🤣 !  Ask the Sketchy reporter to move closer and reveal the insides, stop letting these fools play on your emotions of divisions😎..   ✨👉🙏🌏🌎🌍🙏👍✨
Don't worry about the defence system, Turkey will take care of it cause you didn't to help doesn't mean there is no other option hmmmm didn't you see what happen to Armenia?
Surely they disabled the vehicles if not there doing it on purpose
Why leave that stuff should have destroyed them..
These are not American choppers but Afghan
Such a blunder Joey has committed by leaving precious toys ...... Hail America 🥴😌......
Biden is a Coward. And an embarrassment to our country!
Surreal man...surreal
Let us know when the decapitations start.
About leaving Vehicles behind; They might have just cleared all software in the vehicles, they are totally useless without the software code in the flash memory chips. They could have a USB-key or more likely a custom portable rig for update flashing that is instructed to just clear the data in all flash chips in the vehicle. This can be used in any vehicle like tanks, planes, helicopters. This is how technology works in almost all products today so I'm 100% certain this is how circuitboards in US-Mil systems are built too. Think of it as that you have your morning egg in the fridge but they took out the contents before before leaving, the shell is there but there's nothing inside. Rebuilding that code is a task that is almost totally impossible and requires massive knowledge. Easier to build a new tank with a highly developed countries technology import it and use that instead. OR the vehicles are left operational to help Taliban fight ISIS and the US can disable the vehicles remotely whenever they like.
Please film the taliban guys flying the helicopters!!
US taxpayers are going to pay more tax
they're leaving black hawks now? Gotta give to the yanks man, for all the good shit they are creating around the world...
For people saying the taliban can't fly them they have been flying them and doing public hangings off the plane
Get out from Kabul.If something happens to you no one will come for your help. France 24 get this man of from danger zone.
Does Taliban knows how to fly them, what goes up must come down 🤣
why they cant hide or give those vehicles to other friendly country ?
ALLAHU Akbar
Biden should be impeached for arming our enemy. He’s such an idiot.
Good to see Afghanistan free from occupation time to celebrate 🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂
Democrats
It was reported as such days ago
taliban technology better than usa.
This guy must be French, right? Otherwise, an Afghan working for a French channel talking English with a French accent is just too much.....
I don’t think just anyone can fly one of those Apache helicopters. Just because you have one doesn’t mean you can run it.
Afghanistan: Laundry machine of US tax money, from taxpayers to the arms companies. which country is next?
They Run away.... They did not... Leave..... Hahaha.........
American government (Joe Biden) left weapons for the terrorists
Who is supplying oil to Taliban?
I can tell you what was left behind is not operational. Those helicopters are on maintenance and even if the Taliban can use them by stripping some for parts for others these need to be regularly maintained and the Taliban don't have the facilities for long term maintenance. These will be put on display, nothing more.
How was it actually possible for the us to just leave everything behind? Doesn’t this seem a little odd?
Samething happened to the Soviet’s aswell they also left everything behind
he was clearly being watched and listened to by the TALIBAN
They couldn't fly those choppers out to Panjshir? I'm an American soldier who is ashamed of the American government and stupid CIA.
It's like a torpedo 🤣
Now the US military industrial complex gets to sell the government   85 billion more in equipment to replace what was left behind.
Airport will become one of famous war museums for Afghanistan. Delta force shake hands with Taliban was the best part. I hope some one recorded this on film.
Don't recognize this invasion by Taliban......they are here because of their weapons .
Americans, this is where your tax money have gone to
Good luck to TAIWAN
Fk u west go home now losers
The choppers been disabled but taliban will sell them to Iran at a great price
Sue the US.
The Americans did not destroyed these heavy-duty military air planes. Like he is saying they did. Because there are leaked videos showing them working. He is BSings us about them being destroyed. Wake up America, we are being set up for the new world order.
Thliban: Thank you, G.I. Joe !
i cant believe what US and NATO did after 2 decade 1. give the terrorist a strong military equipment... 2. leave the afgan allies behind...
Us force shake hand with taliban? Hahaha shame on you America
🐐 🧨
Give the Russian two days and all these equipment will be functional in two weeks 🤗🤣🤣🤣🤗
lol all the muslims saying freedom for afghanistan now   what a joke  why so many afghans wanna flee then  ? run by a barbaric regime  muslims countries are dictated by  Control Freak  Men  simple as that
Poor Americans they get taxed just to donate weapons to their enemies 😂
All  equipment has been disabled. Hahaha !! No toys for Taliban devils..😆😂😈
Why didn't the Americans just blow the equipment up?
Only history will Judge US present govt action .... & its repercussions on World Peace.
6he UK can never trust America again .
Long live Islamic Emirate Afghanistan, Long live Taliban😊
They can’t use none of them shits 😂
Don’t forget to turn the lights off
Taliban go back to Pakistan plz no one likes u guys 🤮
Poor afghans Taliban to rule them
funny because America cannot give it free to their so called allied countries in Asia that's poor and cannot afford to buy those kind of military hardware but they gave it free to the Taliban...shit happens
Look up hanged man, flown above Kabul in US heli by Taliban. Shown for example on republic world here on youtube. True face about future
I hope the Taliban resistance can beat this
US Said they destroyed the aircraft, what they did? Formatted the software or what? We can see the choppers right?
All the effort India put into Afghanistan will be used by terrorists thanks to US
Yep Taliban got build back better leaving all our military weapons thinks joe!!
Američtí vojáci tam měli alespoň nechat nějaký vzkaz, jako třeba: Děkujeme, že jste nás tu 20 let nechali. Mějste se fajn. Good luck.
The American weapons had all been demilitarised.
Wonder which country & peoples lives they ruin next . usa are pure war mongers
there not broken there is a video on the gore sites of the taliban flying with a hanged afghan soldier.
As None American I am shocked the there isn't an uprising and revolt in USA. If I was a Taxpayer in USA and my tax money was being squandered so bad I'd be livid.  It's not like all citizens in USA live at least middle class lifestyles, in fact most don't. This money could be spend so much better, infrastructure around the country is falling apart, coastal cities aren't sufficiently protected from changing weather and raising tides, many Americans work two jobs just to make ends meet, and same thing happened in Iraq, just wasn't as televised and public. If this happened in any European country there would be mass riots and uprisings against the government, people would hold the government accountable for mishandling the tax money.
America left chopper in the hand of Talibans? I doubt it . Critical mechanical parts  could been removed from those chopper, hence museum  master piece .
Biden stimmy game is strong!!
All those advanced weaponary now lies with taliban.
One  robust crop of poppy can buy  hundreds of aircraft from Germany , France , U K , Russia and China 😂👍
this reporter is a joke!!
Us tax payer money just sitting in the airport given away . could they not of just of flown or these helicopters out of there?, what a waste . hopefully they got disabled first .
Its about time to redefine the term                         SUPERPOWER.
Reporter is dancing.... Really don't understand what he is saying...
They shoulda burned all that shit up on the way out.
You just got punked by the Biden administration,  next time make sure dead people aren't voting,  just take the billions lost out of teachers salaries, they're responsible for Biden winning the election. Hollywood liberals will spin this to look like a victory,  it is a victory, for the  American communist party.
They will repair whatever destroyed aircrafts by US, they have support of Qatar, Pakistan, China, Turkey etc. etc. they will teach them and will repair these aircrafts for them, then again US, Nato forces, Russian etc. etc. will come to clean the mess whatever developed so far will be crumbled again...
Why don't you remind macron he should free  Muslims in France,  that women can't wear Hijab, men can prey to the mosque, Muslim children can't attend Islamic schools while French,  and Jewish, and any other people have their own religious schools but only Muslims were targeted in French head of state, macron shame on him, what kind of rights democracy,  freedom, liberty he is preaching fo,  when he can't allow his own citizens to practice their ownreligous rights or  believe , this is fascism,  French needs to get clarity on their own maniac menace leader macrone...until then you are stine age era...
God bless all them that did not get out :( and God bless all the ones that lost there life trying :( Biden you are a joke and the rest of the government's around the world for walking out on human life.
USA USA USA we  number 1 LOL ...run away run away
“Taliban gave away Afghanistan to the USA for 20 years on lease. They built all the infrastructure and cities. India built roads and dams. Now Taliban are taking it back improved Afghanistan with no loans on constructions. Smart strategy”  Not my comment, but I had to share it, I do have to add, they left some expensive gifts as well. That’s the best ROI possible.
It’s the TALIBIDEN
This is taliban propaganda.
India's map is wrong ⚠️🇮🇳
America should never ever go to middle east county cause their military loving death more then their army love their wine and life....thats how islam military work... Allahhu Akhbar ❤️
Non functional machines for zombies
The civilisation which has been ruling the world for 300years come to end
its kinda like a scripted situation that they ley left almost all their military assets in afghanistan.
2:30 the most irrelevant question
Why didn't they put C-4 explosives on every piece of equipment before they left and destroy it all , I remember the navy seals did that after they were exiting Bin Ladins compound
US left them more helicopters? Let's see the airport! Not just the reporter. Something is strange.
Shame the US weren’t able to mount an operation to take back the vehicles and aircraft “left” by the Afghan forces. I somehow doubt the Taliban will have anyone well versed in flying any of the choppers or aircraft left behind. It’s not as if you can just pick up these skills.
Investing in crypto is the only big chance of making money
What a humiliation. The enemy playing with your toys.
Thanks to this reporter taking a big risk to bring this report.
Terrorist running a country, what can go wrong ?
Finally freedom of living for afghans. Not the freedom which American say Congratulations to afghans
And just off camera are 20 fleabags with AK-47's pointed at him.
Great reporting
This equipment was given to the Afghans for they're security guard and have now been disabled according to the Pentagon.
The year before the US invasion there was zero opium harvested in Afghanistan. After 20 years occupation the US says Afghanistan is the source of 80% global supplies for heroin.
@0:14 ..Uhhh... yea it's quite an amazing scene we are experiencing with my....😓...uuhhhhh....my...uhh 🤔🤔 💡..YEAH....My Afghan Colleagues.🤥 .Yes that's what they are😁🤭🤭
What a horrible reporter and a loser too. Show the god damn airport and the surrounding area. We do not want to see you jackass!
All the men are now in the west.The west will soon become an Islamic Republic allahu snackbar
They ain’t USAF choppers those were Afghan army choppers no us markings on them
Why are helicopters left ? Hope they are stripped of flight controls
Who cares f em
"The airport us completely empty except some dogs and the Taliban". You repeat yourself.
Incompetent Biden so generous to leave billions of equipment to Taliban. USA is a joke and dumb to have a weak president
US tax payers money 💰 😭
This is Repeat somalia but in diferent situation   " BLACK HAWK FREE" 😂😂😂
Why is the American military leaving all this equipment like holicopters and other machinery we the tax payers paid for these machines, don't leave them there for these people to use against us blow them up or something but don't give them up for free
Don’t come to America your not welcome here!
1:45 handshake with Taliban
Biden should get the Noball's piece prize. At least he ended a useless war, Unlike Obama who started two new ones.
they intentionally left the vechicles, thats the trade for evacuating people
They have been disabled. Pentagon has confirmed.
I do hope that the American Forces really DID decommission those helicopters, vehicles and other equipment, because, looking at those behind the reporter sure look good to me.
Congratulations to all Afghans, Taliban particularly for independence from the foreign rule.
I'm loving it Afghanistan for Taliban  🙏
Has Biden undone the wrong done by his predecessors of his own party and Republicans or has done one more wrong? Many lives were sadly lost on both sides in 20 years. Should it continue or cease? History of ancient and modern wars show that wars always bring sorrow to all involved in such wars.
Thanks sleepy joe..you leave many equipment.
The reporter has a French English accent but looks like an Afghan.
This video is straight up wag the dog green screen bullshit..when is jaws gonna pop out
Fool Biden..the worst president of the USA, giving the terrorist thier Air force equipments..how did the victims of the World Trade Center reacts to that man Biden have done? Talibans were the ones terrorizing the USA soil, killing hundreds of innocents.
Wow $billion worth of departed gift! Way to waste our tax fund. Let’s hope Biden not raise our tax for the rest of his term to compensate this loss
Apparently the American taxpayers are funding the taliban.
When can we see the unedited videos of the last week, oh.....50 years later in a dvd release history channel special with...instead of a trent reznor atticus ross soundtrack....it will be skrillex and bassnectar....understand?
How americans nd west can claim that they are super power nd powerful military after this shameful defeat by poor talban?
Why India helps Northern alliance of panjsheer.which is so much dangerous for india. India should shake hands with Taliban.
Each of those choppers and vehicles are bugged by the way...!
Congratulations Joe! Please NO MORE US Bombing in the name of Peace.
Should have planted bombs in the choppers and set em off remotely after they start flying
Taliban are the heros deafted 40 western countries
Well those choppers are not operative, now its just a bunch of steel and aluminum.
Those are Afghan choppers. Not American choppers.
If another 9/11 or equivalent happens because of this I wouldn't hesitate to nuke Afghanistan
America definitely left them the shit equipment,85 billion for those ,good write off
The USA left all those EXPENSIVE Helicopters there...?  WHY....?  Those belong here not there, that's alot of American Tax Dollars just being left behind.
I hope the booby trapped the planes
May God punish this taliban people. They may burn alive as they kill innocent afghan lives.
Look like old relics them choppers,Fark do the even run
Why on earth leave a military cargo plane intact
It's big blander by American president, lots weapon came under Taliban control 🚁. Fool decision by a fool American president.
Im so embarrassed to be an American in joe Dementia i mean Biden's USA.
Very disappointing to see that the Americans left all these helicopters and vehicles back in Afghanistan
I’m shocked that the USA trained the Afghan Army for 20 years and they did not fight one lick . Yes our equipment should not have been left behind . But you can’t blame the President for ending this war , it was time to bring our troops home. I Don’t blame they didn’t fight for their country, they just gave in to the Taliban 😳😳😳
Run run run USA run 😂😂😂😂
Mmm... if they left all this like nothing I dont want to think what kind of "oops" might be there, lets say forgoten. Nukes for the Brutes?
I hope there is some catch behind leaving then there if not I don’t know what to say honestly.
What a joke Biden
This person is probably dead
Pointless war
Today world know that only weapons not enough to conquer
Maybe the US is clever and has remote kill switches on all the 'choppers'.
I wonder how much are the taliban going to pay contractors to operate and maintain those helicopters
Imagine all those watching are witnessing the historic humiliation of the so called "super power" in the land of Afghanistan. First it was USSR and then the US 🇺🇸 . Who's going to be the next 👀
Wow alhmdo lillah today marks defeat of all nato its allies and u.s  Allah o Akbar
Why lie they are not in full controll northern alliance??
The sad thing about this, just one of those helicopter worth millions that could have been spent on American vet's.
Loser amrica.loser france
We USA just funded the Taliban with everything they wanted.
Shameful defeat for usa nd nato the most advanced countries.
the dude sounds like frogs 🐸
We can’t blame the USA . A army was trained  , given equipment and they still surrendered. So it was time to bring our troops home . The war needed to end . I pray the people who want to leave will be able to .
danger
Frantically looking for Charlotte's kabul small animal rescue dogs. Inhumane behavior to abandon them. What a shame. Please help these hapless animals .
If they can get the helicopters there how come they can’t take them home why would you leave them with machinery like that don’t make sense to me
Friends, now the judgments of God are coming to earth so that people will repent of their sins. Accept peace with God as your Father. And accept Jesus Christ in your heart as your Lord and Savior. Who died and rose again to give you eternal life. And save you from hell and eternal torment
For all the bad things that been happening let's all hope that the new taliban will be more peaceful than its predecessors.
Why would they leave so many helicopters after losing all the other equipment previously
News anchor seems very happy presenting news control by Taliban
If all those helicopters that they could use to bring home people out of that country what a joke never would of  Happened if my president still was in office Maga
Equipment was left but does it work. I would not trust it. Interesting, an entire country that is macho.
Great you got your Islamic emirate now what ? Won’t be long before this emirate is ripped apart by in fighting. Let’s be real the rest of the world will be paying millions every year to stop starvation and poverty. Best start doubling up the planting of the Poppy’s because opium will be the only income left. That and army surplus stores
Taliban has no pilots so they will turn the metal of the helicopters into metal stoves.
Hahaha poor USA
Reporter: can you see a lot of? Me: what? Reporter: sunburn in my face
It is good they take those choppers & Armored car's with them  That's nasty
So  Sad
1 of those choppers is 10 million dollars of taxes wtf biden thx
Joker biden
what a waste of tax money to just leave all that behind. sickening...
Afghanistan is now the safest country in the world but not safe for criminals everyone can visit stay or invest don’t follow media bull shit.
Civil War Starts ~ past is precedent
Basically the tory party 500 years ago.
Wait until one day.
This situation remind me of movie "Avatar"...
Free arsenal, Armory, bases, armored vehicles etc. On behalf of the American tax payers.
There is more to this withdrawal than the general public have been told.
Now what?
one grenade would destroy the helicopter's and stop a free proper gander for the Taliban the British at least wrecked the transport before they left France in WW2 no freebies from us
Subhannallahi wabihumdihi subhanalahil azeem.... All praises and thanks to Allah subhanawatala who defeated America.
France has fake news too. 🤔
All those odd socks you lost over the years are probably in Kabul airport
Thanks Brother for Reporting love from India.
Tbh this is tactically a great advantage I understand they have weapons vehicles etc but now we know who to shoot rather than guessing.
Amirica well equipped thaliban
All the Airplanes have been disabled By the Americans.
Art of war.. silly move why would you leave your weapons
I have never heard of such stupid negotiations......The Democrats are bags of sh*****t your weapons are as important as your men. That is what you take into war fools!!! you ran and left everything on ground.
Cyril is the man
I still dont understand why Biden left the hardware..
hahaha I've never such humiliation
👍
All for nothing! Millions of people suffering and going hungry and trillions of dollars and innocent lives wasted for exactly what?
Who truly believes there is absolutely no American military in Afghanistan?!? Lol
Us with nato failed in Afghanistan
Why he is so happy 👈 showing wrong information 🤷‍♀️
They spent billions for taliban to play their military toys
Joe led the opening of what will be the largest  training camp for terrorists.  Thanks joe! 👍😀
I see a couple of Russian helicopters...
Allow Islam to spread in your country and after decades the same thing will happen.
I doubt America hold the position of world's no. 1superpower, they've already lost their ground and run like wildfires from every country they've invaded. The world has no doubt about it that American is the number one terrorist country in the world along with its associated countries those who inveded other countries in name peace installations
How can American military be so stupid to just leave billions of dollars in artillery, blackhawk helicopters,tanks,ect!!!
Should of called it the oxicontin war
You should be worries about your own countries
If he's waiting for a plane to arrive he'll have a long wait.
why is he still there
For Brutally Slaughtering Afghans In Afghan War America and Europe Must Bring Down To There Knees.
Vietnam 2. Another lost war usa. Also soviets coulnt conquer afghan in 80/90s so y usa think they could, look how its turned out for them!... wasted money and lives
Wow this reporter has not jumped into any plane ✈️ yet ? Where is BBC lol 😝 look he is safely reporting
American allies must be kicking themselves foe being US lap dogs. Australia especially must be shivering ...feeling terribly insecure and unable to fit anywhere. There is no reason to think they dare to stand alone so for the intermediate future they will cling to US no matter what indignity they have to endure!
joe biden just handed out a bunch of assault weapons without background checks.............
Man...they left in such a hurry....leaving so much behind....kinda like thieves do when the cops are on to them...🤣🤣
Figure the cost of what was left behind, and reduce that amount from their budget next time the military needs money.
Our tax money un Afganistán  ..
One US helicopter in that video the rest are Russian made/designed MI17 .  Not sure Delta Force would announce themselves either coming or going
left behind nope left for there friends the US is there own enemy
Helicopters,armed vehicles, artilleries, ammunitions left behind are gift from US to taliban
Early Christmas for Taliban
Those are not our helicopters
i dont understand why they didnt take there equipemant thats grazy
Free stuff from USA!!!! YEAH!
Shocking to see a reporter there... Talking freely...
America could have given all the wasted money to the nasa. At least they would have got some credit 😪
luckily those choppers wont fly again
China Russia and Pak defence engineer will ransack the place
Why would americans pay taxes after this equipment donation to taliban?
It seems Americans destroyed the engines and flyby wire system  of Blackhawks, the engine top cover is left open too.
Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Preis to be Allah
Atleast should of blown up the equipment left behind freaken embarrassing being a American leaving on command of terrorist fcken just pissed off leavin all those weapons and we can even have some back home 🇺🇸 fcken crazy fcken politicians
Don't forget the 50% who make up the female population of Afghanistan. Today they are losing the hard-won freedoms that women slowly but surely had gained under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan with allied support.  Don't forget about them and the lives they will lead now.
You know what the western media told you. But the real truth is what you are seeing now. Now that's what you hear from their mouths.
Now they can start war between ISIS and Taliban..🙄
Reporter joined taliban
In a press conference a general/commander said that before they left they immobilised all those choppers and ground vehicles…all of them. Fast forward a few hours after they left there was a video of one of those same black hawk choppers flying perfectly fine by the taliban………………with a person hanging by his neck from a rope.
And here I just thought they controlled our gas stations
Hehehe wow a lots of helicopters is free by the Pres Jo Biden adminstration to the taliban they so lucky to have dosen of aircraft..unlike others country they are spend billion of dollars to purchase helicopters and aircraft but the taliban they are purchase zero dollars from the US...
The us could gave carried gallons of fuel and carry as many choppers as possible
Thanks to the US the Taliban is now more equip than ever. 🤣 I hope the Taliban did not make a deal with the US to attack Xinjiang in exchange. I mean the US does not give those many weapons for free.
The Women's are facing the hardest time again
I'm sure Taliban will get bored without US. They'll miss US when ISIS terrorises them.
his accent is quite funny. The whole situation is actually very humouress if you just step back and ignore the needless deaths. They just _left_ all that military equipment there XD
silence before the storm.taliban will be nice to get acceptance from world.but after that they will show real face.
France leave us alone this is not your territory
The reporter is still Alive ?
How much does a helicopter cost?
reporter is speaking very well English.
I hop peace come back in Afghanistan
It seem like the ISIS has mutated into  a new Variant called  ISIS- K .
ALL those aircraft will be flying eventually !
Taliban should sell all that War Chest and build up infrastructure schools, hospitals, universities, that would make people believe that their is definitely a new management taking over there.
Now they have pulled out should just start a bombing campaign against any 🇺🇸 equipment seen on satellite its all in rebal hands now
What a criminal waste - don’t worry fellow Americans - you’ll pay for all this with higher taxes
It seems the fleeing Americans took the engines of the Black Hawk and inflicted damage to the Mi-17s in the reporter's back ground.
Nice try idiot those choppers have Afghan Air Force markings .  Even if US troops used them they are still the property and responsibility of ANA not the US .  So stop telling lies .
Shame on Joe Biden He embarrassed his country.,his people n put the whole world at great risk .
Here they go again unnecessarily leaving more of our equipment behind.......all our hard earned money that we slave for every day is being handed over to our enemies this is starting to look planned now 😡
Do you think talaban is basically a gang exporting drugs??  Was this a 20 year  "drug" war??
A new Hollywood movie is in the making showing the victory of united States super power in Afghanistan.
"Destroy Khorasan". Save Afghanistan.
Atleast the 🇺🇸 could've damaged those equipments n machines before leaving.... but nope 🙅🏻!!!they don't even have a kid's commonsense........
Loott complete in Afghanistan with drugs, American fleed
I like how the American news outlets aren't reporting the fact that it was U.S. military troops firing guns into the civilian crowds, according to eyewitnesses in the hospital. Typical American Zionist controlled media. Watch, Afghanistan will be a lot better now.
Theses are Russian helicopters!
Why would they leave those choppers intact to be used by the taliban?   They should have done a scorched earth on all military equipment left behind.
It’s now a peaceful state
I guess france is sad
If I was an ex Blackhawk pilot I would steal one and fly back to wherever I could refuel and keep going.85b worth of weapons left for taliban to get acquainted with and watch what weapons the USA return with.biometric scanners for taliban to check who has cooperated with USA also addresses,what level of cooperation, and if they have given vital information to the capture and kill of taliban  HVT.taliban will see them as traitors who fought with the invaders
I think that many foreigners don't know that taliban have doctors, engineers and very highly educated people in their ranks. If they call upon Muslims to help them, millions will gather for their help especially people from Pakistan, they love them and see them as heroes. They will have a powerful airforce in future.
Can't afford public health care but have enough money to just leave a load of helicopters in another country.
They can’t maintain those
Have fun Taliban... atleast you got it for free and good stuff from good company in US used it for good of your people and include the Afghan people or else your religious beliefs will hunt your forever
Failure & humiliation to Big boss ego of USA  to international terrorism ,sorry to say this.
France 24 is apologetic giving wrong breaking US leaves Afghanistan. It was indeed US flees Afghanistan! By d way someone remembers when France flees from grave yard of empires?
Long live the Taliban Determination leads to success
If you look at the nose of the Blackhawk where high-tech radar systems would be looks like the rangers put explosive devices on it and blew the whole system up.
Talibans- Making the world a HELL hoping for the HEAVEN after death 😥😥
😢
What a shame US!
Waste of money and lives because no 1 want to fight terrorism's foundation/rooting system.  #boycott Rs & Ds & Pakistan.
Finally occupied forces left Afghanistan without removing 'bukras' from Afghan women's head with best weapons and technology of 52 nations. Time to cover naked bodies of western women and taking care of dying mothers in old age homes.
What about just outside the airport? What about all of the people they turned away??
Can you trust this man or are there Taliban standing behind the camera?
The reporter looks like budget Arnold Schwarzenegger
I thought  US went to Afghanistan to destroy the Taliban not to give them arms for free.
Islam zindabad
We left service dogs in cages in the hangars with no food , really
Russia: yep I told u u mfs was always kids yea u america
this looks like world war z aftermath
Helicopter should be destroyed by US Army
" They Have Money For War But Can't Feed The Poor. "   Tupac Shakur .🤘
Can US change its evil ways ? The answer is NO. Just prelude to greater conflicts to come as American military industrial complex gets hungry for more money.
This reporter should show the picture of Airport not his face all the time.
Not so different from Vietnam, the US won the battle but losing the war simultaneously as they leave in shame.
amazing, amazing, amazing.......... France 24 reporter can't hide his glee.....
Sorry for the last guy who was in the toilet taking a 5 minute break and the flight left 😅
Finally when the Donkey leads the lions' nation🙆‍♂️
that equipment probably has been rendered less useful as it is a throwaway hinderance, unarmed combat seems to have been the major factor or generally they have their thieves emirate but I don't see the march and parade but surely you are not trying for to bring back the franc.
Why they didnt fly choppers out? No range?
U.S left those machinery weapons to Taliban's as a gift  after a defeat!
You have shown a absolutely wrong map of Indian territory of Jammu and kashmir . As a indian friend France media must take care of its friend india. You have shown Pakistan occupied illegal territory POK and Aksai chin as a part of Pakistan and China respectively . It is totally wrong . U need to Show a proper map of India 🇮🇳🇫🇷
Look republic world what happening in kabul than panjsher
Im just think about the money you can make by selling all those choppers
Last month was 1 Pakistan now 2 Pakistan, Afghanistan & Pakistan, God bless them, & give them more power, so they can stand against the Evel,
They want  US  army  vehcles War fighters, airplanes all gedgets   money extra, they donot want  education, civil Society,  development of nation
A lot American military equipment , hard to maintain , few months from now ,it will be in junk yard ,
Of course America left things the Taliban can use. Because they want to give them a start so the can have a proper war. America make money from war. 6-12 months and there will be a major war in the Middle East. This whole thing is planned very carefully.
No way will their be peace in Afghanistan. Be going back in within 5 years mark my words
What a shame! Look at those Black hawks! All taxpayers money left abandoned
Glad to see Afghanistan get their freedom. Long live Afghanistan ❤️
It will now be more stable and prosperous which will be embarrassing to America
It will permanently become desert.
Lol taxpayers
Victory....for a small mind it may seem that way For Afghanistan it's a failure as anyone with any intelligence will discover pretty soon
Freely giving helicopters ,  can i get. One
All this talk of hi tech weapons. These choppers have been around for over 40 years.
i feel like this is the beginning of the worst already and its 2021 not 2088 like come on
DAESH and Al Qaeda has no rights of terrorism in Afghanistan..let Taliban do run their country peacefully!!
Youtubes recommendation is gonna be riddled with how to fix helicopter
Why they left the helicopters¿
If USA could not win a war against few thousnds of Talibans, I think they cannot win any European Country
America is supporting and working with the Taliban, what they left behind is a grift to the new Afghan Government. The same enemy they fought for 20 years.
Ahh peace at last in Central Asia
American army in Hollywood- 🦁🐯 American army in reality - 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
Now Turkey will come to manage the airport.
So the  still left coppers for the talisman waw Biden is a genius
Seems like the Americans have done the same thing that the Russians have done, I'm predicting that in another 20 years time we will be seeing a repeat of the last 20 odd years up until now.
No one leaves $80 Billion in weapons by accident
American choppers are left there -_-
Why news anchor and reporter have identical voice....
Thank god US didn't took nuclear arsenal to Afghanistan.😉
Those black hawks are getting reverse engineered very soon in pakistan.
People forgot Cyril
Though the Americans have left the choppers and other vehicles in the hands of the Taliban. initially  it's a happy moment but, later they would face problems relating to the maintainence etc., without the help of other nations, of course China would intervene to plunder the resources. Any thing can happen!!. God bless the people of Afghanistan 🙏🙏
The journalist speaks like George St pier. 🤣
a lot US tax lose
Good to have Afghanistan in the hands of their own people.
Why would anyone want to join the army after this shambles.
Those military equipments left by u.s will be used too destabilize their neighbors that's the strategies of the u.s makes more problem to pakistan and china
The Usa have lost another war… what a pu$$y state
Congratulations to Afghanistan
The entire Biden administration is so evil 😈
This all things are only just formalities no need chopper no need bomber no need tankers no fear autumbomb missile one n only supreme power اللہ (Allah)so i request to all my brothers to join Islam following Islam 100%success in this life and hereafter death inshaAllah your most welcome
US spend lots of 💰💸 money for such useless war.why spend it for their homeless and street dwellers
Be careful what you wish for..now the Taliban have "succeeded" ? Lets all sit and watch how the Taliban create their "Islamic Utopia"...and live happily together forever....he he he he
Those Choppers seems to be totally ripped off.
Can't even put a grenade on chopper before leaving love the  cost saving initiative.. 👍
Biden left billions of dollars of armory to Taliban.... Give me few dollars and I can settle in life... Biden is a number 1 useless president.
Those helicopters will never fly again.
They have watch & we have time...
The US is awashed with war machines and munitions. Consider the 85B a generous donation.
American: we have plan  Innocent people: what plan do you have? America: I left my weapons in Afghanistan, once they start to fight together then they need more weapons then we can indirectly sell to taliban
I know him......Arnold crackzenegger
The proud have been brought low.
Pakistan zindabad
We did it Joe!!
Americans, please tell us where is the keys of the choppers?
America and its allies got pwned by bunch of ppl from mountains without proper military training xD This will be remembered as one of the worst defeats in human history, if not the worst
Pls. Pray the Holy Rosary and Devine Mercy chaplet to free all countries from war, hunger, diseases, climate change, calamities, drugs, prostitution,  abortion, divorce, corruption, vices, violence and all evil.pls pray for peace and joy in all families and home....:
America will return
Here we see Hollywood vs Reality and movie finished Taliban Made a historical victory with no blood fall they deserve a nobel prize man
Wait a minute, that's my helicopter My TAXE$ paid for it.
Fcuk the taliban
Why they left choppers
From Alexander the great to the USA and more to come... Hope not. Congratulations Afghanistan!
Before I leave I will break all of  this choppers inside electronics so that they Taliban can't use them.
Hopefully, the day America starts another ME war and then suddenly quits and leaves nuclear weapons behind for the terrorists to play with will be 6 decades from now...after I've left the earth.
Can anyone please tell me why should Americans care so much about getting their people out of their country? Where did they take the refugees? And we should have been taken out of their country since the first war
President Biden :  Americans don’t NEED assault weapons  Also president Biden:  Taliban can have it all…
Why would they leave all those equipment like this why not take it?
This is a more peaceful transition of power than Biden replacing Trump 🤣
Those choppers are Afghan army.Also, all those helicopters have been made inoperable.
Are they US choppers? I don't thinck so...look likes Russian aircraft base on outside camouflage color.
The choppers and any vehicles left behind have been ripped down to nothing. They took all the equipment and only left empty carcasses. So stop bitching
Taliban don't know how to fly them but they know how to force pilot to fly them. Afghan pilot getting a job which they can't refuse. What a mess United Snakes left.
We need to place a Biden staue in the Air port. The history will remember that donkey.
End of US occupation finally 👍🏻. May Allah bless all of Afghanistan brothers under rightful Taliban Govt.
Is this reporter is from afganistan?
Leaving valuable military assets in taliban hands is not a good picture to see, these will eventually go to Pakistan
What a wasted of my taxe money!
That's not usa choppers, it's afghan army choppers, maybe bought using us money, but it's for the afghans.. and the us didn't care leaving it behind, no secret technologies in it.. and it's not a threat to them.. it's a different story if there was F22, or F15 in there, they will either evacuate or destroy it..
Bibed is most coward and foolish  president.. don't think that USA soldier that's much coward that they left that much armor equipment... and helping terriest.. those country who tie up with USA in defence should re think about it thrice...
Now afganistan will become islamic super power and richest country after Pakistan
Living under taliban terrorist is same living in Hell
Does the taliban even know how to fly those?
Any nuclear weapons left behind is what the world must ask here
Does taliban knows about programming? Do they know how to run the airport?
Shameful!!!
I wonder if the Taliban have full control?
Deserted is what the international response and relationship shall it is feared be. But the airport is very busy with shadow people trying to flee which you just cannot see
people wondering parts wich are basicly impossible to get beside reverse engineering wich only a few contrys can do are taken out of the choppers, they will not fly and are just left to rot
Thank you Biden
those equipment doesn't work or in operating. all are damege
Reporter: ‘All left only a few dogs left at the airport’
Please check the damage they USA killer and  Bombers....have caused....
Biden and USA are a cowards !!!! 😂😂😂😂
Can't wait for a movie based on this 😂😂😂
No more bombs  The bombers been kicked out
America set up Toy R 🇺🇸 Us for the Taliban before they left.. How gracious n generous of them. 👏
Taliban better not take those helis bro....
Everything one is safe in that country.... The killer of poor people have left......
This reporter is declaring an Islamic Emirate before the Taliban have had a chance to declare one. Very proactive.
Why did they leave their chopper's. Literally the US is just funding the Taliban with vehicles and weapons.
ISIS / IS-K all creation of US 🇺🇸. They know to to destabilise other country to achieve their goals at any cost .example. Iraq,Syria,Libya..
Honestly I'm surprised that they're allowing you to report my prayers are with you that you make it back okay they have killed many many reporters
Please show the world........the damage they have left on these airplanes... They broken everything..... When ussr come to this country....you called it invasions.....
Those were left on purpose by the US L.O.L
At least those helicopters are disabled
Yet most US mass media is not reporting the real extent of this shameful, embarrassing withdrawal. As "former" allies, we must be very careful in trusting the US again. The US has created the most dangerous situation for the Western world since WW2. On top of that, we will see an influx of hundreds of thousands of Afghani refugees in Europe claiming they have been of assistance to the Western allies, whether they are "friend or foe". When will we ever learn?
Go in the building, see what is left.  Look in the helicopter to see if it is functional or broken so it cannot be used.  These are questions that people want to know.  We don't want to be told that you do not know anything.
The simple answer to that question is ,yes we are safe.
Now there will be no isis attack
Look they left a helicopter, shows an obviously disabled blackhawk (in ANA markings)
Elhamdoulilah
ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ 👏👍
2001 when Taleiban come afgan government and forces escaped the same thing happened this time
How is the journalist going to get out.
America is collapsing like Soviet Union now China emerged as world power
Bloody to much talking less scenes
I am gespannt what taliban do as rulers
Don't tell lies.... Taliban could not control the Panjhir Valley
Lol American tax payers are broke  jobless and homeless...
Well congratulations , there goes our hard earned tax dollars!
Yup screw them 😡
Wish for a peaceful country
May be some blasts to destroy left over things
They said that they Di-melitarized the vehicles and planes in Airport.
Afghanies and foreigners are more safe than during occupation....
Afghans can not be defeated.
👍
No more fight?? Americans gonna start bore now!! How can they let the world in peace???
I dont know how the americans will face the entire world after this defeat. Shameful moment for USA
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🇺🇸👈
It is better to be free in a desert with limited means than a slave in a palace .
America lost it for real meen
glad i was robbed via taxes to buy them all that shit...
Now Terrorists will have its own 'State of the art Air Force'...wow!!!
☑️☑️☑️👌👌👌🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️ congratulations to Afghanistan and taalibaan.
Idiot talk about your country there is Isis no Isis in Afghanistan Muslim country
Mashallah, Taliban zindabad Pakistan payndabad.
Failed Biden..must Resign/Impeach
I would request all international media to stop reporting about Talibans victory. These reports are pushing Indian politicians, Generals, media, analysts and general public into mental paralysis. They are having sleepless nights and appears to be at a breaking point. Please stop it, as they are use to living in a wishful thinking only their movies can calm them down.
France i warn you to not again prepare the AFGHANS for WAR
All these broke people in foreign country sitting there talking like a few choppers and some bullets are going to change our lives over here in America….   Good luck with the software upgrades and spyware we planted.  We make 1 call and Afghan is a lake.
Airport looks desert type .
U did it again…left ur equipment with the enemy like in the fall of Saigon
Wtf America
cant see no Taliban, just this nut head
Be careful mate
Great.   They have their country back.   Everyone can live happily ever after now, right?
History repeats. Over next few years, there won't be anyone except Taliban
The thumbnail of this video tells every thing!
Newsbreak: America ends war in afghanistan: The new war on Terrorism begins!.
I watched many interviews of Afghan leaders of new govt on different channels, their leaders are so generous, kind and intelligent, never seen such politicians in the world. Lets hope better life of afghan people as Afghanis  like to live.
taliban going to start killing peoples now.  and sell the chopper to Pakistan today
1991 fall of USSR due to Afghanistan invasion  2021 fall of USA due to Afghanistan invasion.
When Afghan army had all the F fighter jets why didn't they fight ??And why did US leave all the ammo and jets for there granny ???
Finally islam won the war
It's a shame the 4 anti-missile auto-turrets are so high-tech.  Those defensive (mobile) installations would have been very nice to have at HKIA if the Talib dug them in.
Thanks to Al Mighty ALLAH... ALLAH Pak is The One & Only Super Power.
If colonial powers did not divided India Pakistan there would have been far better situation and US never needed to intervene even middle east would be in peace.
The American Army ware using the same helicopter & equipments for self defence till the last minute. They didn't got enough time to disable.
people aren't leaving Afghanistan because of Taliban but they are leaving because of American false flag strikes America is still hitting civilian even Taliban are better than America,the prisoner released by Taliban gave interviews in favour of Taliban and they praised Talibans.
Winking, "Blinkin" and Noden Biden
No full control of afghanistan  don't lie still panjsher left to conquer
If it will be heaven after Taliban take over, why Afghanis try to leave Afghan??
War is n the Horizon my people.
Years ago when Russia invaded other countries US called that occupation but when they do the same they call that war. But it`s ok, now US can finally start war inside there own country.
Congrats Taliban
Look at that gentleman, looks like Taliban mate😂
Dirt of European brain, “they are playing everything is safe”
The American Afghanistan Mission Service medal. A big shiny "L". The Taliban have already sold those choppers to the Russians and Chinese, for detailed "inspection". In a few weeks they can be renamed "Flying Coffins".
American Army given save  exit  to escape death after defeat .
Congratulations👏👏🎊🎊Afghanistan .let peace reign in Afghanistan. Peace peace from 🇿🇦South Africa 🍷✌✌
Afganistan population refuse to accept an alternative way of living. Have fun with the Taliban take over. U.S. didn't lose. Afganistan lost. If U.S. went to an all out war TODAY Taliban would be reduced to ashes on the Desert. God Bless America ( except Joe Biden and his crew )
Now they will again start living in caves
Why Desh doesn't go to Pakistan???
Mashaallah it's look like Ertugrul win karajesar qela
USA govt is ediot (Joe Biden) Trump was good in matters of international diplomacy.  These American weapons will be now used to spread terror in India and America.  #SanctionPakistan
One of the greatest victory in history
So who is next? Iraq? Syria? Libya?
A great day for all terrorist organisations in Afghanistan and in Pakistan
Freeze the foreign assets....
French English you Showing Worng map in your Video Kashmir is part of Pakistan
The last breath of americano empire
Congratulations to Afghanistan’
*USA LEFT ARMS OF 80 BILLION DOLLARS. 600000 AR.. .. 75000 ARMED VEHICLES.. & EVEN THEY GIFTED TALIBAN AIR DEFENCE SYSTEM WITH 200 AIR CRAFTS..* _WELL DONE USA_
Imagine just 2 of that chopper hover around pajnhir? For sure they need to figure out how to fly that asap.
America still has a chance to bomb the military equipment they left behind. Something they should have done before this debacle
@1:01   You can clearly see the Blackhawk has missing components from its turbo shaft engines. The Americans disabled what they couldn’t take and the Taliban can barely read. Do you think they’ll just be able to hop in, take off, and start mowing people down?
Why not give Talibans a few nukes for free as well?
Means this person is very happy his face really don't show any threat.... Under Taliban ..... His soul is happy..... Means his body language show...
Alhamdulillah.
گروهء طالبان یک پروژهء استخباراتی-نظامی پاکستان برای فرستادن افغانستان به قرون وسطی می باشد و با افغانستان و مردم فقیر آن هیچ پیوندی ندارد. افغانستان از سوی پاکستان اشغال شده است و دربارهء سرنوشت آن آی اس آی تصمیم می گیرد، نه افغانها.
Tôi đến từ Việt Nam. Everything will pass, peace to them

Look,  The whole world seems to be turning on Joe Biden. While he and Kamala both have been seen to be attempting to laugh it all off, the recent actions with how his administration has handled Afghanistan have resulted in Republicans and Democrats alike questioning his ability to lead the United States, while leaders from around the world speak out against his decisions.  Days after the former President Donald Trump held a massive rally in Alabama, Biden seems to be losing more and more support from here in America to the world abroad. While many want to see a return to true leadership from the United States, the current leadership seems to be continually failing in everything that they attempt to accomplish.  Between rising inflation, the massive failure in Afghanistan, mask mandates, vaccine pushing, and the continual censorship and demonization of anyone who asks questions about anything, as well as his own continual refusal to let media question anything that wasn’t a pre planned question (how many times has Biden walked away when asked questions now?), people are beginning to see through the illusion of competence that has been portrayed since the beginning of his run for the presidency and well after and into seemingly becoming elected.   In recent interviews, Biden has tried to shrug off his failures, even going as far as laughing at the situation he has helped create. In one of the most recent televised discussions, a reporter confronted Biden on his public approval.  The reporter said to Biden, “Americans wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan, but they disapprove of the way you have handled it. The poll also found that based in part with what has transpired in the last week, the majority of Americans, forgive me, I’m just the messenger, no longer consider you to be competent, focused or effective in the job.”  Biden scratched his nose and said, “I haven’t seen that poll.”  The reporter followed by saying, “It’s out there. CBS this morning.” Biden then began laughing at the thought from his podium. During a brief from the White House, another reporter asked Biden, “Do you trust the Taliban?” Biden then replied, “I don’t trust anybody including you. I love you but there’s not a lot of people I trust.” Even ABC News is revealing its concerns. During a special report live broadcast, one of its reporters said, “This very much remains a disaster and one of the contributing factors here is when you listen to the president, he is saying things that simply do not comport with the reality that we are seeing with our own eyes.”  NBC News cut away from a White House briefing from Joe Biden as soon as the first reporter asked “what is your thought process” on Afghanistan.  During a segment on Dan Bongino’s Unfiltered show, he called for the immediate resignation of Joe Biden, saying that, “The first message is for Joe Biden, our president in name only: You failed. You are a total, epic, colossal apocalyptic failure. You failed the American people, you failed our country, you failed our military, our Army, our Marines, our Air Force, our Navy, you failed the Afghan people, you failed our allies. You, you, you failed everyone. Because you were a coward. You failed. History will remember this as one of the most colossal, epic political failures in America’s history. And you did this. Not our military. You did this.” Bongino continued, “And not only did you fail, when your failures became obvious to everyone, when we watched Afghans fall off planes trying to get out of a country taken over by medieval savages, you dismissed them, telling people ‘Don’t worry, it was just a couple of days ago’. Bongino concluded, “Biden should resign immediately. Biden should have resigned yesterday, in fact, he should have resigned last week. Listen, that’s a serious message. I don’t take it lightly. If he doesn’t resign, Joe Biden should be impeached. I get what you are saying that we would be handing the country to Kamala Harris. Ladies and gentlemen, it can’t get any worse.”  Lindsey Graham agrees with this assessment, along with several other members of the Republican Party, sharing online that, “If we leave Americans behind, or if we leave thousands of Afghans who fought bravely alongside us behind, President Biden deserves to be impeached for a High Crime and Misdemeanor of Dereliction of Duty.” Americans aren’t the only ones stepping up with messages against Joe Biden’s actions in Afghanistan. Czech president Milos Zeman says, “by withdrawing from Afghanistan, the Americans have lost their status of global leader.” UK Parliament member Tom Tugendhat, who spent time himself fighting in Afghanistan, said, “To see their commander in chief call into question the courage of men I fought with, to claim they ran, is shameful.  Chris Byrant of the Labour Party there stated that Biden’s recent comments are “some of the most shameful comments ever from an American president.” A segment from Sky News Australia ended with an entire panel of reporters collectively laughing at Joe Biden. Speaking on how Americans have turned on Joe Biden and making jokes about his job and covering for the Hunter Biden laptop scandals, prostitution failures and art mishaps, they said, “Joe Biden says that Hunter Biden is the smartest person he knows… he’s dumber than a bag of rocks.”  They concluded the broadcast after laughing saying that, “The tragedy is, I suspect you were right, that Hunter Biden probably is the smartest person he knows. & there you go.” No matter if anything changes with Biden being president, I personally still wonder if Kamala would be capable of doing any better. I miss the leadership of Donald Trump, but I know that many across the nation and world would disagree with that thought. The Arizona election audit is supposed to release information this week, but looking at the past with things like the Durham Report, who knows if anything will actually move forward. The future is unknown entirely, but the moment sure is a mess This so called President is not fit to serve and his VP is not fit either. Nancy? Forget it!!! Get them out!!!! BRING TRUMP BACK. I would say, we would be better off with a dead .monkey in charge, but we already have three of them, biden, Harris, and Pelosi. So, maybe a live chimpanzee would make a better leader. Good luck America, we are going to need all the luck we can get.  This is a total disgrace for the USA the world see how we react so leaving our citizens and allies in harms way will bring us future trouble from all bullies from around the world
So France likes the Taliban in charge, you will not like it when  they turn Afghanistan into a terrorist country in which they can strike at any non Muslim country at will.
Even  for the USA the war has not ended. For average Afghans it has  intensified. For Pakistan a renewed opportunity to be a Broker with the  addition of a new client- China . For China , Russia and , may be.Turkey  , the war has just begun For the present it is Bade Be-aabru Hokar Tere Kooche Se Hum Nikle
Americans are immune to being defeated, like what happened in Vietnam...
Alhamdulillah... All the best ❤️
