Yeah after seeing this. Gt500 all the way . 🖕🏾Elanor. I noticed I liked the GT500’s when I seen them and when I seen the Elanor I always went… “what’s wrong with it!” It was the damn ugly Elenor body kit. Gt500 looks way better. more classy. I now know the difference thank you.
🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Dude don't even know when covid hit
Chip built all 15 of the movie cars.
Update?
The appeals court just ruled theres no copyrightable material for “elenor”
Wait, he says he was ready to go to court and that they would win. But then he gives them the car anyway!!!!
Greed sucks.
Chip Foose designed it... then a deceased producers wife owns it?  Mhmmm, broken court system
If u mentioned Carroll Shelby and the Ford GT you can't forget Ken Miles! Carroll and Ken built that motor to win Le mans 66!
That woman is crazy. It's a Shelby GT500 with piaa fog lights next to headlights, a bumper cover & paint. It's not a Eleanor that Shelby customized into a GT500 😂 Change one thing & it's no longer an Eleanor IP 🤷‍♂️
In my opinion the Eleanor 1967 Shelby GT500 is ugly. I do not like the fiberglass modifications at all. The 1967 Shelby GT is as it was is gorgeous. If you want a look at some proper reproductions that come Shelby registered look at Revology. Better than any other builder that's building reproductions of Mustangs. In the movie with Nic Cage when he writes down a list of all of the cars he's going to steal he has it written down as a 1967 Shelby GT500, maybe he writes Eleanor next to it IDRC but he calls it Eleanor as a nickname. Like Jim Morrison called his 1967 Shelby GT500 "Blue Lady." The original 1974 movie made by Halicki was a yellow '71 mustang that really wasn't all that special. No one even knew about it until "The Gone in 60 Seconds" remake came out. It was in the dustbins of abandoned video stores. This was one of the worst cases of lawfare I've ever seen. Foose should be embarrassed for Eleanor is the ugliest car he's ever made. I also heard that the movie's producers spec'd Eleanor to be black with silver stripes but the painter made a mistake and painted all the cars the opposite. Was it a mistake or did Foose want to paint them silver? Foose paints a lot of cars some variation of silver. Maybe he handed the cars over to production, shrugged his shoulders and said, "Oopsie!"
CONGRATS, if YOUR car hasn't been totalled, get her back. if she's gone....
Yeah, that lady can go to hell for all I care. She definitely needs to get her pants sued off of her for damaging the reputation of Shelby.
I think they were threatened by the amount of viewers you have
How many times did he say: "In my opinion"? 😂
Bullitt is the better looking '67. Period.
So, by the grandfather clause, Benz own the rights to inventing the motor car, Ford owns the rights for inventing the assembly line, Ford owns the rights for the design of the Mustang, Shelby for the mods called the GT500, and Eleanor Roosevelt's estate  for the name Eleanor, or maybe not...
Halicki is a toxic narcissistic jezebel. No different than my mother in-law. Same exact characteristics. She doesn't give a damn about Eleanor or the film. She just likes the money that Eleanor rakes in and she wants her hand involved in that. She wants to spoil herself. She didn't want their to be another option to buy a built Eleanor unless it's through her team that builds licensed "Eleanors" that don't even say GT500 on them or Shelby anywhere. Which defeats the whole purpose of an ELEANOR BUILD lol. She's such a clown and she will reap what she sows. I'm glad that you're off the hook now. Her time will come and her "looks" will fade.  If it doesn't say SHELBY GT500, it's NOT an ELEANOR. PERIOD!
Build it forget the Eleanor i know it's a good movie but I didn't really like the hood on that car good lock guys zya
Just tell them your car belongs to the Mexican cartel. If she would like you to send them her address. So the owner can stop by and discuss her concerns.
That sucks 😢this is crazy … how things work sometimes…that car is clean though❤❤❤❤
How would you take it if someone said fuck that name I don't want anything to do with or the car 😂😂😂😂 you set the tone I would be surprised if you heard someone say they want to build a Eleanor after watching this...
She didn't even design the car for the movie so why does she get to copyright it.  She's just a greedy you know what.
What four movies? I thought there was only two movies!?!?
Without the gone in 60 seconds release in 2000 there wouldn’t be a market to build Elenor clones honestly. Most people wouldn’t even know about the old Shelby Mustangs. I was born in 1984 always been a gear head, been a professional automotive technician 21 years, I was a ford guy when I was younger I’ve had classics, some of the odd ball 80’s fords like thunderbird turbo coupes and raced fix body mustangs so I was really into fords that’s why I’m saying all of this but I would never have wanted a 1967 Shelby GT 500 if this 2000 release wasn’t made. A ton of people I know would say the same thing. When I went to car shows people i know and myself would see these two GT 350’s numbers matching all original low mileage cars and think man if i bought that i would get the stuff i needed to make it like the movie and get it painted they just don’t look as cool and over 20 years later i still feel the same way that they don’t look as good but   but i wouldn’t do anything to a numbers matching car I would just sell it to buy a Elenor. Without question the movie made the car a household name/thing but trade marking a car that someone else designed and  60 years ago none the less is crazy talk. If anyone should get a royalty payment for a trademark on the car it was Carrol Shelby.
Well now we know why Elenor clone prices have been super over inflated for so long
Fuel for thought, I am taking on the exact build. Hopefully I don't get any shit from the lawyers LUL
I wish regular guys could afford one of these. Last time I checked a builder it was north of $100,000. I'm dumfounded that Ford TO THIS DAY still doesn't build its own modern replicas. I don't want an interpretation of the classic. I want a modern Mustang with the exact classic body styling.
I've subscribed... Can you start building. After hearing your story, I will never buy an Elenor either
If i bought it, its mine.
Are you standing on a rocking chair?
better to ask for forgiveness then permission. and we had covid in 2002?😉
Double ads. Jesus.
Oh yes I should and have
Eye for an eye. Take those suckers back to court
I'm really not feeling IT WHY would you or anyone else talk about the RIGHTS to ownership of this fantastic CAR NOT for PUBLICITY SORRY
shes soo stupid, she was trying to copyright the "name" and anything associated with it. Which is should of known damn well you cant do. A car is a CAR and nomatter how or why, it will always belong to the Manufacturer's rights and legal ownership consent. She saw a little "grey area in the law and tried to CAP on it which horribly ended in NOT her favor. Great that the SHELBY team decimated her for her false findings. Stupid lady stick to making sandwiches.
Sooooo what actually happened to your Eleanor build? I was under the impression they confiscated it from you? At this point hasn’t it been proven to be your creation? Who has the car now?
Turds with corn and red pepper flakes is my likeness, I will sue anybody who eats Mexican and craps turds with red and yellow stripes and uses it for making money..  i didn’t create it, but I new a payday when I saw it, you flushed yours, I carefully bought mine to court, and was given exclusive rights just to get it out of there, I guess when you start saying you will throw so much evidence at people, they realize your right, and let you get your way
I went to the place in Dallas Texas, called Unique Performance. They had a car show, open house. You could stand in line and meet Carol Shelby. And it was great. You could buy, a Gone in 60 seconds, movie correct car. But then the shop started doing some shady stuff. Taking money not building cars, title washing, and all around mediocre work. I heard about a bondo dispenser that was like soft serve ice cream. Well, The IRS raided the shop, people got arrested, Shelby had his name removed from the shop. They auctioned off half done cars to pay back taxes. Not sure what happened after that. But people spent $80k on deposits only to never get a car.  For a long time no one even said the “e” word.  Shelby mustangs are awesome!!
This shit is so confusing so can I build mine yes or “NO” ?
Should name the car Carolnor!
Shelby is a hero. Denise wouldn’t be shit if it hadn’t been for her husband
I'm sort of new to this... so what about all the general Lee replicas? Smokey and the bandit? Just to name a couple
Hmmmm...I named my Camaro Eleanor, I wonder if I'll get sued now...
Yes in the original movie it was a 1971 yellow fastback Mustang, not a 67 Shellby 67 GT Mustang.   Considering that her car was just a off the lot yellow 1971 fastback Ford Mustang, I have always wondered should the Ford Motor Company have sued her, afterall her car is based on Ford's design.
Four movies?? I am only aware of two gone in 60 seconds. The original and the Cage remake
you're right,  i shouldn't build one.  i should build two.  now,  i'm going to build three.  and i'm not getting a license.  eat on that
Nice ad
The Halicki party are just abusive and greedy clouds of exhaust gas. They're going after everyone who owns or builds Mustangs at this point? You may have been subject to anong the most unnecessary 100k in legal fees in US history "thanks" to these goons.
Great rundown and I agree not to build an Eleanor. Instead of having Eleanor as a possible icon and supporting people as Shelby has done, they have turned this into a car that nobody will touch. It will fade out overtime all because of greed. Shelby supported his fans, made money to boot, and is an American legend because he valued people just as much as his cars.
Denise H I think is wreckless in her actions. The Elenor car looks like a Shelby Mustang which has been around now for over 50 years and for her side to copyright the likeness of the car designed by the Shelby company is quite arrogant.
As someone that loved the movie and the car, after the original seize and decist. It lost all the magic. So wont get any memrobelia related to this car or movie. She killed the fan in me with greed.
Time to get your car/money back from that woman... https://youtu.be/sBcTrtmff4Q?si=mlEKULKALREldfDo
I’d want one of de new build ❤
Isn't the whole thing just non-legal binding, since the name ealenor is discribed IN THE MOVIE!! As "A" '67 shelby GT500...😂😂😂😂
hey b is for build you know D.H. has been back in court with shelby and classic recreations this year in 2023  didnt fully understand  but the judge threatened to hold her and her lawyer in contempt of court and they were supposed to be back in court in june  ive not been able to findany information concerning the june 2023 proceedings  can you do an update on that since no one else seems to be covering this at all
I remember the videos when they came out, I watched the build religiously
"...I did, I did" 😂
Inter alia =. among other things
Didn’t Disney sue a guy that had a red E86 with stickers that looked like lighting McQueen
Can you reupload the build?
wouldnt touch anything to do with Eleanor anymore. I wont watch gone in 60seconds again either
Take it back to court, sue for your losses, harassment and court fees, bring this printout of the shelby lawsuit with you. This proves they were lying and had no real rights to take you to court in the first place.
So lets honestly just look at this for what it is. The car in the movie was a joke of a GT500 recreation because obviously they couldnt use real 500s for their needs.. It was a terrible rip off like a track auto exploded onto a mustang.. Thats what the car is . Sheer stupidity and not knowing any better is what gave that car a nickles value . So others wanting to bank on the stupidity of the masses jumped on the bus and started making them . Banking on stupidity has anways worked here in the US and it worked on this junk too !!! So at some point this chick realizes there is a nickle to be made off the junk as well and she goes for it and it works !!!! At this point we have stupidity at both ends that has been bred from stupidity. Is it all worth it for sad clones ? For pieced together cars that never existed anywhere but in this movie ? These cars will NOT age well considering the filler work done to them. So that brings me to Shelby . Shelby has a legit case against these folks that whored a Shelby creation badges and all to sell a movie.SHelby can easily argue that what these people have done has damaged the Shelby brand and the value to its customers .  Again , more than half the morons into that car think thats what a GT500 is... Ive been in arguments with people over that dumb ass movie and they really think thats a GT500 and that is what they look like... This has an impact on a brand that took a life time to build and truck loads of cash and sweat. SHelby America ??? Get better lawyers !!!! Go after this chick and the production company and everyone else that had anything to do with this ignorant trend.
What happened to Build's Eleanor?  Did he say and I missed it???  I heard at the end he(you) said you're going to build another one with a Shelby theme but did you get your car back?  Get compensated?  Going to sue her for damages (hopefully, including mental grief!!!!) ???
Well I gues from now on I'm gonna say fuck Ford... Ill build a GTX 67 or 72
They should be happy that your respecting the car and that you love the car and its history.... That's why regular guys like me cant have there dream car. No kits no easy ways or cheap ways to build a dream car
Allways remember the Deck os allways stacked against you..... Either its a multi trillion dollar govt against you... Or a rich person against you... It is broken. Its. A shame hope your doing better now
what a great watch
What were the four movies? I know 2 of them were gone in 60 seconds but were the other 2
Makes you wonder why carol Shelby was the 1 who never got the copyright If it's 90% there car and 10% someone else they should on the copyright The people who owned the copyright for so long shouldn't have for owns the copyright and you know show me what a been Do you say about this copy right if they had it so
Imagine Hollywood trying to own American swag. I like him but wonder how much Foose played a part in the crying game?
Man been intrested in this since the beginning glad it’s allowing you to be the bigger person❤love shelby
Since the court ruled that Halicki over reached, can people that lost in court to her or settled recoup their losses?
can you now post all of the videos that you created before that you had to take down?
They're basically saying "you can't buy a camaro because it's bumblebee and you don't have a right to it" or " Chevrolet will be sued by transformer franchise for producing a camaro who is bumblebee"
I wholeheartedly agree with your decision to stay clear of that . Any performance car enthusiast knows the name Shelby. So, paying homage to that legacy is the proper godly thing to do. Forget her!!
Budlight Eleanor and take a toke to Shelby
You should take a spray paint can and write Eleanor across the side of the rustiest clapped out v6 you can find
This is the end of the Eleanor brand. Car guys and more importantly movie car guys love history and facts.  This story will never die.  Well done.
Long live King Shelby!  Eleanor, you've been weighed and you've been found wanting.  Your owner is a sneaky person.
When is gonna ford join the fun claiming gt500 was built of their mustang?
Great video!
When my dad took me to look at Shelbys as a kid, he didn't take me to look at Eleanors. I hope they are able to stop this Karen.
I LIKE THIS GUY
I'm building a 67 mustang notch back race car using a ASA stock car chassis.  The body work - fenders wing and front end will be styled after a "Dekon Monza IMSA GT #20 race car". Search that phrase if you want to see that car. I wanted to go with the fastback mustang but will first do the build with the notch back body I got for cheap due to no floors left from rust. Maybe later I will get the fastback body panels and redo it as a fastback. The goal is to get it on the track and be racing it, and, for it to look cool as hell. There will be no Shelby or Eleanor body parts used as those don't fit the IMSA GT Racing style.
You said 4 movies, but I can only find 2 gone in sixty seconds. The original from 1974 and the one in 2000. What are the other two movies?
That deodorant is wack and can't last half a Day
Buy a ford tarus, put elenore stuff on it and call it Elenwhore.
How dare they ask you for my middle name!
I met Carroll Shelby in 93.  He is a true American hero and glad he won.  I'm looking forward to seeing your S550 tribute!
Shit im gonna build a Eleononta put a spoiler and some air scoops on my canta with its new wopping 200cc replica honda gx 4 stroke engine (the origional old  honda gx160cc got a broken cranksaft so im gonna rebuild it as a backup) And put some shelbie stripes on it. was gonna put a hood scoop a spoiler and shelbie stripes on it any way Now i also got a cool name for my lil gray doombuggy.And ofc a dixie horn is a must for any hilbilly on his  lawnmower.ROFLMAO
You should get your car back
Inter alia means among other things
I agree. I was upset when he passed.
A happy ending! I was following this build when it happened. Couldn’t believe what was happening. Glad for this update all this time later.
Who’s here after they changed the rule? You can now build one!
Intelligent discourse!!
Eleanor is dead, let it be put to rest and forgotten about. Don't event talk about it, that seems to be halicki's intentions.
YOU ARE 110% RIGHT THAT THE AMERICAN COURT SYSTEM IS CORRUPT AND FCUKED!!!!
Excellent, you could call the new car "Greedy bit*h"... just a thought 🤔
Mmmm idk i like a little vegan in my deodorant but its nice thats its vegan and cruelty free ion want cruelty but you can leave the vegans in there
Have to get Nicolas cage in on this help get your car back
I would of told them to go get stuffed to start with
sounds like ford should sue her as well.
I thought Troy Trapanier built the car for the most recent movie with Nicholas Cage?
Funny how some people try to steal ideas from others polish it a lil and think they then own that idea.
LOVE IT.
Question: are you going to paint that new car that will have nothing to do with Eleanor grey and black? ;)  Sure hope you'll get some return in any kind of way from that greedy B...
HEY DENISE! DONT CHOKE ON YA HUSBANDS CACK! COPE BITCH COPE!
That 2007 GT is sick🔥
Denise is just another woman wanting her money. Dumb 304
Love the look of Shelby cars, would rather drive a shelby gt, almost bought one about 5 or 6 years ago... awesome.
I don't understand why one would build an Eleanor in the fiirst place—it's ugly! The original 1967 Mustang looks so much better without any body kits.
%#&@! Elenor!  Good for you!
Respect brother
I would vise versa the paint scheme and name it Ellie
The name E***r, needs to die an ignominious death and never be mentioned again. It should become forbidden to even name a child E***r. Every time Denise tries to sell a license to that name, the response should be "Ela-what?" Keep, doing what you're doing: building cool stuff, and shining the high-beams on the jack-asses.
Create a new one and call it elnolaw
This makes me happy… #winningson
This is definitely  a build I'll be waiting for gt500
there was a case yrs ago re Casper the ghost.  Judge said  There is only so many ways to draw a ghost folks.. Same here, Make a few changes and name it Elennor vs elenor and all is well.
Nothing but a bunch of cowards. That whole legal team with Eleanor. That’s such bullshit
anything Elenor is so passe and beyond the statute of limitations.
Anybody born before the 2000s will say 'oh that's a Shelby'
*uck them
Epic F U to she who doesn't deserve to be named.
Good luck !!
This whole thing is stupid. It sounds like DH is taking a play out of the Kardashian book. Just went down a rabbit hole I never wanted to go down. I liked the execution of the GT500E cars, but the early and over-abundant copies were enough for me to not even want one. Good choice in moving on from the project. I LOVED the wide body car that was in the Holley booth at SEMA 2022. Still have pics of it on my phone. We should chat, soon.
The court ruling at least makes things clear. Its like the creator of Initial D suing every white colored Toyota Corolla 86 owner claiming it looks too similar to the AE86 in Initial D.
This is awesome! Guess I can go ahead and build one down the road…… and that sucks that people has to pay her for licensing to build one
Can’t wait to see the Elignore you create
True story: when CS won Le Mans for Aston Martin, and went to said company’s post race party. He got pissed. No, not drunk in Limey Speak, he got angry because he realized Aston Martin spent more money on the party than they did to go rave that race. He also hats Enzo. Not the cars, the man, for good reason too.
Wow. Three more stoopid movies than I was aware of. So which one is the “good” one, according to Mr B?
Build one, or at least call the late model 07 one you built: Elignore.
All I can say is good for you. Screw Halicki. She's been living off her husband's work and taking from others. I do love the Eleanor design but I think the GT 500 is a better design. Can't wait to see your build.
Protecting something from Fans - is an over  reach. B is for Build Full Circle baby lets gooooo
Build your dream car and call it "Carol"
IN MY OPINION, lol, Eleanor was never a character. It was always a Shelby GT500. Did it have some minimal changes to the actual original GT500? Sure, but it was nothing more than what anybody could have done in their garage (not to undermine the genius of Chip Foose in any way). Eleanor was simply the name given to the GT500, just like every other car on the list had a name. You couldn't copyright the name Nadine and start going after any '67 Ferrari 265 GTB4. The minimal changes to the styling of the GT500 for the movie never should've qualified for copyright ability just like you say in the video. It's a shame what happened to your build and many others for Hilicki's overreach and I'm happy to know that her time is now over.
One word on your judicial system, BOLLOX.....
Sad thing is Denise didn't build Eleanor. Her husband did and he's dead. She's living off of his creation, with lawyers and BS lawsuits. Kind of sad. I hope you got your car back off of them.
Someone is about to get sues for ripping off a whole bunch of people. Excellent Vid. Thank you!
Just dont call it Eleanor, and your good to go.
A Chip Foose version of a Shelby car, why not try to claim it as a design you own? lol. What a terrible person she is.
Great story loved it
Love this brother! Thank you!
If someone wants to HONOR your 74 pinto cobra wagon movie car (not a thing) by building 1 (not 1000) thirty+ years later, just be honored.  Don't be an ass hat. P.S. I was 14 years old at a Newport Beach car show when I decided my "favorite car" was a GT500KR Convertible. It still is, followed by every Koenigsegg ever made.
Inter alia: among other things
Funny , I was thinking about something I was 99% sure I saw on your channel .  It was essentially a "flat pack" front suspension cradle I think that you bent and welded yourself to save some money?  So I was looking and couldn't find it right off and I wondered was it used on the "shall not be named" build.   IF so can you share the product name?
Great content, I’m a little in awe of your creativity in the first place. Your builds are ambitious and gorgeous.  It’s always great to learn the real story. Another great story belongs to  HB Halicki. Perhaps the wife was trying to honor his memory, but “in my opinion” she and her team, did the opposite.
I live in a wonderful state called Alabama and down here we own lots of wireless hole punches(guns) so if I build something you think you have any imagined right to bring your ass down here and try to take it. Hint it will not end like you think it will.
As a uk resident i find the whole thing disgusting...The word "Greed" comes to mind... Hope you dont mind but i found a great vid about this that others may find interesting...Search "Shelby's lawsuit means Freedom for Eleanor Owners!     Tony's Fords and Mustangs"       .. Hope this is allowed.
Build another mustang and call it Denis 👉👈🤣
I hope you drove the Mustang GT on the second suit to the court house. Please tell me you did 😂
Can you please put back the videos they were so awesome of the mustang you made
I would go after her and the car because what she did was wrong.
Fuck me how intitled do you have to be to sue someone for a body swap and a bloddy paint job
You know there's a thing called anti-slapp right? Kind of funny a car guy called something broken and never looked for the fix.
All this shit is so crazy. Most of the people reference the name Eleanor with the GT500 from the movie Gone in 60 sec made in 2000. I didn’t even know of the old yellow model ford mustang from the older movie
There is a 0.302% chance Chris will even read this now. But dare I say it anyway!? Chris, you are the great American Hero! You are the bad ass! You are our icon! Good work!! Keep rocking it, man! We all love it! 🤘
NOT TO MENTION THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BUILD CAR WAS NOT EVEN A CLASSIC GT500! That's like saying no artist can draw marvel cause there not Jack Kirby or Stan Lee..... so sad. Keep making your art it EPIC!
Gets married in 89, husband dies same year.......
Can't wait to see how it comes out..
Everyone! Name your Mustang Eleanor in honor of Eleanor Roosevelt!!
Uh....I must be late.  There's 4 feature films ?  I thought there was the original Gone in 60, and the new gone in 60.
You really want to piss someone off  Build the car and paint it a nasty color 😂
Carroll Shelby also makes the best chili mix ever
Name the new car Denise… please 😂😂😂😂
I won’t watch anything that supports that greedy copyright troll. I’m glad she got a slap in the face due to her own greed 😂
Hell yeah 😎 I can't wait for the build honoring Carroll Shelby. You know u should get ur cars into the fast in furious movie that would motivate the shit out of the car culture 🏁♥️💯
This whole thing has ruined the GI60S franchise for me entirely. Used to love the Nic Cage version, but now I'll never be able to watch it without feeling rage over this cunt's actions.
You can still build it if you just change the name to Hellinor!
Well said
Thank you for address this issue. I was hoping this video would come out. Cheers
So when are they bringing your car back to you ???????
Four movies, one of them is good. That would be the 1974 original with a yellow 1973 Mach 1. Unlike Bullitt, every stunt in the original Gi60S movie was performed in the order it is in the movie. There's no repeated footage. One 1973 Mustang Mach 1 was used for all the stunts so there would be no damage that vanished then came back. It is the *perfect* car chase.
This is the biggest.. "fishslap" (for obvious lack of nicer words) that I have ever seen in the history of the car enthusiast world. Unless you're trying to parade on prime time television that you produce, and sell a vehicle under that very specific badge.... There should be no reason why anyone should come after you this hard over modifying a product you bought and paid for with you're own money. Absolutely ridiculous.
Not the smartest guy. Nobody can stop you building stuff or drawing copyrighted stuff if you're not doing anything with it. Why did he give the car way? Dumbass. I drew 4 Mickey Mouses and Deadpool taking a dump on Thanos. If I Don't do anything with them, what are they going to do.
21:25 ABSOFUNKINLUTLY!!! And I'm way older than you.
he basically said "F Eleanor."
long story short i wont be paying to watch eleanor again... ill just use the free sites because of the bad taste left over..
It’s a custom Shelby GT500 with a name. After hearing about the huge assholes they are I would never want anything named Eleanor.
Shelby created illegal original cars? The American legal system is a joke.
You’ll be pleased, I came for the story from #LegalEagle but stayed purely out of interest; not only did the ‘See you next Tuesday’ suing you has got you a lot more members than ever before! Nice work killjoy!
I mean, make what you want. Just stop telling everyone.
@BisforBuild. I just came across Devin Stone's take on your case over on his LegalEagle YT channel. He really covered the whole case well and was very favorable to your plight, specifically. Give it a watch if you haven't already.
Absolutely luv the way you laid it out and I as an automotive enthusiast will never buy or support anything to do with the Eleanor franchise!!
@3:10 “it started in 2002, right before Covid hit” - LMFAO we were stuck in Covid a lot longer than I thought 😂😂😂. I’m assuming you meant 2020 lol. Great video sorry to poke fun! :P
I never knew there was someone who was claiming the design of Eleanor I always thought it was a Shelby design the courts did the right thing on that case.  I would do something  like the Shelby but add some new age style and use a different newer body style mustang
B is for build  That means build what you want
I wonder how Halicki got copyright in the first place considering that any Eleanor is derivative of Shelby’s work, which is itself derivative of Ford’s product.
You are right and that company that thinks they can go around taking peoples builds, I hope karma bites them in the ass. I remember when this happened and everytime I seen one of these cars that’s all I could think about. People are greedy. A company that wreckless shouldn’t own a copyright like that in the first place they have no place in the car world.
Inter Alia is Latin for “among other things”
This is awesome
What are the 4 movies, I can only think of 2
At this point Eleanor is played out imo.
Well Shelby owns the copyright to all Shelby designs. So if Shelby didn't contact you with any court docs keep building.
"My Lawyer Made Me Change the Name of This Video So I Didn't Get Sued"  Does the ribbon on your wrist say "do not open before Christmas"?
👍
that's like if Michael Bay said every yellow camaro is Bumblebee.
EVERYONE HERE IS A LOOSER except the lawyers, who charged lots of money!
Its still a crappy rebodied Ford Falcon...who cares?
Give them the ultimate finger. Restart the build, reverse the color scheme, and call the car Eileen N'Or. F*ck em. F*ck em HARD. This is bullsh*t.
Just subscribed to see you build your Shelby. Congratulations my man.
I left B is for Build for awhile. Im back!!!
I'm an older dude and Shelby was already legend when I was a kid. I'd never heard of Haliki before, it's offensive that someone took Shelby's genius and tried to sell it as their own.
Nice
Man, you rolled over like a puppy. No way around that.
are you going to re-release your previous vids?  There was a lit of good custom info on those vids.
Can someone explain to me what the four movies are. I thought Eleanor was the name of nic cage’s dream car in gone in 60 seconds.
Asking for money to make the threat of legal action go away sounds awful like blackmail to me...
Imagine 86 Trueno builds. Does initial DN go after the builders?
I guess this is a good time to say... if Denise's husband heard about this lawsuit he'd be rolling over in his grave. 🤣🤣🤣   Rot in hell Denise...
Gone in 60 seconds. Was the turning point for me with loving cars. Seeing that scene where he sees her again and loves on her before stealing her really got me. That was my true first love in cars. Besides the 5th gen viper 🤣
I wish people would stop building this car, its so overdone that it is disgusting. Loved the movie, don't get me wrong but these things are everywhere and over priced.
Don't build or buy replicas of that stupid car.  Don't watch the movie.  Don't buy the DVDs, don't buy the merch.  Trash talk the movie anywhere to anyone who you think might watch it.  Let the only thing we remember about Denise be "one more entitled lawsuit-happy Karen" till we all forget her.  Let the dumb movie, the bitchy lady, and the stupid paint job disappear into the mud of time.
A modern restomod 67 fastback is my dream. Good luck on your build
AY MAN FUCKKKK ELENOR I wouldn’t want to build one after all the bullshit either.
native is actually very good. been using it for years. Replace your 5-1 bois for something that keeps you clean & smells good.
Amen, brother. I feel the same way. Eleanor is a beautiful car, but I wouldn’t build one for the same reason you won’t.
I love native body wash. That’s what I use.
Crazy how they tried to copyright any 67 “SHELBY” GT500 as if they owned the rights to that specific car when they modeled a “character” after a already popular car then steal them from anyone who built a factory looking Shelby
Please redo the work u did on the old one. I loved everything about the details u did to the old one u were doing.
You said 2002 did you mean 2020 or 2022?
Third time's the charm. Love the builds. What happened to the first one really shouldn't of happened at all but glad your building what you want
Car builders should form some kind of network and support each other even financially with situations like this. It make’s sense since the legal outcomes affect them all.
If you show me any Mustang all I see is the Bullitt movie car.
G'day Chris, I heard about this on Devin's Legal Eagal channel, I love Muscle Cars & own a 2012 Holden Ute SS Thunder, I can Whole Heartedly understand someone wanting to own a Shelby or Replica as he & his creations are VERY Important in Muscle Car History, H.B. Halicki made a Brilliant car chase movie in '74 but why would anyone want to copy any of the cars from the Atrosity of Nick Cage's Gi60S, it is one of the most 💩car movies of all time  Also I can't understand how Bitch Face Halicki can claim that the Shelby GT500 in the Remake is her Intellectual Property inherited from her Husband when he died in 1989 & that Car wasn't designed until 10 years later, Eleanor IS a Yellow 1973 Ford Mustang Mach1. Plus her claim that any car that looks like Eleanor in either creation should be turned over to her if the owner calls it Eleanor is just ridiculous as Steven King or John Carpenter claiming all 1958 Plymouth Fury that people call Christine as they are a character in the Book & Movie.
Good stuff brother!  I cannot wait!
Sad part is, it was her husband that made the movies she’s just a greedy bitch in my eyes😮😮
Kind of makes me wonder if you were to "build" another car from "Their" list in the movie (with same name), would another lawsuit follow?
I sure hope that when i get the chance to build my car, the BMW M3 GTR, i don't have to deal with this nightmare.....because i am building that car for myself and myself only, i am making that demonic car that was introduced to me when i was 5 by Need For Speed Most Wanted 2005 mine and oh boy am i going to drive it like i stole it
Came to this channel after hearing about these shenanigans on Legal Eagle, but stayed and subscribed because that car you plan to eventually build is going to be badass!
Legal Eagle sent me this way. Loving the channel. Sub'd. 👍
So I never comment on YouTube videos but you have a new subscriber because of Legal Eagle. Love the builds so far, can't wait to see some more.
Chris, you could not have put that better. You keep making content, I  will continue to support you and the guys.
I came here to support you, fu*k Halicki!
POV: you’re here to support the channel after watching legal eagles post
amazing
It'd be dope if FORD just stepped in and told everyone to sit tf down... "ALL OF YOU are fighting over OUR original creation, stop fighting or we're taking everyone's toy away"
Call it Winanor
So can you get your old car back ?
Look forward to the new build, glad shelby got involve and won 🤘🤘
I'm checking out your vids due to Legal Eagles vid covering your problems with all this. Da** shame that lawyers have to enable awful people who are willing to ruin cool things for profit. More power to you, and I look forward to checking out all of your builds.
Legal eagle sent me here.
HELL YEAH! Hearing you're doing a 67 body swap build again makes me so happy! Its my favourite Mustang body style! I hope its clean af!
LegalEagle brought me here... Especially the scene at 21:21 to 22:00. All I gotta say about what you said about Carroll Shelby are 2 words: FACTS & RESPECT! Shelby's both an icon & a hero in the American Car Culture. He created the GT40 for heaven's sake. The Ford GT lineup wouldn't existed today in not for the GT40.
A stock GT500 looks better and makes more sense design-wise than an Eleanor. I wouldn't want to build an Eleanor either.
wow..... Ive wondered this whole time... But wow this is ridiculous!
Nice!!
If your strong enough the TRUTH always prevails  . I wish you the Best Brother . Stay real keep it real no LIES no Bullshit
The original Eleanor was yellow with black stripes and was a 71 Mach 1 completely different from the layer Eleanor also note that Eleanor was wrecked in a scene and then another car was stolen to replace it
Can’t wait till they go out of business.
Congratulations I learnt a lot and now have a real bad taste in my mouth for “Elenor and Denise”!  B is for Build fan for a few years ever since you LS Swapped a Lambo!
So if they make a movie with your daily that means you can't drive it anymore? We need to get rid of stupid elected officials asap. As I age I'm finding these cars and movies expensive , useless and ugly. Don't tribute anyone. They don't deserve it and will never appreciate it. You are the only one that deserves a tribute from your followers. God bless you.
It's the Shelbenor
Name your black gt Elanore. Get a plate with the name and make a video about it.
When this initial build was stolen it took a lot of the wind out of my sails. I was an OG watcher of the channel and this made me take a long break. That being said I'm super stoked to come back now and really happy for you ..  Stick it to those AHOLES ruining car culture .
I think ford needs to step in and make everything "GONE IN 60 seconds! " Freedom of speech dont sue me! LOL Shellby Rules and im a japanese car guy.....
You should sue them for harassing you on your second mustang (black one) and asking you for money, and then get all your money back by charging them the sue fee + your legal fees. 😅Just saying, maybe it's possible who knows.
It is a freakin Mustang (wich is a horse and none was offended) so just make an identical one and name it KAREN in the "memory" of that blonde bimbo :))
Damn, now I want to watch the Nic Cage/Angelina Jolie movie JUST to see if they ever refer to Eleanor as a Shelby or a GT500 in the movie…because if they do, wouldn’t that throw out ANY right to her claiming the car as her design?
👌👌
love it! wish you could get your original back too!
well said.
And now the Eleanor desirability crashed.  📉 “Greed will imprison us all”
in europe most people dont even know eleanor, we just call them mustangs :D ... anyways halicki should eat d and get a hefty fine, i mean fine that will make her eat cereal with water fine. that would be justice.
so, without getting too complicated with it, how is it that Person A can claim ownership of a design that person B draws, and person C builds to feature in Person D's movie. Person A didnt design or build anything.  Giving far too much Credit to Person A IMO considering they didnt have anything to do with any of its creation at all. not even the original one.
Does anyone else think the guy in the GWi internet ad looks like  Luke Wilson?
I have just two words to comment:  FUCK YEAH!!!
Bro I can't wait to see the beautiful Shelby yall going yo make. I will be waiting
Just goes to show that when you think you have a big dick, there’s always a bigger dick swinging in the dark corner of the locker room. I’m glad Shelby unzipped his pants.
Wait Covid started in 2002??
hell ya cant wait for your new 67 build.  personally, i never watched the og for the eleanor part, always the shelby mustang part.
Build the original Eleanor. Not many people know of the original.
ELEANOR Ii ....The return. Looking forward to the new build !
It goes to show you just because they can win a frivolous lawsuit doesn’t mean they can keep winning them forever.
Denise halicki I hope reads this and knows they can tongue punch my fart box, horrendous that they are even part of car culture.  Plus’s I thought copyright only was for 10 years or may that’s just proprietary information…. I know with the tools game you can build parts for old 70’s drill presses now…  Also you should indeed start a hashtag campaign and get some custom plates… my even some hoodies that say #NotAElanor… I know I’d buy one…
Is that your lawyer that we can hear in the background? Also, no hate on your sponsor, but Artistry products are the best around. 😉
Screw that hooch, I'm gonna build one anyway.
Carroll Shelby dies and still wins legal battles. Legendary.
I'd build one out of spite and call it elly lmfao
Carroll Shelby was an absolute legend and I'm sure if he was alive today he would have no problem with somebody building a newer style replica of his car as a matter of fact he would take it as a compliment these other people getting involved are absolute morons
gt500
95% shelby is WAY too generous to what was considered the "Elenore" brand. The seats, the interior dash, the steering wheel, the transmission, the geometric design of the vehicle itself, the suspension, the engine, the frame, the body panels, i mean we are talking about hundreds of 1,000s of hours of engineering and design work for someone to put like 5 Mods on it and say oh this and anything like it is mine. No no no I would suffice to say (disclaimer) that in my opinion it is more accurate to say that 99.99999% of the build and design of an "Elenore" is actualy property that was designed by Ford Motor Company and Shelby and they should be the ones suing the Elenore team for all the money they collected while hurting the Ford/Shelby brand so they can give it back to people. In my opinion! Lol
That was such bullshit what happened to you guys with that project.  The entire internet car community was pissed about it.  Glad you're moving forward with a project with someone who deserves the tribute.
The judges got paid to watch the movies?
Like anyone can stop you from building any car that looks anyway what a joke.but it sure makes the myth of Eleanor mustang and Shelby.
Well. Carroll passed sadly in 2012, but I am glad that his legacy is protected.
Id countersue for losses
F#ckin champion. Looking forward to this one. Suffer in ya Jocks (certain other car builder
Just don't call it Eleanor. It's a tribute GT500 that happens to be Pepper 'Hasty' Grey
B is for bum get it correct
Bottom line: He’s right they ARE crazy. If you don’t want people cloning their dream car because of how hard/expensive it is to get THEN JUST START PRODUCING THEM AGAIN AND MAKE MORE MONEY.
2002
It's always satisfying to see someone like that get slapped down.
You shouldn't have had to go through all the BS in the first place, but sounds like all good news in the end!
Wussy
EXCITED !!
Name the new build SHELBYMORE. 😂
Love Native just got the coconut vanilla my self its nice
the bumper of elanor is a shelby 350 bumper
Copyright last I heard it has to be 33% different.
Fact of the matter is, don’t ever mess with us builder’s.
In other words, fuck Elenor. ❤
Instead of being proud from a local builder rather destroy their credibility.
I used to love Eleanor. But after watching your episode you are 100% right I cannot stand behind or promote something that lady had her hands in.
Great video. Good luck with the build. Can't freaking wait to see it. Being a Super Shelby fan, I'm looking forward to it.
Only a woman can destroy a beautiful cars image.
ME PERSONALLY.. would build an Eleanor and then GIFT it to Whistlin Diesel right after for testing purposes 🤭 a big F YOU to them.
This Halicki woman can get in the fucking sea. People like that really boil my piss.
The courts are BROKEN!  Not only is it imperfect, but the legal system in general makes tons of $ by STAYING BROKEN.  They have NO INTENTION of fixing their money machine.  #JudgesHaveTooMuchPower
It's how she makes a living.. and she thinks it's ok.. says a lot about her as a person.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
HELL YEA we have been waiting for this… redemption build!
A convertible version would be fantastic that is my dream. What do you think about it  making a convertible??
Doesn't sound like it's over. She's going back against Shelby in March 2023
You are some great fighter , keep on with the great work , wish u the best !
Why cant you get it back now?
In the Nicolas Cage movie "Gone In 60 Seconds" His character refers to the 1967 Shelby GT500 as Eleanor. And he says "The 1967 Shelby GT500" a few times.  In the original "Gone In 60 Seconds" from 1974, they refer to a 1970 Mustang as Eleanor. So, I was always confused from the lawsuit to begin with, since those are totally different cars anyway.
Right on, keep moving forward 💪
I swear Corporate America is no better then Communism.
Awesome news! I will NEVER support ANYTHING that has to do with that   Can't Understand Normal Thinking  Haliki person, but will back you ALL the way!
You 100% have a case to get your car back, the court fees, AND damages from loss of content now that there's a president in the court system. I'm sure your lawyers are smarter than me but I wouldn't think they've got a leg to stand on on top of the fact that they tried to extort another car and money out of you on a completely different car!
i would make an exact movie car just out of spite just to piss her off
But what happened to the car they seized? If they took it and it isn't copyright that makes it theft. If they crushed it they still owe you a car and compensation. So even if you can't get it back they still owe you for it and you can sue them for all the costs and suffering they caused.
You a better man then me would’ve built that shit in secret and still drop one video
didn't even know what an Elanor was until you started building it, imagine my suprise when it got shut down. talk about horrendous PR
كفوو عليك والله مجنون 😀😀😀😀
3:13 2002 is when Covid hit?
What happened the old car? I missed that part... as in where is it now...
Sheesh I feel like I was just watching the Datsun videos yesterday.   This has been a while.
So 3.16 min in and I'm like, holy sh## covid has been around since 2002! 😳 that's crazy!
They must have built their entire livelihood around suing people with Mustangs.
in the Movie they called it a shelby GT500 and nick named it "Eleanor" later on in the movie. this has to be the biggest bullshit lawsuit I've ever seen in my life.
every body loves the Shelby Mustang I'm more of a fan of the Shelby modified AC Cobra (which started life as an aluminium body British sports car...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Cobra) such beautiful curves!
You mean people can paint their cars any way they want ? Far out man.
Lovely 👍😉
Fuck yeah! Can’t wait for the Shelby build. 💪🚗
can you talk a bit faster? i almost heard every word you said.
That was a great end to the video can’t wait to see the build
Very sad to hear! Especially when there is now that body shop making the exact copy and using the Eleanor name in chrome badging around the Whole car and interior the  shops put out over 150 of these already!
PERFECT
Let's Goooooo! I cant wait for this build!
Chris, good explanation! Respect Shelby and %u€k Elanor...
So basically the courts just put them and their licenses out of business. Good Riddance and I agree it's too bad the first courts didn't do their jobs.
Shelby forever!👍🏼💪🏼🤙🏼 I never liked Eleanor. The hood sucks as well as the nose drop.👎🏼👎🏼
Bro, get in touch with LawTube and get your car back from that absolute parasite of a woman. Making your own GT500 is a nice middle finger to Denise, but take this ruling and absolutely hypothetically pummel the living shit out of her whole operation in court
Bravo!!
Anyone remember the Foose Camaro?
What about your lost revenue from the content you created and were forced to remove? Will you please re-post that content A.S.A.P.
If you have the threat in writing that they wanted money or would  take you to court! and that a judgement has been made that you can and COULD have built a vehicle that they falsely claimed you can't.   You should seek  legal advice in regards to taking them to court for "Attempting to obtain financial advantage by deception" .. Cheers
That's a huge victory
2002?
Fantastic video man!
Eleanor has been too over done.
Shelby: Goes Like Hell. GLH!  Can we put a Dodge Omni body on a SRT 4 chassis?  😂😂😂
Is Denice Halicki related to Rob Kardashian senior?
I just searched for news about this and it looks like they’re (Shelby Trust and Halicki) going back into court in March? Apparently no final ruling has been made so nothing seems to be finalized…
love your truth, man. I am in the UK. Shelby is an American GOD BOOM 💥
Much more interested in the Riva stalled build than another (yawn) Eleanor.
FUCK ELEANOR! I can't wait to see how the build will turn out!
Carroll Shelby is a goddammed American hero......mic drop
We want great big cars made of steel with big engines. Why are the chapping everyone's ass?
This is where greed gets someone. Looking forward to the next build :)
a bit unusual but still very informative and interesting ... thank you for not only making it through this under the belt action, but also taking the time to give your take on it. Good luck and long life to BisB
interesting point.. Halicki's original "Eleanor" was a yellow stock 73 mustang fastback. You can't have IP on something you did not create. it was a stock mustang. the ford mustang was already IP for Ford. they can't claim it.
Shelby has used the system in the same way over the years. None of them are without sin. I wouldn't support either.
Humble junkyard man begat entitled brat, entitled brat destroyed humble junkyard man.
Interesting
Time to bring back NotAnEleanor!
just build the car and never name it (ELEANOR )
inter alia = among other things
You should delete your Minecraft account America, you people are a stereotypical joke all the way.
That is hilarious! The court absolutely destroyed Halicki, but the damage is done. The names of that car and those movies will never again cross my lips or keyboard. All of us car lovers should band together and memory-hole the entire thing.
Good things happen to good people. Love this and love the sound of the new direction you're taking Chris 💪
Support and credit where its due…What a legend Shelby was.
But what about the other car? Wonder where it’s at, destroyed?
4 films? Did I miss something.  Last time I checked there were only 2 the original one with the yellow mach 1 and the Nicholas Cage one in 2000
If the industry knew how many old timers built & still have Eleanor clones, they’d have heart attacks. Imagine living in the land of the free not knowing if your allowed to replicate a movie vehicle 🤡
those guy were complete asshole
Thank you for sharing, I was wondering what happened
The end of this video made me wanna  go out the door and scream F*** YEAH!!
The new build needs a “F*ck Eleanor” sticker 😂
Damn I think Elinors are over now after this…definitely put the nail in the coffin wit the closing statement of support n I’m ALL FOR IT
“This all started around 2002 a couple months after covid hit” wait a minute…
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
So I like to think of two stages of a person's interest in a generation.  When you are young and dreaming and when you are old enough to afford the current generation you are in.  My affordable generation was when the 2011-2014 was out.  So I think people like me will view the 2012 Boss 302 as their Eleanor.  Because I did not know about cars ad much at that time as I was new to it all, I purchased a 2012 v6 Club of America (which is beautiful).  I am content and love that generation.  I am always fascinated by the front hood of this version (which they changed for 2013).  I think it is the most beautiful looking hood of a Mustang (not including Shelby versions of other years).  So though most of us cannot make a 67 or 69 their own, they can own another version and make it their generation to own.
Wow, people should burn that movie.
Ngl i want to build an eleanor out of spite
So what happened to your physical car? Do you still have it? New to this story lol
Good luck man, can't wait to see it.
I am so glad to be part of the Mustang community.
2002? Covid? Wot
But can you get your old car back ¿?
IMO, Denice Halicki has REALLY tarnished her late husband's legacy with this litigious foolishness. H. B. Halicki loved cars and action movies, not frivolous lawsuits!
Damn this makes me so happy! Thank god that gold digging pile of shit can finally get bent😂🤘🏻
Finally a build intro longer than a pasta recipe off a food blog. ✌️
Oh boy, vegan deodorant and body wash? You can’t wait to taste the body wash I have been using, thanks native!
These days tons of people are trying to recreate the designs that make cars look like what they use to and what some look like today. In most cases a nice set of wheels will bring any car back from the grave in the eyes of the beholder. With you and other artist like yourself doing what you do, it gives more than just entertainment to the people that have Classic Cars not running. Just watching isn't enough. DIY dents, refurbishing, mechanical, electrical, etc., is what your channel about and having fun in the process. It was Bull from the the beginning what they did to you and you should be compensated in some way. I understand your wishes for not wanting Eleanor anymore and I support that but man I wish we could see your creation finished. I'm not a Ford person myself but your Ford was more than just a car with a name, its was something even a Chevy enthusiast would love to have in their collection.
Chris! Please drop Fords 7.3 Godzilla engine into a mustang .I’m personally looking to drop one in a 6th gen mustang but would love to watch your take on it…they have been shown to handle 1000+ hp on a stock motor and would be the perfect garage monster build.
Vegan and cruelty free😂😂😂😂i dont believe it
Right on, and I would also say that you nailed it on the head with saying that the "Eleanor" car is actually a Shelby car. Man that truly sucks you had to go through all that, and honestly Halicki should make good and return your car to you or at least repay you for the cost to settle her BS crazy cat lady claims.
Welp, I am subscribed!
But my question is what happened to your old car? And will you be reimbursed for a false lawsuit?
Well said, Sir!!
And I don't even know about Elenore before lol
If they loose your case, they should pay for your legal fees. This would diminish frivolous law suits.
What are the four movies?
Finally a satisfying end to this story!
Was long awaiting this video, thanks for giving us closure and a W
Uglyist car of all mustangs build
In my opinion crs shouldn't be copy right able
Humans are greaty as F
If i were you i would go after that bitch to get your car back  Love to see people sticking it to that no talent gold digger leeching off of her dead husbands success
how about fastback build with lucid ev motor formula e
In my opinion a great video.
What happened to the car that they took from you?
Thats the spirit! Keep buildin em for us
i am so fuckin stoked that you guys won this. what an ordeal.
Never liked Eleanor body, your wide body looks sick! Much better.
I might have understand if a team would have sue someone over a very special movie build car for example the Fast and Furious low profile, all wheel steering ramp car as this is unique and a design not made by any companie other than the movie production. But the Eleanor was literally 90% Shelby's shape and design with 10% worth of redesign slapped on top of it. They should have never won any lawsuit to begin with.
Every one should use this and make yours now
yeah go B is for Build Bang out a Elanor fuck them in there Face👍😂
I will be looking forward to that build. And I agree with your final statements about Mr. SHELBY. He is an American hero. Carry on our wayward sun.
I'll be watching this. One of my dreams to have a new chassis and all the bells in a 67 body :)
Carol Shelby was also a renowned chili cook. What didn’t this man do 😂
denice looks exactly like the kind of person to go as far as she has to screw people over.
Support all the wayyyyy Great idea!!
If I'm not mistaken Foose did the Eleanor design from the Nick Cage movie.
Great synopsis of the outcome and love what you've got planned. Do it for Shelby! (Also, found your explanation on the GT500 vs 'Eleanor' differences very helpful)
HALICKI THESE NUTS BITCH
Man I waited for this video since all this happened.  You should call the new body swap mustang Helleanor just to piss off that chick.
Can't wait to see the new build come together! I've always wanted the same thing, the classic car look with modern amenities!
if it was me, i would go full send. I'd ask for the EXACT car that they took(probably doesn't exist, more problems for them), go after the money revenue that you would get from youtube content and would reach as far as putting in sponsorships in the argument. Just to screw them over
Awesome, Chris! I've always thought that copyright and suing you was bogus anyway.....
I dream of owning a car that at least looks like the 429 Boss in that beautiful orangey yellow.
Now that is how you handle a issue like this!!!!!!
Eleanor was never a character, it was a code name for a model of car in the first film, Toby Halicki steals 3 different “Eleanor”s to finally get the one he needs. In the remake there’s a long speech about “Eleanor” where the characters talk about how many times he tried to steal the same make and model car. “He drove one off the Long Beach pier once” etc. all of those cars they mention are just 1967 GT500s. Memphis Reigns just keeps referring to the car as “Eleanor”.  The truth is, the car in the original film was a 1973 Mustang and it was called Eleanor because it’s yellow and the Eleanor is a yellow flower. If Toby were alive to see what his family had done to Carroll Shelby, he’d be pissed.  Toby Halicki was a stunt driver and one of the biggest car fanatics there was. So I’m sure he’d hate what Denice Halicki and Disney’s lawyers were trying to pull.
I’m more confused on how you can copy right a movie car to a real life car, that movie company doesn’t make the cars, therefor people making copy’s of it aren’t even stealing sales from that copy because those sales never existed for said company.
Last few minutes of this video, fuck yeah dude Carroll Shelby was the GOAT. So happy that you're going in that direction, build it for those of us that dream of one day owning a Shelby!
the lady from gone in 60 sec probably sueing left and right thinking they have a cash cow and when they need money they jusy threaten everyone
Love the plan and can’t wait to see everything come together. Paying homage to what is my opinion as a great American racer and builder
These people get rich suing everyone like b is for build
Wow - just Wow!   What a story.
i thought there was only the one movie with the grey eleanor and 1 movie with the 71 mustang what other movies was it in?
Ten grand that’s a drop in the hat for most ppl dealing with lawyers
It would b amazing to see you finish that car it was an amazing build they should have left u alone
One word ….RESPECT!!!!
Carol Shelby is a real American hero and this other person is nothing less than a twat.  I look forward to your new build and still think you should hammer that "person" somehow!!
I never seen someone say f**k you so beautiful before!!💯💯Well done bro #BisForBuild
Legend!
Classy Chris, really classy. Handled like a pro, Halicki can eat shit. CANNOT WAIT to see your SHELBY tribute car. Next month please and thank you.
You did to much thinking making this video.
21:59 An American hero for sure. Not only was Carroll Shelby all those things you mentioned, he also did Texas proud and he has a chili kit that’s sold in stores. I’d definitely recommend trying it.
IMHO, THE REAL 67 SHELBY GT500 BASE ELEANOR WAS CREATED AND DESIGNED BY A AFRICAN AMERICAN FORMER HOT ROD ILLUSTRATOR/DESIGNER BY THE NAME OF STEVE OR STEVEN STANFORD AND THE BUILD WAS DONE BY CUSTOM AUTO DESIGNER/BUILDER CHIP FOOSE!...YEAH, I KNOW YOU BEARLY MENTIONED THEM AT THE END OF YOUR VIDEO, BUT THE OTHER BUILDERS INCLUDING SHELBY AMERICAN, CR AND OTHERS CAME LATER IN THE GAME!...I AM JUST SAYING!...GOD BLESS AMERICA! 😇
You're giving Denise too much credit. She didn't have anything to do with Eleanor. That was all her husband, who left the rights to everything to her when he died
Well, I just subbed! I have to be honest, I bleed Bow Tie, however I couldn’t agree more about Shelby. Absolute LEGEND! I want to see the build, thanks for the great video!
love the new goal. great video. support good people.
The sad thing is her dead husband would probably be rolling over in his grave at the things that she's done over these enthusiasts.
Gotta love California. Where the people their things are more important than others
Well done Chris…..god bless man love your work.
Boy getting thick
Thank you for the content about what happen. I will always support your work, regardless.
You are a genius, go for shelby!
Confirms my dislike of this stupid movie franchise. Watched ten minutes of the first one and switched off. Corny and contrived.
Buddy for these body swaps one piece of advice do you don’t compromise the crash safety of those cars. Stop using normal mig welding switch to either mig brazing or laser welding.
Wait what are the other two movies that have the Eleanor mustangs besides the two gone in sixty seconds movies?
A brilliant response to what was a travesty of justice. Well done Chris!
Hell ya.
what i don't understand is what the problem is. take the Delorian time machene for example, the creators dont care if you recreate it.
It's ridiculous she was ever granted the rights to claim a slightly modified GT500 was "hers" in the first place.  I hereby decree that I own the copyright and likeness of all silver Saab 9-5 Aero's with horizontal roof mounting bars, a Christmas Tree air freshener from 5 years ago hanging from the rear-view, and a ding in the passenger door where some a-hole opened their door into mine.  I call this car "Denise Halicki" and always have.  Anyone using this name for any purpose without express written permission is in violation unless they pay me 500 thousand dollars to license the name or likeness of "Denise Halicki", the world-famous famous Saab 9-5 Aero with the strategic passenger door side-strake and the iconic Yakima roof aerodynamics system. Xd  The stupid thing is if someone had the money and a good enough attorney, they probably could do something this absurd... Well, Denise already has, lol.
I've completely lost interest in watching Gone in 60 Seconds, which use to be a yearly watch for me, since they seized your other mustang. I simply can't support that film by watching it.  I'm glad that your lawsuit is done. Congratulations, "in my opinion".
I feel,sad what has happened to usa and people there. I can paint , build and call my car here in Europe what ever I feel like. Nobody cant sue me for building copy of piece movie s#it.
The Shelby was always a better looking car, Eleanor was just a knockoff.
Agree 100% on all the stuff with Carroll Shelby. When the movie came out, the Eleanor idea was cool, but honestly it looks dated and too trendy, like you can tell it was created in the 90's. It's disappointing when people use the legal system to troll people just for financial gain.
Great on you brother!! I'm a huge fan and a ferm believer you you and your team!!! And not that the legend needs it but what about Barrit Jackson and his relationship? Don't see her going after him at his auctions for selling them off.... All the best brother!!! In our eyes in the car community... you also are a legend
I think I understand this. I'm going to call Lamborghini's DAVE now. So now I can sue Lamborghini for making DAVES. If you own a DAVE, you owe me money (didn't know he mentions Lamborghini in the video as I'm writing this. LOL!). What a joke! Its always been a Shelby. I can't stand hollywood!!! I hope Shelby America took them to the cleaners!
What are the four movies I know one of them obviously but what is the other's
If I toke one of the greatest songs ever written, changed the title and a couple of words then told everyone else this MY song and you can’t use it until you PAY ME.   That’s dirt bag shit.  Glad to see you’re going in a different direction with your build.  Best of luck to you and your crew!
I think Donut did a pretty good job explaining the situation with Halicki's business model, being a "license troll" firm, they obtained the license for the character of "Elanor" from the movie and then went around with the accuracy of a blindfolded skeet shooter trying to sue anyone with a silver Mustang with black racing stripes.  Your theory is not far off and I hope to see more from your shop in the future.
I typically like Chip Foose designed cars but I think the big bulky hood scoop on the so called "Eleanor" movie car is plain old ugly. I much prefer the look of the standard Carroll Shelby type hood scoop. It's much more tasteful.
WAIT!!! While this is good news I have read where a trial has been set for March about his case and that no judgment has been rendered. I hope the plastic bitch gets what is coming to her, but it sounds like this is not over.
Have you seen Denice's statement she made a few days ago? (2-4-23) Basically, she said "this isn't over" and asserts that no final determination has been made. They're headed back to court with Shelby over breach of contract in March of 2023. She just won't quit... I hope they conquer her on this one too.
What 4 movies? I only know of two, 1974 gone in 60 seconds and the remake? 😂
I remember the first time I heard your story and I just couldn't believe it.  Glad they got all this nonsense figured out and people can start building their own cars again.  Looking forward to following your next build.
Hope we all got the message here. Don't let a bitch get in the way of you and your car, cause they don't know shit about making or driving them.
Haliki deserves nothing good in her life
This turned out great. I started watching your channel only because I was really interested how you will get those two married into a functional, nice, daily driver. I was surprised that it suddenly disappeared and the whole lawsuit felt stinky. I'm glad it turned out this way, people should just forget about Eleanor name and leave it to one good movie, Shelby is the king here and he's the one to pay tribute to. Eleanor proved that they don't deserve any attention, they are just for money.
Land of the free
Copyright is a blight on modern society, and needs to be abolished. Yes, i realize how vast the implications of that are on modern society and creative art. I stand by my argument.
Shelby is goated, that broad is a nobody
I watched all of the ads to the end to support your work. Look forward to seeing your build.
Man, if only there were an Amendment that explicitly stated your right to due process and not have your property taken without a warrant and just compensation...
The new mustang should be called Denise!😂
I think Disney actually came after someone with that car with a Mazda I believe. He built another one with a Corvette I think
So you're building an Eleanor destroyer in every way possible
Carroll Shelby is definitely an American hero.
I don't care about lawyers or some crap lawsuit. Thats all I'll say to not get in trouble.
I agree with you 100% your Mustang build for Sima as I like to call it. The beast is a much more beautiful looking car then  the Eleanor.
I've been waiting to hear your side once I heard about how they lost in court.  Brings joy to my heart!  Build your Mustang man!  Build it!
Eleanor looked lame with the modern fog lights shot gunned on the front with a giant holly weird hood bump. Never liked it any way, now I hate it.
I’m really glad to see that there are car companies that give a shit about their legacy and appreciate that not everyone wants to buy the latest and greatest car - which is a very apparent trait of most car companies. And that they fought for the owners of the cars that they no longer turn a profit from. Well f*cking done Shelby
your a smart guy
I knew  of  2  movies  but  what  is the  name  of the  other  2  of the  2  I  know  of  1  was a yellow  71 Mach 1 the  other  was a  67 Shelby GT500 and  those  2  cars  i  know  of  looks  nothing  alike and  should  never  be  wrong  for a  person  to  build  if  they  just wanted to  own a  car  like  those  2  cars  but that  is  my  opinion
10k in attorney fees? Dude, that's like having an actual 25cent Hamburger Stand today. You were lucky. However, as an attorney myself I'm probably going to need to sue you for negligent representation of ordinary fees as it may complicate my future billing processes or even dissuade future clients from retaining me. Though, I'll probably sue your attorneys for this also as they are the ones that advised you in making these competitive statements to the public.
BTW, just to be clear, "Eleanor" is an OK Mustang - weird that it has a  name at all.   Lots of people build mustangs with flaired wheel wells.   I suspect the name on a car might be copyrightable but not the body.  "Inter alia" - just means "among other things".  If you want to see the most ridiculous lawsuit.    Do you remember "Monster Wire"?  They sold over priced speaker wire at stores like Best Buy and Circuit City (remember them?).  Well Monster claimed the copy right of "Monster" in regards to "Entertainment"   They went after anyone including a Putt-Putt golf called "Monster Golf" - I think they initially went after Monster Energy Drink.  They finally went after a guy who was a lawyer who owned "Blue Jean Cables" (High quality, fairly price speaker and audio cables - really nice stuff).
BURY"ELEANOR"  !!!  Nobody wants to another Eleanor,     Defy and build "your" car.  Your style , your build, your tribute to Shelby
What movies has Eleanor been in other than "Gone in 60 Seconds"? He mentioned 4 featured films.
How about you build a dead sexy car and call it Shellanor.??  Or Carol or Carroll?
WOW, that was an amazing story. I am glad Shelby won the court case!
Cougar tailights
Yep first movie it was yellow, rammed into exit ramp lamp post, so any wrecked  mustang is an Elanor, Shelby did it hilike and crew are a lot of crap.  Elenor was just one car, Carrol told Ferrari to stuff it. Like your fat stand track car, my first car was 66 sprint 200 and c4, put a dagenham 4 speed it it it was the best, way back in the 70s, please research the IRS that was supposed to go under mustangs but was dropped for cost savings.
Boss here
It was only made difficult so they could make money sittin on their ass
Broooooo! F that Slam 🐖!  Make ur own and name it the Felonor!
In my opinion Eleanor or not it's a Shelby mustang in the end how is it possible to sue the creator of the Shelby mustang for copyright infringement when he's the creator of the mustang that Eleanor is based off of
The Eleanore in the Original Gone in Sixty Seconds was a crap Mustang. And it was a dog of a film. The car that you were basing your build looks like it was from the Nick Cage film. That was a cracker of a film.
Um, it's a mustang...just call it Nancy.  Case closed
I'm sorry, I've always called yellow/orange 1971-73 Mach 1 an Elenore not a 67 mustang FB with side exhaust added that don't really sound very good, I watched the original movie and that is what I base Eleanor off of.
You can build whatever you want but you can't name it Elenore. But mostly folks don't pursue that issue at all. There is hundreds of time machine delorians around but they just don't sue people for being fan of movie and putting flux capacitors in delorians... Ps; ever wondered why all new cars have stupid names?
I never want to hear and see anything about the Eleanor car again. If they wanted the car to drift into being nothing but an icky memory they succeeded. Idiots
Does this woman just sue people to live off of?
I believe, in my opinion, you're a legend.
Damn Shame people can't name your own car anything you want without a threat from anyone who feels they have rights to your name..lol. Don't name your kid Eleanor!
Four movies? 🤔
Your ausum American made
This video was so nice I was watched it twice!
Meanwhile not a single person has been sued for a General Lee tribute car.
Amazed that the Eleanor team wasn’t buried by Shelby and Ford for trying to claim intellectual rights from the start. It would be like the Back to the Future people having all DeLoreans trademarked…completely insane!!
Hell yeah dude!
Great outcome on the "real" court actually doing their job and great idea on the drivable 67 "tribute".  (how's that for a label)
What about the car that was taken from you?
Let's call the new one "Anothernore" XD
Here’s an idea. Why don’t you just build something ORIGINAL?
The only thing that should have ever been realistically copyrightable was the color, and that is only if Shelby/Ford or another company don't already own it.  If you see a silver mustang you think Eleanor, but no one calls a blue or red mustang that. It is also the sole reason the silver GT500s get called Eleanor.
Thanks for the update
Need to remove "E" out of the title as well. I've thought they were tied together & went after u. Oops,  now understanding/realizing more. no way would I support them.
So i’ve only seen the original Gone in 60 seconds and the Nicolas cage remake, what are the 2 other movies called?
Shelby all the way, screw elmodor, your mustang builds were much better anyway, live and learn and move forwards
Yo! Been waiting to hear your take on this situation.  I swear, I did handsprings when I heard the news.  Time to build out your "Notanor." Can't wait to see what you do with it.
Chris, that was perfect! Much respect for you. Personally, I like the look of the  67 GT500 better than the movie car. Can't wait to watch the build, thanks! 👍🏼
handled with class 🤌
@3:16 you said this all started for you in 2002 "a few months after COVID hit" Definitely misspoke there
According to the courts there has been no final ruling yet, meaning she could still sue anyone using Eleanor.
Sounds to me like Denice Halicki is trying to live off of Carrol Shelby’s shirt tail… She should have to pay Shelby to build her cars not the other way around!
The Eleanor car is a nice vehicle, but it seems over-rated and played out.  There are many other amazing builds to be done with old 'Stangs.
Carroll Shelby FTW!!!
I subscribed to your channel JUST for this build to happen. Let's go!
My big question is what are the four movies I know the original Toby halicki film,  the nick cage film , what are the other two ?
She's just a greedy ₩itch. That's the bottom line.
The original Eleanor was a 71 gt from  halicki’s  movie to the 1967 Eleanor the link is tenuous at best . If they are suing over the name that’s ridiculous
Seems I'm hearing more and more about copyright lawsuits these days. Why is it a problem if your car looks like theirs? How does that affect them in any negative way? Sounds like they were hoping to scare you out of some money. I hate all this lawyer crap. Seems they'll do ANYTHING for a fistful of cash.
Copyright on body filler
I know of the 2 ............what are the Four?
What FOUR movies did that car have screen time? I know Gone in 60
I wish someone would pull a gone in 60 seconds and clean out that company’s garage where they house all the cars they stole from people.
Hurumph!
New subscriber here. I'm glad to be a part of what you are doing.
Well said 👍👍
The next car build should be called justice.
Personally I think the Elenor car looks more like a GT350 than a GT500
Covid has been around since 2002, said here first everyone!! 3:15
So, what happen whit you car? if you sue them (eleonor guys) you can have it  back?
Lol there's a guy that did a clone local but it's been sitting in a barn for like 8 years now but it's red and white color.im not big into the whole adding modern day engines or the electronics to a old car I try to keep like it came out of the factory back then I love the 70s 80s themes big meaty tires and shackled rear with air shocks.
Hell fucking yeah I left this video super satisfied love your stuff
Okay, glad that this saga is over. But what 4 movies are we on about? I know that there are 2 Gone in 60 sec movies, where one is yellow... Then there is a modern classic with Cage. But the other two? Please give me some info.
So does this mean you will ever be receiving your Eleanor back????
What are the 4 movies that Eleanor was in?  I know the original and remake of Gone in 60, but are the other two?
#f_eleanor
Great video explaining everything. Completely support your moves on the next build. Can't even imagine the frustration of losing the car. Unfortunately near the end of the video you felt the need to take the Lord's name in vain. ☹️ To bad. No like button for that one sir.
Good on ya mate with amount of bullshit you had to deal with will be great to watch this build like you said when it happens. An I'm sure Mr Shelby would probably approve seeing as how your so passionate. An with that wish you nothing but the best mate an keep doing what your doing.
Just call it Helleanor!
Shelby still doing gods work.
Oh good now I can go out and buy a 67 Shelby ,put a big square angular box on the hood then add the always tasteful exhaust pipes coming out of the rocker panels.
I wanted a Elenor style look on my 65 but the company made it so ugly that even if we can make them I won’t because I don’t want to give them any type of notoriety, the company can burn, feel and be overly discredited for all I care
I am a bit surprised that Mr. Ford didn't send his lawyers after her for going after their brand. From the parts that I read, it appeared as if Shelby had the backing, and this was a warning to her that even if she won, she would lose to Ford, who has the ULTIMATE likeness rights on the car, and they would have gone after evrything she had, including those 300k investigators lol
With this ruling you can actually go after Denise and do a counter-suit. Also, do whatever you want. I know I sure as shit would.
Back in 2002.... when Covid hit. It really does feel like that was 21 years ago, I feel you lol
Now that this c**t lost in court you should get your car back!!!
What are the 2 other Elenor movies?
4 movies????
It is time for the name holder to lose their shirt!  The name needs to be made worthless and every owner needs to go after the name holder!
Well,  I'm sure buying some native deodorant is going to help recuperate your losses lol.  Every little bit helps.  Hope you get the car back.
Eleanors are fucking garbage
The bumper swap could also be the '70's bumper law adaptation similar to the Camaro.
Screw the people that sued you. I hate that car 'character' now. I bet most in the car world do now. What did they think would happen? Idots.
4 movies?  Are we talking about the theatrical and director cuts of the original and remake?
Shelby is the MAN !!!
hell yeah! I always thought that whole situation was bullshit and that it wasn't copyrightable. Glad it kind of worked out in the end.
Fuck you virtue signaller eat my asshole I'm building 20 of them per year and selling them as a car company and you can't do fucking SHIT
fucking 10k$ in legal fees over the stupid name
These ppl sound so scummy like how do they sleep at night
Do you think it's possible they went after you because of them ? Maybe they tried to get a bunch of small legal wins for their car so while they were going against Shelby they could be like yeah we own this right look at our wins already. And maybe the "slap-suit" guess is more right than you think they needed money for their main suit
I like the Eleonor and all but with it being a car from a brand that ruins lives and makes Hollywood movies and let lazy judges give them profit really shows how poor Hollywood really is. Don't mess with Shelby.
Everyone's here cuz Mustang and Shelby and I'm the geek in the corner drooling over the GLHS. ;)
The question we all wa t answered is are you getting your car back?
Wow, what a powerful presentation!  All the power to you and can't wait to see you and Oscar build the Carroll Shelby Tribute car!  Made my day!
Its so unfortunate that the Halicki team has spent years going out of their way to really destroy people's love for Eleanor. I always wanted one ever since I first saw the 2000 film. And I genuinely believe the vast majority of people just wanted to have a piece of that iconic Shelby Mustang history.   I'm glad the right side came out on top on this and justice was eventually served. Although, it NEVER should've reached that point. Congrats for the win.
Man you lost so much in this lawsuit just for it to be over turned! Where is your car!!!!
Okay so now I know there are three more movies lol
I still don't understand how they can do this... People build back to the future DeLorians or Ghostbusters ECTO1 or fast and furious movie cars. And nobody gets sued.
I didn't know covid hit in 2002  That means we've been in a pandemic for over 21 years
I love the plan to support Shelby and 🖕elabor
The original film “Gone in Sixty Seconds” did feature an Eleanor, as a 71/73 Mustang Mach 1. That Eleanor was even credited like any other character and actor in a film.
What a joke
TIME will always give us the TRUTH. I’m super glad you won that battle…..
Dont you wanna try geting your build or at least your money back?
I'm only at fourteen minutes, but so far I'm getting the impression that the Halicki parties' claims are totally bogus and unjustified. Imagine if Michael Bay sued Chevy for producing yellow Camaros, because it's "his intellectual property". The fucking audacity.
Inter alia just means "amongst others".
What does this mean for your original case though? Do you have the opportunity now to sue and get your car back? I saw in the fine print "No longer protected by copyright" Which kinda makes it seem like they've been protected by the court on attempts from defendants in previous cases requesting their cases to be reviewed.
Its about time those assholes got checked
you should call the new car "EleNOT"
Love to see Ford step in for fun in the lawsuit to make a Ford/Shelby team, Ford has patents on all the stuff that Shelby didn't do The Shelby team knows how to deal with Chicken Shit...............
LMAO...... Noted, just avoid ford mustangs.... Build a Camero
Definitely agree with support for Shelby. After your Eleanor situation I don’t even care for them anymore. Beautiful car horribly unreasonable people involved with it. They ruined and tarnished their own name by being absurd. Completely lost my respect and car. Glad to hear about the new project. Would’ve love to see you build the “Eleanor” with your own twist to show how creative you are as well as your efforts. That could’ve been put towards an absolutely astonishing car to bring more attention to “their” car. In my opinion that’s what I think your going for. I can’t wait to see where it leads to.
You don't have to give them shit, you can't copywrite Elanor Roosevelt's name, Fucking stupid. Just get it thrown out, you cannot copyright a character based on a RL person.
You have been talking to lawyers "in my opinion", covers your butt!
while I wish you were able to finish the Eleanor I’m so glad you went with your choice, thank you for not supporting those greedy people and I hope they’re reputation and value goes down the drain. Can’t wait to see this new build hopefully this year!
Build a gray and black 67' Camaro on a new Camaro platform and call it a Halicki DS
Chris, get your car back.
Also, the reason Denice Halicki is so powerful is due to the fact that she was engaged to her third cousin and lawyer Robert Kardashian. Now you know where she got her legal advice, Kim's father.
Unfortunately, this isn't over as there is still an unsettled lawsuit that could flip this decision. Federal lawsuit (case number 8:20-CV-01344) The court set a trial date of March 2023.
I can say that since what happened after your build was stolen ; i have not watched that movie and cringe every time I hear that E word mentioned. I think a cash grab has royally backfired on someone something terrible, which is what most people would call Karma. PS dont know if you watched the original movie but it was FUCKING TERRIBLE so glad it was re-made.
So happy to have a Shelby car. I was shocked after the other incident.
Hell yeah!!! And like that Elenor is Gone lmao may their design RIP
nice. simply just nice.
Yeah fuck those money grabbing cunts. Proud for you guys
Susan G. Kommen did it with pink...
2002 😆
👍👍👍👍👍👍🇦🇺
heck yeah, good to hear.
2002?
👍
the widower can expire. shes been useless since her husbands death. individuals shouldnt have the right to do what they did. they fucked the car scene. didnt improve it. boomers are useless. even your gparents
i dont understand the part with the 4 movie, isnt there only 2 gone in 60 sec ???
I heard about this, pretty awesome, halicki and her team have been known trolls over this and I was elated when I heard Shelby gave her the legal smackdown and derailed her gravy train for good.
Good 4 YOU Chris!! Hell with that Hag!
I'm so happy the court judges decided to have a movie night. Also eat dirt Denice Halicki.
I WOULD HAVE PUT THE CAR IN A GRINDER BEFORE GIVING IT TO THE BITCH!!!
Movie Mustangs better than Eleanor: 1) The Baja Special Mustang from The Thomas Crown Affair, originally created for Last Action Hero, with knobby tires, no roof and a roll bar. Incredible car. 2) The Innerspace Mustang restomod based on a '67 convertible but lowered with a wide body fender flare setup and modern side mirrors. Incredible car and sounds. Wow. 3) The Aston Martin V8 Vantage Volante in The Living Daylights which is basically a combination of 1978 mustang headlights on a 60s grill and hood. That car is the ultimate mustang. And the color is incredible looking bronze in some scenes, steel gray in others. Gorgeous car. And it's what the Mustang II in '74-78 would have been if the gas crisis never happened. Aston got it right better than Ford.  Eleanor who?
4 things that just bug me about this whole thing 1st. The car her husband used as Eleanor was just a yellow mach 1 2nd. It was typically a nickname I don't think a nickname is copyright-able 3rd. Always called it a Shelby GT500 Eleanor or GT500 Eleanor since I always just saw a Shelby car and just assumed it was built BY SHELBY for the movie since it looked like a GT500 with a few superficial changes. 4th. How easy is it to become a judge, would explain California's predicament
I didn't really like the 73 Mustang in the original movie. They beat the living daylights out of that car and it took it. The Cage remake car has been Fooseified. I like the original Shelby GT500, it is timeless. I was in a shop today that had one in black and it was beautiful. I don't like the molded in, slicked off scoops, or the droopy looking fender flares on the Cage car. For them to claim license to the clapped out GT500 at the end of Cage movie is just wrong, as that is Shelby's design! Glad you are going to build what you want and giving the finger to this whole mess.
I'm glad native is vegan free.
Build this 67 and call it Elea-nope just to troll these "Eleanor" trolls.  I remember when all that BS originally went down so stupid....
You do know that Mr Carroll Shelby has passed away , may 10th 2012. So why do you keep speaking of him? Just wondering
it's awesome that you're gonna get to build your Shelby but can someone please tell me what the 4 movies are? there are only 2 "gone in 60 seconds" movies. what am I missing?
You should build one just for the final middle finger to those dirt bags
They return you the previous car?
I hope you sue to get your car back.
Friends don't let friends drive fords. Leave that junk in the scrap yard
I’m ready lol
Congrats on the win. Now you can stop being the 'We don't want to be in a situation like B is for build' guy. Total bs situation. I can understand trying to control a legacy but a movie about a silver mustang that has a few mods on top of being a shelby doesn't make it different. Blame Barret Jackson for feeding her ego.
Bro please fight for your car
No I don't understand this or why this was a scam from the beginning it never was and never should've been giving copyright protections. Dude you should just counter sue and really get your shit back
Well Foose did say he based it off a GT500
Watched a dozen or so videos and never subscribed but had to make sure I hit the button after this one!
you should call the next mustang your building the fuckuanore
Good for you, shitty ass hollywood profiting off legendary Shelby!!!! Than suing people, classic hollywood or bollywood shite (they are equal woods in my eyes)
I still don't understand that a Brand will sue it's customers for wanting to preserve heritage! Why?!!! What's the point.....
This nonsense ruined Gone in Sixty Seconds for me.  Screw this bitch for thinking she could get away with claiming Shelby's design as her's and screw the courts that let her get away with it.
This is a bad ass video !
Why give it a stupid name like Eleanor. All my cars are called BITCH!
Shell-B is for build.
Love that and nuff respect..!!!
Your love,  admiration and respect for Carroll Shelby and his accomplishments,  gave me, a new respect for you as a creator,  designer and builder.   Prayers for your health,  your family and your future endeavors.
Fuck the 9th. Their shit gets over turned all the time. Nothing to do with this video just can't stand that court
They Didn't create the Name did they? They don't own it, I woulda just told em to fuck off & kick rocks
Just build the car.
The Indiana guy who did Batmobiles has had a tone of issues. But it’s with one costumer.  Hope good things get going your way.
I wanna see the entire car community ban together and trick them into going after several ppl and all of them beat them in court and destroy them bc if you can’t put a body kit on the car you own without getting sued then some stuff needs to change
That would be so cool if Carroll Shelby gave you a visit while you're building the car
I bet you a dollar that the first Eleanor movie gone in 60 seconds was made in the 70s probably before half these people were born
It would be funny if a YouTuber could bankrupt them bc they wanted to be ignorant especially if the entire car community and the Reddit community could destroy them
Can’t wait for the new build
I remember that my heart was broke and I was mad just because you lost it it wasn't nothing you did it was what they did
I hope you sue Halicki and her crazy lawyers they took CS car and put a few parts on it and called it their own that is crazy. Everyone should sue her ass and make her understand her errors.
Sound like a family of meth heads that know a lawyer. And are so high they think they can sue the world and win. Nuts
For God's sake man repo Eleanor fast yesterday
Old Carol is laughing from the grave calling everyone morons
Inter alia = Among other things. Phrase is often found in legal pleadings and writings to specify one example out of many.
tobys wife: Cant Understand Normal Thinking wouldve totally slid that in the video.
Should have named the car the "Bitch".......LOL
I ain’t gonna like I thought you woulda got your car back from the thieves.
Im so glad those mf's lost theat lawsuit
Shelby over Denise all day. I hope she loses everything. She deserves the worst karma possible 🔥
DO u realize u said this started in 2002 ??? I rmmbr when it happened, def wasn't 2002 lol!
Im a HUGE fan of Steve Stanford, but I cannot stand all the "eleanor" design cues he did. Im also a Shelby fan, but not because of the mustangs he built honestly.  Glad all this stuff is potentially done and over with. I say potentially as Im sure her team will go after someone else for some reason.  oh, and youre correct that the tail lights are off a Mercury Cougar
That’s so awesome. Can’t wait to see the hatchback mustang you guys build.🤘🏻👌🏻🙂
Gotta agree. Those lawsuit ruined the Eleanor image
10k in legal fees you got off cheap or have a shitty lawyer dude.. Lol with that said having owned, bought and sold around 7000 cars in the last 42yrs the Eleanor mustang is on the absolute bottom of my list, now I'll admit I've owned 4 of them simply bought to flip at auction because there's plenty of Saps that will pay stupid money for a stupid car... I dont, never have or see the hype in that turd
I do now wonder if all the people that Halicki went after have a claim since apparently this ruling means that the previous findings were in error.
Chris, lawyer here. I love your frequent insertions of, “in my opinion.” Very well done. I hope your lawyer was proud!
What gross people.
My experience is that 95% of Eleanor builds are not Shelby GT-500s, most are not even ‘67-68 Mustang GTs.
It's crazy that you can make a full on replica of of the DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future and nobody has complained about that but the Eleanor Mustang was somehow an issue. When clearly the DeLorean in that film probably could be copyrighted in the way they tried to copyright the Eleanor Mustang.
You should be able to take them back to court and sue them for everything they cost you, since there is now precedent set by a higher court. Good on Shelby for slapping Denice down. (Also, she DEFINITELY did not create or design that car)
I had my shop broke into and my wife’s 65 fast back we were sick I was just getting started resto on it
This video absolutely made my day! I love what you guys do and I can't wait to see the new fastback build!!
Gotta keep in mind Oregon courts are especially bad.
There was 4 films with a car named Elenor in it?
I never even heard of Elenor lol
I never considered Eleanor a character, just a nice looking car, more akin to eye candy show car. Now the design and look of the car gives it character but that's a different type of character with different meaning. Eleanor was the goal car of the plot, Nicolas Cage played a Character whose goal was to get the car.
I know the two Gone in 60 Seconds films, but what are the other 2 B for Builds references?
I don't want an Eleanor now ever I will build my s197 408 windsor Shelby tribute screw Eleanor
@LegalEagle love to hear your take on this! I'd love get more info on the Daniels Test.
So where is Chris's Eleanor build ?
I'd tell them I want my car back in the same condition it was when they took it, and if not returned as it was when taken they owe back pay for revenue that was lost because of their stealing it.
This body swap shit is lame lol… it’s like a transgender car 🥴
Some greedy bitch took it too far and now the Eleanor has fallen from grace... good fuck her and those movies. All the love for Carol Shelby ❤️
When I saw the article I definitely thought of your story first.
39$ for deodorant 😂😂
where is your car and will you get it back  its your property not hers
but what happened to the car they took away ?
It never made any sense she would sell parts for the cars but then sue anyone who used them. Is that nuts or what?
then I'm guessing you'll be going with a nice deep blue with white or cream stripes?
Can´t wait for see your car finally running!
I can only think of 2 movies with Eleanor in it? What are the other 2. I don't think it was even in the original 2nd movie.
You should sue to get your car back or monetarily  reimbursed for your car.
Our legal system is fucked.
As like you, I have my own opinions on this crazy case. I believe you were gangstocked by The British Accreditation Regency within your State whom conspired with other State BAR agents within the US union to scheme other mustang owners and builders . And it was raising awareness about the 4th amendment and private property issues tangible an entangible property rights. So basically the BAR was commiting capital crimes against each state constitution and it's inhabitants owning anything relating to private property violating intellectual property of movie franchise with a broken chain of intellectual property. Nun prun tunc .
Just awesome Chris! You build some amazing machines! When I’m rich and famous maybe you can build one for me! Ok, rich, famous, well it’s fun to dream eh.
You da man!
"2002 a couple of months after covid hit" - what?  Covid hit in late 2019 / early 2020.
This is like people suing because you "stole" their idea for a flower arrangement.  Build what you want and screw these insane rich assholes.
I think I'm going to name my 2015 GMC Canyon "ELENOR".... wait maybe they'll sue me too?
I’m not surprised all of this came from a woman. Had this been a man, he would be proud for his name to be the namesake of a famous car.
Ok, so...call it Sue instead of Eleanor...lmao
Ok but are you getting your original car back?
Bravo young man. Denise and Eleanor can dine on a large bowl of Richards.
In my opinion. I feel bad for anyone that bought an "Eleanor." Their prices are going to plummet because of this lawsuit and I hope they go back and sue Mrs. Halicki to recoup their losses.
Fantastic, as far as she goes , Can’t Understand Nutty Thinking 🤔🤗🤣
I've never referred to any Shelby car as Eleanor, the original wasn't even a Shelby car.
You keep talking like Carrol is still alive, feels weird but I get what you mean.
Ford people.
These are not Eleanor
It's a yellow Mach 1 in the original movie.
You’re attorney team is worth every penny!!
Wow, I learned something new  about COVID. It hit us back in 2002.
“Eleanor is a character”  No.  It’s a car with a name.  The General Lee is more of a character than Eleanor ever could or will be.  KITT, the Mach 5, and the Batmobile are more of a “character” than Eleanor; and certainly more original than a high trim Mustang with a few bolt ons.  The lawsuits over Eleanor being a character is just a money grab…  plain and simple.
Great plan moving forward man.   I loved the gone in 60 Seconds 2000 film, I will never watch it again after what they did to you, Denise successfully killed her brand here. In my opinion, what a terrible person to rob so many people of so much joy, she could have come to you and made it an official build, and built her brand, but instead she chose to be a terrible person and alienate everyone.   I am looking forward to your Shelby build.
If its worth doing its worth doing three times.  All jokes aside im glad this turned out well for you and shelby.  3rd times the charm cant wait to see
I do hope you get you car back from that bitch though. You really can't let her keep it at this point...
F Eleanor!, car looked like a plastic pile of sheeet.
To me the whole situation is weird because the original Eleanor is a yellow and black 72 Mustang Mach 1 with a 351c. From the original Gone in 60 seconds from 1970 HB Halack classic  You should build the 73 Mach1 cause that is the real Eleanor, just to stick it to them  Sad thing is HB Halaki died in a car stunt while filming the Gone in 60 seconds 2, honestly og film has the great car chase scene in movie history …. It’s a solid 45 mins
I feel like it was probably left out on purpose, but what happens to all they cars they seized? Do all those become null and the rightful owners get them back?
Thank you for posting this video. The events you describe here had pissed me off so much that I had never watched another one of your videos. And I had been a big fan of the channel. Not that it was your fault, but it just left a bad taste for me. This sort of fixes that.
Finally... Kicked that B to the curb!  NICE!
People are still building Eleanors in 2023? Yikes
It definitely feels like covid started in 2002
Came here for the drama (you know you did too), but left with actual knowledge separating what's a GT500 vs an Eleanor. Very informative and this is even better.
You should get your car back, because Elenor doesn’t have copyright, they have no grounds to keep you car, you built the car yourself and therefore it’s yours, not there’s. please dude, that was an amazing car you put a lot of effort into, and you deserve to enjoy YOUR build
Vegan, cruelty free deodorant? EFF THAT! I want mean, ANGRY, meat eating deodorant!!!  Cool cars though.............
A few thoughts, and some won’t be popular…  The controversy helped build your channel.  I can’t say if it was worth it or not, but I wager a lot of folks sympathetic to your position on discovered your channel (and the carol Shelby legacy) so maybe a silver lining?  H.B. Halicki made a really cool movie in 1974.  On a shoestring doing his own stunts.  It has been a cult classic car film for many years…and now that reputation has been tarnished by some bad behavior from the guardian of that brand.   The modern movie sucked.  Gone in 60 seconds (1974) was a car chase movie that needed people for the chase, the modern adaption tried to make it a people story, and not a well written one to boot.  The star of gone is 60 Seconds (1974) is Elenor…a Yellow mustang fastback.  The star of the modern interpretation was nick Cage.
I hope the bill goes easy for you and I hope everything goes out and you get the desired effect of the car that you're looking for and take a piss on the other one
You felt you did something wrong.  No, they *made* you feel like you did something wrong.
Unfortunately the real truth about Carroll Shelby and his family is much different than the pr material that you have referenced in referred to about him being such a great driver. His professional achievements are no better than the majority of the top drivers in the his circuits at that time.  But he and his family were directly involved in criminal misconduct including and sued multiple times as well as enforcement agencies raiding his facilities.  When he concluded his racing contract as a driver for GM, they even refused to let him back into any GM facilities past the lobby....well documented. Heck his family even sued each other over control of his body after he died for control of the money.  And the Carroll Shelby foundation kept about 98% given to them... verified by tax audits...instead of it going to sick children..... And who ran the Shelby foundation..... The Shelby family   REM and Dean Moon who actually built the very first cobra with rem providing all the logistics with ac motorcars..... Both walked out after only about one year at Shelby's shop.  Rem went on for the next 40  plus years at Dan gurney's shop All-American racers.
Sue there a off for every dime it cost ypu and what lost
3:13 you say “this all started for me in ‘2002’, a couple months after covid hit” but covid hit in 2020. Did you mean 2020 and not 2002?
What a bunch of tossers, so glad you are back Chris. I would consider burning the car.
👍
The ending was so satisfying. I can't wait to see how the new build turns out!
you used Eleanor for clout and clicks and it backfired
Hell Yes!  Video just makes me want to watch Ford v. Ferrari right now!!  Can't wait to see your build.  Congrats!
Congratulations on your partial win . But I think you should get your car back anyway. I wouldn't want her to think that she has won against you.
If you name it Susan, it's a 6 cylinder
Just call it Karen , nobody can copyright a Karen
Excelente ❤❤ bravo 👏
I don't like the Eleanor cars on principle because of the removal from the marketplace my favorite classic car.  I will likely never be able to buy the 67 mustang fastback and get it to look like the one I missed years ago for a reasonable price.
About dang time!
America land of the free
All I can add is Carroll Shelby is the GOAT.
Well said sir
Brother, this lawsuit pissed ME off, and I have nothing to do with it. Wasn't it a 25 year deal or something? Aren't they almost done with it???("the name"). so many other builds slipping through the cracks and just because you have a decent following they start shit. Fuck them, man. Sorry to rant lol. I hope this all ends in your favor. Even if there isn't a B-is-for-build-elenor.
If you go back in the comments fairly early on in your original E build I did tell you what would happen with the whole calling it the E word but no one listened...........
“This all started around 2002 around when Covid hit”
Good on you..!
That story is ending really well ! F*** Eleanor, honestly they deserve it. I used to think people were overrating this car but was “well ok it’s a hero car, that movie is a classic “ etc, since this has happened with you, I totally lost interest in this movie and it might be stupid, but decided not to watch it anymore, it’s not even a good movie anymore, it didn’t age well. I think you are making the best decision ever to build a tribute to Shelby instead, that will be much more exciting, interesting, valuable, than an Eleanor that looks imo like a pimp my ride mustang.
Counter sue the woman for everything! She has made people's life's miserable. She needs a taste of her own meds!
Eleanor is a beautiful car, but so damn overplayed, it’s like widebody BRZ’s, or liberty walk GTR’s it’s boring now
Yes do it
this is what happens when a company X has a lawyer on retainer they pay 20-25k a year and can go around suing everyone for fun and to get money.
Imagine being so selfing with an idea that’s not even originally yours that you chase away the fans of that idea
I always thought their enforcement of copyright was downright evil. Pissed me off that they could just confiscate a car for being inspired. Think they deserve to get the book thrown at em
I hope people start building the hell out of that car as a big middle finger to her.
Respect!
The "Eleanor" car is overrated. Use your own imagination and build something better.
This whole thing is so dumb. It's a car, she should have never been allowed to sue anyone
If your story was even a small reason for shelby to take those idiots to court damn thats legal revenge and i love it. The helicopter 🚁 restoration guy from greece. I am currently rebuilding a robinson helicopter and you are an inspire to start crazy projects
Sooooo.... time to get your car back?
Fuck her and Eleanor. Since the first time I heard that they had done this to you I thought they where just nasty and horrible. For you to now tell the full story and what she was using to stake her claim against so many people is just down right horrible.  Do your build, do it your way and finish in your style, with some lovely Shelby parts. Support the good, push aside the bad
I need to ask you a question Eleanor, was my mom name I my car is name after my mom before the movie came out would that be a problem. Because I’m not taking the name off my car regard less to whom has the copy right.
He said 2002 😂 love it
Your GT500 restomod will be dope! Definitely a car I want to build in the future.
I stopped following your videos after your “off-road Lamborghini” project suddenly stopped being posted 🤔
LOL People can build whatever they want.
i cant stand people who ruin old cars and put modern bullshit in them or ruin a good rust free body and body swap on a new chassis with modern running gear! old cars should be left old!
Covid hit in 2002? @3:14
I bet Toby is rolling in his grave over their stupidity. My father knew him from back in the days before he was famous and told me that he was pretty level headed and not the money grabbing  shill that his wife is.
That’s why I don’t support ford
Absolute broken court system
so what about counter suing and pursuing damages for lost revenue, money invested, and a whole car? probl sure you cant speak on it just yet but im very curious.
Right there with ya man. Shelby Mustangs are the real deal and not some Hollywood prop.
goddamn Karens..errrr Denices. 😒🙄
Chris you aren’t a lawyer and you shouldn’t just state facts that are in fact, just your opinion 😂😂😂
To everyone who owns this shape car. Build a replica just to piss them off
I whole-heartedly agree with you, gt 500 is one of my favorites.
I absolutely detest how people/groups get so ridiculously insane over copyright legality like that. Get over yourself.
I have been waiting for this nice!!
After watching this i ditch the name elenor and just stick with the name shelby gt500
Everyone. He signed a NDA with them. He's already been paid off for his Elenore 🤣 he's not going to do the right thing because he already made his money. Just another fake YouTuber
hell yeah
hmm when u guys do a body swap like that, will the car be register as a 2019 mustang or 1967 mustang.
Meh.  Eleanors are ok but overrated. Go build something cooler.
All this over a butt ugly car.
She married the guy that built the original car. Then she sued B is For Build to get his car. It sounds like fking people to get what she wants is how she has gone through life. Real piece of work she is.
here bloody here..... hope u get yours bud
Nichols cage calls Eleanor a 67 gt 500.that should have been end of discussion
I can’t stand this lady and her nasty little team
4 movies, only gone in 60 seconds right? lol
That is kick ass dude!  Congrats!
Yea people build “tribute” cars all the damn time…. Lmao sound like she had someone sit her down and was like….. I bet we could sue for this…. Kinda like the story of the donkey Kong high score…..
I just screamed Merica!!! Long live Shelby!
Bring back the Eleanor build!!!! woop woop!
Know what’s wild, never ever called them other than a gt500 or a Shelby
I won’t even watch the movies anymore.
Eleanor is nothing but a clean looking car. Nothing more.
I was just telling my wife about what they did to your car yesterday .
Just for your informationn, Carol Shelby as passed away ;) you mentionned his name like he's still alive.
Even Ferrari would give you less trouble than this. (I think)
Looks like they wanted to go after you on the black 07 because the original Eleanor was reversed black with the peppered bronze rally stripes so in their minds any black and silver or silver and black GT500 was Eleanor.  Oh hells yeah Carol Shelby was a stone cold,big brass ones clanking friggin legend. Ford vs Ferrari is a good look at that Lemans race.
I'm sorry but that Sema car is ugly as hell.
Great video, love how you ended it, that will be a phenomenal build to follow! You guys have alot of experience in these body swaps now so I expect a damn near perfect rendering lol
2022
Any Licensed Elenor’s should simply be banned/shunned from any car show/event.  Also why is Ford sitting this one out, Ford owns the base rights.
You know they reading the comments and boy love karma ;)
Heck yeah, can't wait for the new mustang build! Congratulations, Chris!
Thank you for sharing this with us. Can not wait to see your new car when it is done.
You should sue and make her pay for the car she stole from you 😂
Good for you Chris.  Must have been a real bummer this whole experience.  Great to see you positive and bouncing back with a great attitude.  Looking forward to seeing you build the daily drive.
You were the first person i thought of when i read that bit of news a few weeks ago!
Terrific vid man.  Great work.  I loved it.
It's a shitty looking fake movie car anyway
would be great if you could sue her and claim damages
F@#k Eleanor,  just call it an 'Amber' Sh1t, maybe not!
Inter Alia; Latin "Among other things" When they cite a reason for the cease and desist like copyright infringement,  inter alia is used that reason among other things,  and not solely the one reason cited.
3:15 ummmm wrong year bro
Every car on the list to be stolen had a name. Shelby AC cobra was Ashley,  Toyota Land Cruiser was Kathy, Toyota supra turbo was LYNN,  the 911 turbo TwinTurbo was Tonya,   I believe Nick Cage’s character called it his unicorn,  which was a Shelby GT500,  not just the specific Shelby GT500 in the movie,  but any Shelby GT500 he tried to steal in the past and failed.  Does that mean they have a copyright on every one of those cars given name?  It clearly says on the chalkboard that Eleanor is a Shelby GT 500, the product of a Carroll Shelby and Ford collaboration.
Fuck Eleanor. Kudos and Props to Carol Shelby! Your doin right Bub! Good on Ya!
I have been quietly following this “debacle “ seriously thank you for your take on the results and your comparison between the 2.
Can you bot get make them give you your car back and compensation for damages
They aren't "filled in" they're just fake Shelby recreations on a normal mustang
Very interesting video. As a guy who loves Mustangs, owned a '69 fastback, and a '70 BOSS 302, I have never heard of an Elanor. Definitely know Shelby. I agree, stick with the work that pays homage to Shelby.  Legal system can be disappointing, but don't let it get you down.
the fact i i know that cat as a shelby 500 and not as eleanor (i din't know about the name before like 3 months) if some one show me eleanor and a stock mustang i will be like this is a mustang with some diference's
I salute you for keeping your integrity through all of this. I just love it when a bully gets the pay-back that he (or she) deserves.
Yeah you still shouldn’t build one because they’re the most played out boomer crap ever.
What were the other 2 films?  I know the 2 60 seconds films, what were the others?
3:12 covid hit in 2002?
Screw eleanore, built the Shelby! I can't wait to see it!
You should totally get @LegalEagle to break that down for us. That could be amazing.
I wish the court ordered zalicki to pay back the money she extorted from people throughout the years
Build an Elizabeth
Covid in 2002?
Instead of Elinor hb elania lol
Hi Chris, When I saw your videos before you deleted, I bought a ford mustang and start searching for parts to build my dream car. But when they stopped my dream has been crushed to build it because i have no other reference to watch it.But, now you give a hope to think about it again. So, please build your GT500 ASAP. sorry for my poor English. your biggest fan from KSA
maybe you should name it the " go to hell-eanor" build !!!!😁😁
If I remember correctly, Disney went after a guy with brz/frs lightning McQueen or something that was a car made before the movies came out. The guy lost to Disney of course
Snore
Anyone who tells me I can't spend my money making my car like something I want will get their family killed. Rather mind your own business for your own sake.
To be honest, who would want to make replica Eleanor from the Nick Cage Gone in 60.  It's ugly.
Sue for damages against you. All the videos you could've made in that time period, sue for legal fees and however much you think you would've made off of those videos. Since basically your court case is void. They're just trying to reach into your pocket.
imagine they tried the same thing with herbie
Loved the update. I remember how disturbed I was when you lost your car. I'm happy you are somewhat upbeat over the whole affair. Good luck and happy building. I will subscribe to watch you and the new NOT-Eleanor build.
I don't recall the yellow 71 being called Elanor. Maybe I need to rewatch.
distgusting how they can't be decent people and find a good solution... 🤢
Loved the video. Definitely looking forward to this build.
did anyone else hear 2002 ...so the eleanor build started before youtube even existed 😂
Can't wait for the "Shelby" tribute build. ~Bad four letter word~ Eleanor! I think it'd look cooler with a side pipe then the molded side skirt anyway..... this coming from a MOPAR guy .... lol.
Awesome update. I really respect the path you're taking with the tribute to Shelby
what four movies are you talking about?
Completely agree with you, shocker: I never understood the hooha over the elinor car anyway, shelby’s look much better.
TIL there were 3 more movies with Eleanor. I only knew about the Gone in 60 Seconds with Nick Cage.
Super based dude. I feel the same way as you. Her overreach made me never want an Eleanor. I’d be totally for a Shelby GT500 however.
Old salty hoe was greedy. Old salty hoe got slapped by Shelby. good ending achieved
your more than welcome to use the spelling of my last name Elenor :-)
Denise almost single handedly destroyed the ambition and dreams for my entire generation of car lovers. I remember in high school writing whole book reports dedicated to Elanor, and every car guy I know loved that car too...and then they pulled all these lawsuits and overnight I and everyone else I know suddenly hated it. I'm so happy the courts got this right in an almost timely manner. The car I used to fall asleep dreaming about isn't gone.
fuck yea, cant wait for the new build and we all know that its a silent middle finger to that "Elanor" lady!
Excellent video. Thank you for filling in this story’s missing parts.
Don't forget, they can still appeal and could possibly win. So don't be too confident.
4 movies? I thought elenor was only in 2 movies. What are the other 2? Same films in different languages?
As much as it sucks, I haven't watched any of the films since the car was stolen. Won't support halacki anymore.
This woman Denise is just a twat who inherited a last name and since the husband was gone she needed a paycheck so she gave a car a name and then copyrighted it lmao. What a loser ! So many people hate her she’s a loser a nothing ! She didn’t make a car !! All she did was marry a man and take his last name and then take a car and give it a name !! What a true twat !
Hell yeah!!! So happy that youll get to build it!! I cant wait to see it happen. Making it a Shelby tribute car instead of Eleanor is just the cherry on  top, Fuc* That bit**!!
Well anymore people are allowed to identify as many things. Maybe “Eleanor” is allowed to identify as all different types of mustangs. Lol.
You go do that Mustang tribute to  C. Shelby, so looking forward to see the end result! "F" the attorneys that sued you, they should all be removed from the bar.
After your video about losing the mustang. I’ve said. Fuck an Eleanor. I’d rather drive a mustang 2
2002 and too before covid hit? I’m confused by that
Shelby actually redesigned the body of the mustang and Denise pulled a “I’ll copy your paper but change a few words and turn it in as my own” type of deal. Frankly both the Shelby and Eleanor are Shelbys design, Eleanor isn’t different enough to constitute it being a whole other car the way Shelbys and Mustangs are. The way I see it Eleanor is just a SLIGHTLY modified Shelby, so it’s still Shelbys design. This woman is trying to defend a case of plagiarism
Can somebody just give chris a real gt500 in really bad condition and let him build it back. Somebody has to know a guy who has a rusted out one in the yard 🥺
What a  class act. All I can say.
artistic freedom 😂😂😂😂😂
Four movies? Someone help me out here. I've only every know of the two.  Oh and the 1974 film is better.
It was always just a Shelby Mustang ....
It’s going to be epic. The fact that ur going to do another build & give credit to Shelby is the icing on the cake 👍
Maybe all those Eleanor owners should got after Ms. Halicki for tanking their car's value  🤔
Covid hit in 2002?
So excited! Yes!!!!!
I 100% agree that situation ruined Elinor for me to the point I no longer wanted one or respected the name. Not for what you did but how that Denise was about it, she ruined the name with her actions IMHO.
Love the future direction you are going to take. Looking forward to seeing it come alive.
Out of curiosity, how would one title a body swapped mustang? Using the body vin, chassis vin or or apply for a “home build” vin?
Wasn't the Nick Cage 'Eleanor' built by Chip Foose?
4 movies, I only know of 2 (1973 and 2000 gone in 60 seconds). What is the full list of 4 movies?
i knew you couldnt "legally" make one but also glad that she got what she deserved for her greed! all she did was take cars and finished them and sold them again.
But what about your old car. Did they destroy it? Is it sitting somewhere and one day you'll get it back? Or is that the thing you were saying that you're not really allowed to talk about yet?
ya,   F is for F dAT bish....
ok thats great and everything and I totally support you not wanting to build an elinor , but wheres your mustang you should get that mustang back plus be paid all the legal fees you paid when they took it
You'd think someone who owns IP like that would be excited that popular builders are honoring their work and driving customers to their IP.  Instead, they turn into blood-soaked enema implements to steal a few thousand dollars from folks who just loved a movie.  I hope horrible things happen to them.
Fuck yeaaaa I can't wait for this build..Chris is pumped to . You can hear it in his voice....lol
there has to be something written in the law that something that has been under copywrite by an automotive company, cant be claimed as a copy written hollywood fantasy character.  a ford mustang is a FORD MUSTANG no matter what pretty nickname it gets on a screen.  just wow.
MADD Respect to you! I've always loved your content, but I respect you so much more! I Can't wait to see the SHELBY build! Good job B is for Build!!
dont build one cause there fucking ugly and terrible. The only real Elenore is the 71 mach 1 that was used in the ORIGINAL gone in 60 seconds.
Great job on the new one! Sucks the engine isn't Ford
Fuckin' A. Goddam Yes. Screw Elenore, LONG LIVE THE GLORY OF CARROL SHELBY! AMERICAN ORIGINAL. You, though, are the man.
It wasn't a Shelby! They are Dumb!
Thunder Bird tail light! 64-65
Way to go, Chris! You said it all: Carl Shelby is a true legend and real american hero! Personally, I'm with Oscar on this: I like the coupé ones better. But I can't wait to see this build - specially after seeing all the struggles you guys went through with Oscar's 😂😂😂
When I saw "Gone in 60 Seconds" I thought "hey, great looking (Shelby) GT350". Foose does nice work, but I didn't see enough variation to think it anything but a Shelby. I'm glad the courts got it right this time.
Wasn't Even A Fucking A Shelby!
Love it….
It wasn't used it in the Original movie! It was A Fucking A 351Clevand
Did you use the 71-73 Fast Back!? Case Closed!
I like your opinion; it was the best thing I’ve heard in a long time. You build and film or I'll watch it. Good luck bro.
The problem is she is out of _$
Well Big Daddy. The Original Gone In 60 Seconds was 71-73 Mustang! So they can eat sand
I’d rather have the classic recreations GT500 anyway.
Great video man thx
The 9th Circuit is GARBAGE, absolute garbage, it is why a lot of these nonsense lawsuits are brought before their bench.  They are the most overturned court in the united states.
If someone loses a lawsuit and the appeals process, they should have to pay for the opposing party’s legal fees. Especially if it’s an individual or small business and not a major corp.  The whole “the process is the punishment” needs to be taken out to Canada for a visit to the local MAID center.
Denise Hollicky = The Ultimate Karen!!  What a bag of crap!!
Shelby made the cake Elanor was just a slice
You know why there’s never child seats in the back of a mustang ?
From now on, “Eleanor” can kick rocks! I will henceforth refer to any mustang with the likeness as a “Shelby”
Couldn't you counter sue for punitive charges basically stating it was biast and totally wrong
Just build a Mustang and name it Denice Halicki.
Good to hear about your newest body swap Mustang build which you will be able to customize to your own taste. Can't wait to see the progress on it.
The most shocking thing about this video was to find out there were 4 Gone in 60 Seconds movies! I was like were there direct to video sequels I didnt know of?? i had forgotten the movie was a remake, and the old one had sequels.
Mic drop and ,can't wait for the new build.
The only question I have is did you get your car back?
@ 8:10 sounds like extortion to me.
Shelby has put his talents into many different vehicles and not all were fords. I think that a tribute car built to honor him is an awesome ending to this story.
Just scum bags
You have GOT to sneak “Elenor” ever few sentences in all your videos for the next 3 months. Do it. Your lawyer said they approve
Call it the Smellanor, paint uneven racing stripes that look like a middle finger
i Always thought the Elenore car was awesome too till that whole deal went down and they took the car.. I dont think of the car the same anymore.. but hearing this story and the tribute car idea,, that is awesome and im glad you pointed out where the credit was actually due.. Carroll Shelby Definitely deserves all the credit. I hope that u can get the car back, if its still around...  just because.. Cant wait for that build .. Awesome video by the way..
A Shelby GT500 by any other name, is still for all Americans.” Probably not Carol Shelby.
Lmao name the next build The boycott Elenor build.   BEB Mustang 500
The court system isn't broken. It's the people in it who are. After all any and all systems are nothing more than a construct of the human mind. Essentially something we all just decided to agree to.
F That B
I’m gonna guess your lawyer advised you to use the phrase “in my opinion” 😂
Take your car back! If Elanor is not a trade marck, they have took it illegally from you! sue the crap out of them with the best lawyers
I had no idea they tried going after the 07 mustang, that's hilarious. I have legitimately avoided watching the movies (I still haven't seen them) since the original kurfuffle
Right on point. It was Shelby’s design. Thank god they went after the Eleanor jokers.
If there was a way youtube invented a clapping sound that played out loud for you if we don't the clapping hands emoji. It's now. They need to do it. Bravo man. I refused to watch the film ever since this happend.
3:14   2002 ???????  LOL
I like how professional you were about it.
This is the video I hoped for when I saw you take down your original videos
the C&D was sent by her, not lawyers.  she was a fraud.
Yesssssssssssss!
Yay! Happy times. All is right with the world!
Am i the only one that heard him say 2002 at 3:13 ??🤣🤣
bro go get your car back.  it'd be epic. i mean do the shelby car too. but get your car back and call it carl or whatever . 😂
Finally. The fact that Eleanor ever had copyright protection as a freaking character is complete garbage. Super sexy brilliant classic car? Sure. An actual character with movie credits? Please.
Glad that worked out, honestly glad she got what was coming to her. She was just milking it and trying to get money out of that shit. Pathetic really.
such a satisfying answer to a questioon i have had for a long time.
You should call that white wide  body mustang "Escanor" as a F u to them 👍🏽🔥🔥😈
The build will be a tribute to Shelby and a middle finger to the other dudes 😆
THIS is by far one of the best videos you have ever made! your brain is the reason you've done well,  Seeing this all happen over the time i've been watching to see this resolution, very cool
Are you not entitled to your car back and or cash and all costs there of
A little brief research on my part shows that at one time Denice Halicki was engaged to her third cousin Robert Kardashian. Nuff said.
"We saved the best for last. The 67 Shelby Mustang GT500."      -Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage)        Gone in 60 seconds  https://youtu.be/RedV7vhVKHY  How was there ever any doubt that this car is a Shelby? The American legal system really is broken to even entertain the idea it was someone else's creation, let alone award Halicki anything. I'm so happy Shelby won in the end and squashed that nasty cockroach!
So you can't get yours back that they took?
hi just a question what are the 4 eleanor movies??? i only ever thought there were 2
I love it!!
That's great news! Have i missed the 370z give away announcement? I've been checking all your social media and haven't seen it
To me Elenor is the same as B.B King name all his guitars Lucille. C.Shelby is also an American icon
Interalia means " among other stuff"
Absolutely spot on, and exactly what I thought when I first saw it. Sweet Shelby! Well said.
Still didn’t mention what’s going to happen to your old car, you should get it back and crush it
What happened to country of the free?🤭
There is a 3 million + subscriber youtuber who was working with a donation company giving away this vehicle or one like it, his fans told him about  this channel and what happened. He did the right thing and stopped the give away immediately this is what needs to be done, hit these  idiots in the  pocket book and maybe they will fix the laws someday
3:15...you say started around 2002?
Can you sue the bitch?
just want to say that i use an adblocker and this was the first video ive actually used the unskip function on sponsor segments because i absolutely hate what happened to you with the mustang.
My guy you said 2002 instead of 2022
As I stated before even back when they stopped you it could have never even been and Elanor car because of the base model being 2015 mustang Elanors most famous model was that of a 67 Shelby Fastback GT so the interior would not match they just wanted recognition for being a badass who can control you build which was insane copyright infringement is making an exact replica of copyrighted material without permission inside and out match
Body swap onto a gt350 or gt500 that way it’s truly a Shelby tribute.
I was a little worried about what the message of this video would be, but it ended in just the right place, a tribute to Carol Shelby. Kudos to you Chris for turning a bad situation into something we can all put our passion behind.
Much respect to u b is for build
When an Eleanor...becomes a Felon-or. And your dreams are Gone in 60 Seconds!
This is fantastic. I love it.
Thank you for making this video 😎 Closure at last
Ledge
So what actually happened to your car? Did is het destroyed? Does it still exist?
For me the gt500 will always be an Eleanor.
Chip foose made the most famous Elenor
This helicki lady just made a living seeing people and made money,   and did it until it didn't work any more.    Imagine how many cars and how much h money she got from her garbage lawsuits
Can’t you sue back for the money it cost you to not make those videos? And what you lost out
The Shelby/CR is better looking than the Elenor!
Whats worse is that its not even HER design or creation. Just another kid mooching off their parents, and ultimately sullying their name.  Be good parents. Teach them to be their own people, with their own achievements.
I hope the Halicki estate goes broke!
Whoop! 🙌🏻 🎉
The original movie featuring Eleanor was shit, but the real irony is that that her late husbands character in the movie stole the car…
B IS FOR BUILD IT
Bulls$#$& that I pay premium and people are inserting ads in in the narrative.  But bye
And he make some damn good chili seasoning mix.
Denise Halicki has made both the name Denise and Elenore synonyms with Karen. Instead of calling all once pretty, but now the overbearing women... Karens, let us all call them all Denises. Hopefully your going to sue her. It'll be good content, and serve to protect everyone else.
They can take that Eleanor and shove it where the sun don't shine. I would build one better than Eleanor and call it a HellEleanor with a sticker crapping on Eleanor.
Name the car Denise......then send her a cease and desist for using her own name, as she's not a car.
Hallelujah!!! 🙌🏼👍👏🏼👏🏼🎉 Great News!! I see an update to that Donut Wheelhouse vid needed and hope you are in it!!
🤔……..😭👶🏻
God I'm so pumped for this!
i love how at some point your lawyer told you to make sure you said "in my opinion" before slagging people off :P
F* elanor, we fell no more!
Name of the next; B is Beleanor, a tribute to Carroll Shelby
"Its only 4 movies and one of them is even good" 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Savage and brilliant
I love that this video is basically a huge middle finger to Halicki.
And that car could be called Carol..........
Fuck. Yes.  Good guys win.
4 films???? i thought they were 2??
Justice Prevails!
This is heck of a video man!
So, you going to repost all the videos they forced you to take down?
F@#k Halicki and her litigious ghouls
I wish you would sue the Karen.
"Carroll Shelby is a gaddamn American hero" - I couldn't agree more, and I am not even American. Never even be there. But as a car guy, that statement could not be any more true!
That just shows you what Hollywood thinks of there self.They are no Shelby. I had a 67 Shelby and there's is not one of them.
The world is fucked it’s crap now from bullshit lawsuits and name drops.. hopefully some Russian dick drops a nuclear to start 01.00.00
What a crazy story. Man, I wish you'd sue her into the ground for everything.
- Delorean DMC10 with a flux capacitor  - 83 Pontiac Trans am with a red led in the grill  -68/9 charger in orange confederate flag & 01  -63 beetle in white with 53 on the bonnet & doors  - GMC Vandura black & grey with red stipe & spoiler  - 58 Plymouth Fury in red  - 69/70 black charger intake sticking obscenely out of the bonnet  - 76 Gran Torino red with white stripe - 72 black Ferrari Daytona / 86 white Testarossa  List not exhaustive but where would it end if allowed to continue
I appreciate the pettiness at the end of the video 😂😂😂
Smug mode engaged..🤪
build an eleanor and gift it to whistlin diesel for "testing"
Halicki deez nuts. Copyright that, Denise.
Since 2002 , I get it. But of just how it's flow smoothly 😂
Are you going to sue the aggressors to get the value of your car back? After all they falsely produced a libel action against you and had you surrender your car to them. Talk about balls! Go get the bastards!!!
Yess im excited to see this build.
Their actions (not yours, to be clear) have made me completely uninterested in that franchise. I think you made the right call here!
Gtreaaaaaaaat news
For the algorithm
if you can counter sue them but then again seeing how they used to live they have no money is at all
Love the story and Shelby! ❤
He loves to lose cars and money. Car don’t fit corights but u can’t reproduce body kits and make a movie. Vultures will allways aks for money 💰and because thats what their accustom.
So where is the original stuff you owned that was taken from you. Can you get those parts back
.... I think after all this bull $hit the Eleanor name is poison and nobody will want one... But I'm thinking of sending a pic of my 89 s10 and my 81 foxbody to Denise and say I'm building 2 Eleanor's.
What other 3 movies besides Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)?
"2002, months before Covid hit" WTF??? 💀
Way to stay the course, and true to yourselves!
Halicky: your car looks similar to our car you cant have it!  Shelby: And I took that personally.
I'm pretty sure your story has iced the cake for Shelbys lawsuit.
Finally! Closure! Justice!   I’m so excited to watch and finish this build now!
I respect the decision to not want to make an Eleanor-like Mustang now that you would be able to again, but if you still want a famous movie Ford the Interceptor would be a solid choice.
Really looking forward to the 67' Carroll Shelby tribute build!
Perfect.
Dude with you all the way. It's like WTF?  When has it been a thing to get Sued for building a car and call it something? People have been doing this for years so, again W T A F??+??
Denise Haliki was married to the creator of Gone in Sixty Seconds for 4 months.  She's been living off his back for over 34 years since.  She is the ugliest soul ever.
i love how a dumb mechanic says dont build one so he can overcharge you for one
Cant wait for the badass build!! So happy that they absolutely destroyed the copy right of Eleanor!!
This is so silly, if anyone has a claim here, it would be Chip Foose as it is his original design and work which is what the modern Eleanor is. But, Foose wouldn't do that as he was hired to do a job by the director. Denise needs to just go away and stop grabbing for money.
Why doesn’t everyone just call them “Hellenor”?
The movie wasn’t that great anyways. I never saw the point in paying tribute to an early 2000’s Nic Cage film remake.
Should sue to get your original build back. They now have it based on a no longer valid claim. Should also sue for damages for lost revenue from the videos that had to be taken down
Man, I would have CRUSHED that car before they took it!!!
It all started in 2002
I wonder if you could sue to get your car and legal fees back?  (the car is likely gone, but monetary reoperations).
This great news. The part I can’t get over is that this self righteous, money grubbing scum had the audacity to seize someone else’s property. I hope B is for Build and everyone else she extorted, counter sues her until she and the co-conspirator attorneys she used in her scheme are left penniless.  That’s the only way these ambulance chasers and con artists are ever going to stop trying to rob good people. The courts were never meant to be a shield for those with means.
On this note, I am out going to build my Eleanor ...  ;)
Most of these cars are just fast backs want to be Shelby 's
There a lot of those people/companies out there, stay true, due your homework. Long live Carrol Shelby, a veteran and legend!
This is fantastic news. Justice is served. That (mother dog) of a women can take her Eleanor's and stick them where she sits. I have always loved the GT-500's and the GT-350's and they have Shelby written all over them. He built them and she modified his build and tried to call it her own. Rip off artist. Can't wait to you build your GT-500 Chris. Flaunt it all over the place with style. You deserve it brother. I wish you could get your original one back.
Denice Halicki destroyed a absolutely cherished childhood movie for me. The greed/pettiness and the fact they seized the build instead of using the series to increase the value of the Eleanor they destroyed it for me. I have wanted to build a Eleanor car since seeing the movie as a kid. But seeing how they operate as a business i in no way shape or form want to support them in any way. Or god forbid spend a bunch of money to build one and if i post on instagram get sued and have my car taken. I will never watch the movie again either because i don't want to help their stream numbers.
To bad with that ruling you can't recoup some of your money back. To bad there are money hungry hacks like this in the world. Love your channel and your builds.
So can you not get your "Eleanor" car back that they took?
Four films? I know about both versions of Gone in 60/Sixty Seconds, but what are the other two?
Wow! I didn't knew much about how deep do these guys go! What the actual cluster**** is this bs? I mean wasn't Shelby designing these parts before the movies came out? So in that sense wasn't Shelby in the right of suing these guys for using designs that looked alike instead of getting sued? They didn't do it because well it's a different design and after all it's good for marketing, was it their fault that they had good taste and came out with their designs before the movie launched? Freacking leeches!!!!
The ending portion of this video is plainly and simply an epic win. I could see the virtual flipping of the bird in the direction of one single person. Just awesome, and very well played. Good on you sir.
Be happy if the court had made it a retrospective judgement and all the people she had stole from like yourself turned her over in multiple court cases... or maybe you could start the ball rolling and get your mustang back? Just a thought
Love what you're doing as a tribute to Shelby , well played sir 👍👍
Amazing story and closes one door firmly shut while throwing a new one wide open - love it!
It's ridiculous, wasn't the og Eleanor a puke yellow '72 fastback??? Glad you're winning this, it was unsubstantiated and bs from the get go.
Fuck the Eleanor and their copyright owners!! Long Live the GT500!!! Can’t wait for this.
but, what happened to your car, the first one that wasn't even done, are you gonna get that back?
Wait I thought the Eleanor from the Nick Cage movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's car. I remember reading something about that but it was years ago.
$10,000? That’s it?!?! 🤦🏻‍♂️ you make that per video!
This video was an absolutely awesome explanation of the entire Eleanor scenario and I agree with everything Chris said his opinions were spot on and YES! Without a shadow of a doubt Carol Shelby is a great American Hero!! (the opposite party involved in this mess took our legal system and crapped all over it and, in my opinion is a NON-American vilian!
You should sue Halikki for reparations, and potentially see about getting your car back…
I can understand wanting to protect Intellectual Property and preventing others from profiting from the likeness of Eleanor. But going after private owners and after people who are building Mustangs that clearly are not Eleanor is just a moneygrab and a bad look.
well said
Next step, they will sue Ford to have build mustang model ? 🤣😂
Absolutely love you guys, been a fan through your successes and endeavors. Love the channel, love the builds, and will continue to support this Channel! Keep kicking ass!
4 movies? I thought there was only 2. The original Gone in 60 Seconds (1973 Mustang) and the Nicolas Cage remake (1967 GT500) What are the other 2?
Good for you BB
So what happened with the first build? Did you give it to them or do you still have it but can’t use it ?
HONESTLY the name Eleanor I've always said it's a GT500🤷🏾‍♂️ In the movie that's what it's always been a gt500 Eleanor is the namesake of how elusive it is to get away with stealing it. It's a character in a Edgar Allen Poe peom for God's sake!!! They ass need to be sued for that!!! But it all really comes down to them wanting money for something they didn't actually create! Because they stole the name from an iconic poem and the make and model of a car that's STILL an iconic statement from a great man who loved life and lived it to the fullest.
Build Team, man brother preach it! Give them dual flying birds an then spin Mr. Shelby design and make it bad a$$
its like a youtuber suing a game publisher because they have a custom character in game.
Bravo great video packed with great info 👏
She should try suing the millions of parents who've named their kids Eleanor. Would have the same result 🤣
Great video and information!!! Kick rocks Halicki!!!
Dude you just made me want to watch that. But I can't wait for more boat content
Glad you are going your own way on this. I'd love to see a 1969 dodge challenger body on a modern challenger chassis and engine.
wait there is 4 movies? gone in 60 seconds? 4 times? what?
Really hoping to hear about your compensation soon for the car and parts that were illegally confiscated from you and recouping your legal fees and then some for lost income on the builds videos etc 👀
If you look at this logically they do not have a leg to stand on.
"If you don't know me, I'm a douchebro who wears a baseball cap backwards." Out.
WHAT 4 MOVIES??????????????????????
Name it "Elli Noir" or "El Noir" just to say fuck you!
Will you be able to get the other project car back?
Awesome explanation!  Looking forward to the totally legit BifB Shelby.
Fuck building another Eleanor, get your damages Chris! This person caused you harm.
4 movies? What's the other 3? I only know of the Gone In 60 Seconds Eleanor. A little help here.
Truly hoping that the "eleanor" cars lose a shitload of value. People dumb enough to shill out for a license deserve as much. Halicki deserves even worse.
From this point on every single 67' fastback shall be known as Carol
Hell yeah, love it and can't WAIT to see this vibe together! Shelby is a hero and glad that's the route to take!!
And that is the best dis video of the century
I'm glad to hear the outcome brother 👍
Wait but you still didn’t say if your getting your old car back if the copy right is over then that should apply to you
I think you should do exactly what you are talking about and call it... mention it a "Eleanot"   man I hate that woman.  You have a great build going.  Can't wait to see it.
I would definitely hit hilacki with a slap suit and more to recover that car.
In the Ancient Hindu culture we call that "Karma" for a reason. Its exactly what happened to that greedy lady. Full circle.
yaaassss my favorite build is coming back kind of!!!!!!
AAAAAHHHHH! I'm screaming at your future build!  😆
👍
The accusatory party in your case knows nothing about cars and was married to HB Halicki for about 10 minutes before he died.  And the car in question wasn't even designed or built by him, and the Nick Cage movie bore little resemblance to that B-Movie from the 70s.
The legal system is for the rich and the lawyers.
Love it, I don't even want to say her name here but it's the greatest middle finger to her that you can possibly give! So glad that it's mostly the end of the shit for you regarding the court case and that nameless got what she deserves from the Shelby court case. I look forward to the Shelby tribute build!
2002 a couple months after Covid?
We still didn’t get an answer with where the original mustang build went, who has it? Can’t you get it back now they lost the case or at least now take that lady to court and get what you are owed for the car and legal fees she has cost you ?
I’ve been waiting on this.
Halicki estate are trash. They steal ideas from Shelby, then go after you for using a name! THAT'S FREE SPEECH.
Victory may come late, but it is just as sweet.  This elaborate biz has pissed me off since before your troubles, and then multiplied by 1000.  Glad you can now do what you want, and yeah, Shelby's cars look better anyway.  Rock on brother.
Fuck yes! Can't wait to see the new SHELBY build!
You should file a suit against them for a frivolous lawsuit. I’m not a lawyer, I’d just really like to see companies like Halicki’s get their just desserts.
Those are ugly anyways,leave them stock they look better not like a 16 year old high on dope slapping a weird body kit ruining the classic car is what these look like.  Furthermore,The REAL Eleanor is a 1973 Mustang Mach 1! Sure they used a 1971 with 1973 trim but nonetheless looks better than these weird Amazon bod kit Eleanors!
I think. You response should be B is for build Bit&@&&ch
Nothing but love
The court system isn’t broken, this is by design. It’s working exactly as intended. It’s not broken, it’s corrupted.
sounds like Denice is the real snake in all of this...
Imo Eleanor is the color scheme bc if you paint that car white with blue stripes I would call it a gt 350 or 500. And it was just a code name so any one listening on the radio wouldn’t be clued in. They also say 1967 gt 500. Not just Eleanor so I’m glad Carol and his group won the court case!
Yeah, a broken legal system and assholes. They “Eleanor”lawyers)deserve a bad reputation
i want to take the low road for  a sec, and voice that this lady is truly a POS.. I won't even mention her name because i hope that it never gets mentioned again. I truly hope history forgets "elenor" and her, altogether. She ruined the legacy. Nobody should build to those specs again. Her legal team is also regarded, evil, snd didn't deserve any of the money they won. All of them are narcissistic parasites. This is all just my opinion of course. ❤️
I'm wondering how money they've made off people by doing the same thing they did to you. Sounds like they poked the wrong bear, the bear was a bigger bear that fought back. Now they're probably kicking themselves for it because they lost a big part of they're gravy train. Also wonder if this will have any effect on their licensing side of business, now companies can just make the same looking car without having to deal with licensing
I believe in my opinion, that you nailed it - maybe! 😆
When you build this one please don't cut the 2019 frame in half. The 1967 fastback cut down the middle and stretched to fit would look so sick. just my two cents. Mr. nobody
get your car back, but I am no longer interested in seeing another 'Elanor' car.
FK Denice Halicki, Love the idea of body swapping a 67 on that 2019. Can't wait to see it happen.
Lol did anybody catch when he said back in 2002 around Covid 😂😂😂
I hate to be Mr Obvious, but this version of Eleanor was never Eleanor at all. We should all be arguing about is whether Eleanor is a 1971 or 1973 Mustang.
This isn't a SLAPP lawsuit. Slapp means strategic lawsuit against political participation. It's about silencing someone's political views.
Like the vid and think the whole body swap process is sad thing to do to an old car but at the same time also a great thing to make it have all today's comforts I guess I'm always torn on these things but I can see both sides. However Carroll Shelby wasn't a stranger to "Trying it on" either, especially in his later life from what I got from the media and heard. Something to do with a hundred Shelby 427 bodies suddenly being found???
Finally.
Best B is for Build episode ever.  I am so happy you guys won this and looking forward for a fantastic build.
Hell yes.... the greatest YouTube build is back but better than ever......
sue happy people can screw off.
I just cannot stop laughing at how they just thrashed the brand of Elenore so hard in these lawsuits,  a brand that targets car people as its only source of income, turning the name Elenore into a curse work in the mouths of all car people and a sworn enemy by being petty and seeking a quick buck,  they basically made the brand the sleezy used car salesmen of rights owners.  I think B is for build should sue the Elenore rights holder for the damages they caused to the Elenore brand, as it causes damages to all car culture.
Build whatever the fuck you want.  You need to counter sue for damages, Stress and whatnot.
Couldn’t you get the money for the build to replace the one now they technically stole?
I love how the Elenor guys got their bad attitude handed to them. Well done competent court!
So are you getting the mustang back to finish it in honor to shellby.
This is redemption, looking forward to this future build
Eleanor replicas as cars are now forever tainted by this and will never now be coverted by real enthusiasts imho.

For anyone who wants know what a "slap suit" is, check out Legal Eagle here on YouTube. 👌🏻
My hope is that Halicky gets flooded with a combination of legit and frivolous lawsuits, C&Ds, and claims for money to wipe her and her lawyers out.  I can understand if they have IP but it's been open for years how much they used used the legal system like gangsters.
I think you should build one anyway, swap the color of the paint on body and stripes and name it Ellen whore
Good for you. Screw those guys. Shelby was a genius and is a true American legend.
Man you should of did a documentary
I think you gave in too much anyways should have told him to kick rocks from the beginning
So Eleanor is just sideskirts on a mustang…..
Personally It hurts to look at elanor cars because they look so terrible
Intellectual Property is theft
I'm guessing that the rights that Hair Licky holds now are pretty much useless. Wonder how much she bought them for?
So I'm not a "car guy" at all .. I just love to see the build process and appreciate what you guys do but if you would have showed me a picture of those cars I would have said those are a Shelby Mustang. I'm super stoked you're gonna do this build again but I'm even more excited about how you're going to do it this time and pay respect to Mr. Shelby.
A widow claiming a car is a character.
Playback speed set to 0.5x 😅, glad to Shelby is getting the recognition and respect he is due!!
I still get fuming angry just thinking about the fact that these peeps think they can just confiscate random mustangs because they think they own the copyright to what.. any and all mustangs?
Here's an idea for shits and giggles, take a Camaro body (68/69 SS or 70/71 Z/28) and throw it on a modern Camaro Chassis.
The man who built and help in this project was none other than the greatest car builder of all time in chip Foose u know how many Eleanors he built for overhauling ect he has just much rights to the car as Shelby and that bitch does just my personal opinion
I love your channel man I hope the build goes smooth
It's funny that from it being one of the most beloved & iconic movie cars to being probably one of the most hated due to this topic~ I'd be fun to watch moving forward if any new Eleanor replicas are being built...  If I were in your place, I'd do a Shelby tribute as well... Good job Chris~!
what were the 4 movies? I thought there were only 2 (GI60sec and the remake)
I totally agree with the sentiment that the Eleanor character was ruined by its litigious creator.
Thank you for giving a voice to all of us Shelby GT500 lovers out there!
Crystal mineral deodorant is the best thing I have ever found..within the first week of use I wanted to be their spokesperson!!!!!
THIS IS AWESOME!
I don't care that it's a kit car with Ford sheet metal having an LS in that Mustang is a disgrace
Am I crazy or are there only 2 movies featuring Eleanor?
2002? 3:16
Good lad and good for you. Nothing like a nice dose of karma to say 'I told you so'. The way you handled this whole soap opera with professionalism and humility is a credit to you and your team. Now you can get shit done 👍
I hope you get your car back man!
So happy about this...  This will be the TRUE redemption build.  Well articulated video and I am so happy Shelby sued her.
Good vid bro i felt as hard as you tried to be intentional with your wording the epic glimpse of a well placed middle figure to those Eleanor people shined through.
Nice job detailing the differences. Halicki's actions really leave a bad taste with the Eleanor name now, still a nice design, but with you on rooting for the real Shelby design, the true legend.
All I can say is.... "This upcoming CAROL SHELBY tribute build is gonna be GAWD DAMN AWESOME!"
You can't own a car someone else created by putting a name on it. If this was the case then all bandit cars need to be collect and  destroyed
When you send "Carrol" to paint is can only be one of two colors schemes  White with Blue stripes or Black with Gold stripes.
I appreciate a well presented argument. This is a very fine example. Love your work mate, well done. 👍
Was about to subscribe, but then the scent commercial. Bye
Great video.. Nice work.. Carroll Shelby is amazing..
Get your car back!
Maybe LegalEagle could make it make a bit more sense? He's good at legal commentary
Time for B is for Beleanor!
Yep.. I don't ever want to look at an Eleanor again because of this. The family should be disgusted with themselves..
Awesome!
I hope there is a class action against whatshername for legal action based on lies. Eleanor, meet Karma.
Looking forward to it 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
When you showed the 2 pics I still only saw a gt500
Nicolas Cage is the only man who could tell me. “No Elenor”. it’s fking rubber & metal.  hey H company whatever they name is im building a Carbon Body Elenor in a 3rd world country - bite me!
Could you imagine if the company who owns the rights to General Lee went after all those builders? That car clearly stands out and was always a 69 dodge charger with 01, so its easy to see. I personally like doing body swaps since its an easy way to get modern options in an old style body, but it sucks thinking some crazy person could come after me if they really wanted to.
Isn't there only 2 movies? Both editions of Gone in 60 seconds?
*B is for Build* Bravo well done, thank-you sir for taking the time to bring us along on this crazy story. GOD Bless. (( PS, New Sub ))
Man I dreamed of a 67 Shelby since I was a kid. Its actually insane to claim a bumper and hood kits is a whole likeness. Honestly that car ruined the used Shelby market. I remember being at shows in the 90s. A guy was selling a 69 Gt500 for 20K...I hope he didn't sell that car until after the movie...I did love the Eleanor bodykit back then, but honestly it think there is opportunities to do cleaner more modern design now. I think the ultimate revenge would be to develop a modernized 67 body kit. Take away their market completely. The would lose popularity for a better, legal,  and quality kit. Love the new idea, build something better in honor of Shelby. I own a 67 fastback, but its to original to modify...I pray I ever get the 325k for a classic creation 67 Gt.500.
I still think you should go after them to get your car back and all your legal costs, teach them a lesson! Don't let them get away with being a bully!
What type of person you have to be to go hunt down a simple person that enjoys simple things of life like building and driving cars. What did they won from doing so? I swear...some people are getting off by being evil and stupid...
Is this like Harley Davidson suing bike builders for the sound of their engines?
AWESOME wording!!  Im happy for you
just get another mustang and finish what you started
So Halicki ripped off the original movie and Shelby and then used Lawfare to try to rip off anyone they can. Nice
I love your work man, I was following the Eleanor build and I thought it was bs from the start.. so excellent news, keep on the hard work!
It was always his car and now she can read that in paper
Bro I just heard that slap hit her face all the way  in Ohio
Conclusion: It is not the Batmobile. It is a Shelby GT500 with a paint job.
Before it looks like an eleanor, it looks like a GT500.
so  EMO        can't wait to see the new build
If a legal letter/contract/fine/whatever has typos in it, those typos make it void. Although they can retype it and send it again. Although in the interim you can get yourself ready or change what you are doing.
So not funny. 'Eleanor' wasn't even a Mustang in the first film draught!!!,
Should ahve called the first one Elanore.
The new thing I can say that was good from the Eleanor fiasco was it brought me to your channel. I had seen a tweet with a link to your video and I've been so happy to see all your crazy builds that you and your awesome team of peeps do.  Super excited for a Carol Shelby dedicated build!!!!
He needed a better lawyer instead of bowing down and losing his car. Especially if someone is coming at them with nonsense and stupidity.
This makes me so glad I named my dog Shelby 10 years ago instead of Eleanor 😅 my favourite movie car wasn't ruined because it's 99 percent a Shelby creation
Ah yes, covid 2002, the prequel ;)
Would love to see every build with a title like a Carol Shelby and NOT an Eleanor. Just to twist the knife every video
Carroll Shelby is and has been dead since like…..2012.   It’s Shelby American that sues that psychotic b*tch to release the rights to the gt500.
Maybe "Eleanor" are the friends we made along the way... idk
What are the other two movies that you are referring to? I know the original gone and the cage remake.
Well done. Thanks for posting and clarifying everything about the build. I will look forward to you building the new tribute care to Carroll Shelby.
Denise Halicki oughta hang out in a closed garage with Eleanor running. About to call my Lexus project car Eleanor just to see if she calls with a C&D so I can tell her to suck an exhaust pipe.
You are a legend I have a 1966 mustang coupe that I would like to make it more modern.
The fact that they sued you over this is just sad and pathetic
Bring on the Carroll Shelby tribute!
question is if you can get the original back and if not sue for damages as it might be scrapped by them.
Sounds like your about to build what would be my dream Mustang. Can't wait to see it happen.
Man, from the outside the legalsystem in your country looks mad FUBAR
called frivolous lawsuit..
I’d be talking to my lawyer about recovering fees and tacking on punitive damages. Don’t roll over so easy.
Ye man. Great news. I think We all support everything what is related to Shelby cars.
Once GOLD DIGGER ALWAYS GOLD DIGGER.  Karma is a b1tc4 and it will come back to hunt her.  Thanks for sharing.  Hope your builds make it in movies.
Sounds like a dope plan to me , shelby is awesome 👌
You have to name it Carroll cannot wait to see this build
I'm pissed that you guys never got to finish that Shelby.
Yo Chris you're wrong on the tail lights are out of a 1967 Thunderbird
Shame that Denise has basically ruined her late husband's legacy. Glad that the courts finally came to their senses and invalidated the copyright.
Carol Shelby, all the way bro, I always thought it was just a GT 500 they called Elenore for the movie. I didn't even know they changed anything, well for gone in 60 seconds anyway......
what happens if you name your child, eleanor
this is fascinating and finally some common sense from a court that reflects what anyone who has seen the films and knows about the mustang would conclude. Good luck with the 'proper' build!
I was totally into your build eagerly watching every episode. I was left baffled at what had happened. It changed the way I feel about those cars and anyone who owns one. You are absolutely correct in the fact they ruined the appeal and value of that car. I’m one of those people who never misses an opportunity to shit talk an Elenor on Social media. Those cars are lame as hell. Ford and Shelby should sue them for bring down the value of their vehicles. I certainly would never own one.
Happy to see the next build, like it 🙂
Good to hear not great but good. After your ordeal. I was expecting black trans am. Drivers to lose there cars for not being the Bandit! Yes I'm that old
🙌
Look forward to the new build.
I've watched a series about building the same car in Russia. The car is absolutly same as Eleanor(except they found out that Eleanor's body panels are assymetrical, and they fixed it in their car), but they just don't call it Eleanor. Ans that's it, no one can sue them(also because they are Russians) =)
Love it...I wouldn't want an Eleanor after this either.
Yes! I love it! Was real bummed when the first body swap mustang build was ended
B is for bloody legend
To me the car is shelby's.  The name Eleanor in the movie means unobtainium  you could maybe sell numbered body kit but not say the car is yours
Hate to say it but the elanor was one of 2 builds I actually followed. Other being m5 240z
Karma is a bitch halicki know this now😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
I might be mistaken,  but wasn't "Eleanor" designed by Chip Foose ? If so, it is his design and he is the only person to say anything about someone building a replica of the car !
Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!  Thank you explaining the differences between the two models in question and the likely starting point of one of them.  Great that you are supporting the true legend, just like you are forming into.  You deserve massive support and recognition.  Cannot wait to see what you produce.
4 movies??? Someone please explain.. I only know of 2
Hellz yeah, Great win! My take on what Randall Raines (Nicholas Cage) called an elenor, was a unicorn car that was hard to steal, an that there were ALWAYS problems with the theft of the car.
I wonder why even Ford wasn't involved. I mean it's their car design. Mustang is even a trademark of them. Geez
Hell yeah!
Hard to wrap my head around all this, i've never been a pu**y so i don't sue people. It's hard for me to understand how someone can claim to own the name Eleanor when it refers to a "Shelby" built a certain way based on a movie. It's still a Shelby, now it's just ugly, i don't get how someone can claim to own that. Don't take my personal opinion of Eleanor the wrong way, i just think stock Shelbys are better looking to my eyes, but it has nothing to do with the point. That's crazy man.
I went to get something from somewhere whilst the Native ad was playing, I have to say I like my products Vegan Free as well
I support the channel, and honestly I support the sponsor today… I use Native all the time, 10/10 product (might be on the pricey side, but it’s worth it)..   I highly recommend y’all try it out if you haven’t.. use the link and code ! 33% off is lowkey a steal..
I loved the Eleanor mustang in gone in 60 seconds. It's a shame Denice had to ruin its reputation. I agree with Chris why even build one of them anymore. I applaud you for the direction you have taken
OK bro you've got me questioning what the h*** because you said 4 movies have Eleanor I know the original yellow fastback Mustang mock one And then the Nick cage gone in 60 seconds but what the h*** are the other 2 movies
In the words of Dave Chappelle "Gotcha B****" 😂😂🤣
The whole issue is copy righting an actual car (Mustang Shelby) is ridculous.
Mr. Shelby is a true hero!
Great idea!
Around 2002 dang covid been around for decades and people still whining lol
No offence but it appears you can’t wear your underwear with out someone there wanting to sue as long as there are verified differences what the problem your build at the time was very inspiring carol Shelby design cars are world renowned and as far as I can see < Eleanor>was and is a Shelby concept car so how does someone hi Jack an ideal call it there’s the can sue  My opinion love your work look forward to your build  Thanks for the entertainment  Got to love you yanks 😂
cant they just return the other one or did they crush it already?
I was pissed off when I heard your project was being litigated because I was very much looking forward to seeing your version of the car. Carol Shelby was the designer of the base for the Halicki car and that's why it seemed odd that she could claim ownership of the vehicle as a movie character. I am glad you will be redoing the project and I am impressed with your attitude about the whole deal after being ripped off by an overzealous legal team.
PSA: All car guys should refer to "the car" from Gone In 60 Seconds as "Elenwhore". Bonus points if called buy the character's full name "Denice Elenwhore". Never forget the Elenwhore and her Elenwhore ways
That's so wrong I just subscribed to u so what does this say about other youtubers that build cars from Tokyo drift and other movies
I always just thought the Eleanor was A GT 500,  Never until I watched this video did I realize it was different at all,  That being said, I'm not a Mustang person, lol
Chris, I'm SO glad you have cleared the air on this.  Like MANY, I am thoroughly impressed with Shelby creations and intellectual property.  On the other hand, the "elanor" experience has SO cheapened the world of performance custom cars that it has horribly discouraged my life-long love of iconic cars like the GT500.  Your candor about this atrocious experience is helping heal the damage done by that disgusting band of greedy low-life thieves.
Cool
"Carroll Shelby and his team” who gon tell him👀
DAMN SON!!!!!!!!!
The first gone in 60 seconds car wasn't a mustang lol
Awesome stuff dude. And that's it. In with Shelby, out with Denice. Great middle finger story, video, and (next) Mustang build.
we’ll done dude just do it
My take is WTF. The original early 70s movie she may have some chance of copyright,,, except it was std Ford Mustang! So Ford own any copyright! The later movie with the name and basic plot I feel sure there would be some copyright.  For the car too the producers of  the modern version. Though it was simply a hotrodded fastback Mustang. GT500 or whatever would be Shelby.
Hell yeah!
It's amazing that the original creator of this mustang (Shelby) had to get permission to build a mustang. Pure greed
2002???? U mean 2020 😄
Glad your free to make it your way. You have good style.  I’d say that a Eleanor is a Shelby GT 500, but a Shelby GT500 is not Eleanor. Two different concepts entirely. Glad they figured it out!
Great Results....She has  Forever Tarnished the MOVIE 'S her Late  Husband  ..made.
Lol did anyone catch him saying it started in 2002
💜️💜️💜️
Proud of your decision!!!  Told my friend about all this and she wants to sue them for using her name!!!! After all, she had it long before they did! Hahaha.  Can't wait for the BBuild!
In 50 years, even in 100 years and beyond, people will speak of Carol Shelby and his creations. Ford should sue her because her behavior could have had a negative impact on mustang sales. Her and her movie car will be just a blip on the radar, Shelby is the whole dang radar! Great video!
Proud of you, really good choice for really good reasons.
I wish they give the car back so you can continue the build...that was just pure greed on their part. It has and always been a Shelby and they just took advantage
Great story Brother. You have done some off the wall builds and I'm looking forward to your next Mustang build.
Where’s the og one then?! I’d be getting that back
Man Karen Halicki went on a completely bonkers power trip. If I were Ford, I think I would sue her for damages.
based on this ruling however you should sue the shit out of halicki for not only the vehicle but you lost youtube revenue. because they took the vehicle under false pretenses
Sooo what's ford saying about all this mess?? 🤣🤣🤣
Soooo what's ford say about all this??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eleanor looks like if someone was building a mustang custom with the same design as Shelby was to make it mass production
If you are still able to, you should sue halicki for harassment and EMOTIONAL DAMAGE because of the suits especially regarding the 2007 mustang.    Sue her for all she is worth
I only know of two films, Gone in 60 sec (original) and 2000. What are the other two films?
First movie is the only one that’s watchable
I’m sure I’m one of your many viewers who was quite disappointed when that project had to be put off due to the lawsuit.  But I’m still here supporting the channel as always and hopefully what you had dream to build comes full circle again as always , ❤ your work Chris . 🎉
Chris, your GTR build not only got me started watching “Car Build” channels, but was basically what got me to make the move from cable tv to YouTube videos. So thanks and ahem… we’ll leave it at that. 😂
Salute hurt them with kindness sorry you had to even go through that all we want is to build our dream car can’t wait to for that build 😬
Im more of a Shelby fan now. Screw that B.
I am by far and away NOT a Mustang fan!  But Carol Shelby was an amazing builder, designer, drier, and business man. Can't wait to see you build another mustang with Shelby Designs.
🤠
Looking forward to this build. I was so pissed when they took the old build away. I was pretty sick about it.
Denise can suck it. Carroll Shelby was such a great man, and I believe he would stand behind you all the way. Chris, your channel rocks. I am so happy you finally get to speak your peace about this crock of poo poo. B Is for Build fans rejoice!!! By the way, your white SEMA Mustang creation is a thing of beauty and an inspiration!
Thank you, you're fucking awesome !!!
But do you get your car back and any retitution ???
b for build explained it all.. i love watching b for build , i have being watching this youtuber for the pass 5 years now and i enjoy it all...
FUCK YEAH!
Her husband would be turning in his grave if he could see her now with the way she's behaving, she got gave the rights to the movie by default when he died and what a mess she's made of them. I'm glad she lost in court. Would have loved it if Ford sent in their legal team and said well we own the copyright so your all arguing over something that's unobtainium.  On the other hand when another YouTuber built a Lycan hypersport replica from a F&F stunt shell that was supposed to be destroyed after it was used, Lycan themself's reached out to the guy and offered to help with the build, that my automotive friends is what happens when a company (or a person) isn't money hungry.   I never knew there was so many differences between the movie car and the classic recreation cars, the movie car is a beautiful shape but the CR cars are just done better, build it to CR spec 👌👌👌👌
It’s too bad, as a long time “Gone in sixty seconds” fan, this whole thing leaves a bad taste in most peoples mouths, it’s like a bunch of money grubbers trying to claw as much money as they can from her late husband’s creation. The car in the first movie is totally different..it’s the “real” Elenor, the whole thing is disappointing. The car in the second movie, is more of a Shelby than anything else..I’m glad this should finally be at rest, and people can move on and enjoy the cars.
mad respect on your decision on your next build and toughs on Shelby!
I hate Eleanor mustangs, I've always thought they were butt ugly.
Covid 2002 at 3min mark?
Good for you, I am glad that you are gonna keep going.  I have no doubt that it will look awesome.
Everyone "except" YOU should call the car Eleanor 2.0 just to piss her off! Great Job and great idea B is for Build ...I love it!
What are the 4 movies the Eleanor was in...?
Glad to finally hear the story but I couldn’t help but notice you were talking if Carroll Shelby was alive? He’s been deceased awhile
Shitty thing that happened, but great to see the excitement you have for finally finishing what you started (in a roundabout way)
Perfect call and response
Do you have legal grounds now that what they were doing has been deemed illegal to go after them to get your car or its equivalent value plus more for the harassment?
I worked for Shelby on the Series One car and met the man too. Nice guy...May God rest his soul...or he's duking  it out with Enso to see who's the best.
Fantastic!
Hey Chris. Just so you know, Carroll Shelby passed away back in 2012. That would make a tribute car in his name that much more badass however.
You left out a great Chili creator. 21:50
YAY !!! Can't wait for the EleaNOT serie!!!
i was waiting for you to say i got my car back XD
So basically F*CK Denise Halicki and Eleanor!!! I love it!!! Hate people or corporations that think they can over step.
Great news. Harley Davidson tried to trademark the sound of a v twin 😂
shes the widowed wife of the now deceased writer of the original movie story at that.
As soon as I heard Shelby won the case I thought of you Chris. Another build with the "right" parts will be awesome!! They really have hurt the Eleanor name but you can explained it.
clap clap clap Perfect ENDING AND PERFECT SOLUTION in the PERFECT DIRECTION
Ok now I'm pumped
Send them to god
Chris, do you man! You're awesome, and I hope your dream comes true for you because you deserve it. Keep being awesome
im sure someone has already said this but anyway...... my latin isnt brilliant but the basic translation is 'other among things'. so that doesnt sound like much but if you switch words around, it just means among[st] other things, or also included
Loved this video! You go Chris!! Can’t wait to see this build!! 🔥
All the Ford guys are yelling at the screen "Thunderbird taillights!" Hahaha
Chris I would sue there asses back
Yeah, I don't know if that lady knows it or not, but Eleanor is basically a four letter word now. Screw her, screw her cars, and screw anyone that spends a dollar that goes in her pocket.
I would cut the new 67 fastback in half and widen it this time
Ohh, I am looking forward to the revenge lawsuits against Denise... ;)
Bro @3:15 you said Covid started in 2002… 🤷🏻‍♂️
Hell yhea brother! Thanks for your update.
Get your car back fuck those assholes
Chris, I think some of this story starts in the '90s- Foose had built the car, the movie went bang, and Chip had entered a deal with Unique Motorcars, of Dallas, Texas- mostly a kit car builder to that time. That all got shut down, and in the aftermath Foose's lawyers (his wife, I suspect) tried to get the court to release the already built cars, got denied, with no public explanation. This lady has been pushing and shoving on this for a while- Good on Ya' for helping her get hers!    FR
Bravo great idea.
cant wait
Coconut vanilla is the jam, sea salt and cedar is light and nice but goes on like high grit sandpaper, the citrus herbal musk though is too strong, instant headache smelling that junk.
Can’t you now sue them back for your legal fees?
Hell yeah this is going to be epic...thank you.
Been looking forward to this!!! Finally
Video I’ve been waiting for for months 🤌🏽🔥🔥
Fun fact Honda also has a 1980s cr dirt bike known as the Elinor bike
Well if you are willing to be in a romantic relationship with your cousin it’s not that crazy to think you also own every mustang that resembles a Shelby.
So happy we get to hear the whole story. Glad you are getting some closure.
In my personal opinion their c*nts that is all .
Covid started 2002?
The side skirt was not on the 67 or 68 Shelby. It was used on the movie car to put side exhaust. Shelby was always a full rear exit exhaust.  I remember watching the original movie. One of the reasons why I have owned 5 Mustangs.
But what happened to the car they stole from you?
You are the man!!! Shelby would be proud. He wasn’t afraid to buck the system either.
Totally understand why you wouldn't want to build one. I was going to suggest you use some of the Tesla parts and make a. E-lanor. Can't wait for you to build what you're going to build.
Carol shelby - at least watch ford vs ferrari - that movie is so cool
Love your stance on this case. Screw that bitch. Much better to support a true legend like Carroll Shelby. Looking forward to see how your Mustang turns out. 👍👍
I’d build it just to piss her off lol
Thanks Chris...i listened to your every word...im not going to say anything about the Court Case... just to say i support you...Oscar....and the  BIFB team ....thats what matters to me...such a shame that the USA is so letigious.
What are the 4 movies? I only know of ‘gone in 60 seconds’
Bravo!!!!!
👌🏻
So after this are you now owed damages as you were wrongly accused and lost the car?
So whatever happened to the original Eleanor that you were building
I just want a '67 gt 500 fastback. My dream car. Never gonna happen though
Excellent synopsis of this long-standing nightmare that has now come to a righteous, fair and reasonable end.  Your excitement about having your original beliefs bona fide when building the 'Eleanor' Mustang is palpable but your tribute to Carroll Shelby was both emotional and heart-warming.  It's great to see 'David' finally kick 'Goliath's' butt.  Good luck on your future projects.
I would love to see a break down with a legal pro. Crossover with LegalEagle 😁
Amen!
go for it bro!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sky is the limit
she is a 'B for B**ch' and her team
I wish you'd sue for damages.
In other words… fuck dat shit.  It’s Carroll Shelby’s and we’re building him a race car
Remember following this, totally out of order. What about the actual car you were building on. Where is that now? Greedy bas'ards.
Way to stick it to the b!tcI-I!
If you decide to build the mustang; please build a better one with little changes to change the overall look.  F the "Eleanor " people !!!
They say, "The best revenge is success in your enemies eye's 💯 " I know you dealt with a lot but, man I know that karma they are getting is a great feeling to have. Can't wait to see the Shelby project brother.
Beautifully said, I'm sorry you had all that aggravation, I'd love to look at a case she won and compare the legal fees she claimed against the quality of their work, it seems like they got the cheapest lawyers who can't spell and can't fact check which would make this is "legal fee scam". I hope any cases she won are reversed but also hope they all get together and sue for inflating her legal fees.
Im here for the yacht content.
So glad to hear mrs H. Get her just deserts…..such a toxic person
that video must felt food putting out there
Brilliant!
Funny thing is Elanor was NEVER a specific mustang it was ALL gt350/500 mustangs in the movies. So fact a coyrt allowed these ppl to copyright this is insanity. The two movies old n remake make it OBVIOUS that grey super snake gt500 in new movie was just a random car. ANY of those cars are called "Eleanor " no matter their color
I know Eleanor was in gone in 60 seconds but what other three movies was it in ?
I can not say how happy this made me since i heard what happened to you all those years ago. I dont watch your channel but i just subscribed to watch this come back story. Do it for Shelby
So gald for you 👍🏻
Well, i guess that dropped the value way down.  Shelby FTW
Where’s the no win no fee lawyers prepared to back the counter?!
Preaching to the choir buddy! Shelby for president!
I love this so much!!!  Hey would y'all ever look at working with a Dodge Hellcat conversion, swap, restore, etc.? I'd love to see a Hellcat in your garage Chris. Much love. One of my all time favorite Youtube channels.
Glad Shelby fpught this cause that lady scammed so many ppl
The "Greedinor" shall not pass
Let’s not forget about Carroll Shelby Chili kit!
Due to this court judging that Eleanor is not a copyrightable character, I think you should sue back with a slap suit. Sue for damages (the money you lost from having to remove the videos and not finish the build) along with whatever this bullshit has cost you in legal fees!
Elenor mods is like chip foose design.
Mate, I’d still have you build me one if I could afford it ….. dream cars are dream cars despite legal bullshit….
great summation, enjoyed watching this and your video filled in a lot of gaps for me. Nice work as always
Wtf man, who do they think they are!
WELL DONE    enough said   p.s. start the build sooner rather than later, we can't wait.
So excited for this build! Do a burn out in front of her house when you are done!
What are the 4 films? Obviously, 2 are the gone in 60 seconds og and remake... But what are the other 2?
Karma really but then in the ass with this one.
All that bitch is after is Money, what a cow. Eleanor had nothing to do with her husband and his movie. What I don't get is how she can believe every mustang out there is her property.
This would make a great legaleagle collaboration...
So pleased for you. Go screw em
The fact that you don't seem to be suing Halicki for your legal fees and the loss you took on the original project is so god damn respectable. You're blessed to be in the financial position where you can just take the loss and start over in an even better fashion. Your fans will support you more for it. More people need to be able to move on instead of continuing to deal with the broken justice system in this country.
eleanor is garbage after this lost value in my heart
inter alia is a fancy way I mean legal way of saying "among other things".
I'd be so tempted to build a shitty one out of spite and plaster "Eleanor" all over it. Drive it around with a bat in the trunk and film people having a wack at it. 😄 But I love your direction just as much. Lol Taking the high road as usual.
Good luck to you man, I hope everything goes well for you moving forward. This story is quite compelling, seeing the lengths that people with a severe lack of understanding of somebody else's life and work will go to just to make a fast buck. It's a shame that you had to go through this but at least the one's in the wrong have at last been stopped. I've not seen you before now, but you have earned my sub.
Where is Ford? Surely Ford should have the last word as they designed and created the Mustang platform. Ultimately they are all Fords.
Even in the Cage movie they call it a Shelby GT500, Eleanor is just code they use over the radio for that particular car, best someone copyrights the rest of the cars on that list, did she copyright unicorn too 🤣 there's been a few built in the UK if she tried that shit over here she'd of got the middle finger
And that's why copyright trolls are so insidious : they go after ppl because most ppl can't afford to spend thousands defending themselves even if they are right.
YES YES #shelby4thewin elenor you suck chris you must finish the "shelby" build
Well Chris, that was lengthy but worth watching.
You honestly think your sema 22 mustang looked better than Elenor? Lol you high
All the languages in the world and you decided to speak with the truth
Good for you bro!
I love the out come. I mean honestly who deserves to be remembered? I pick Shelby, I'm sorry to have even learned that women's name. but it'll be forgotten soon enough.
We need additional commentary from @LegalEagle
You absolutely spoke perfectly in this video and the direction you are going with your projects. Good for you to stick it to that pathetic excuse of a human being. “MuH eLaNoR hurrrr durrr durrr”
Amen !!!
Inter alia means amongst other things. Kind of like including but not limited to.
A similar situation would be if the creators of Bullitt called copyright on anyone with a green Mustang. I never understood exactly what they were calling copyright on besides the name. If I nicknamed my Saturn "Eleanor" and posted videos about it, would I get a cease and desist? Just a dumb situation. Bureaucratic Felchers.
I need to go back and watch some of the other videos. Bit confused, people build movie replica cars all the time.
Love it! So much better doing your build this way. Good for you, man!
What happened to the seized one? Was it destroyed? Do you plan to counter sue for expenses, loss of revenue and theft?
I'm still gonna. Or at least I would, just to be a rebel, but alas I am too lazy.
I was wondering when you were going to make this video! We were all so pissed when you got screwed on that car, that was such a crock of sh!t! So glad you're going to make another car, can't wait to see it!!
3:13 that's when I was born😂😂😂 Guys he means 2022😂😂😂
Hopefully they paid you for the car they stole from you and smashed after all of this.
Great plan, can't wait to see it
The only mistake you ever made dude was thinking that your work in any way damaged their business. Halicki and her team of rats entire "business" was built on exploiting something none of them ever played a part in the creation of. She truly is a bottom feeder and the fact that she was able to do what she did years is testament to the joke the US legal represents.
Elanor was originally just a Ford mustang. Let me guess you fell in love with a Nicholas cage movie and you like the new elanor so much you decided to copy them?   So car enthusiasts really are the furthest thing from original, who would have known. No wonder why my landlord in Texas called his office the stables. Had a Shelby hood with all the workers signature..and he had a dozen or more mustang cars. Of course in Texas, you tell a city slicker your office name is the stables, I'ma be looking for horses not cars. Some people value cars way too much
It's dumb that it was a character in the first place like it's a fing car. Love the vids 😀
That’s dope bro. You’re a real one for turning it around and do a tribute to carol Shelby
I think you should call your next build the "Hellinor" just to stamp all the misery (cough HELL) you went through for this build. Love your work and has inspired me to find a rust bucket and give it a go (I have 0 ... ZERO mechanical experience with cars). Thanks again. Cheers
Given that that build is your content.  And not completing it affects your ability to develop new builds. It's them that owe you money.
Fuck yes! You naiiiiiiled it
Time to get your car back and sue them for all you can get
Heck yeah man!
So happy to see it coming to a positive end and looking forward to see it done. Congrats mate
I'd rather have or build a classic GT500 any day over the Eleanor car. It's nice but it has a stink on it that you cannot wipe off.
And there's this, the Nick Cage Gone in 60  "The E1ean0r in this movie was a gorgeous 1967 Ford Shelby Mustang GT 500 fastback and the hero cars came built by hot-rod legend Chip Foose with Steven Stanford" Case MFKN Closed
21:21 PREACH!!! "Carol Shelby is a goddamn American hero" - this should be on a t-shirt
Awesome I back you 100%. F**k Denise and Eleanor. She can have it!
Hoping to see a class action law suit against Halicki, in my opinion they stole a bunch of cars. Would be nice to see Ford get involved and with this and say hey you're causing harm to the mustang brand with this and it ends now.
I LOVE THIS!!!!
This is a very important video. Thank you so much for taking the time to make it. P.S. Much love to your lawyer. Go figure there's a good one out there lol
I thought it was just one movie
Hand it off to Halicki to ruin a brand/icon because of her greed and spitefulness. Now when everyone hears the name "Eleanor", it's going to attribute to all the negative BS that surrounded it. Frankly, the car itself doesn't deserve it.
It would be nice if the whole community did focus more on other designs and let the Eleanor design fade away. There are so many other great parts for mustangs.

Looking forward to seeing Your car to tribute Carol Shelby
AMEN!
Two thoughts: - My wife and I were talking about your car and what happened just a few nights ago while watching a F&F movie.  I'm so glad this nightmare is behind you and that you can now tell your story and build what you want.     - Also, Classic Recreations makes amazing stuff and I love what they do.  Classic Mustang looks with modern guts.  I'll likely never be able to afford one, but I'm sure happy for those who are able to buy them and help keep the business going.
Hell yeah man!!! HUUGGEEE FU to the Eleanor people. Personally, and I bet everyone in here feels the same, I never want anything to do with, or be in support of, anything related to an Eleanor branded mustang. I wish them nothing but failure and misery in their business. People who operate like that are scum.
We have to remember #JesusChrist. Pray daily because the time is short..and many horrific things will start happening in this world soon. We gotta be ready for the changes from the world. There's no salvation without asking for forgiveness of sins daily. #JesusChrist
Looking forward to the build.  This was a great video.  Shelby is my hero as well.  This sort of greedy legal BS is a waste of time and money.  Good for you on picking the higher ground and doing a Shelby build.
Very well said
Lmfao! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you go Chris screw eleanor I'm glad you are done with that and going to build a tribute to Shelby Mustangs because Carol Shelby is a true American hero in every way imaginable especially in the automotive world, Shelby Mustangs are frig'in awsome!!
Real respect.  You sir and the b is for build team are the main character
someone should make an eleanor camaro
God DAMN AMERICAN HERO!
What 4 movies???
Im not so secretly going to call your new one the Gt 500 fe. For eff Eleanor Lol
👍👍👍👍👍✨
One thing I really liked about the previous build was the headlights. I believe they were for a Harley, but they looked great in the mustang
Oh this is the best F you i ever seen! Proud of you! Can’t wait to see this build.
I’d love to see more lawsuits and see Halicki have to spend the rest of her life settling court cases and wasting money. In the end leaving her with very little money and completely disgraced. All of her nonsense makes the movie with Nicolas Cage almost unwatchable anymore. Even when I do watch it I always rant to anyone who hasn’t heard it what a completely garbage human she is.
Stated perfectly Shelbys a legend screw them can't wait to see the build
Ford Motor Company has entered the chat
Bout time you did something cool 😜  Fuck Eleanor. Gone in 10K 👎🏻
I love the ending to this vid. cant wait.
Yeap!! If you gonna make it for shellby I say blue with white strips. That's how I view shellby cars.
I hope you file a lawsuit against them now that you can use the Shelby lawsuit as an example. At least to get back damages, and also your car
Well said Chris, Carroll Shelby is a absolute legend amongst our car enthusiast community and his GT500’s simply stunning. Like you say Eleanor is just a modified GT500 which isn’t what the plaintiff was accusing you of copying. It’s unfortunate but like you say you have moved on.
My childhood is a mix of emotions... General Lee was ruined over a flag being "interpreted" by certain non-car people.  Now Eleanor is ruined by the very people that "marketed" it.  I would say created... but as you pointed out, there wasn't much modification going on, it's mainly just a name attached to a Shelby car.  I kinda wish the Roosevelt family would sue them for using the name Eleanor. It makes about as much sense.  I'm looking forward to the new build.  Hopefully the good from the publicity online outweighs the stress and money lost on all this.
Alot of people also like to state the exhaust coming out of the side skirts is a big elen feature.
women☕
Awesome video
Systems are not broken, simply are just adjusted for their own benefits!
If I had a billion dollars..I would not buy an ELINOR...I would definitely buy a ford Daytona.not many people have 1..most have a shelby cobra...but I do drive a mustang and good for the shelby company for taking down that chick.
Get trolled dennis
Get trolled dennis
I hate cars
Denise may have been a vindictive bitch, but I actually pity her. After losing her husband, she felt like she did the right thing by protecting what her husband created. Somehow, it turned into greed and she lost her way.
23 minutes of non-car building and I was captivated by every minute. Good stuff!
This is probably one of the best car community videos I have ever watched. We support you dude. Amazing explanations and such clarity and conviction. Honoring Shelby is the way to go. You have a great plan and I wish you all the fun and enjoyment of proceeding with his project without the legal hassles you have experienced before, and rightly so. Rock on man!
Sue them dude these tyrants need to learn.
So if the courts found that the Eleanor team was wrong, what’s stopping you from getting your car back?
🔥 🔥 🔥
Good Luck Chris and team! I love the idea of supporting Shelby and not the movie. Get it done!
I've been waiting to hear your reply to this lawsuit.  Love the Shelby build idea too, f Eleanor!
Did you get the car back  heliki stole from you?
I find it hilarious that Halicki’s over reach has bit her in @$$ and will probably no longer prophet off the Eleanor name. 😂
I met shelby once when i was 18, at a resturant afterba car show, he came to me and complimented my on my mostly original 64&1/2 mustang
I am so glad you get to do your build... I'm so stoked for you :)
My dream car Shilby 2016 version...  i don’t need new version
Its because when hb died, she didnt get shit but the rights to the elinore name.. his kids got everything..
Sooo where’s the old car?
in my own opinion the only thing that makes people thing the classic recreations car look like eleanor is the fact that it’s gray.
LETS GOOOO📈
So ,if i understand right, they took illegal your car after the win of carol Shelby?
I must say, sound's like Carroll's been feeling strongly from the grave for over a decade now ;)
*IT'S SHAMEFUL THEY ATTEMPTED TO RUIN YOU. MOST WOULD'VE ROLLED OVER. **#GREATWORK*
You're guess at inter alia left me choking man, don't do me like that!
Damn now I wanna watch the movies again but I don’t wanna support that team
B is for BUILD. S is for SHELBY.  But  BS is for Eleanor 😉
Love it Shelby  100% or no pony
The big problem is that the first Eleanor looked nothing like the Nick Cage Eleanor. But against Shelby, if I bought an orange 70 charger, and dropped the General’s decals on it, I’d have the General Lee. Probably best to steer clear of the Nick Cage Eleanor 😂. Make it red and white when you build it
Build a modern Shelby Daytona Coupe?
I enjoyed the build and was looking forward to the end product, its just sad that you were targeted because you had a pretty popular platform and following on youtube. they could have look the other way but they chose to target you and use you as an example and exert some power.
Give them hell man.
You should sue them back and just pour as much money as it takes , just for vengeance sake!
Everyone tell that lady to SUCK A DICK!
It is kinda funny in a way, that chick is killing the fan base, by trying to sue everyone who tries to build a GT500E, or restore any GT500. I think that the real reason you won't build an Eleanor, is the bad taste in your mouth, and I bet that you probably don't even like the Eleanor movie prop nearly as much as you used to.
In the movie it is specifically referred on the list as a Shellby GT500 and it's given the code name of Elenore like all the other cars get a code name of sorts when they are talking on the radios.
What about a 69 Camaro body on the newer style Camaro chassis? I think that would be nice too.
Love the thought process for tribute to Shelby cars
Well said dude
I wish I could see her face while she watched this, getting more and more angry
hellllll yeah, I hope you start it soon so looking forward to it
RIP, everything regarding Eleanor is hitting rock bottom.
I came to this channel from Donut Media when they talked about this very case. I wouldn't have watched B is for build otherwise. So, in a sense, it was good for me, because it brought me to you. :D
That Kent can go and fork her hat! Greedy people, trying to screw over someone having a go!
Love how youre thinking about it, i would think the same. Shelby even in Sweden is a big name in the community
My all-time favourite Shelby car has to be the Cobra 427.  What Carroll Shelby did to the AC Ace design, shaping it from a small roadster into an absolute beast of a car was absolute genius and completely destroyed the competition from other manufacturers. Keep doing what you're doing, support Shelby and forget about the previous shitshow, leave the past behind and focus on the future.👽
I’ve always loved the Eleanor movie car, however, after hearing about all these lawsuits, and especially after what they did to you, and others, who built cars that may have somewhat looked like Eleanor, it has really left a bad taste in my mouth. I would much rather have a Shelby GT500 instead.
Last part for shelby is just goated and I totally agree👊
Hell yes!!! And Mr. Shelby suffered through his heart conditions and has given so much to kids! Helping improve the lives of so many children suffering from diseases.  Carroll Shelby Foundation.  From engine swaps to heart swaps, he and his teams are top tier! ❤️
Anyone that watched the movies would know the names were just "code names" to keep the cops from figuring out so they could do the heist and Eleanor was a name given to his mythical beast that always fought with him because FORD... Quoted "a unicorn" because "something always goes wrong". So do they own the rights to all unicorns too? clearly over reaching, I would of just changed the name and kept going because it was something different already. I understand not fighting because of medical bs, wouldn't know how to respond. Come back strong and stand behind your work 🤘Shelby started with kit cars and you already have a line with ford
"2002 once covid hit" lol ik it feels like forever but it was only 3 years ago hahahhahha
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 me quito el sombrero ante usted caballero.
Carol Shelby is the personification of legacy. Im a kiwi and I see him as one of the most American people in existence. Kudos for essentially dedicating the build to him. Chur.
better have a digital dash from the new gt500
Are you going to try and get back your old car? I mean at least for the parts and a middle finger. For me it's ridiculous that in a land of free and high value for private property someone can take someone's else property because it's similar to a character in a movie.
Denise can copyright my nuts.
Amazing, completely agree and so excited for the new build.
Ironically Denise Halicki hurt the Name and Likeness of the Eleanor brand. These builds are actually free marketing for people to rent/buy these movies.
Beautiful! Thx 4 all that legal commentary :) By proxy, congrats. Halicky is a wuss :| Long live Shelby GTs :D
Dude do it! Call it the Carrol can wait !
It's about damn time this shit gets fixed .  They should have never went after you in the first place bro
@2:06 You've got a Teams meeting waiting for you 😂😂
Now I want a mangled 67 in gray primer with black Rust-Oleum stripes. Bolt some ABS JC Whitney-grade garbage on it and call it LN Noir... Or maybe Hell Nor. Park that sucker under her nose.
The guys who took Your previous fastback should return it or You should get compensated. It is not normal that it was done this way. It is good that the court has clarified the matter.
Great outcome. Surely you have to name the build “The Carroll Mustang”.
Thank you for clarifying the situation for us all, and am sorry to hear you had to go through such shit storm. No one should be pulled though that especially since you wanted to make the situation right from the outset. Stand with you Shelby deserves the limelight, not Halicki, Shelby is the name behind these great looking cars and the Shelby brand. I stand with you in the fact that you should build a Shelby tribute car, that other car 'name' needs to be put to rest forever.
That's how you do it Chris
denice halick and associates are pretty shit ppl, glad to see they lost.
When greed goes to far. So glad what happened to them happened. You got the last laugh!!! Can't wait for future builds!
I enjoyed absolutely everything about this video. Especially the fact that you’re pointing out that Denise is busy demolishing the Eleanor name/car, coz it’s exactly what she’s doing. I also like the fact that you’re planning on building a 67 to honour Shelby himself. ❤
Nailed it!
Don’t forget Shelby did all that with a bad heart too!! Congrats Chris!! ABG
Thanks for sharing your perspective.  I respect your positivity and professionalism while explaining everything. The whole legal battle against you was ridiculous.  Excited to see this new mustang body swap  get going. Cheers 😎
You mess with the snake you gonna get bit 🐍
i love it, what a great idea !!! cant wait for the build.
pretty smart Chris, well done
Like Ford getting upset at Koenigsegg for having a Ford motor in their 1st generation cars ( having a heavily modified version of a Ford motor) and saying they build kit cars instead of all original. It's just silly.
Shiiiiiit.. didn't see that coming 😂 Me, as a fan, was completely shocked and sad about how that build ended. But now I'm looking forward to another clean, great build. Good luck, guys. I'm so proud of you.   A fan from Kuwait 🇰🇼
😎👍✌
FINALLY I’ve been waiting to hear that for so long wish I had the amenities to build or well body swap a car like that been looking forward to this for it seems like forever words can NOT express how excited I am for that build!!!!
Sooooooooo..... what happened to the car they took? Was it scrapped or something?
This is why you are 1 of my favorite YouTubers too watch. You make cool shit n have crazy ideas n to top it off I can see you laughing so hard on the inside about this law suite situation. Love ya work man 👍🏾
Ridiculous how Eleanor can win when the "unique character" is a generic looking grey shelby mustang Imagine if fast and the furious start to sue whoever that have a black charger
Sorry, I don’t take seriously a grown man wearing a backwards baseball cap. Time to be an adult, not a slobby 14 yr old.
4 movies?
Hell yeah that's what I'm talking about..
one of the nicest and gentlest middle fingers I've seen
I guess nobody knew F@rds income is 50% lawyers, go ahead miss a payment.
Can't wait for the build.
Love it !!!!!! MAKE ANOTHER ONE!
someone still kicking has GOT TO KNOW one of the nicknames Carol gave to one of his cars .... call it that..
👍
Dude, do it!. She's just entitled and trying to stick her finger in everyone else's pie. Keep doing what makes you great. Her fee fee's are just sore because she can't do a better job than you and Shelby.
Re release your Eleanor videos, I loved that build. Get your car back and if they will not give it back report it stolen. You guys are so talented.
There's always been way around that and still be able to call it Eleanor the 1974 gone in 60 seconds used a 1971 mustang sport roof
Hell yeah bro! Love this news. My heart broke when that build ended. Like I couldn’t wait each week to see the newest video and for you to say you had to stop. Well at least we have closure. Keep at it guys you’re great.
Build an elanor and give it to whistlin diesel 😂😂 he’lol but into action how you feel about the Eleanor cars😂
Plus, another amazing thing he did was starting the Carroll Shelby automotive program at northeast Texas community College to help others get in to the car community and do what he was so passionate about.
…And all your fans will be watching and waiting with excitement for the Shelby tribute car!
When are you going to finish the boat?  I know your busy but that is a beautiful ship. It really needs to be back on the water. It's February 1st. A few days of work and you can do the 2023 4th fireworks on the water. Besides the fact that I want to see the results. My boat needs a new power plant and I'd rather go gas than the deisel that's in it. Thanks for the hard work. I'm always a fan
You are correct, the courts in this country suck. Doesn’t matter if your innocent or not, it’s how much money you can throw at it.
Fuck yeah! Shelby all the way! Those greedy bastards (I don’t have to say who) went after the entire CAR COMMUNITY and got smoked in court. Look forward to the Shelby build!
Halicki is a major Karen.
Would be great if Shelby America would reach out to help you with your build just to make the win sting that much more.  Congrats Chris.  🎉
This was the most satisfying videos I've seen about injustice for a very long time. And, yeah. Shelby deserves more tribute builds than anything having to do with that franchise. I have to ask. Am I the only one who just found out there were 4 videos based on the GI60S world? I only knew about the original, the remake, and one sequel (that I was afraid to watch).
What happened to the original car
Got me so upset from what they did that I'd watch all your ads to support your channel lol
Nice one. Thanks for doing the explanation. You should build a custom Mustang FE (Fuck Elanor)
I Agree with what you said
Great explanation!  I cannot wait to see this new project!
wish i could hit the likes more....   ella who???  always been Shelby   thank you for digging in!
Build the car in honor of Carroll but call it the hellickme
Where is chip foose in all this?? One of the designers of the nick cage Elenore??
They ruined Eleanors reputation… Shelby is the king.
Wasn't Eleanor the code name used for the Mustang, how do you copy right a code name???
I'm not a major mustang fan, but the Shelby's oooh wow..., Just like the white one y'all built freaking awesome! There is/was locally guy who has a simi replica of that car but he calls it Ronaelle.. said it was a in your face too the lawsuit gonna on ...I figure it must have been do to the Shelby case idk.. of course his was black with silver stripes...
This video was good for my soul
She’s wrong!!Of course,Eleanor was the name of a modified gt500? In the 2000 movie,the car was named after a another car that was called Eleanor! It’s a name,not an exact car. It’s like copyrighting Sally.I don’t know how that case held water for as long as it did..crazy.
A hundred percent correct it's a Shelby. The side skirts on the Eleanor car are about the best part of it being Eleanor the hoods ugly the side scoop should be Shelby to really look right. The front air dam and stuff is kind of ugly it was just a good color being gunmetal gray I think that color had a lot to do with its popularity. That car wouldn't look as good in black or red.
Great idea! Build a bad ass Shelby!
The car had the look before they made it popular with their movie other people designed its look and it was based on parts manly from Shelby.
They used a laptop 💻💻💻💻 IT.... Call non-ethical behavior.
I don't even know what the original Eleanor looked like tbh, until this video....
Well said!!
You guys Totally got molested dude. They totally deprived you of your property and any money that you could have made so like if you get it back and you get millions and millions of views on finishing the build at means that they potentially deprive you not only of your personal property which should be illegal. I don't know it just seems like that's how it should work they think that they were damaged you didn't really do any damage to them however once they take your property away they damn is you and then years down the road you find out in court but what they did was illegal basically your lawsuit for all of your losses and time and enjoyment you could have had the car or money that you could have made on it I think they should be liable.
Can we all agree to let the el- name die?  Start calling all references a shelby gt500. lets cripple the old brand, and help original brand get its lime light back.
Damn you could be a real dick. And I love it LOL
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Thankyou for that solid update, and 100% agree with your call ! No thankyou Eleanor, yes gt500 ! I wonder if Shelby would reach out to you after this vid 🤔
I'm so happy that Shelby was able to take these scumbags on and win! And that you could tell some of your story. I'm sure there this still more you can't talk about. I can't wait to watch the new mustang build series; after you finish the boat of course. 😅
I just hope that Btch lost a lot of money
Sue her for loss of revenue, cost of car, legal fees.  Please, for everybody she fd over.
I would be so immature and rude about this haha
Wow my view of the Eleanor just went down 10 points (out of 10 total) you would think it would be an honor for people to want to build a car that you made famous. She just shot herself in the foot. She was only looking for money and it makes me feel pitty for her. If she needed the money that bad maybe she needed to go make a “go fund me” TikTok like any other girl who needs money would do.
Subscribed.
Lady singlehandedly just killed the entire franchise and the branding of Eleanor.  Resell value has dropped like a rock and interest in creating the vehicle is now a thing of the past.
Well done! You are in fact DA MAN! 😂
Wait so can you legally get your car back now if you wanted?
Do it!!!!! I need a not a Elenor shirt !!!!
Was bro was.
Absolutely
Shelby also funded his son in laws idea of creating a restaurant themed around his favorite food. As we all know, Carol Shelby had his own chili brand and sponsored a major chili cook off each year.   That restaurant is named “Chilis”…
Suck it Halicki!
Been waiting to hear you address this topic since the judgement came down. Great to hear your perspective. I’m really looking forward to seeing the next build!
Awsome just saying
When money is the most important thing to someone, they aren't going to care about what else you say or offer.
God i love this channel!
B is for that B*tch
You mentioned four movies? What are they? I tried to google it and was striking out. May have been user error. Thanks in advance!
I don't know how you haven't sent her and her fake ass lawyers a bag of flaming poo every day since they took your car like that.  That kind of scum copyright troll deserves nothing more than eternal torment.  You should call it Eleanor just to rub their face in it now, or at least get Rich to do it for you, he pisses everyone off anyways.
Absolutely well done. I love all the parts of this video!
Man I wish you the best of luck I was so excited when you announced that build then to have it snatched away by some idiot because they thought they were right is just a shame but I digress keep on going man this is one of my favorite channels on YouTube
i love how for the last 2 years every time i saw a "you can win this Eleanor" add i would comment "i would rather be stabbed to death with a spoon than own an Eleanor"
Woohoo! Can’t wait! You are also a hero like Shelby!
I am praying for the update that you counter Sue them. SCUM
Okay I have an idea you can't use the car's name from the movie. How about building it would that style of body only Make it go solid black with a number 5 back glass whatever's legal for side windows with a 460 big block cammed with a five-speed manual transmission with black interior build it show me an email or posted in your page I might be interested in buying it. 😜😜😜 Or a triton  V10 THAT WOULD BE SWEET
They took possession of your old build right? Does this mean you'll get it back.. eventually?
Nice homage to CS, well done !
Chris, glad you got to have your FU moment regarding the BS lawsuit.   That being said,  it is without question that Carroll Shelby is a legend, he was also every bit as litigious as Helicki is.  I raced vintage Shelbys for many years and had many interactions with him before his passing.  In his later years he was very well known for suing many, many people,  even including the national club dedicated to his cars.  To this day  I have a bumpersticker on my tool box that was common in this timeframe with Shelby owners that said "Honk if you are being sued by Carroll".  Many of us that are dedicated to the Shelby cars, especially the vintage ones paid homage to the history, loved the cars, paid tribute to the legend, but held our noses and tongues regarding the character of the man.  I don't say all of this to temper your enthusiasm for the car or the desire to build one, just to let you know that the man, Shelby, was the same type of person as the one that sued you.  I laughed while watching your video because in my perception, two parties of similar tendencies decided to duke it out.  If you are curious if what I say is true, just google Carroll Shelby lawsuits and enjoy the ride. Despite all of the above diatribe, love the channel and your journey from the beginning of learning how to work on cars.  I will be watching whatever your various projects, even if it is a Shelby "not an Eleanor" tribute.
Great news, but what happened to your original build?  Can you go back to work on it?
Inter Alia ; adverb among other things. "the study includes, inter alia, computers, aircraft, and pharmaceuticals"  I was curious..
i cant fuckinggg waiiiittt for thiissss!!!!!!
Drinking game, take a shot everytime he says "my opinion"
LOVE IT!
Did it feel good saying Eleanor so many times in this vid without the concern of legal action?...I bet it did.
I'm glad the court ruled against the lizard people. This corporate greed and power has got to end.   That's a bad a looking '67. Widest Mustang I've ever seen.   And yes Carroll Shelby was the man. To me his greatest acomplishments were becoming the first American car manufacturer to win at Lemans in 1964 with the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe(1st in GT Sports Cars +2.0L, 4th overall)and the First American car manufacturer to win an FIA sanctioned international championship when Shelby American won the 1965 World Sportscar Championship with the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe.
Can't wait to see it.
There now is a need for a "Super Like "button on YouTube. B is for President !
Someone should buy a Eleanor car and trash it sounds like a good job for whistle and diesel YouTube channel and Noone should ever want to buy one of there cars again..
fck yeah 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Absolutely... go fuck the "Eleanor " team .. I love that youre goingnro do another build and I love that this court case has happened. I love how you explained the only commonality is .. well mustang ..and Eleanor.  Chip has hated this b.s from day one and their idea that they own his vision . Remember he took Steve Stanfords ideas and tweaked them a bit .. so I reality .. Eleanor is 100 percent chips .. no one else's.. hes the one who created it .
SNL should be sued by every politician ever based on what you explained 🤷‍♂️
Who cares, the mid engine is way better than that POS.
What a beautifully articulated middle finger to D.H.
2002???
2002, a couple months after covid hit. 🤣
I didn't know there were 4 movies. I knew of the original with the mach 1 and the nic cage one but the other 2 no idea.
🫡
Hell yeah!!!
Yup, agreed. Its better to pay homage to Carol Shelby's work than a wheedling turd. I dig your style.
Carol Shelby was an OG!
Build your own, call it your own
Hope Halicki gets sued for these frivolous lawsuits. This is ridiculous
The best part is at the end of the day their actions against you cost them and benefited you. Great video, great summary, great context.
Did he say 2002? @3:14
b a s e d
Hell yeaaaaah!!!!🎉
I have nothing for you but a slow clap and a big nod. Please build more amazing cars...
Awesome man! Go for it. 😄
Good on ya! I appreciate your explainer, and your choice. Shelby is the man! Excited to see the unique creation you build!
HEELLL YEAAAAAAA
Yep, Mr. Shelby was a great man and a visionary when it came to muscle cars. I used to buy his chill. It was quite good. You can still get it at the grocery stores.
Mate, I'd be going after the Halicki's.  At least for damages for the undue stress caused by an un-lawful suit.  Maybe the out of court settlement would be getting the original car back.
Bullshit
Imagine going after Shelby for infringing upon an IP right that was based upon a Shelby platform to begin with. The entire thing is asinine, and extremely hypocritical.  Its sorta like if someone were to build a restaurant on top of a McDonald's, sharing the same red and yellow theme, and then suing McDonald's for IP rights. It simply does not work that way.  Anyhow, I'm super stoked to see that the B Is For Build team is (mostly) in the clear now, and that y'all are back at it again.
Fkn imposters
would be so sick if Shelby starts to sponsor your next build. Shelby X B is for build mustang
You obviously have way more info on this than me. However, I believe at the time they copyrighted the "Character" muscle car (intentional vagueness), it was to gain royalties from companies that made toy models like Revell. It was attempt to get as many royalties in areas that were being lost to other companies, brands, and franchises. Eventually those extra charges are what caused a lot of model building companies to die out. Entertainment movies are expensive and royalties from sales in every genre possible from a Happy Meal to a sticker set of magnets is how they recoup their losses and make profits. It sounds like their is one hell of a strong legal group that is trying to do that, but may have over reached. Sorry for your troubles.
I pay for no ads. What’s that? A sponsor? You mean an ad. And for that reason. I’m out. Peace.
Chris, so glad you made this video!  Keep doing what you do.
One hell of a video and probably my favorite!!! Chris Thank You !!
Taillights are from a 1965 thunderbird
Heck yeah! Make us a promise and make this one super clean and no cutting corners on finish work. Very excited for this one!!
That's great and all but where's the car that you were building? Did thay buy it or just take it?
I loved that build and it's what got me into your channel ....but my brain stalled when you said 2002...
Great. Now I'm free to build one of the dumbest cars ever.
Chris, thank you so much for making this video and setting the whole thing straight. I was super bummed when your build got taken. The suit itself should've never happened for anybody. Hopefully good comes out of this for you and for the shops that do the Eleanor recreation. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE FINISHING THE BUILD AND DOING IT SHELBY STYLE!
ive always liked the original Elenor more the 71 mach 1. but thats just me.
Cannot wait for this build. I hope this car is so damn awesome it’s a slap in the face to people who took the original. I’m sorry for all that happened to you and I know it has been an expensive adventure to entertain us. I can offer my thanks for running it back and finishing this. I know we all have had that Firefly like ( hope I don’t get sued) need for a great ending and I know we will be getting it now
Very well said! Building a tribute to Carroll Shelby, I’m looking forward to seeing the build.
Can we appreciate how the "H witch" always went threatening small people until someday she got big dicked by Shelby itself?? That's what i call sweet  Karma
Yes for Carol Shelby
HELL YES!
LFG! Can’t wait to see a tribute/Shelby inspired build from your team. After a body swapped EV
Hahaha this is fucking awesome! Chris is a legend 🙌🏼 I'm so glad this all seemed to pan out in y'all's favor, minus the money and property lost. I hope to see the build on the channel soon! Best of luck and God bless Brother!
I love the not so hidden message.  Let's support Shelby.
Dude! I am so excited for this! As a car kid I loved that car Nick Cage drove, but was too young to know it’s full Shelby heritage. It started my love of classic cars. Then I saw a real GT500 on an auction and realized that the Shelby design was amazing & timeless. Something I’m not sure that could be said about the movie car.
Great stuff! Peace!
What a piece of human garbage.
Hell yeah! I'm excited for what's to come.
Damn that’s such a great slap in the face😅
Their lawsuit destroyed their reputation. I was going to watch the movie because of your build, and now I've boycotted them. I won't give them anything.
Congratulations to Shelby as well as classic recreations snd b is for build for just getting that satisfaction
Oh I bet Denise is FUMING LOL
I love this, screw you de nice
This is a great insight and a Shelby tribute is going to be EPIC keep on building these amazing vehicles. Also a question that possibly a lot of people want to know is where is the build you started and was wrongly taken away from you? Will you ever get it back?
SEND HER BUD.. TDOT SPEAKING BEEN A FAN FOR A HOT HOT MIN. WHAT TYPE OF GUM F EM.. SEND HER BUD
Can’t even describe how happy I am for you Chris. You and the team are amazing people and don’t deserve to go through something like this. We all have been following you for years now. And finally heard and understand how everything went. It’s crazy. You’re the GOAT my man. Congratulations
When Is the mustang comming back home
Step 1: Malicious non compliance Step2 : see step 1
I agree .. the Elenor brand is going to vanish into the wind … this video has opened my eyes and I am sure it will open the eyes of every gt500 owner .. support the original creator not the copycat .
Quick question, maybe you answered it but because they took your build saying copy write crap do you get it back now, obviously its your property.
Being a little on the old side, I was confused because in the original movie Elenore is a 1973 mustang Mach 1.
Dude, if I could afford it, I would cover 100% of your legal costs just to go back to that Eleanor lawsuit and get it reversed. Not to get the original car back or to get to build another Eleanor, but to make them pay. Assholes need to pay. Get from them $ for every single nut and bolt you bought to do that build, the chassis, the body panels, everything, and for every minute you spent building that car and every minute dealing with this stupid issue after you tried to make it right on good faith. I want to see them go bankrupt and suffer for being assholes. But not you Chris, you are a better person than I am for letting this go and doing a build in honor of someone who actually deserves it.
You get what you bring. And they walk away with heads looking down!!! A freaking plus!!! True, honest, Carol Shelby kind of peoples, and yourself just won!!! Dude! Your now in the histroy books!!! OMG. 👍🏻👍🏻😎😎😎
I'm with you Chris!!! Don't build a car that has that much damaged history,  damage that she did to a good car.  Build a heros car for Mr. Shelby! Let her go kick rocks!  Great episode!
I still refuse to watch the movie "Gone in Shitty Seconds" as I have began to refer to it as.
AMEN brother!!! Long live SHELBY!!!
Did I miss the part where you said what happened to the car that was half done that they took?
Pretty interesting stuff, can’t believe they got away with that shit for so long. However, not sure how many people want to watch a 4th mustang body swap lol….,
After they took your car, I honestly considered trolling them by buying the ugliest, shittiest, non-running, $100 car I could find, making a body kit out of expanding foam, spray-painting racing stripes on it, and calling it Eleanor. I just wanted to see if they'd confiscate a broken-ass Kia or Hyundai because I called it Eleanor.
he actually didn't build any cars himself, he had a team car builders, engineers and hot rodders that built cars for him with money from ford. He was a good sales man a good talker.
I’m not sure Mrs. Halicki is the problem here. Chris mentions our ‘broken’ legal system. I’m wondering if some POS lawyer said Hey, we can make some money here…How old was she when her husband died? Just a thought…Happy for Chris & other car builders!
support that build 100%
Wait what happened to his original build??
Sounds to me like she used your R&D to possibly start making their own version of that Elenor build knowing how rare and expensive the 60s platform is getting.
M is for Middle Finger in B is for Build style! Man, I very so much enjoy it when these legal leeches get squashed at the end. PS.: The American legal system isn't the only one messed in our world.
Hell yeah.
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO BUILDING A TERLINGUA MUSTANG. IT’S ANOTHER SHELBY CREATION
Well said bud Build a tribute Shelby car and ignore that other thing
It all originated from the fact that Denise was able to get a trademark on a common name, then license out that common name, and unprofessionally go after non-businesses for making there own clone of a car that existed before she had any kind of trademark
Sucks that the situation is on going and the fact that this court case doesn't mean anything in the standing of your case
Should try to get that car back
I like the native shampoo I use it
Are you able to get your car back from them?
The ending was perfection.
so what did they do with the vehicle that they stole from you?
Well said,  and I applaud your plan going forward.  Shelby is a great inspiration!
B is for BETTER MAN THAN ME!  I would have built an Elanor and did burnouts in front of her place every chance I got.. salutes to you Chris🤙🏿
Love this video. You go Chris and team. Can’t wait to see your vision of a daily driver ‘67 Fastback Mustang.
"THIS IS THE MISSING INFORMATION I WAS WAITING FOR!!!" "B IS FOR THE BITCH THAT STOLLEN YOUR CAR!!!" "$10.000.00?!!!" 🤬"SHE PISSES ME OFF!!!" "WILL SOMEONE PLEASE PUT A BOUNTY ON THAT BITCH'S HEAD!!!" "DIE, BITCH, DIE!!!" Oscar's and your mid engine fast back Mustangs were AWSOME!!!" May the Bitch who stollen your Elenore build burn in Hell's Lake of Fire and not know Death's end!!!" "SHE'S A LAWBREAKER!!!" "THE WAGES OF SIN/LAWBREAKING IS DEATH!" "CAROL SHELBY IS THE MAN!!!" He was a good friend to Micheal McFarland who was Cleetus McFarland Grandfather!
This build have the perfect aura of the main story on the movie with nicolas and Eleanor. The impossible car to have.
Whoooo In their face!
Loved this
Denice...hope you are reading this because lots of people are coming after you for every dime you have and stole. HST and the two brothers are coming after you as well.
Yes, Denice went after Ronaele who partnered with HST international and Carol Shelby.  HST was the Mexico manufacture for the Ronaele Mustang and the Shelby Cobras.  Tons of pictures on Ronaele YouTube vids with lots of Ronaele mustangs being built side by side with the Shelby Cobras in 2008.
I am curious to know what they did with your build. I didn't really understand that part of it all.
I love it. He’s going to build an EXACT replica in honor of Shelby. Can’t wait
Yeah, C. Shelby  is my GT7 user name and all my mustangs and all my GTs have badass Shelby liveries with Eleanor colors
I was today days old when I learned that there are apparently four movies instead of just two.
Dude. Great decision !
Love this idea of  Shelby tribute. Can’t wait to see what comes of it.
… if you build it, we will watch.
That's all fine and dandy but you need to get your $180k car back
Man I'm so excited to see this build one of my favourite care of all time
I continue to not watch anything associated with those movies.        My code has honor, my code is BBUILD
Agree carol shelby was an American hero !
What I really want to know when you sent her the car was it a 2 foot by 2 foot cube? 🤣
I almost never comment on videos. The (decline to mention the name) movie DVD is now shredded. The associated actor movie dvds are (mostly) are now in the shredder. Not interested in anything affiliated with the aforementioned movie, actors, or even publishers. Way over reaching. Flattery is contagious. Greed, well, that’s a disease. It should be eradicated. #gfy
I'm thinking you took the high road and came out on top, bro. If there is one thing I think you all got from this whole ordeal was a much larger audience then you started with prior to them stealing your car. This whole thing pissed me off, not because I'm in love with Eleanor (I'm not really a Ford guy), but because of they way you and the team got treated. I thought it was CRAP (and it was, now that I've heard "the rest of the story"). Due to this, I sub'd to your channel and have been dutifully watching ever since. I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest ... I'm not the only one.   Thanks for making this video of explanation and for all you do. Looking forward to seeing everything else you all build. I'm sure it will be good. :o)
Chris,,you very well explained everything about that lawsuit thank you for sharing,and I totally agree with you on Carroll can't wait for the build of the Shelby .Thank you for explaining your fans stand behind, awesome job on all your great entertainment.
I was so pissed when all that happened to you. Then we saw the suit had been won you were the first thought I had.
The side skirts with the side exhaust is pretty much an sn95 svo side skirt
Fricken ey Chris!! Can't wait to see the Shelby build!!
Good rant😂😂😂🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🫡🫡🫡
You: B is for Build Her: B is for Bitch
"A God Damn American Hero." Had me laughing.  Tell it like it is brother.
It's crazy what 1 Karen can do. Talk about a pain in the ass. Can you sue them for taking your car, over false claims? Basically she should have stoped at the cesse and deciste, so you may not use the Eleanor name... it's pretty much where all her lawsuits were supposed to end.
hell yeah this was my second favourite car I saw you start building can't wait for it to be back
Where is your car now?
Bro sometimes America is fucked
Well said Man!!!!!! I am so glad you got somehow vindicated after all you had to go through!
let's goooo!!!!
Well… good job Eleanor you’ve just managed to single handed my destroy your reputation and everyone hates you now. Nice.  Also respect to B is for build for discussing this very respectfully, I can tell he was holding back from bashing Eleanor, but it wasn’t needed, we all read between the lines. They suck and were incredibly petty.
The original one is a ‘71 Mach 1, yellow and black.
I was so angry when they did that to you, it was so wrong then and they are still wrong in the end. Glad to see that you want to make a "Shelby" version now.
I love that idea brother do it for Shelby
YEEEAHHH!!!!🥲
I always thought the latest Eleanor was a poorly done ripoff. Shelby is a far better choice.
Kudos to you and a big fat 🖕to the greedy pieces of shit.
I warned you when building this thing about calling it an Eleanor...
can't freaking wait!
Build it! (The Shelby not hellinore)
I mentioned it before, but you should call it the Hell-anore lol.
It's like you're in the movie Route 60 in the City of Morlow. Bad story.
SHELBY  TRIBUTE BUILD ALL THE WAY... WE SALUTE YOU!
Quick question do y’all let fans & car enthusiast that live locally to see the cars y’all build in person at the shop?? Or is it just completely private and don’t stop at the shop. I’ve always wondered??
Ellenor? Nah this is an Allen Moore.
This made my day!
Good luck mate. I am really looking forward to your next mustang build. Let us know if you have any trouble with THE woMAN again
Brilliant video Chris! I've been waiting to see this video since the judgement in favor of CSA!   Denise 🖕😘
Oscar "didwell"  <---middle name
First please finish the boat ! I am not a car guy and found you because of the boat videos. Still watched all the car videos though  😇
So given the fact you're planning on doing this all over again from scratch, I'm guessing somehow you aren't allowed to have your car back?
Glad to hear the mostly full story on this one. You definitely made the right call. GT500 > Eleanor
Honestly scrwa eleanor, Gone in  60 seconds and the company who sued you.
Great explanation and going forward plan!
What actually happened to the car though did you have to sell it to Denise and what happened to it after that?
Love the back half of this video!
Good on you chris
FUCK YEAH!!!! The happy ending we all wanted for B is for build!!! Congrats!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I work at Barrett Jackson how was wondering why so many of the Eleanors had made your way back onto the auction block. This video shed light on that. Thanks for doing the video and letting us know what the hell happened with it. I hope the money grubbing whore no longer has a source of income
yes🎉
Glad to hear some good news
Respect bud!!! Nice approach to the problem, and Im glad your mega positive about it. Hope your health is also in hand, and I look forward to more videos. Keep on smiling!!
I think what the document pretty much saying is don't call your car a Eleanor so these evil people don't come and try to take your car from you. Just a thought🤔
Spot on with Shelby
What happened to your actual car  and build ? Did I miss it in the video ?Did they take it?
I have an essay due tomorrow night for my business law class and thanks to you. I now have a topic to write on!🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾
Let’s go dude!! A Shelby Tribute build!!! Can’t wait!!
Awesome, thank you for that. I learned about this, and that is when I started following you to show support of the frivolous of this.  Sad part is it is not hers. It was her late Husband. Hedid something awesome and she is just riding it out becuase she has no other way to live off his legacy.
cant wait to see this build
I’m so exited to watch that build, pls do it asap Chris!
Hell yes brother can’t wait for this build to take off! I honestly feel like you should be able to sue her back for this stupid stuff now!
Good for you Chris. I believe they call that karma!
Still think you should sue them with cost to get your car back. Then rename it to the hell-icky dishouner build
Fuggin awesome!!
I called and told the company that does the Eleanor’s for Denise that I wanted to purchase 2 of them , one for me and one for my Dad . Started the process of ordering these two cars and then mentioned what happened to B is For Build after having numerous conversations with them about my builds . Expressed my concern about what Denise had done to you and said I wasn’t sure I could do these builds. . She got involved sending correspondence saying that these cars would be legit and no issues like what happened to B is For Build . Acted like things were ok more correspondence. Left them hanging for a week or so and then said no thank you due to what she had done to B is For Build I was going to have to cancel my 1/2 million dollar order . This was my protest for what they did to you . I still have all the emails
Congratulations on the victory. This is also a huge victory for the classic car industry. They were clearly taking advantage of a bad court ruling for years. I remember seeing “Elenor’s” being built at a shop on the discovery channel. That must have been before the first round of law suits. I like your attitude towards the whole situation. Gotta support Carol Shelby.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"Eleanor" really is a .....  She's exposed as such. Leave her alone. Shelby is "the" man. Without Shelby,  there would be no Eleanor. Do a tribute car to Shelby, doesn't even need to be a mustang.
Perfect video, man. Celebrate Shelby, ignore the copyright trolls looking to cash in
Onward and upward and PI$$ on that other gal!!!!!!!!   SHELBY is the greatest.
Very nice update. Glad to see you can finaly, with confidence, restart the build you wanted to. Its respectable how you go about the whole situation. Cant wait for the build.
Damn, I can't wait to see that build.
Sweet revenge! 😋
Damn, didn’t realize it’s Been so long since covid, 2002😳
Chris I'm so glad in the future your going to build the mustang again 👍 the build will be epic content 👍🇬🇧
F*ck Yeah! Damn the Whoa-Man!! Can't wait to see your dreams come to reality!!
Did the original build get seized?
Karma it’s a kick in the toosh.
I wrote you about this weeks ago to tell you about it and never heard from you.
But are you getting your build back?
karma is gonna find her and its bringing a cactus.
I could care less about an Eleanor, I like seeing the Mustang builds on the late model cares. They should give you your car back. What a scam.
I've already decided that "Eleanor" is dead to me.  Keep on building.
Get the car back and finish it 😩😩 definitely better than the mid-engine mustang
Love this video, and appreciate your complete explanation! And as a side note, your description of Carrol Shelby was beautiful!
If I was you I would name every fxxxg build Elenore (not Eleanor) even if it is a motorbike with two stripes on the fender and imagine how -Karen- Denise is exploding in her office
Fantastic idea to build ur own Shelby design Mustang
I think I'm a little bit smarter for watching this video.
👌❤️
I refuse to watch any of those films because of what they did to you. What a twat she is
Looking forward to it.....
They got what they deserve now their brand and little respect that had down the drain
Too bad you didn't have the deep pockets necessary to beat Halicki into submission.  You lost a mighty fine build.
any particular reason 'Ford' didnt get involved
well said ! can't wait to see you finish this one !
Respect, Chris. Passion trumps law!  (we hope)
Oh right! Can't wait
Agreed. Carroll Shelby deserves the credit. I saw all the movies in the Gone in 60 second lineup. It was a in the 1974 movie that a yellow 73 mustang was given the name. It was the Nick Cage movie this one copy cat Shelby was premiered.  Until you said that is was a rusty version depicted, I forgot all about that one! Good point!! Love your channel, great builds, great folks! Love that newest Mustang build. . . what a looker!!!
Lmao.. Legaleese XD
Sounds like she can Halicky your balls!!, thanks Shelby for taking care of us little guys! Glad to hear your outta the weeds chris
Hopefully he gets his money back and also if his car is gone he should be reimburse for his time
Did im the only one who tried to scroll the PDF doc ??
Cant wait for this build
So… The woman who married the man who created the original car three months before he died then took his creation and profited off of it is a money grubbing bully? I’m shocked. 😂
So the question remains: What happened to your build? Nice to see a win for common sense 👍
great job
Can we collectively agree to start naming out 500$ shitbox cars Eleanor just to erase the meaning of that name…
No, bro, it wasn't negatively impacting their business. It was negatively impacting their pockets, cuz the bish greedy af.
What happened to the original mustang u were building
So many deodorants make my underarms rashy af.. Even went as far as trying some that was specially made from goats milk and hypo-allergenic. Axe is legit the only one that doesn't make me break out.
Well done! Congrats on winning the war and changing the reason for the battle.
Chris....great job on this video. Yet again, you should be proud of your work. I appreciate you digging into the court case and explaining the difference of the Shelby GT500 and the Eleanor.   And I could not agree with you more about Carol Shelby!!!
Yes!!
Hell ya bro I’m excited for you!! Building a bad ass carol shelby tribute car is a stellar idea…F the other lady…she can suck it!!!
IF I ever did see a middle finger stretched out... this was it!! I LOVE IT
This made my day.
Elenore was based off of a Carroll Shelby GT500, so if any one is ripping off anyone it's they who must not be named.
Any car enthusiast law professors out there? If yes, they will make this a case study in his/her class. Common sense & the ‘law’ landed in the same spot on this one…blind squirrel finds a nut? Thanks for the interesting update, Chris!
Awesome redemption story! Build it for the real car maker American hero Carol Shelby. 🙌
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I use native deodorant. But at $13 for a deodorant stick that doesn't last long sucks...
Love that!
I'm glad the lawsuit is over. In my opinion..the only way a car looks like an Elanor..Is the hood. Without that..nothing else makes it look different than any  real  Shelby. Its Hard to believe so many people were sued..over a hood??
This is SUNSHINE! For this PNW day!!! Good new and good attitudes! Thank you Chris!
Amen Brother! Good for you, and Carroll Shelby is THE Man! Much better direction of build.
This is great news. The only thing that would have made it better is if you were able to get your old car back, but for all we know, that is or was being looked into. All the best, and the new Shelby will be an amazing automobile with better looks that the E version; which I always felt was too busy looking, just gilding the lily.
Started watching your videos after all the drama and so much respect to you for going in the direction of contributing to a real car designer, can’t wait to see the new build.
Result! Long live the spirit of Carol Shelby!
In my opinion, what I think, is that I believe that you absolutely got screwed and I cannot wait for the day your “not-eleanor” Comes back!
Fucking love it
Good to hear. What are the 4 movies it appeared in? I know the two Gone in 60 second movies, but what are the other two?
The quintessential middle fingers raised in this video is amazing!    B is for badass
Obligatory comment for the algorithm.
Lets hope you sue them and get your car/capital spent back with cost....and hope everybody they screwed does the same
#DoItForShelby
Ohh man...talking about movies, that's right.  Same happens with the Herbie,the love bug. Don't know how many movies are made, n all the movies there's different years. N still been the  Herbie.
Thanks man.... even more of a  B is for build fan now because of this video!!!!!!!!!!!
Fun fact, didn’t know the car was in four films!
That’s how you fight back against crooks. They have lost a bunch of cars enthusiasts and you will only grow even more moving forward. Congrats!!!
FINISH THEM!!!
Elanor at its core is just a GT500.  Can I copyright my 68 Camaro that I call Sue?  So no one may name a Camaro Sue, without having to pay me money?  It is just insane.  If anything Shelby/Ford had a claim against them, because  they were taking their copyright on a GT500, and trying to make money on it.
2002? man time really flies! i feel like Elenor Project was 2 - 3 years ago, not 20 🤣
You go Chris...long live the Mustang!!!
Awesome idea!
👍
I have been waiting to hear this forever! I'm glad to hear this and can't wait to watch. Screw them is right.
Totally agree
Gotta love it when an asshole overplays their hand and gets caught and played at their own game.
Imagine how many more Eleanor's would have been sold if people saw your finished build.. they missed a free marketing opportunity. Your build wasn't costing them money. 🦶🔫
My great grandmothers name was Eleanor and she had it legally changed due to a cease and desist letter. She goes by Peter now
Outstanding!!!! Hope you are made whole again!!!!
You've been dealing with COVID since 2002 lol geez, this must be the weird stuff you were talking about 😂
Chris, build a Shelby Daytona and a mustang frame
Interesting
I am glad how this turned out for you.  I would love to see you get the original build back just to give them the finger.  Get it back and not finish it, just have it be a musuem piece for you.
I know Caroll Shelby has had close ties with Ford for many years.  I'm just wondering, couldn't Ford Motor Corporation also go after Halicki and squash their copyright as they have renamed a Ford model which Ford have had copyright to?
Been waiting to see if you'd comment as soon as I saw the court verdict !  Great to see you're doing a new take on the banished rebuild and glad she got told to go swivel 👍
👍👍👍👍
Can't wait for the new Body Swap Build. 100% agree with you, screw her and let's see a Shelby tribute car!
Kind of interesting how Eleanor does not pass the Daniels test and they are going after cash grabs constantly, and yet Herbie (who no one would argue IS an identifiable character) has who knows how many clones running around and we're not hearing about constant lawsuits despite being owned by one of the largest, most powerful movie houses in history...
I can’t wait to see this build it is going to look awesome
Nice to see sh💩tty people loose. Eleanors are dated and look ugly nowadays anyway. The Carol Shelby cars are timelessly beautiful though.
I always thought just make a murdered out black and red one and call it hellenore. It should qualify as parody.
I would say you should go after them for the car and the ability to edit the videos of the prior project and repost them, then take the money from those videos and put it towards a donation tied to Shelby or Mustang etc
A build with a reason and an origin story. This is one for the ages
Woot!Woot! Cant wait!
What are the 4 movies?
Fuck yes!!!
This is why a LOVE button should be included for videos.
id say thats a clear case of someone trying to punch above their weight. stupid to think they could take on Shelby, i know he died in 2012 (RIP) but his legacy will never die or be taken away. Ford wouldnt even be able to do that and they would have more chance than anyone. i have never heard of Shelby or ford complaining about replicas of their cars, if Shelby was still alive i think he would be over the moon that we like his cars so much. so i say build a Shelby GT500, you want it, we want it. i would try get backing from Shelby if possible in some form. i bet they would encourage you to build a replica
Simple way to understand this: Think of it this way, you made a character to be sold on shelves as the "Hulk" yet even though he's now silver, is still a person (A Ford Mustang), gets angry (Gets Stolen), and has a Jakel and Hyde mentality...(has stalling issues) Disney/marvel's going to notice you're making money off their IP, and not only notice it's the wrong color etc if you don't pay Disney to use their IP, what happens? You get sued or get a letter right? So why was this situation so much harder for those to grasp. The trademarked and legally bound name "Eleanor" was Halicki's.. period. Yes you can argue Halicki's Mustang wasn't a real Mach1.. yes just as real as the CGI Nic Cages' Silver 1967 GT500 with a Roush Yates EFI 427, body kit, larger mock Hilbrand center knock wheels, and oh yeah Nitrous... that jumped an ambulance like it was out of the Burnout game series lol Thats not the point. When you say Eleanor, anyone born in the last 30 years says Nic Cage, not the original which its based on.   Halicki's situation is how a future independent filmmaker can get railroaded by "fans" who had money to have one built for them as reboot era car duplicating his work. Universal paid him for the usage, for those who didn't are like those who try to sell you counterfeit tickets or products and charged people for it and denying the original creator the proper payment of his original works. Don't know about you all that use the "Creative common's License" as an online crutch, but again, there's no such thing as an original idea anymore, so what's the point?
Great video and I'm so stoked to see the new build! The comment about Carroll Shelby (roughly 21:21) really hit a guy in the feels.
Thanks for the transparency!
Hell yeah love this video. I've been waiting since you first said I can't say anything about the court stuff. I figured it was all some bunk shit. Good on you guys for staying as calm and collected and what not. Not flying off the handle like fuck that lady ima build my own Eleanor with black jack and hookers lol
My god! Substitute "bimbo" for every mention of "Denice Shakarian Halicki"!
I can't wait for the BisforBuild '67 Shelby S550! After your disappointment with the one that got away, and the success of the last, you deserve it. Great news!
Gooooood riddance to that harpy!!!! Don't let the door hit your greedy ass (and your fake ass hair extensions) on the way out, hunny!!!! 👀💅 Way to go Chris! Can't wait for this future build. Too bad you can't sue HER for damages.
Awesome..
& be there, I shall watch it!  Oscar's Mustang is rad also- are there any updates like water-proofing that needed to be addressed given the PNW weather?
love it! can't wait for the build!
I think, in my opinion... About f.... time that got sorted out!  Good for you 👍
that's the news I've been waiting for, nice one Chris.
I love that point of view Shelby over Eleanor full support
badass video Chris im so glad this issue has been resolved in court, we should all be supporting Shelby for what has has done for the car and racing community. can't wait for you to finally kick off your new build, im sure its going a lot of fun to watch. best of luck to you...
Heck yeah bro! Screw that lady and her so called Eleanor! That lady is TRASH!
Shelby homage car. We all know your skills guys, so we can rest assured you will make something that could make Carroll proud, smile and ask for the keys so he can beat the hell of out it. Keep raising the bar guys and keep wrenching!
One of my favorite episodes. The truth shall set you (we, us ) free. Keep on keepin on brother
Glad the whole it's an Eleanor thing is done and dusted for you .but what an absolute scum bag that woman and her lawyers  are the whole point of a tribute car is to pay homage to the original not try and squeeze money out ot anyone and every one if the car is not a 67 fastback see rego docs it's not a Eleanor end of .Good luck with your project
I've always hated the Eleanor and didn't Chip foose design that? These people are idiots just because a couple of guys are building a car that looks like the Lenore doesn't mean any thing and why they would waste their time And then to take the project that you guys were working on it leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth and makes them look like 💩 and I'm not talkin a little I'm talking like a big bull pile of 💩 and I will never buy one of those cars especially from those sue-happy boneheads They need to get a real job and stop messing with people that are just in love working on old or cars in general
As far as I am concerned, Eleanor is dead. All this legal punching down stripped any joy that existed for the movies, or the car. Let them rot in history.
Tell me you’re at least going to sue mrs. halicky for all the money you lost on the first “Elenor” build .. that’s a lot of money time and work down the drain when it’s now been proven you were in the right
I will continue to boycott all movies related to Eleanor for the scummy things they've done to the automotive community. Total dirt bags.
amen brother!
Someone was just hurting for money
I've just got one thing to say, HA!
You. Da. Man. Man! Great job. 🇺🇸👍🏻
That’s one way to take a W
Well said. Can't wait
And that'll be a hell of a build man!! I'm very proud!!
Let’s gooooooo! Been waiting for this video, can’t wait for this build!!
Man Halicki is such a scumbag. Making a repro of a ANY car that you are not claiming is a licensed example has no copyright or intellectual property rights. It's a physical object not intellectual property.
Found On Rubbish Dumps.
That ending was the most subtle 'FOff biaaaaach' that i've seen on ye ole interwebs.   In my opion.
Wow that means bumblebee could be any yellow car 🤣
I'm a Camaro guy but hell's yeah. I want to see that build.
Well said.  Halicki (and Eleanor) can get stuffed.
Beautifully explained! Cant wait
If it was me I'd request the the car to be returned, and then build it and give it away.
B is for Breaking the law!   Man I started watching the channel with the M5 powered Datsun, but every time he pulls out a mustang, it just makes me happy.  Thanks Chris, and thanks to your team!
Been waiting for a while now to hear this!
AWESOME!!!  Been waiting to hear this update since hearing about the recent court news!  And making the new build a tribute to Carol Shelby and not that OTHER car... PRICELESS
Nice bro
So will Shelby sue you for building a gt500 tribute next ;)
oh no doubt! i cant wait man so stoked for ya!
You, good sir, could not have shown more class in how you are handling this. I am definitely looking forward to the build! =)
Fuck yes! I can’t wait for this new build!
I agree with you 💯 👍🏽 👌
An almost stock fastback or Shelby is a stunning piece of rolling art the way it is. I have a 68 fb that needs restored, I bought it years ago and life got in the way. I've thought about it a lot over the years and although I like the gone in 60 seconds version I wouldn't want to build my car into one. I agree with everything he said in this video and look forward to the build. Hopefully I'll get to build my own version one day. Got lots of ideas and think I could bring a unique car onto the scene.
Good to see Shelby win out and leave the door open for you to get your Daily GT500
I can’t wait to see it
Glad to head this whole debacle is coming to a close for you guys. I wholeheartedly believe the “creators” of Elanor have officially tarnished the image and name of that car through and through.
So the entire decades of legal cases they won were based solely on fraud. They should be paying back all the money they stole plus interest and replacing cars they stole.
😁👌 I knew towards the end you would give us the goods 😉. Can't wait to see the build.   I'm glad that the lady lost in court.  Now shes gotta go get a job as a Walmart greeter . 🤣.   Who knows maybe she'll take a Walmart vest add in a pink stripe and try suing Walmart for copyright uniform infringement .😜
Can't wait. Let's go. Karma is hell!!
Where is Ford in all of this? All of the cars are really Ford's creations??
I,m from Europe, what the fuck , if I buy a car ,shelby, it,s mine, I can do with my car whatever i want, i dont understand what ,s the problem
Win for the good guys 🥳👏 can't wait til that series comes out. Good luck with it. In the middle of the Datsun build for the 3rd time. It's helped soooo much with my 280zx build
Yes Chris, very well said.. this was an awesome video! Fantastic explanation and absolutely 100% it’s a Shelby design. Tribute car for Carol Shelby… Full send!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Effing A!!!!!
I never will respect Elenor’s ever again. I see them and I feel disgust.
Great explanation of SLAPP.  https://youtu.be/UN8bJb8biZU
What I see now happening is people who own previously licensed “Elenor” cars. Once they realize that their paid for licensed cars are no longer “license” legal cars, their value is no longer associated with the movies or the characters they depict. Miss stupicky, is in over her head.
But did you get your car back from the clown who stole it from you, claiming “copyright”?
I was wondering if you’d even approach a conversation about any of this. You sir, are a fucking legend and I’m 100% here for the new mustang build.
You need to get your car back, probably a loss on the legal fees. 😄. BTW I’m gonna build one as soon as I find a donor! 😆 I have a 2021 GT500 iconic silver with black stripes and I’m calling it an Eleanor! 😃 always found it funny that the court was willing to copyright something that she didn’t manufacturer! 🤪
Good Luck with the Shelby car. And can't wait to see the build videos.
and i remember clearly in a documental where shelby's E were being built, they talked about the movie car and clearly said all the details, like the side exhausts were not even functional and they had to be recreated, and dont mention the bodywork redesign work
the eleanor people are total scumbags.
They suck! Great 4 u
At least tell me your going to sue her now to get your money back for your car, legal fee's, pain and suffering
So it would be really cool to sue to get your old car back and then do a build and like give it away to a subscriber or something
Please start it next month!
I 💯 agree with you on all of this !!! And I can’t wait to see that build!!🔥🔥
Why could this not have happened before they took your car? I'd like to know if you can now sue them for the hardship and expenses that their actions have caused for you..?
Just think about all the money she has robbed, basically she extorted from every single person shes ever dealt with over this, and has had the courts fooled, shame on them, she is nothing less that a crook. Glad she now knows that she has been caught, and wondering if everyone she has sued and or harassed over this can sue her for deformation.... food for thought.
Mate this women who is trying to sue everyone sounds like a right bitch… clearly can’t make her own money so has to sue other people for theirs!
If there's one piece of information in a cease and desist that was obtained illegally it's null and void. You can even counter them with legal action.
There's the 1974 and the 2000 movie. what were the other two?
Everyone building these cars needs to drop "Eleanor" name and just call them GT500 and Shelby gets his recognition. Eleanor name must die!
You should still sue to get your creation back. It was looking so nice with all the custom stuff like the back lights and the 3d printed supports for the sensors. That is no Elanor mod right there
You should still go get your car back. That bitch NEEDS to pay! Everybody NEEDS to go get their cars back from her!
3:14 … “2002 couple months after Covid hit”… how did that make it past the editing
Did he just say 2002 before Covid hit 😮
👍👊✊
You just grew in my eyes. I don’t agree with everything you do and have made, but this explanation and video made me respect you much more. Kudos for your thoughts! 🎉
Denise needs sued into oblivion for lawyer fees and damages for lost revenue by everyone who was building these cars. Denise can beg for coins on the beautiful streets of skidrow alley.
Hell yes dude!!!! SO happy to hear this and we all knew it was total BS what they did. And yeah.... The Shelby tribute instead is an amazing idea!!! Much love ❤
Sounds like a “slap” lawsuit against her is in order.  Return your property (and /or monitory value of property) and legal fees.
It’ll be fun to see what hate mail you get from Halicki after this!
Nice one
Chris, what did you do with the “Eleanor clone you made”?
I hope the wh…woman never sells another license. She can piss off
Glad that drama is over.  Can't wait for the build, I love mustangs
🫡
I hope the wh…woman never sells another license. She can piss off
Peace
Solid breakdown. Excited for the Shelby build.
Who pays ur lawyer fees???
That was my our Dark Moss Green '67 GT500 at the 18 minute mark. Thanks for  using it in your video, and you are correct, Carroll Shelby was a true American icon. He used to be present at the Shelby Meets in Las Vegas that I used to attend with a group of friends. He would just be walking around talking with people, driving his Cobra on the track, some really cool memories. I'm looking forward to watching your '67 Mustang fastback build project. Good luck with it!
You can get a lot of donations to sue for your car back then do a video of you crushing it.
Lets fucking go Chris!!!
That is the classiest burn I have ever heard or seen. The only thing I would have done differently is getting the build back and destroy it and I mean DESTROY !!! Keep on being you and same to your amazing team. Can't wait to see the new Carroll Shelby tribute project.
That's Karma :)
I believe technically the Shelby GT500 was not considered a Mustang at all and was its own car
HELL YEAH NEW BUILD
Any idea where the car you built is now?
I never liked Eleanor the regular gt500 looks better. I like what you didn't with the render fastback way better. Glad you made this video, I was curious about it.
Only $10k I would have expected it to be a lot more.
Outstanding 😁
stupid DENICE
What a great video. You showed great character, good on you Chris!
Hell yes!!!! Screw em
Damn! Karma is a bitch. When she hits back, she hits hard! Great job being so true to yourself!
I totally agree with you….”F” the Eleanor…build a Shelby tribute car. Looking forward to the videos. 👍🏻.
Hell yeah! I felt the Bald Eagles screaming as the power of V8 engines roared when you talked about Mr. Carol Shelby! GT-500 for the win! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽💯💯💯 #merica #americafuckyeah
Good work Chris!  I wish you could get back the stuff that was taken from you.
Big middle finger to Halicki, good job. I'm looking forward to your builds.
So so awesome cannot wait for you to start building this thing. :)
i want a 69 charger body swapped on a modern hellcat platform
I started following/watching this channel after I heard about this on Twitter a few years ago.
Holy shit dude, I can see it in your face how happy you are about how this cookie crumbled. Cant let off the throttle now. I spy a forever car in the works
So if this is the case, did they crush the original 67 fastback you were building? or is it sitting in a warehouse somewhere? Either way i do think you should get financial compensation for the revenue lost and also the car if said car doesn’t exist anymore
Nicely said! Definitely back you doing another paying homage to Shelby. He’s the real hero no doubt.
Halicki'🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕. Can't wait for this build.
Greatest comeback I've seen in a long time 😂 would love to see them challenge in court, but it would take so much time and mentally drain everyone, I'd say these new plans are the best decision.
Yes!!!
Just lost all respect for Shelby after watching this video.
I have always been lost on how a Steve Stanford and Chip Foose interpretation of the GT500 could be owned or trademarked by Denice Halicki. The film I get, possibly even the moniker of ‘Eleanor’ when used in conjunction with a Mustang, but not the design or likeness of the car that Halicki did not design or develop.
So what’s happening to the car you already built are you gana get it back or just forget it
So sad that you lost your build!  It was one of my favorites.  As always LOVE the channel!
We are so glad you are finally being recognized for the great work you do - outside 'this' Mustang.. But you have Great Content - Keep going!
I wonder if they will have to pay back damages to all those that they took advantage of. They should. Good win
I think chip foose built the Eleanor in the the nick cage movie.
Good on you brother! In MY personal opinion, I'm STOKED that the Shelby lawyers were able to get that dumb as lady off everyone's back. She kept this going for way too long, this was her source of income, just sue people, which in MY opinion is a shitty thing to do
Hell yeah, you're the man
One question that wasn't answered, what happened to your original build? And can you now legally fight (if you wish) to reclaim your car? Or, at the very least, financially compensated for the loss of your build (assuming they crushed it or whatever).
#FUCKYOUDENISEHALIKI   TREND THIS SHIT TO THE MOON BOYS FOR OUR LORD AND SAVIOR CHRIS. Dude has has alot of bad days if youve been a fan long enough and this would atleast put a smile on his face because he’s immature like the rest of us. We all love you chris, Oscar and Kyle.
So what happened to your original project, did it get crushed pr something
Thanks for breaking all this down.  Would t lie, when I saw the ruling, the first thought was "so are they gonna finish the build."  Good on you and could agree more.  Shelby was the real deal.
I come from Sweden and have wanted to visit the Us fore a long time but the legal system you have scares me. What if i violate some federal law thats prevents me from  returning home? The land of the free??? 🤕😬
Ms. Hickie is trying to screw over everyone.
Best damn show yet!!
Crazy thing is that from my understanding Chip Foose changed the design brought to him into what it is in the Nick cage film that made the E name popular. As someone who took the time to find a dvd of the first Gone in 60 seconds I can tell you it is not popular nor the reason the name is known. So in my mind if anyone could have owned the name Chip should have not the greedy widow
Chris, my man.  I'm glad you're back in it.  I wish you could get the prior build returned to you, or at least some kind of financial return for all that work.  But I also know you're gonna do a great job with the new project.
Absolutly fascinating. I have to admit, I really like the idea of the Elenore brand being damaged by their obnoxious litigation.
Wait so what happened to the one they took!!!? Did they crush it??
3:13 woah, COVID hit way earlier in your area than in the rest of the world man 😂
Thank you for posting that video. I have been wondering what the real story was for some time. I look forward to seeing the build begin.
Let's F'N gooo!!! Can't wait for the 67 mustang build!!
Great video and victory
PEACE!!!!
"L" eanor
Love seeing the car my grandpa made in your video, even if it is shown for half a second as a comparison. (Grandpa is Chuck Cantwell)
And that's what we call a Bitch Slap! Nicely done
Just glad that "Eleanor" team got a huge kick in the nuts (or tits). The fact that they used Shelby's car to argue that it was theirs is mind-blowing
Damn does that mean that the Eleanor decal I made for my 2009 Mustang is a patent infringement. Correct if I’m wrong but Carrol Shelby was licensed by Ford to create the GT 350 and 500 Cobra Mustangs, so I’m not sure where Ms Holicki fits into this.
This is one of the biggest bull shitter stories. Imagine if guys froms fast and furious couldnt replicate any of the movie cars. Or people wanting a bullet mustang from the steve mcqueen movie.
Fantastic. You go Chris!
Man, I am so proud of you. Thank you for sharing this.
@b is for build   at least put back the episodes on youtube .
I always assumed Oscar's middle name was "Did a Great Job"
Amazing video! I'm so glad you're building another one! I feel so inspired bud! Cheers!
2002
In my option the US legal system is a mess. Hope this culture doesn’t spread do the UK. Really sorry you had to go through this.
That was one of the politest, "go f'yourself's" I've ever witnessed. Good luck on the new build! Cant wait to see it.  Good for you and good for Shelby!
Hammer time
I love you Christoper. So much I used your WHOLE NAME.
I am so happy to hear that. Made me smile... may have got a little teary.
YES MORE MUSTANGS
16:50 - I love the fact that the document has in it:  "For Example, anointing a 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E with the name Eleanor..."  Dude.  I mean, that's fantastic right there.  Not only using a modern car as the example, but the Probe-E to boot.  Hilarious, well done, court!
Great update!  Love that you are going the Shelby route instead.
ok i'm convinced - i don't want you to build an eleanor either and if halicki ever makes a sequel, we should boycott it.
Was bullish!t from the get go
Absolutely crazy. I wish they'd give your fucking car back and anyone else's. If anyone owns a right to that car its Ford and Shelby.
100% in agreement with what you said and what "wasn't" said. It's unfortunate that the other party took it that far. They completely destroyed everything great about the movies.
Awesome! Looking forward to seeing your build.  God bless
Did someone call nicolas cage and ask for his opinion......... 😅😅
Man, it must be hard to be so right.  You want to stand on a mountain and scream "I TOLD YOU I WAS RIGHT!!!!"  The way you handled this shows how incredibly humble you and your team are.  In the end, you guys will win!  Cannot wait to see the build that comes from this.
We support B is for Build!!!
imagine a world without lawyers... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2VxpTMAbas&ab_channel=TimPrisc
After hearing your thoughts on all of the players involved in the saga, and then hearing your final plans on the topic warmed my crusty 'ol soul! I'm really looking forward to it!
I have to tell you, Chris, you came through this like a Rockstar! All the bumps in the road didn't stop your love of building cars, even other Mustangs! I think all of this drama would have broke me! Can't wait to see the 3rd one, cheers!!
You talk to much.
Hell yeah!!! Can't wait for that build to start, and for this copyright finally gone for good.
NICE !!!
Inter alia means amongst other things
I like Natives body wash
So wait, you aren’t getting the one that you already started back?
The minute they took you to court was when the Eleanor car was dead to me.  Carrol Shelby will always be an American hero.
Killing me in this one, Chris. "Like what's Oscar's middle name? I don't know." Inter alia *points at ear*
I'm not even a Ford guy and even I have mad respect for Carol Shelby!! That fake ass Shelby gt 500 has caused more damn headaches than the MF worth!! They basically ripped off a Shelby car and gave it a stupid chicks name. Bout time the courts actually did something right for once.
Yes yes……… go ahead boy. Build it with pride. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Only 10k??? Good lawyer Chris
Hell yeah bring Eleanor back !
I thought this was crazy back when it happened. Glad Shelby rightfully won. I’m gonna be honest I’ve never liked Eleanor though. I’d rather a mercury cougar.
Good for you and f them I have lost all respect for them
WE BACK BABY!! B is for Build! LESSS GO!!!
Let’s Gooooooo!!! Really happy for the team.
Glad the court finally did something right and got rid of the unrealistic copyright nonsense. Looking forward to the Shelby built!
Those people are literally trash, that bitch made money off of people she didn't deserve.
Great video but you missed out some information. The Eleanor Mustang is a 1971 Mustang Mach used in HB Halickis Gone in 60 seconds and was featured in Junk Yard Man as well. HB Halicki the Car Crash King was tragically killed whilst filming Gone in 60 seconds 2/3. Denice Halicki entered into a licence contract with Disney in 1995 to produce a remake with Nicholas Cage which featured a custom 67 GT500 as Eleanor. The yellow Mustang Mach 1 was in more Films than the GT500 which makes the copyright that much more redicolous.
Glad you're going to build your dream Mustang. Too bad Denise won't just admit defeat and hand you back your original car. But, I look forward to this next Mustang build, and honoring Carroll Shelby's legacy is better.
John Oliver has a good episode on slapp suits
Legend!
Let Eleanor die.
Sounds awesome, can't wait to see the build.
Well done Chris, but my question, can you actually do this build without wide bodying the hell out of it? :)
I'm starting  a drinking game where when you say In my opinion I take a drink
Glad for the updates on your 69 Mustang! Looking forward to seeing your Shelby tribute 69 Mustang 🤝
So much respect for this video.
I destroyed my dvd copies of both the 1999 movie and the 1974 original. I also haven't mentioned the name of the movie or the car since.
Dude, I watched about 8 minutes.  It just dont make me, give two fucks.   Stick to molesting cars.   Crying out loud, isnt your strong suit....
Have never forced myself to watch an ad but there always a first!!!!
F. Eleanor
WTF was that about at 14:23 "interrupting a heist by getting intimate in view of the vehicle, and keys for 3 vehicles must be retrieved from the bowels of a canine by feeding it laxatives!?"
Eleanor wants to be General Lee =) But Eleanor can't just be any mustang. Interestingly informative.
I may or may not have just fist pumped in the air that you are going to do your redeembuild!
what happened to the last build?
"Inter Alia," meaning "among other things." The lawsuit against Halicki was all things GT 500e/ Eleanor in production. Carroll Shelby International owns all rights to Shelby, " Eleanor." If  Carroll Shelby International feels that the Eleanor brand is being abused, Carroll Shelby International can and will create a lawsuit and win.  In your case, Halicki was being childish and did not want anyone creating their version of "Eleanor," unless Halicki was making profit.  You can create a lawsuit for damages, the cost of the vehicle, as if the car was completed, attorney fees, and "inter Alia." I would like you to see you build the new project with all the styling that you want. You're an amazing builder and car enthusiast.
wow!  what a crazy story! all this trouble over something that really isint anything!  wow! shelby is a legendary figure and i hope you build a great car in his name!  great video chris!  thanks for explaining. and no more eleanor!
Eleanor is a 71 mach1 with a 428 in yellow the nick cage eleanor is just a new age copy  of a shelby 🤣
And just like that I will never again support the idea of  Eleanor
Good for you man!!! And anyone else wanting to build themselves a beautiful classic fastback!  I was so baffled when this all went down, and from what I've learned and heard about Denise Halicki over the past cpl years... well... lol... I like to consider myself too kind of a person to say what I really think about her and her practices.  If her practices are a representation of her personal character, then she can copyright herself as a steaming  piece of, well, 💩💩.  Keep on buildin', brother!!
So based on the fact that youve bought another set of donors, im going to assume the original project was destroyed
I will happily give my money to CR for those retro builds, fuck those Halicki opportunists !
I appreciate the fact he supported Carol Shelby and I hope he gets his car back
It would be nice if they where forced to now reimburse you for most of the expenses you endure over this
Wait a minute... there are three sequels to the original Gone in 60 Seconds?
I can almost feel a smile from the inside knowing you where in the the right. Never shall I m3ntion that other name agian. Good on you and your hard work.
You just got a one man standing ovation. My dog is really confused!
@LegalEagle would love to see a full breakdown on both cases.
Good for you I'm so glad you where able to find peace after losing the original  build good for you
The video with the most "I think" I've ever seen 😂
Eff Eleanor. Shelby and BifB FTW.
"It all started for me around 2002" think you got the year wrong there bud. But I could be wrong
Good for you bro!
Did oscar paint his car if not please make a video of it where it's painted
4 Movies? Isn't Eleanor only on Gone in 60 seconds movie and then the 2000 remake?
2002 🤔
Good job Chris!  You have really kicked their asses.  :)
Let’s fucking go
Yeeesssss!!! Justice has prevailed!
Happy that’s finally over for everyone’s sake. Also really like your sentiments at the end. Looking forward to another body swap.
Is B really for Built? Naaah B IS FOR BRAVE!!!!!!! :) :) :)
Having an Eleanor used to be a dream as a young kid, but I have been saying on basically every comment section of an Eleanor photo that we should no longer be building, supporting, or viewing anything that benefits the LLC. They have disgraced themselves in the automotive community and should be made pariah.
Nice video, btw what are the 4 films. Anyone,,,,
I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY THAT LITIGATION WAS WON BY SHELBY! HE DESERVES IT! That happens because those people were so greedy that now our court system have spoken, I WISH we would have seen you finishing that car, it would have been 1000 times BETTER than whatever that movie car is called, because it would have been built with a lot of passion, care and RESPECT which a lot of those people DONT HAVE (which BTW I BURNED MY PURCHASED COPY OF THE MOVIE IN PROTEST). Congrats TO YOU it proves you were right from the very very beginning and I cant wait to see what will be that build you mentioned with the mustangs! Congrats bro!!!!!!!!
So proud of you man and cannot wait for a tribute car to such an amazing guy like Carrol Shelby - please make ensure this is completed and not a click bate as I know you will make a bad ass creation
That’s awesome great story. Looking forward to your new build. Love your ideas. I spent 40+ years in the Autobody business and I am living vicariously through your builds and projects. And it’s a bonus your here locally. Awesome stuff. Big fan.
I've never commented on one of your videos. That was a really informative, great great video! Tribute to Carrol Shelby here we come!
BOOOOO Elenors Suck 😂🔥
yes yes yes yor so true
Yesssss! Been waiting for this update!
God bless the Shelby family
Just call the new car a "Carroll" !
I'm so happy for you and look forward to the all the upcoming builds!
Wait...whats Oscars middle name?😀
hit the like button 3 times for good measure!!
I want him to build the same car, name it "Not Eleanor" and tribute it to Carol Shelby.
Pending how much you alter for your personal design flavor, I say you name the new build the BB500.
Chris are you gonna sue and get your money or your car back.... fuck Eleanor... do a 69-70 mustang
I’m glad that after the recent events everyone can make their own decision on whether heliki and her team are just shameless toe rags trying to steal money through intimidation.  You’ve performed faultlessly and with integrity.  Great that Shelby took them to school 😂
Love it!!  Give credit where it is due.  Shelby was one of the baddest car people the world has ever known.
Keep smashing it lads! Can’t wait to see your take on the Shelby 💪
It’s so sad. Just like so many others, ‘67 Elenor was my all time favorite car. But thanks to whatshername, I’m no longer a fan. I wonder how many others feel this way.
Crazy
Yaaaaaasssssss!!!!!
They suck, screw them. They’re just money hungry.
That's the biggest f# you in 2023 yet
Chris, you are a bad ass. I love the respect you give to Mr. Shelby and his team/family. I agree with the direction and can't wait to follow along the project. Good for you man.
Love this episode
Hey Chris.. We are with you and the guys all the way.. those guys/gals are whack.. (Yea.. I'm bringing it back.. "whack" is good of a word NOT to use in this situation.. lol)  Oh... and btw, Covid started in 2020 not 2002.. YEA YOU SAID 2002!!.. lol.. I got a chuckle.. CHEERS!!!
This is awesome to hear!!
so basically they think theyown all silver gt500s lmfao
Great story! I always wondered what happened about the mustang!
You are so damn spot on in this video!
So happy Shelby won. I wished everyone who lost money to this crook goes back and drags her to court and crushes her. I will never watch that movie again because she is such a POS. This was someone using their money to steal from small enthusiasts shops and people. There are not many people I hate more than her when I found out what was going on. I’m not a Ford guy but I do really like the early year mustangs and love the Shelby mustangs. They are true works of art. Can’t wait to see your build
Why can you just not go and pick yp the car you were busy with that denice and her team took with the "case" and finish that one the way you wnat to??
What the heck is an Eleanor
Fantastic! I'm so glad this got resolved. Can't wait to see this build come to fruition.
I love a story that has a happy ending. I can't wait to see how the build goes!!!
A name I shall not say got handed everything they deserve, b is for build this is a great video, Carroll Shelby is a legend
Cant wait to see the Shelby tribute. Never want see an Eleanor again........😎
Loving everything about this outcome!
Classic case of a bully extending their reach too far only to get slapped. Now she lost all rights all because she was greedy.
Ahhhh that just felt so good to watch… Chris! Nice work man!
Soooo, are you going to counter-sue for pain and suffering?
Great news. Does that not mean there is a chance of getting the original build back?
Love it good for you man 😉
looking forward to seeing the build when it happens.
Sounds like you’re going to get very familiar with the body/frame swaps! Time to start a side hustle? ;)
Go get that b!+(# !!!!!! She has to be to most hated women by car enthusiasts. Shame on her and her team. She is a thief.  She can't make money any other way but to steal from innocent people buy using our broken justice system. It's about time she gets stopped. Hopefully everyone she has sued counter sues her!  "In my opinion " 🙂
Bro needs to do a Collab with Shelby.  F Elenor
Anyone know where to watch the 2007 build at
Glad you finally got a chance to talk about this, and I'm super glad that these trolls got shut down.  Copyright/patent trolls suck!
The original movie that started this featured a 1971 mustang fastback yellow top with black lower section - this is the car that she claims she gained the copy right from.
What a way to start the year ... B is for Build is getting that the dream Stang done. Can't wait for it!
Sounds like Chris ran into the same people Kanye has been talking about
🔥🙌🙏
Please go after her for any attorney fees and go get your car back. I will donate to any crowd funding to support you
Awesome explanation!    "F" Eleanor
Can't wait till you get started on the tribute build. Seeing what your team can build, I know it will be amazing!
What happened to the body swapped one you already built?
3:13 proceeds to say something crazy and weird, so the build happened roughly 21 years ago, got it.... just kidding I know you meant 2020 or something like that.
What happened to the one you started ?
What 4 movies?
Will you get your original back? Or is it no longer intact?
Amazing to hear this! Hope she watches it all fizzle away
The fact that they still have exclusive rights to this "entity" after fifty years is just wack to start with. The entire ideology of IP is scientifically invalid to start with.
Hell yeah I've been waiting for this f*** Eleanor lol
Her greed tarnished her own earnings. Amazing.
Awesome, show those idiots a middle finger and build it!
Interesting
Way to bring it full circle-can't wait for the build.
Let's gooooo. I've been waiting for you to finally build a restomod for yourself to daily
What are the four movie the car is in
Money 💰 grabbing Vultures.....OH YA! That's all I see that they ,and many people are.... 💯
I have to stand and clap at the end of the video👏👏👏
Uhuuuu!!!I’ve been waiting for this for long long time 💪💪💪
I've actually been working on a script about this for months.  Collab?
fairplay
It'd be funny as hell to put that sideskirt on your own build as a F-U.
Congrats on Getting this project at least to the planning stage.
I always wondered how Toyota got away with their Celica which was basically a scaled down Mustang lookalike. I parked the Celica that I had once and when I came back there was an actual Mustang parked next to it as if the owner wanted to say "ha, I got the real thing" 🙃
That was an amazing commentary with class.  I still wish you could get your build back just because you spend a great deal of time and money trying to build it.  Denise should be publicly shamed for being such a villain.
I bet they wish they would have just done a partnership and had you pay a lic fee. They would have made more money in the end. Probably even been able to work with you to sale repops of the body panel work you where planing. Now they have no legal authority over it....dumbasses.Truth really does come out in the darkest night when a light is shined on it.
Riddle me this follow the clues, Who controls movies, courts and the news?
Milk that sponsorship Chris! Somebodys gotta pay for that legal fee 😂
Can’t wait
3:17 Covid hit in 2002? I must have been really busy in school back then
Eleanor reputation is down bad and sad honestly i don’t want Eleanor build either if they added in video games
On the plus side, like many others it was that lawsuit that got B is for Build on my radar, and then after watching once I became a lifelong fan.
I’d sue the shite out of her just out of principle.
Respect! I'm happy you shed light on this. I used to love Eleanor's now it's the opposite, can't support snakes. I'm excited for the new Shelby build!
Yup they messed with the car community.  F off and forget them and their car and that movie.
An electric Eleanor?
Even though i 100% agree with you on the build and making it a tribute to Shelby, i still would love to "kick" Halicki's *ss and try and get the mustang that she took from you back!!!! That to me would be the ultimate finger-moment.....
Well that was interesting, can't wait to see more camper builds 😁
Man! You should do whatever you want to do bro, we're just here to watch you do it. That being said I guess I was more emotionally invested in that build than I thought. I was so angry when they took it away it's hard to describe how angry that made me. So what a relief that for finally and for once the "bad guy" gets the door slammed on them!
I am surprised you can't counter sue for loss revenue to your channel but what do I know. Not a lawyer.
What are the 4 movies. I know the gone in 60 seconds movies but what are the other 2
Her husbands Eleanor was a 1973 Mustang fastback! The later movie used the Shelby and he was already dead I believe. He was not part of the Cage movie!
Plain and simple, the lady is an entitled Karen.
Shelby is a legend I respect that you are moving forward with a Shelby build and not the... other one can't wait to see it
Hell ya man. Don’t let these greedy 💩 heads stop your creativity. Keep doing you man. We all love your content. By far the best one out there for car content in my opinion. So much out of the box ideas turned to reality and documenting it
Thank you
The GOOD always WINS! Happy for this conclusion and proud of you mate!!! Looking forward to that Modern Fastback Shelby Tribute :)
Can’t wait u get your car back
Finaly !,that lying ladytroll had her ass handed to her!
So glad to hear the outcome of this story.
As soon as I heard the outcome of the court case, I posted a photo of my stock '22 GT online and named her Eleanor. But honestly, her real name is Sally.
Congrats to you !, and I'm so glad you decided to share your story...From one Oregonian to another, Thank you!
So I can copyright my name and sue everyone that has the same name?
When I came across the story of what happened with your build, well, that's how I found your channel and saw Oscars car being built. And have stuck with it ever since.  So, yeh, build what you want to build, how you want to build it and I think a lot of builders will either build an Eleanor out of spite or avoid them altogether.  Whatever you build, it will be awesome.
Where is the car now?
AWD EV Buildacorn.
These halicki guys ruined the name
Love this!!!!!!
"I BELIEVE, in my OPINION, I'm NOT a lawyer" - BIFB  new t shirt please lol
I was waiting for you to make a response video like this. I think I said it when you lost your car in the first place. You're not lying when you said this did more damage to the brand than anything. I have absolutely no desire to ever watch. Gone in 60 seconds again after what you guys dealt with. And now seeing just how much of that car was really just a knock off of Shelby's work. It's ridiculous that they were ever even able to make it this far in the first place.
Wasn’t Elenor designed by chip foose? So wouldn’t it be his property
Should have went to Costco and got the big 3 pack of 67 Fastbacks lol
love it
This might be my favorite video. I cannot wait to see this new build!
Hell. Yes. 💪
Phoque those guys. Money grabbing pests.
Just asking but how are there four movies that include and Eleanor??? What are they? I know three, but whats the fourth`?
When you complete your body swap on your redemption build you need a register plate that says "Elea no"
Amazing news in the new body swap! Can't wait to watch you guys get going!
Good for you man,give credit where it is due,that woman shud be forced to repay everyone!I get it she made bad taste in ur mouth over her shit,I don't blame u,I hope no one ever builds one like hers
Good for you and cant wait for your Shelby build.....P.S. FY Denice Halicki!
Good diss
I wanna know, what 4 movies. I know GI60 in 1974 and 2000. What are the other 2.
In my opinion this was a great explanation Chris 😁😂
Do you have a path for a lawsuit for the seizure of your car? Seems totally ILLEGAL!
Carol Shelby was also instrumental in the Dodge Viper. Maybe you need to do a Viper build to honor his legacy 😘
Finaly.  Been wating for you to be able to do this since the incedent.
*It was long overdue, but they finally got what was coming. They abused their power over their copyrights and also destroyed their image. Imagine if F&F or BTTF Delorean did this to their fans.*
I believe this is a win for all car culture. It sets a precedent for copyrights in general.
They are that bad at their job.
This is going to be EPIC! Cannot wait to see what you do - right on, a tribute to Carroll Shelby is way more thoughtful and the right thing to do.
In my opinion, that was an epic tirade full of merit. Love seeing wins for the people. Congrats
Doing the Lord's work.
"A GOTDAM AMURICAN HERO!!!" lol! love that. You sounded like Red Foreman or someone, channel you inner proud grumpy old white man.
Your lawyer must like the show "The Good wife."  in my opinion.
Thanks Chris. Been waiting for an update from you.
what are the 4 movies?  the 74 original  the 2000 remake what's the other 2?
Booo
Great video! I can’t wait to see the new idea finished
Way to handle this like a pro
I just don't see the appeal of the Eleanor cars, what they did just ruins the lines of the GT500. And having seen your '67 project in person, it is WAY cooler than an Eleanor.
I watched those first videos of the Eleanor build and in the back of my head I was thinking that it wasn't going to end well, Just for the fact you were calling it an Eleanor. I had seen what they were doing to the musicians playing popular songs or just a couple of notes of a copy righted song and getting slapped hard for infringment. Making them take down all their content and paying royalties and getting hit with those cease and desisted orders. Good luck on your new build and tell Oscar to keep grinding..!!
Good for you Chris. Screw that b*tch and I'm glad the Justice system actually got something right this time, sad it happened too late! I agree with you, Shelby is the man and should be recognized for his work that chip just modified as you said. Can't wait for the build!
what were the other 2 movies that had an Eleanor mustang?
I'm waiting to see this build and thank you for going with a Shelby car not that knock off
It’s a big part of what’s wrong with this country right now. Big companies will sue a smaller company just knowing that company can’t afford the legal fees. It’s a bummer
I though Foose designed this rig!!
Denise = Karen
Love the attitude and response. Wish you didnt have to go through this in the first place just to have something that you wanted to build for yourself. Excited to see the new project come to life though and raise that giant middle finger to Denise!
you Sir are a genius.
Excellent. Like many of your fans, I to have often wondered about the story behind the story of your loss so thanks for filling in so many of the gaps. Can't wait to see whatever comes next out of that stange, warped, magnificent brain of yours.
Again: you're awesome
So glad you beat this case I was pissed at her team for that
Dude!!! I havent heard good news like that in a long time!! GG brudda!!
GET YOUR BUILD BACk
Honestly I've seen many, many films with a Ford Mustang but prior to you pointing out the differences, I could not tell you then difference between a Shelby Mustang and the Eleanor Mustang. And quite honestly Halicki being able to get away with this for so long is crazy because the basis for the Eleanor build/character is from a Shelby Mustang. Idk how the courts sided with her for so long over this. It's ridiculous.
so where or what happened to the original build car? they took it and scrapped it or something?
3:16 didn’t realize covid was 21 years ago 😂
Awesome decision!
Americans are so sue-happy. Guess it all stems from that broken legal system which allows it
These people are on the level of patent trolls. They're incapable of earning a living through their own abilities so they just go around leeching off of actual people like you. If a society that's actually fair they wouldn't be able to get away with and would actually face real punishment. They should face charges of perjury and be sued by everyone they've ever taken money from, that's the fair outcome.
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🤌🤌🤌
I think people oughta build Honda civics, and minivans and call them Eleanor.....if it's your unicorn it's your unicorn. Build what you want. If you build anything, I respect it more than a new Corvette. Cannot buy respect.....no offense Corvette people....but you know what I mean
I used to be so into the movies and the lore surrounding the car, but after this mess I want nothing to do with the name, the movies, or anything associated with it. I was at a car show last year that had a replica on display and it attracted a lot of negativity, so I know I’m not alone 😓
What a SAGA. This was such a bummer when it happened. Glad you're on the other side with a smile on your face!
Amazing news for you guys and super hyped for when this build happens. Based on this court verdict, can you get the mustang they took back? That seems like a class action suit where people's property was seized or they paid money
If you take out the e in Eleonora and make it L-A-nor isn't anything they can do about it
I stopped subscribing to your channel after the LS swapped Hurican test drive at the track when Kyles BMW beat it. Not a fan of exotics in the first place, & near 1000 HP is no good if not not applicable. HOWEVER, checked out the channel again like 3 days ago, and was delighted to see an update on the yacht and now the Mustang conversion legal situation!  Question where is it, do you get it back?
Good! I’m glad you are not building another Eleanor. I’m excited to see the tribute vehicle for Carol Shelby!
Lawyers makes greed look bad  ..
Love all your body swaps you've done. I can't wait to see you do this one to.
build that car now put everything else on hold for your fans roll bar and side exhaust in British racing green
Hell yeah Carol ShelB is for Build restomod car. Eleanonor can be forgotten now
let alone, foose designed the car in the new movie. the car she would have had rights over would have been the yellow 73 mach1 look. this entire thing was ridiculous from the start.
I’ve always wondered what actually happened to the half finished mustang chassis after it was taken. I can’t imagine they finished it.
I'm glad you talked about this but what I was really hoping to hear is that you got your stolen property back and then proceeded to teabag Halicky until she apologized to everyone she screwed over.
Good comments for the algorithm!
Congratulations on getting the monkey off your back.
I'm glad you are going to focus the build / design where it always belonged, on Shelby.
Chris My wife, an attorney who did some IP work before moving over to insurance for a career boost, and is not really into cars (but can appreciate them) cried happy tears for you as we watched the video, and shouted several expletives in your favor.  Congrats buddy!
2002 after covid huh? 😆
I hope you can get the old car back if that’s possible
"See You Next Tuesday" Denise
Way to go!!   Can't wait to see the next mustang build!  A+ content.
What a shame. I am glad the C. Shelby and his team won. I believe she ruined the Eleanor name. IMHO Eleanor wouldn’t existed without the Ford and Shelby design. Totally agree with you Chris. Also, I don’t think any car lover is ever going to look at Eleanor brand the same. IMHO, they should have thought this through but I guess this is what happens when greed got the best of them. I really liked the movie and the Eleanor car too. After seeing what they put the Shelby team and you through, I have zero interest in the movie and the car unless it’s a GT500 by Carol Shelby 😏
Out of interest (I am not in the USA) do you have any recourse to get your property and monies spent back?
Like many others before me have commented, I have been waiting for awhile to hear from you to about that awesome build that was “stolen” from you. I’m incredibly happy that it has now ended the way it has and that you won’t be supporting Halicki in the way of building another Eleanor. I really enjoy watching your builds!!
Great Video, well done! I'm behind you 100%.....
GO Shelby
OH Man you couldn't of Said About Carol Shelby better I'm in the UK and my First American car my Dream car was a fast Back Shelby Mustang Shame i Only Have Pics  that Prove i owned one and drive it in Fact I used to Road Race  Well Done man and I hope you get to make your Dream Car with out all the Problems over what it is and who Owes it
W plan!
Even though Eleanor car from the movie is quiet good looking, Halickis actions/threats/lawsuits and disgusting behavior ruined it almost completely. Totally agree with Chris! Props to the Legend, shame to miserable, selfish halicki
Absolutely awesome! And I expect to never see the name Eleanor again!
Always the bigger person, love the content and everything BIFB does!
Might be unpopular here but: Elenor is recognizable no? At least the Gone in 60 seconds one. It a strange ruling because recognizing a car really depends on how much you know about it. My SO wouldn't see the difference between elenor and a regular GT500 so this goes in the spirit of what they wrote here. But still. If someone where to make an exact replica of it, then one with minimal experience (having whatched movies) could recognize it. Very weird decision. It feels like it was writen by a non car person... "Every mustang looks the same so it's not a character" is a weird position... Good for you though!
thank you!!!!!!! we have been waiting for as much of your side of the story as the lawyers would allow, and look forward to the build!
imo the eleanor looked ugly af anyway.
I used to love the Eleanor design which turned out to be and accentuated GT500 so when I first heard you were building the tribute car nicknamed 'Eleanor' I was very excited but the fact these idiots sent you a cease and desist made me hate them and the vehicle even more. The fact that we are coming. We have now come full circle and I love the fact that you're going to build one again we all support you giving Eleanor and their team a big FU is going to be a sweet redemption 😊😉👍
Especially since the most popular one is the Shelby one which means her team owes Shelby now 😂🤣🤣
Fully support you on this!!! Can’t wait to see you build your version of a Shelby and a nods to a god damn American hero!!!
I'm happy that you are building a Caroll Shelby Tribute build instead of giving that Woman a chance with another Eleanor build.
Got remember every time y'all see 1 of her "creations" just down vote it. We don't need her stuff in car community.
I've watched since 2020 when I saw Donut post about your first lawsuit. Great breakdown of what happened. Awesome to follow your dreams, see your haters fall while you soar to success! Good luck through '23!
Well said Chris!  Build your dreams as you always had.  Couldn't agree more on the decision to give Shelby his due...all the best to you and your team.
So awesome 👏🏻
Awesome video… 100 percent support you on ditching Elinor name.    Thanks for shaming them, they well deserve it
She married her cousin. Nuff said.
👏👏👏👏
Just the same, it seems to me that she should compensate you for the investment you had in your build, at the time.
This is great to hear Chris it was a hard pill to swallow losing the original build, but you have grown and learned a lot since then an I'm sure you guys will make  an amazing car this time round 👍 looking forward to seeing this build for sure.
Jeez. I'm glad something that makes sense _(that is this big)_ won in court again.
So cant wait for the build  the S550 platform is a awesome daily i might be biased as i own one the first try to the Eleanor build is what got me hooked on B is for Build so stoked to see it as a Shelby.
You should name your creation Beleonor.... :D
Love it. Can’t wait.
Wow man thank you for all the information!!
I knew when you didn’t reply we’d be getting a video thanks Chris!
Awesome. I agree, screw building a tribute car to an a$$hole, do it for a real American.
They knew oscar`s middle name dammn nobody knows my midle name other thatn my parents and my wife not even my kids know my midle name
RESPECT!! Bravo!
Greedy Murica
Wait, it’s been in 4 movies?! Lmao who knew…
Good on you!
People are ridiculous just because you put a couple body parts and little intricate shit on a mustang they swear they own the damn car rights 😂 like what ? Sounds like they’re just hungry for money.
Ms. Eleanor Mustang, meet Ms. Barbara Streisand. There's an effect you may not be aware of.
Someone needs to make Elenor decals so everyone can run them on their plane jane whatever cars. Water their brand down to nothing.
That’s awesome.  I got chills when you said you are building your daily driver.  Congratulations
FUCK YES MATE!!!! CSFTW!!
is your original build crushed? or can you get it back? (1300 comments, maybe you answered already XD)
This video made me sooooooo happy!
Hell yeah!!!!!
God bless you, keep the hard work. You inspire us all over the world.
That’s a 1st class response Chris! Sorry your attorneys got rich over some bullying, but that’s no hill for a stepper!
Hopefully 🔥🔥
Score one for the good guys!
Been waiting for this
Quite possibly the most hated woman in car culture!  I hate Eleanor now!  Just as crazy as patent trolls.
Now if they fix Ferrari in will be ON.
Well said
Build another one and tell them to fuck off.
A look into the light "Yes yes yes "
The new car will look fantastic and i hope you can show your car (and the wide body ) design to the shelby company  for there take on it
21:23 No truer words have ever been spoken!!!! On a side note, I heard about the news of your car being taken away and that caused me to seek out your channel and watch it. I've been a fan and subscriber ever since, so there is that upside! 🙂
you are a Legend!!
Yes!
Congrats Chris👍can you now get the original build, the court of law Eleanor back?
“ I’m 10 k in lawyer fees  , now a word from our sponsors”    I’ve never been so happy to hear a commercial product placement
It's too bad you went thru all that, but I look forward to seeing that dream of your come true.
Eleanor is a beautiful car, but its reputation has been tarnished to the point that it's near worthless.  I feel for the customers that had purchased the Eleanor's from Halicki's team.  They now have a beautiful car that is worth so much less because of Halicki's actions.  Mr. Shelby is a genius of a man, and his legacy is flawless.
Fuck her now you need to sue her back just because and get all you're shit back counter sue lol
Wait wait so my fiancés Saturn aura she named Elenor should have been a target of the loonatic halicky flicky team well she could have had the piece of crap
Love your stance on this.
While Denise is not a popular person these days, her husband H.B Halicky was the real hero of gone in sixty seconds. The 1973 Mach one that was originally used as Eleanor was a movie that inspired my dads 40 year locksmith career. He died tragically while attempting to make a sequel to that movie and I think it sucks that Denise has become embittered about the whole business to try to extort custom car builders from using the name and likeness of the more recent car. I still love the look of Eleanor as Steve modernized the gt500 so we’ll for the time(2001). Proven by the fact that it’s still a stunner 20 ish years later. I just wish Denise could have been willing to work with people more. She has inadvertently destroyed the value of a brand she worked so hard to protect. It’s sad. I’m very excited for this build Chris. I loved the original and had planned to do one myself. It had the makings of being your most complete creation since the evora in my opinion. Looking forward to it.
Big fan! Watch every video. One question, what happened to your Elenor project? Was it crushed?
Hell, get the car back. If you can't, burn down the garage it's in
In the end the good people truly does win. It sucks you lost the legal fees but at least you dont have that stupid copyright hanging over your head now.
Didn’t they take your old one? If so, can you not get that one back? Can’t wait for this build!
now re-release your mustang build videos on youtube😀😃😀😃😀😃
Well said
All this sours the name of Eleanor,you cannot own a name,has this woman taken all the woman called Eleanor to court, No  because it wouldn’t stand they would laugh you out of court,if any one should own the name Eleanor Carol Shelby should own the rights to the said name
Yes : go get em Chris, and very interesting informative Episode
The first "Eleanor" was a bone stock yellow 1973 Mustang Mach 1 with a safety cage for the stunts. The intent was to be a bone stock yellow Mustang. I don't think the law would allow anyone to place a name on a car built in mass and then sue anyone else who does the same.
Chris, Thanks for letting us know the whole story. What are the 4 movies with elenore? I have seen 2 (gone in 60 sec with the 73 and the nick cage one.) Also I believe Ford did the side exit exhaust long before she did. Looking forward to the Carol Shelby tribute build!
Honest question - which movies are we talking about? Only Eleanor I know about is from Gone in 60 seconds.
3:12  "it all started 2002"   That can't be right? Did you mean 2020?
I wondered if you would return to this after I saw an Article on the lawsuit.
I was hoping you'd answer why you couldn't get the Mustang they took back.
After all that hassle, I wouldn't touch anything Eleanor related with a ten foot pole. Just saying.
Toby himself was a pretty cool guy, .. if he has blood family that still lives, they should be filing a billion dollar legal action against Toby's widow for defamation and destruction of his positive image. He was creative, he was ambitious, he helped enthusiastic young people get a foot into the film biz when the big guys slammed doors.
Let's go..
FIGHT ASSHOLES WHO DO THIS.... they KNOW they would loose in court and the frivolious slap lawsuits are designed as an intimidation play.
👊
Shelby was known to sue tons of people when he was alive and the company bearing his name is still incredibly litigious. This is one rich company suing another so they can probably just sell Shelby branded Eleanors.
A really great video to make.  Really well thought out and explained.  Will be supporting whatever you build.
Still Disgusted. It's a crying shame, we probably won't ever get to see one as good..
But what is happening to the cars that they took for “ copyright “ infringement now that Elenor is no longer copyrighted ?
Now you need play the reverse uno card and hit them with a slap suit for your legal costs and loss of earnings from you build series as after all the you tube build series is your business source of income, cause with the new ruling what they did is illegal and bordering on black mail?
3:13 you say “2002?” I’m guessing that u didn’t mean to say that lol all good just making sure it was an accident, love you channel and all that u guys do here!❤❤❤
I have been building my 67 fastback for 5 years and everyone i know asked if i was building that car i said never . you nailed it bro shelby all the way he is the real man behind the car not them
Lets go! Lets Build!
Thank you
Which 4 movies, i know the 2 different gone in 60 seconds what's the other 2?
Not the best day for greedy Halicki 😂
Yes! The abuse and over-reach by Halicki has made me so angry, I'm super happy to see it come to an end!
That was interesting
Thanks for the clarification on this story. I hate Court warrior Bullies too. I'm glad it turned out this way in the end.
Will definitely watch the Shelby tribute build 🤓❤️
A justice has been served. Can’t wait to see it
You were always free to build it just call it Shelby and not Eleanor
Hey, so this video earned you a sub. I've been lurking behind this story line since it broke, and I've never really watched your channel, but I watch lots of others that are in the genre. Puddin's fab shop, Finnegan's garage, Newbern, all the Cleeterverse... I think you handled this really well. This video did a good job of describing your side, without just absolutely shitting on her like it could have. I've subbed, and I'm excited to see the new vision of this build. Good on you for handling things this way, and giving credit where credit is due...
New drinking game: Have a shot every time Chris says "In my opinion" 🤣......... Now I need an ambulance!
Please go after the scum and get your car back???? Terry UK
This Halicki person can now officially go f...  right off. Greed karma is a "beach".
So you don't have any legal recourse to sue Halicki? You lost ad revenue and physical assets due to unlawful seizure, no?
I honestly wanted you to be able to finish your build but after hearing this I agree 100% and am in love with the idea of a tribute build!! Love you videos crazy they came after the black mustang. Glad you made this video
Wonderful outcome!  👍🏼👍🏼
I know I always trash talk Eleanor’s now in comments
The name Shelby has been so much to the car community. 🏆
Well put, no reason to inflate their ego any more. Time to focus on better hero cars and people.
Such a good take. Thanks for the update. As I type this I am looking at a poster of 1964 Cobra Daytona that hangs over my monitor, in the corner it says"Born in the USA"
I'm looking forward to the Mustang build!
I was looking forward to hearing what you lost besides just the car. What were you out in total? Not just lawyer fees, but also revenue from your vids that you had to remove.
And the Shelby drop....the visual difference of that suspension drop really changes the Mustang into the gt350/500.
JFC
This is crazy...based on the movie itself, I was under the impression that "Eleanor " was a term for the "'girl' that got away". Not a specific brand/model of car. It just so happens that movie character's "Eleanor" was a freaking mustang. It really sucks you are having to deal with this ridiculous nonsense.
So where is the the physical car now?
As Much as I dislike Donald Trump, it was Trump appointed Judges that revamped the 9th Circus.  They were a clown show for 30 years before that.
You do Carroll a disservice by not mentioning Carroll Shelby chili.
Glad that this came full circle and that a video was done about it!
Shelby also helped the british car industry, hence the "AC" Cobra, he bought the AC Ace and put in the Ford 289 V8 & then the Carrol Shelby AC Cobra was born
Does this mean you can reupload the videos?
I was happy to hear the "Eleanor" copywrite go away.  OH what will Halicki do now for income, like I really give a shit about her and her goons.  Build a tribute to Shelby, hell yes.  Celebrate the real man and his car.  So now I have to ask,  Is it worth going after them for your money and car back now that their copywrite has been found to be a non-qualifier.  I'm sure she would be bankrupt is the matter of a week.
Chris, you are a class act
Love that due justice was finally served 🙌  and can wait for that series I know it will be epic like the rest
The CR "Felonor©️," dibs, also uses the mirrors from the Eleanor.  Basically off the shelf parts though so no argument there.  That Eleanor hood is trash anyway.
You're in America.... meaning everyone hits you with a lawsuit for anything the salty idiots 🙄😂
The amount of hate mail that helicki got from this theft of your car must be incredible.   Looking forward to that build, it should be called, the redemption build.
very proud of you dude! that is the way to live and dream!
We’ll damn
FTB
So he won in court ? Why can't he get his car back then?
Purely AWESOMENESS Brother!! GET IT!!!
So keen for this build to come back, the body swap that is, really happy you’re focusing on Shelby.
lol flawless transition into the sponsor ad
Denise absolutely tarnished the brand and movie for me. What a boneheaded move on their part.
Sounds like that's how they make there money by taking every one to court 🤔
That's will be a great build , am sure and i cant wait to see it :) Keep going guys - making thing that live in your Dreams - make them Reality. :)
Did you get your stuff back? Is it possible to get your expenses back?
Denice and crew are really crazy people,Eleanor is just a modified GT500.
its like halicki thinks that she owns every gt500
Absolute badass video, THANK YOU!!  You went through some shit and I’m glad you stick with it.  Came out clean on the other side, that’s a big win!!
"Carroll Shelby is a God damn American hero"! Love it
Imagine these smucks copyright everything.
The 9th circuit is single-handedly responsible for more government overreach than the fucking CIA.  The 9th circuit is the epitome of corruption.
But what happened to the car that was taken from you? Where is it now? We can't know that?
chris i hope you have memorized Oscar's middle name by now LOL!  cant wait for the new mustang build! f'em!
#fuckeleanor
Haha I was totally thinking about Lightning McQueen
Any chance of getting the car/money back? 😉
Omaze had a Elenor giveaway after yours got seized. The auto scene was pissed, I bet the wish they hadn't gone near that one.
YES, this makes me happy 🎉😂😅
You should get your car back from her just to tell her to F*** off, then burn the Eleanor stuff and send her the footage of it.
I am absolutely on your side!!!!!
Great job on the video.
HB "Toby" Halicki was one heck of a guy Mrs. Halicki on the other hand (since Toby's death) is a money hungry Karen. You know what I think about Karen's 🖕  Oh & they're also little 💩's or big ones depends on their build 😂🤣 Can't wait to watch your next build 👍👍
The licensees should get their money back!
Perfectly said.  Hopefully you start this build soon. It would be awesome if Carrol signed it when you are finished.
love the plan going forward, perfect
Nice tribute plans and an even nicer middle finger to that bish! You go and can't wait, even if it takes a month, a year or a decade for you to finish it.
YESSSSS!!! Super glad to hear your take on the frankly mad proceedings that went on with you. But Chris, for the love of God, call your new Mustang bodyswap THE PHOENIX :D
so you get the car back....right? ...RIGHT?!?!?!?!?
Fucking AWESOME.
It's "REH-si-tay-shun", not "REE-si-tay-shun". But that's beside the point. Glad to hear this news!
@3:13 you accidentally said 2002, fyi.
Sheby gave a proud middle finger to 'Eleanor' and this copyright BS, love to see this after all that happened...
Amen brother ❤
Eliwho?
16:10 Except Disney did do something like this, claiming Lightning McQueen is a Subaru BRZ when the original Cars film came out 6 YEARS before the BRZ or any of its siblings existed. They came after someone who was using their Lightning McQueen “replica” to raise money for charities at events, if I recall correctly. This happened relatively recently, as well.
imagine this right, someone wears the same clothes like you, the full outfit... so you sue them. Some people really do be reaching out waaaaaay to far
Carroll Shelby finally took down  “Mustang Karen”… This good news and has always been baffling to me how they could copyright and modded mustang
In an alternative reality,  Disney: Going after red cars Ferrari: You dare challenge me mortal?
Carroll Shelby was also VERY litigious too, though. That part is disappointing for me.
What are the 4 Elenor movies?
Done with tact, and class my dude. Screw the halicki party. Screw the movies. Build a badass tribute car to Carroll Shelby!
I love this. I watched the original build go sideways and I was horrified. I loved the movie the car was in but really do not know that I could ever watch it again knowing how nasty and underhanded the creators were. Seriously? Move some lights, add a side skirt and call it yours? Build a Shelby tribute and we will all watch with bated breath.
Awesome! I think you are doing the right thing ,support the right people that were in this for the right reasons. I think its great that you are redoing the mustang concept you started.
Watching this just got me so excited. We get to see this build happen again with a different idol as inspiration to your build. I’m just blown away with how this has happened to you and you deserve to have that Mustang you dreamed of. Keep doing what your doing, I’ll always support your channel and in my opinion your channel is very unique compared to all the other car yt channels. 😊🎉
DAAAAANGGGGG…. What a video! And topped it off with that future build. “In my opinion”.. ur a badass Chris!!
Awesome!  Can’t wait to see the build and they can suck it!
Well Done!!!  You are a real Badass Dude and I can't wait to see your Shelby Tribute car!
I have been waiting for this video. Can’t wait to see the new Mustang build.
'it all started in 2002' bisforbuild been around longer than youtube. The real og's 😂
"...Is a god damn American hero... " 😆 Love this channel.
Steve Stanford designed movie car and Chip Foose built them.
So the eleanor is a body kit for a car thats someone elses but they called it their own car and had a tantrum. Imagine every aftermarket manufacturer for brz’s did this for that car and we KNOW how many kits there are for that car… it would be a joke!
Wtf is even Elanor ,first time hearong about it
now that sounds awesome can't wait to see we got planned for that Mustang,and it still sucks that you had to go through all that lawsuits stuff.
I just named all my vehicles ELEANOR. Ha ha. Let them come get me. None are Mustangs...I had a 1979...
B is for BOOYA!!!
Great job breaking it down.
3:13 COVID19 in 2002 confirmed?
I'm really surprised that lady had much power over the name. But it's also ironic Shelby sued for wanting to copy a car when they have sued factory five 3 times over there kit cars(and Shelby lost)
Can you build a Pinto with an "E" Paint job and body kit, but name it Denise?
Sounds like a damn fine idea! For me, I would NEVER again mention her name, this situation or the name of that car on this channel! That being said, this never should have happened! The original was a 71 and IMHO one of the worst looking Mustangs produced. Lets just forget 74-78 cause they never happened! The only caveat is the 71-73 Convertibles, those are acceptable.
build one that dont run just to spite her.
So stoked to see this build again n I can honestly say she screwed herself instead of working with people she went against them n now her n her husband's name is tarnished left nothing but a sour taste in people's mouth about them they could've made so much money n so many cars its not funny now she's lost all what she thought she had
I like watching your videos, I like to see the small man do big things, even with mistakes. "We are human". But most of all I love the fact you get to build your dream car, and screw them other guys.
I’d recreate the bullet mustang
Woohoo 🎉 I was so bummed when you stopped building the car so glad it’s happening again
Takeaway - there are 4 movies?! I'm aware of the 70s movie where its a mustang mach2, and the Cage/Jolie remake. Were the other 2 direct to DVD or something?
But, what is a woman?
Can't wait to see it 🔥 #FuckEleanor
Quit calling the cars Eleanor and call them what the cars are
Can't wait to see this build!
hoorah ✊🏾
Yeah buddy !! ♡
Yessssssir!!! This is awesome!
Congrats on a passive victory
F Eleanor - Go Shelby!!
Good shit on Shelby for going after them. What they did to you is just wrong dude. Im glad they threw them in the Fxxxing hole!!
A huge W for Chris and the team, Bravo 👏
Only 10k? Jeez...that's NOTHING.
I had to pull most of my videos after receiving the same email to remove all co rent but thanks to this I have been able to repost all my videos of our builds
Atta boy!
What is iscars midle name , I don't know 😂😂, love your videos very much ❤️💪🔥
I won’t even watch that movie anymore.
LETS GOOOOO
Lets gooo!
Well said Chris!  They’re just greedy AF and you can do better!  Also, hats off to you for giving Shelby such high props!🫡
Is there any legal way to get your build back from them?
Denice Shakarian Halicki disliked this video
It's funny how people can be doing so well in life and then they just keep wanting more and more and it's never enough so they start going after what they probably consider the little guys, honestly I think having thousands of people building replica cars from your movie is a verry good thing and just brings more attention to the movie and everyone involved. The Eleanor car was always my favorite movie car and like pretty much everyone who has seen the movie I always wanted one. Not anymore I wouldn't want to do anything that could help bring any attention to anything she's involved in.
Awesome Chris. I love your sense of humor about this whole thing.
An EMPHATIC “PEACE” at the end there.  Good on ya.  Knowing that you were right the whole time and they got what was coming to them has to feel absolutely freaking fantastic!!!!!  #CarrollShelby
Herbie, the VW beetle could be copyrighted, it is the same car in all movies, but you are right Eleanor changes every time.
It's called LAWFARE.  Suing people into submission. We definitely need tort reform. BAR association stands for British accreditation registry.  Why does British have anything to do with our court system.  It's completely corrupt.
Can't Waite for rhe new build. Thank you for updating us on what the hell happened with the ceas and desist.
Excellent, so now the question is: where is your car? they just took it? they wont give it back?
Damn proud that you are going to do this again. Looking forward to this build!!!
Great fantastic, good on you and look forward to see how the B is in this Build whoop whoop 🙌
Scumbags......
TWO THOUSAND AND 2!!! Come on Chris. LMFCO
Ok so can he sue to get his stuff back or no??
what I find funny is the original  ellonor  was a yellow mark 1 mustang in the original  movie its so funny how the remake movie has so much fuss
What 4 films did Eleanor appear in? I’m only aware of GI60S 1974 and 2000.
🖕 Halicki period.
This is awesome, man!  I’m so happy it’s all come back around again.
I know about the two Gone in Sixty Seconds movies, but what are the other two movies?
2002?
Denice sounds a lot like a Karen
All  ya had to do was say nothing and just remove the name Eleanor from all your stuff and give it a diff name and ya wouldn't have lost anything I'm sure I said this already or something close to it
Good on you!   B is for Build and Thomas Shelby fuck that whoever she was (not going to even say her name)……
Time to get the 'original' back?
I personally don't consider the Elleanor a great looking car. The factory version and shelby version looks better in my opinion.
Awesome watch man, great to see the explanation of everything. Great to see your still going to build the car you want man. Hats off for standing your ground man 👍Shelby forever man
Agree
Inter alia - among other things
Worst part is the copyright she did own was for the old movie, not the one with the silver gt500 featuring Nicolas Cage! It's insanity how people lost against her for so long. It was originally the Yellow one she owned rights to due to her husband. Its properly bonkers really is.
Thank you for the shoutout!  We pride ourselves on building these epic licensed Shelbys. Come visit us in Dallas, TX 📍
YEAH! Finally! I can’t wait to see the Carol Shelby tribute happen. I truly believe that all of the “B” is for build family knows the type of individuals that you and your team are and you’ve definitely raised the bar for the rest of the YouTube community in being one of the classiest individuals by speaking your truth about who, what and why about the case of your mustang. Now you’re ready to move on to the next chapter of your awesome creativity and innovation journey with integrity. Here’s to many more years of you and your team continuing the great content that everyone loves and is so looking forward to each episode you create. Thank you.
Looking forward for you Carol Shelby GT500 daily driver build! :-)   Then, she who shall not be named, can enjoy the (probably) counter sues..... I'm hopeful!
2002 was a wild year.
Can you get your car back
Eleanor LLC basically just exists to profit off of a movie car, and sue when they aren't getting a profit. Its like branding the time machine Delorean fron Back to the Future, and then expecting everyone to pay you royalties or get sued if you put a "flux capacitor" in your Delorean.
This is like a bicycle company called specialized was sueing anyone using epic. Hahaha. Crazy story this was.
Love how you detailed Shelby GT 500 and Eleanor story.  Your Sena car is an awesome creation and your fans are looking forward to your next builds.
To stretch a fabrats saying to its breaking point 🤣 you'll have done it thrice so it'll be REAL nice.  3rd time is a charm, I'm super looking forward to this one! Still a bummer you're out the first car and all the legal fees, probably a valuable lesson about licensing stuff and dealing with white collar crooks. Oh man, the next one is gonna be epic.
I always wondered where Foose was in all of this since the Eleanor from the Nic Cage movie is a Foose Design.
It's like sueing someone for having the same name 😂😂😂 so stupid 😂
😭😭😭🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I heard of this frivolous lawsuit way before knowing your channel, that's how bad that money grab went.  I just cannot believe that some people can use the US court system in that way.  That says a lot in how crooks can use the judicial system to rip off honest folks.  Ain't the justice system supposed to protect citizens?  This is just crazy...
Remember ELEANOR is based on another car it's called a Mustang the fact 5hat they got a copy rite is a joke
Sounds like Sinister Diesel a while back when they thought they owned any parts painted blue 😂😂 like i always say, people are sue happy and 90% of lawyers are jokes!
Would like to see remakes of the 1973 Mach 1 Mustang from the Original Halicki Gone in 60 seconds flick.
this mf is really gonna make us watch another mustang build. And i am sure as hell gonna enjoy it! 🤣 lets go!
What happened to the car you built? Is it still around? Can you reclaim it?if so will you reclaim it and rebuild it as a gt 500?after all it should come back to you the rightful owner .
Amen to that.
If it wasn't for copyright you could have used lily Allen's song fuck you in the background of this video.... May be a tad too provocative for your lawyer...🤣🤣
Karma Bro!
Chris, you rock.  I learned something today, like everyday, but the way you played this out and showed how we all should want a shelby car and not a E movie car was perfection.  I hope this goes viral and your research pays off and everyone follows suit and builds their own Shelby replica, and not an E replica.  It's just sad that someone who really had nothing to do with the gray E car can tarnish the name so badly.  I hope this is a lesson, and furthermore I wish the xx family very bad fortune.
The whole time of me personally knowing Elenor I just assumed it was a gt500 with a grey paint job and two black racing strips
Yes yes yes
Wow, so can you report the car they took stolen? 😳 Ah, they probably crushed it anyway. Assholes!  Lol
This is all great news, and I'm excited to see the redirected build when it comes along! Whether you do anything with it or not, did you get your car back that Halicki took?
Very interesting video! Some very interesting information, and I can’t wait for the new mustang conversion! To be honest, the first conversion I only followed because of the s550 chassis and classic body swap, just because I would like to do something like that in the future. I didn’t care about the name. That’s why I was also a great fan of the mustang for Oscar (I would have painted it though), but it was really nice inspiration! So I can’t wait to see the new s550/1967 body swap!💪🏼

I am interested in watching the build of that black 2006 Mustang, but I don't see a playlist for it. Any chance you might be persuaded to put one together?
This build is why people throw the word tribute in front of their projects now. They should give that car back ASAP and apologize. They never made the car famous Nick Cage did. It could’ve been any other Mustang and it still would’ve been famous
love it dude :) cant wait to se this build. carrol shelby wuld be praud :D
Every car in gone in 60 seconds had a name 🤦‍♂️
So basically you could have taken any mustang and added a few body mods and then painted it black and grey and they would have claimed it was their property. The only Gone in 60 movie that was good was the Nicholas Cage version. The rest sucked and I never even finished them because they weren’t done well at all. This also shows how the court systems are designed to make people very rich and it’s not either one of the parties involved in the case rather than the city/county, judges, lawyers and law firms. If I were to sue someone i don’t believe the lawyer should have any right to the money from the law suit as well as not being allowed to charge hundreds, thousands or hundreds of thousands dollars an hour. A lot of life’s are absolutely ruined that way.
I love what you said in the end. Fuck Eleanor. A Shelby inspired car is waaaaay cooler imo.
Well, now we know another project that'll get started before the boat build is completed.
Nice plan I’m on board to watch 🎉. To hell with Eleanor
2002 ?
But where is your car
Can someone correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t chip foose design and build the 1967 Eleanor for a 2001 film on the request of a Hollywood studio?
" GET YOUR BUILD BACK '
To Sue or not to sue? That is the question. Get them Chris
The weirdest thing about the claim is that Halicki was involved in the 1974 film, starring a Mach 1 NOT the GT500 from the 2000 Nicholas Cage movie. Halicki had NOTHING to do with that movie. The ONLY similarity is the name Eleanor and the fact that it was a Mustang, whose IP is owned by Ford
This video has really shown your mettle, your focus and your loyalties. Keep doing what you are doing and making use 'followers' happy with your skills (Oscar and Kyle too).
The "Eleanor" isn't even a GT500. I personally think the Eleanor Mustang is ugly as sin (including the side-pipes, hood bulge, and the stupid relocation of the running lights into the headlight bucket). I cringe whenever I see a picture of one.  The center-grill lights were only used on the early 67 Shelby's. California had laws at the time regarding the distance between headlights, so Shelby relocated them to the outside corners. The front valance is indeed inspired by the 1965 R-Model GT350, and was done to improve cooling.  I'm glad that a) the asshats got their comeuppance, and b) you're not going to resurrect your Eleanor project.
Ima build one and name it after the Lady. Call it’s the Denice Halicki is a terrible person that could suck start a power stroke.  Kinda long but factual.
Sounds like a power hungry woman with an axe to grind for whatever reason. My guess is sales of the rights to build replicas probably weren't doing that well and then you make a build using the "likeness" which undermines their already failing sales.
LETS GO
COVID didn’t hit in 2002 homie. Heh you mean 2022?
Awesome video Chris. You are on point, Shelby is a true American Hero. Build a" B is for Build Shelby" and enjoy it. Love your channel.
That bi*ch is Armenian descent. Those people are worse than the Gypsy's. They are involved in just about every illegal activity there is, and it's all about the money. Denice Shakarian may not be a direct part of the Armenian mafia but I but I bet she still looks, thinks and act's the same and probably used their shady lawyers which is why they were so rude. Her net worth is only 500K which means she's scrapping for anything she can get these days.
Should sue for loss of revenue and get the car back (if it's still around)
This is a classic story about greed and someone who tried to get rich off of something she had no hand into creating. If she was a smart person,  she would have embraced every single Eleanor out there,  regardless if it was from a licensed shop or a regular guy in his garage. The more popular the name became,  the more money she would have made from "officially licensed" versions of it. She decided to take the greedy route and run the name, along with the stigma of Eleanor,  into the ground. Ever since they "stole" your car,  I personally comment negatively on just about every video or social media post about Eleanor I see,  in protest of Denise's actions. I love Shelby Mustangs, but if you call it Eleanor,  you are supporting a horrible person and I will give 0 fucks for your car,  just for that reason. Why? Because fuck her! I cheered when they ruled against her. It was justice served, but yet it is not truly justice until she returns what she has taken from our beloved builders.
Can't wait for that Mustang swap build, version 2
RESPECT. THAT'S WHY WE LOVE YOU
The is a testament to honesty, integrity and staying firm to the truth - congrats for what should be considered a moral victory here! Looking forward to the next mustang build
I love that!
Been wondering when you were going to say something and I love what you said specially right at the end
SHELBY=HERO    HALICKI="Robert Kardashian was engaged to his third cousin Denice Halicki in an explosive incest scandal."
Big win for car culture. Chris, u r national treasure.
How fantastic is that...Greed is what it comes down to...Shame on the Denice and Halicki family...
Congratulations! 💯✔ You deserve all the good that comes your way. Kudos!!👍🖖❤
You totally need to take a card out of their BS legal playbook and sue them for legal fees, the tens of thousands in content revenue, potential partnerships and BIFB brand deals and thousands in legal fees you had to fork out. Sounds to me like you have a slap suit of your own.
Crazy, I've been here since the Lotus build! I wanna see this next one now 🔥🔥🔥
i hope you can persue getting your orgianal one back at this point in my thoughts it has been stolen form you
Yes! Let’s go! Redemption build time!
Just big brother being a bully, they should just put there toys back in there pram and keep there gob shut, some good came out of it, look at the white beast you built, I know what one ild rather have in my garage,
I’m glad that you talked about Shelby in this video and your decision on the build. He is one of the pioneers and he deserves to never be forgotten. I just wish that Shelby American would build a modern Cobra and sell it to the public.
Inter alia- "among other things"  "Carrol Shelby is a G@dd@mn American hero!!" Yes sir, he is!  Good for you, and can't wait to see the build, whenever it is you get to it!
Talk about ruining the reputation of something so cool that everybody loved and was famous all around the world for no reason
You only spent $10,000 on that whole legal battle? In the grand scheme of lawyers that is not a lot of money.
I can’t even watch that movie anymore as I don’t want to support her at all
basically they were C*NTS
What happened to your car and are you getting it back?????
Since it happened, I started hating this mustang and the movie.
Awesome. Thank you for sharing your story.
Thank you lol !!!  Love the fact your going to do a GT 500 . Can't wait for the build .👍
if its not copyrighted,,, then they stole your car really.... get it back,, its parts for tons of money...
I love this. Thank you for the update and explanation. Can’t wait to see the Carroll Shelby tribute Mustang GT500.
I wish you could get your car back. Any Chance you could go after her for stealing your shit based on lies to the court? Sort of a “theft by deception” situation?
Volkswagen TDI swap the fd rx7
Well said Chris,  this notion of taking what is someone else's creation and copyrighting it, is the epitome of greed and getting paid for nothing. So glad her arse was handed to her.
I bet you’ll hear from them again. Probably give you a cease and decease to not talk about them and what they are doing.
Please, do a original interior with better seats and a digital cluster. Its better than a modern dash with old door cards
$10k in legal fees?  You sure they are real attorneys?  Thats hella cheap.
We should have some function clause in our copy rights to prevent firms that don't make anything from abusing them. Enabling economic drains from companies that add nothing to GDP is foolish.
We all know that the legal system is not perfect but have you experience any other so you can compare? broken like it is still one of the best in the world
2020, not 2002 :)
Sue them or just build one to piss them off.  I used to like gone in 60 seconds but after they did what they did, I just feel sick when I hear about that film and the cars.
Inter Alia:  "among other things". Glad you won, sort of.  Glad its over, sort of.
One correction only (in my lay opinion), it's a duck-TAIL, not a duck-BILL at the rear!! So glad justice was finally done, for you and ALL those other builders and creators!!!
It sucks that the rear on the 07 and 14 mustangs is different. Would've loved to see it turned into a take on the 2014 need for speed hero car. That is a movie mustang worth remembering.
Hell yeah! You are the man!
In my opinion, a custom 67 fastback is pretty cool, no matter who built it..
Just keep on building!
Sounds to me someone is close to being a peasant like the rest of us and they are scratching at the walls for thee almighty coin.
yes,,  finaly a GT500 b is for build. . . .
She’s a bully and a crook
The question I wanted answered (which probably couldn’t be answered due to litigation) is what happened to the original build? Was is crushed or in a warehouse collecting dust.
Hey guy when you finish this new musk rat build please give it a custom tag  the number should be the case number of the shelby and such and such case and please call the car theultimatefu
Best news to start the day! Love the videos and I would love to see you guys use a 1969 or 1970 Mustang Fastback swap to a modern Mustang GT power train.
I left during all of that. I'm back. Let's go!
Can I get a hell ya!
Excellent video. More power to you. Looking forward to seeing the future B is For Build/Shelby Mustang creation. Thanks.
3:13 “so this all started for me around 2002” dam I didn’t realize it was that long ago 💀
Seems like it is just an extra money grab!! Cause they cant manage there patent properly.
Anyone else NEVER watch another Halicki film since? i havent, fuck gone in 60 seconds.
Carol Shelby is a badass ,my childhood dream has been to own a gt500 and I can't wait for you to build A tribute to him .watching you guys from 🇦🇬 in the Caribbean
Jesus love's tou come to him you do great work
I think the better example for 16:00 is bumblebee, if we ignore the whole transformer part. It'd be like if hasbro decided to c&d every yellow beetle, or yellow camaro with racing stripes.
Im speaking for my self when i say that this makes me soo happy that this has happend. But im still thinking that if there is a possibility that you can get that car back that you shuld. I say take off all the parts taht resembels a "ELEANOR" and make samthing new whit it. You are B is for Built an i know that you and youre amazing theam can make somthing speciall. God bless you.  PS sorry if my writing is sloppy writing is not my forte.
a bunch of smart asses, trying too make easy fast money, that wanted to take credit for something not totally theirs, not even close,, embezzled the history and got away with it, because the justice system is lazy and foible...who have it guess.......
Maybe you can collaborate with Vehcor so he can complete his classic and modern Mustang project!
Great dissertation. That felt like a pretty honest read of your situation with “Eleanor”. Glad to see you come back so positive from it.
Amazing👍👍👍👍👍
Chris. You need to establish a TRUST.  Having a trust (at least in NC) makes you impossible to sue. You can still get sued, but nobody can stake any claim against you.  Completely insulated.
Your next build should be called a “haliki not”
ELSHELBY HERE WE COME BABY F*#K THAT BEACH!!!
Shelby and such and such went to court because such such tried to strong arm shelby into licensing fees   Which i find absolutely absurd  how the hell you gonna demand licensing fees from the creator of a car that your car was based on  Also im not sure why ford didnt get involved in this
inter alia=among other things.  I hope you get your car back and finish it.  I loved that series...maybe you say it at the end of the video.
Lets gooo!!!!
About time, hope you get to sue them back for fraud.
Good for you guys!
Gaaaaah! Cant wait for the build!!!
lmao I love the fact that u are going to build it again!
Can't wait to see the new build! I was pissed the old one ended that way.
Good for you, dude. My only issue with the old build was the skirting problem you faced last time. Where the new body extends way further down than the old one. Wonder if you had any ideas on how to tackle that differently this time or whether you might actually be able to eliminate it once and for all?
It was my favorite movie. I haven’t watched it since your issue and have no plans to.
Eleanor was a Yellow Mustang. If all you idiots didn't call that ugly ass Nick Cage car Eleanor, this would have never happened.
Karen Halicki
Awesome news! Can't wait to see this build finished!
You should of had a middle finger poster in the background.
The nick cage car is NOT Eleanor! The only Eleanor is the original that HB Halicki built. Denice was his second wife, and I'm thrilled that skank finally lost! You should TOTALLY build one, JUST to prove the fing point!
WELL .... said..... Do it
Well done and we'll said bro 👏 👍 👌 🙌
in my opinion!!!! her actions and tenacity to over reach on a car likeness for this  and be OVERLY protective about copyright protecting a car has "in my opinion" sullied the name and likeness of said car to the point "in my opinion"  of worthlessness like you i choose to support the great C.Shelby not a greedy manipulator !!!! ( i need the meme of daffy duck holding the pearl )... MINE MINE MINE ITS ALL MINE ) !! B is for build .. creates better cars and FUNNER drama around them well played Chris well played
What a waste of everyone’s time.  It’s a Shelby 🤣
3:14 wow COVID really did start longer before I remembered.
Frivolous lawsuits the American style. So sad…
Such an awesome video. You're definitely going in the right direction honoring and giving all praise to Carroll Shelby with this new build. Thanks for explaining all the intricacies of the legal case. I also wasn't aware of how similar the G500 was to the E even though I am a huge Mustang fan. Also, the Gt500 wasn't the first choice for the hero car in the movie. It was a Ford GT or GT40. It was because of parts availability and cost.
Car is gt500 elanor is a still a ford mustang . Movies could write scropts to steal manufacturers models. It Carol Shelbys car.
are you allowed to build an Halicki effigy and drop a mustang on it?..............
They acting like they own the ford mustang model 😂… Ford should hope n this
This is why we can't have nice things - does the person doing this even make anything? or do they just own the rights and attack the people who actually build things?
😂😂😂 Gold Digger I can tell she wasn't a good wife
So sad that people are so quick to sue just to get money.
The last 2 minutes 👌 that’s made me smile 👊🏻 can’t wait 🫶
FYI, Carol Shelby died 11 years ago.  I say this because it sounded like you were referring to him in the present tense as if he has won the lawsuit and not the company(s) in his namesake.
The Shelby build is the absolute best way to purge all that bad Eleanor energy. Can’t wait for it.    You’re right. People loved the 1999 Eleanor because it was a GT500 tweaked just right, and that is all it was - a tweaked GT500.
10K in legal fees? Omg..
Eleanor builders have become a dirty Dog bit off its own Tail bone by bone until it came to close to the A hole and got brown on its nose.
Mate, you are such a gentleman, good on you!!!!! and please keep going with your example of honesty and integrity. Even after scammers try to have a go at you, your actions show the person that you really are. well done!
That’s totally Awesome! I was hoping you would do something like that! I do have to say and this is definitely nit picking but being a mustang fanatic you used the quarter panes from a 68. The 67 had cut outs for the fake side vents.
So stoked for you Chris! This will be a build to remember! ❤
someone should sue denise halicki back, get your build back or make them pay for it, after all they did try to take your unrelated mustang gt away. SUE THEM BACK!
There you go let's fix this build it better let's get the channel back to where it was thanks for posting
Absolutely love this!!
perhaps you should try the slap suit threat... kindly ask for your car back plus10k in legal fees or you plan to sue for emotional distress on top of excessive legal fees....
the question that was not answer in this video is whatever happened to your Rendition of the Eleanor car. who has it and if someone else has it are they obligated to give it back to you, or did you dismantled it. Your next video should be "The Back story of my Eleanor Car"
Excellent idea. Can't wait. 👌👌
Google says inter Alia means “among other things”
Nice one! Looking forward to this build!
"Build it! Build it! Build it!"
money doesnt buy happines , sueing the lirttle guy doesnt get you happines, doing what your doing and byyour own hands and you team brings you and all your followers extreme happiness and moves us gives us the boost to get on with our own projects ...................In my opinion as a car guy not a lawyer ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;OH and what is oscars middle name ,,,,,,
They just wanted money and a free car
This might be a stupid question but I'm a Brit so I don't 100% understand the US legal system, but does this mean that Chris could (if he wanted) sue Halicki for a wrongful cease and desist which ultimately cost him 10's of thousands of dollars???
Oohh yeh, B is for Build it bloody awesome, brilliant news about the upcoming daily 67 build. I still hope you can get your old build back that was taken from you.
Just some movie info, the original Eleanor was a Mach 1 mustang, and yes it was yellow, glad you are pursuing getting yours back, I was pissed when they took yours
"The scent reminds me of surfing" Oh, you mean sunscreen XD
No sorry your statement that your build *Negatively Impacted their Business is utter garbage and proves they still have you stumped!*
Great video, still think you should get your car back (slap suit of your own) hopefully that is something you can and do pursue.  Not for retribution but enforce the fact this was never okay and hopefully prevent it from being done to others.  Awesome that you are doing a tribute build to Shelby, definitely an icon and one of my personal heroes.
The bottom will eventually fall out of elanore while Shelby will live forever. Screw her
Gotta love American Greed!! Yes, the worlds most pathetic justice system that allows such bullying and also allows this bullying can just carry on. I hope that old hag Denise keeps drinking herself to the grave, the sooner the better.
I can't wait till you build this car. I was so upset when you had to stop this Shelby build.  I'm glad you are going forward with this new build project.  I'll be watching .
I started watching back in the BRZ days. Watched loyally. I got selfish and stopped watching during Oscar's mustang build. I think the Eleanor crap took the excitement and fun out of the channel. Seeing this makes me want to start watching again.
That's really awesome news! But my question now is, and I'm not sure if you're allowed to comment on this, what is going to happen to the previous Mustang you've built? Will you get money back for all the revenue lost from the videos made and had to take down? Will they reimburse you for the value of both cars? Because I would hope that they learn the hard way and get a court order where they have to give back the people what they're due
Hell jeah 💪 ....all I have to say...
You should consider lawsuit of your own for defamation of character and lost income.
Great video finally the right result and looking forward to a Shelby modern retro.
that Hilliki broad sounds like a modern day Cruella De'Ville.
Brilliant!  Great to hear all that Chris.  Looking forward to your next Mustang build.
This floozbag was also engaged to her 3rd cousin, Robert Kardashian.  Tells me all I need to know.
### E is for EPIC! ###
How the tides have turned!the corrupt companies that bully the little are now feeling the many years of wrath from people they have hounded!!  Can not wait for this!!
PLESE!! Call the next Project "Elżbieta" xD this is not Eleanor or Eleanora In Polisch language but looks Better than Eleanor xD
So where is your actual car that was taken off you now?
I can’t imagine Chip is too excited about the whole Eleanor saga either. Surely he’s a massive Shelby fan.
Build an eleanor shelled tesla powered car and call it Elon :D
Should call the new Mustang build.. "NOT Elanor"
YES, B IS FOR YOU'RE GONNA BUILD THIS B!TCH! CANNOT WAIT
I think a better ending  is that they would get fine for all the seizing  they did of people  car and pay them the money back and if the cars haven't been destroyed  return them they deserve  even more punishment  ,but happy  they copyright has been overwritten  , can't wait for the next build
Well said man!! Hope they see this and goes "oh fu*k" :D
Would love to hear Foose's thoughts on all of this.
besides the 2 gone in 60 seconds movies, what other 2 movies was the mustang in?
To me this just smells like marrying the man for the money and trying to milk his legacy when you spend all the money he made before he passed.
Can't wait for the Shelby tribute build 🔥🔥🔥.
Justice!!! Screw that lady!
cant wait to see the new build, great news 😎
What!? this cost $10,000!!!!!!
What happened? The USA happened. Another ridiculous example.
Great news and great approach. I wonder what happened to the previous car? Can you get it back or sue this witch for compensation?
this is the best way to say to this Halicki chick to stuff it were the sun doesn't shine
Dyam these people are so money hungry, they will screw anybody for every little penny..
I have loved Mustangs since they came out when I was 13, though I have never be fortunate to own one. When I look at the cars you show, what I see is a Ford Mustang with minor modifications to the skin. How can an essentially Ford design belong to anyone else? How has Ford behaved in all of this discussion? It is still their car!
yeeeeeeessssss!!!!
This was the dopest video.
I prefer the original shelby anyway that classic Carol shelby look is so much better. Tune the engine and that's it keep the original brakes and running gear and blast that bad boy who wants modern brakes and and interior anyway. Give me a thousand hp on all original car now that's fun.
310k lmao
This makes me so happy
Can you sue for compensation / return of your build??
I was surprised by myself that i was still listening and watching at the end of the video.
Great result but did I miss something in the video ( which is entirely possible 😅) what happened to Your car ? Where is it now and can you have it back seeing as it was illegally seized ?
Vindicated! Great news and great choice on how to move forward. Shelby has been instrumental in shaping not only american car design but automotive car design and function across the whole world.
Brilliant, Ellanor is a tiny side note compared to Shelby.
Completely makes sense, in the Nick Cage movie even the reference in the movie is that Eleanor isn't that specific car in the underground garage. It even says in the movie that he tried to steal another one before and crashed it. The Eleanor reference is just his (in the movie) a placeholder/name for a GT500.
A great little talk-along! Looking forward to the build!
Hell yeah brother!
Lost all respect for Eleanor...geez...
A useful reminder that you're dealing with a _legal_ system rather than a _justice_ system. Glad there's some closure on that ordeal. Would be nice to see the old videos resurrected (maybe with this at the end of a playlist?) but I'm guessing there's legal reasons that can't happen.
Fuck all that bullshit bro, great job, never give an inch on arseholes like that.
It’s a 1973 in the original movie. Yellow with black stripes.
Chris, thank you for doing this video. You project was gonna be phenomenal, we have all been wondering if and how shelby's win could positively impact your project if at all.   [Also for all intents and purpouses, the owner of that intellectual property is no longer with us, and from what I've heard of his surviving wife and staff, that situation is indeed insane]
Go for it!
I hope the value of her cars goes to near zero. i'm not a ford guy much less, a mustang guy.... but the foxbody is a  great chassis for the dragstrip. I still think the Shelby mustangs look amazing, they just aren't for me.
They made u famous when they took the car, and now they’ll hopefully give u the car back, HUGE W’s
Yeah boi! Round 3 - let's gooo 👍
Add "in my opinion" to all the comments. Good one Chris!
YES❤
Wait! Carol was a dude? I always thought tha Carol was a girls name. My entire life has been a lie! I've only have one thing that is true left, my childhood cartoons, these wonderful cartoons made by a great woman named Hanna Barbera; yes, she will never betray me.
Fuck yeah mate. Nailed it. Smashed it out the park. I'm sure this build will be sublime, buzzing for it.
all body new engine and interior is my dream mustang, i can' t wait to see it done
all i can say is YES  well done to shellby  you and all builders finally sense in the courts can all parties that lost money sue halicki  for costs because of false representations so technally shelby owns the rights they have been claiming OH what fun I WAS SUPPRISED TO SEE THE TITLE WITH THE WORD ELEANOR   LOVE IT AND SO HAPPY FOR YOU ps what happend to THE BIULD  your property
BOOM!!!! Get in lad! So proud of you!
Denise? pretty sure she is actually called Karen.......
For what it's worth  Chris I'm with you tell them to stick their so called design  where it can fit and for you to embrace Carold Shelby's classic  Mustang  features with your own flair He is a legend  she isn't ha ha cheers from OZ
Best news this year! 😂 love this man can’t wait for the build
Don't let her win build ELEANOR . Do it .Don't back down .Win you know you want to god knows I want to see the project completed .
Inter alia means among other things. You probably recognize it used in short hand like in books i.a. notes documents etc
Does this mean that the original vids can be uploaded again without any issues? Or you'd rather just not go back there? Deserve some return for the effort that was done...
W
I agree with you 100%. Mustang is and always will be my favorite car. Hell, it’s the reason I started following you. Shelby deserves his flowers and can’t wait to see how you represent him. I can no longer look at that movie car the same after this
2002???
So nicely explained and such a reasonable and pragmatic view of future objectives. I wish you and the whole BifB team. Peace! 🙏
Check out my Helleanore build.
I bet you were dying to flip the bird at the end of that video. Eleanor is dead to me.
Payback is sweet!
Awesome news Chris, I’m so happy you got the last laugh over Halicki and I have no doubt this video will reside rent free in her head for some time! 😊
This is really good news 🍾🥂
I love that
🤘🤘✌✌
Good for you.
Can’t wait for this Chris, please please please get on to this project ASAP 🙏 there’s nothing like striking whilst the iron is still hot.
Hi Chris   This is awesome news for you , your team , any other car creators channel or even joe public wishing to build an "Eleanor" . I think you have now chosen the right path building a Carroll Shelby tribute .  On the one hand I feel that after all the damage the "Halicki Parties" have done to the car industry and car culture as a whole , the name "Eleanor" needs to be buried and forgotten . But on the other I can't say that I'm not a little sad that you haven't "stuck a big fat one" to them and built an exact replica . Having said that I completely agree with your stand and ethos on the direction you're going .  I was most definitely the more noble and honourable direction . Hats off to you sir .  P.S. Your latest Mustang creation was stunning . I can't wait to see what you and your team produce going forward.  Fattrucker
Started in 2002 hey pretty sure it was 2020 😂
These people are a flock of vultures (In my opinion) Keep us posted mo cara!
Man this is just too perfect! The fact that you are now allowed to, but wont even give her the credit of representing her with the build and supporting shelby is the biggest deserved middle finger i have ever seen
Build it this year.
Maybe im out of the loop, but what exactly happened to the car that you already started? I think it got seized but can't you just have it back at this point rather than just buy shit again? You already own these things. someone please fill me in thanks.
To be honest I always found the whole Elenor thing really cringeworthy, why would you call it an Elenor and not just a Shelby GT500 which is far cooler!
so, is it safe to build "Elinor" with my kid in Lego blocks? nice work man, keep building them!
Your "legal system" is really that broken??????? You mean to tell me "Better Call Saul" was a documentary?
Can you now recover your costs associated to you build ?
But what happens to your car that was taken ?
People build Genral Lee's and knight Riders, I dont hear of anyone  suing them.. That women must be broke and dating a drunk lawyer to be chasing people down for building a Ford Mustang
You just made 100% of the population happy thank you.
Maybe it has been answered in the comments but will you be getting the car back? I think i read that the car was taken away from you?
EVERY ONE OF US DREAMED OF TWO THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL!  #1 Eleanor.... #2 Angelina Jolie
call it Sheleanor just to piss them off
Boom take that !! Biatchhhh. …👍👍👍
Why don’t you counter sue get your money back from them and also the car back?
It mightve saved you alot of trouble but you've learned alot. Especially new words.
Awesome result. Time for another great build. Leave the toxic in the gutter where they belong...
Great to hear you're doing a Carroll Shelby tribute car, I'm looking forward to that. Are you going to counter sue, now there are precedents for the case. I'd go after them for all your losses.
hell yeah brother!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Outstanding Result Chap can't wait to see you start the build ;)
Great stuff
I haven't watched one of your videos in years, but this "fuck you, specifically" attitude just earned you a sub.   Please be sure to send a signed photo to Denise when you're done.
I'm glad you're going to make another one fastback mustang
The 9th circuit is a bunch of leftist clowns that ignore the cxonstitution.  A majority of 9th circuit appeals decisions are overturned because they are based on leftist dreams instead of the law.
I bet reading that legal document was really bitter sweet... I hate that dumb *****! To bad the courts were lazy about the first case with her and Shelby! I can't wait to see your next Mustang build!
i wonder if all the licence fees collected over the decades now have to be refunded? what a shame if that happened!
Can you get your original build back?
This is the best news I've had all year
shelby guy has a movie. ithink the title was ford vs Ferrari
fuck yeah dude. I like where you went with this video. SHELBY !!!
We need a Legal Eagle breakdown
Hey Chris,I've been watching since you rebuild your og BRZ  , I like many others really enjoyed the mustang build,  I hope that the mustang build returns all complete and sitting in the new shop
If the car still with you   You need to do very little change  Just change the car name to EleanorA done
I hope you build this car for SEMA 2023! IM SURE IT WOULD BE WELCOMED BY ALL.., AND WELCOMES BY SHELBY COMPANY, FORD and others.!
I like that you touched on how the eleanor mustangs get roasted on line.  Every time I see one on my feed I must comment on how  they suck I would never want to own one after what they did to you.  Their value is in the toilet thanks to your case, forget that stupid car.
Awesome!
I loved , like really love that first build, I can't even describe just how pumped I am for this build, hellls YYYYYYEEEEEESSSSSS
Love it. Great idea 👍😎
I would make it Silver Just to piss of halicki
YEAH! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait, there are 4 movies? I knew about and watched the original Gone in 60s with the yellow mach 1 and the 2000 gone in 60s with Cage and the GT500. What are the other 2 movies?
Very well said Chris. I didn’t think a video regarding legal battles would keep me watching but you put this video together perfectly. Great job and I love how you flipped this negative into an even better positive. 👏🏽
That woman is the perfect example of working the legal system to make money. No matter how many people she screwed over she doesn't care.
This is the best YouTube video I have ever seen and can’t wait for the build videos to come!!
sick
love this - "in my option..." looking forward to this build - please be this year
Yikes. As a european we commonly joke about being able to sue anyone for anything in America, but this thing is just blowing everything out of porportion. So glad that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, so sad that you still have to pay your own legal fees after another party initiated a threat. Good to see you smile again Chris, way to be the bigger man.
Can’t wait to see the new car b 👍👍👍

👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾so excited fuck karen skarneky or whoever
Looking forward to this build!!
That build is what got me into watching automotive YouTubers.  And was pretty bummed when it got taken away. But it made me a fan of yours. So I'm pretty stoked on a new mustang build.
Yea buddy!!! I had my Eleanor on hold waiting for this lawsuit to be over… now I’m gonna get to finish my E build with a unique design twist to slap Halicki in the face
Does anyone know what happened to the previous half finished build?
Why doesn’t  “ B is for build “ sue denice halicki for damaged and lose of revenue and kick her to the curb and take some money back that you lost from that bullshit cease and desist ?
"What a great argument your team has presented." No Contest.
I'm just wondering if you're able to get your original build back
Has to be bittersweet for you man.
Amazing video :)
I hope everyone who was previously sued is now going to Court and getting their payments back because then someones will finally fall squarely on their faces.
Well said.
What are the 4 films. I thought there was 2 films?
I actually like native it doesn’t burn my sensitive under arms lol so I approve too
Wait what it was in 4 movies? I only know the original and the remake what are the other 2?
👌🤣
Gotta agree with you Chris. Elenors are dead to me. You couldn't pay me to drive one  after what they did to you. So I'd say their value is effected.
This is probably one of the vids I’m not going to want to miss I wish he would dedicate a ton of time to get it right forget about compromising and just do it right and be very detail oriented about this build
Chris can you revisit your new mustang and make it show ready and fix panel gaps and apply real paint to it? Thanks
Finally he is doing something that the people here have been waiting on im not religious but thank all the gods that b is for build is building this build for us to watch the build with a bigger budget and slightly less sketchy than before
This is like your dad having a pet name for his car, say "bessie" his 67 C10, and deciding that because he named his, all C10 trucks are the same, and therefore a copy of "Bessie" just another example of scam culture and it's untoward success and the justice system failing to do something about it because they benefit from the court cases resulting rather than protecting the constitution and constituents. Sickening
A Shelby GT500 tribute build would be absolutely awesome !!!! 😁👌
Chris any idea what happened to your old car? Was it crushed or is it sitting in a warehouse somewhere, as now technically it was 'stolen'
Awesome, great news
Wait...four movies? I thought it was two? What are the others?
And Ken Miles
Actually Chip Foose and Steve Stanford designed the look of the car for the movie so Halicki should shut her mouth about the rights of the look of that movie car its theirs not hers.  If it was her design that movie car would have been yellow like the first movie car was
Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this chaos 🙏
We love you man!
I freaking loved this video, what a rollercoaster and I love the respect you carry through the whole thing. Excited for more content to follow
And let's mention most will call it an Eleanor because of the color as well. Paint it blue with white stripes? They'll call it a Shelby Mustang.
In my opinion, I feel it’s potentially interesting you can clearly spot when someone has previously been sued for defamation or copyright. I can’t be sure though, it’s just what I think.
It's just wrong to mess with Shelby! If I could have anything, it'd be a Shelby Daytona. You should talk to Garret Mitchell, aka cleetus. He's actually a lawyer.
love the Carol Shelby car   good for you   I think ill find a white Beatle and paint 53 on the door and call it Henry!  just keep doing what you love
Good to see those damn parasites get what they deserve.
IMO
Karma...is a biatch if your name is Denice "Sue 'Em All" Halicki.
4 movies? How are there 4 movies? Seriously.. I need an explanation.. obviously there is is the original gone in 60 seconds . Then the (in my opinion) terrible remake that turned it into a drama with Nicholas cage... What other movies?
Great all the way around. Silver Shelby should be the name of it.
Please tell me she hade to pay you for the first build or that you Will sue for it!
Denice Halicki needs to kick rocks.
God thats gotta feel bloody great!
When you stopped your mustang build i unsubscribed.... i was so pissed you caved in but i understand you had no choice...  if you continue the build now i will reconsider resubbing
Nice one Chris im glad u say u suport Carrol Shelby true American car builder 👌
I think you should be going after them for your car back  The precedence has been made with Shelby  If anyone owns anything it would be Shelby 👍👍
name one system in this here great united states that isn't fubar. or a lot of other place around the world, esp. those we've had hands in that aren't fubar.  copyright is bullshit and should be scraped from law completely.
May have been said already but another YouTuber/ lawyer/ car nut Steve Lehto,Lehto's Law covered this in detail. Give it a watch. Glad to hear you're going back to this build. I was taken by complete surprise when it disappeared and had no idea why.. Gonna be a killer series.
It would be cool when start building your 1967 mustard with modern features. Do combination between Shelby car & the bullitt car.
WICKED!!!  First Build in your new big shop???
Can you after them for the money that this headache cost you?
Hell yeah, Chris! Fight the good fight  brother!
Brilliant can’t wait to see this build a Shelby car is gonna be awesome with a B is the build bits and pieces on there respect from the UK
I cannot wait for your next body swap 67 mustang build!!!
F that b. lol
Well,  I dunno if Chris is gonna see this but..... This was once my fave build  And i literally cried when i heard of the lawsuit. This might sound a little wierd but, How about actually building another body swapped Mustang? Taking the s550 chassis, attaching it with the 67 body, boss 429 front end, and a twincharged 7.3 L Godzilla Ford v8 ? I always wanted to see something like that Let's just hope that one day someone's gonna build it
I guess where I'm still a little confused and uneducated about is that, since your original build was taken under, what equated to be a false precedent, why aren't you entitled to get either the vehicle back or the value of what it was worth?  Since it's now technically proven that any case she presented was basically built on lies, how in the world are you not entitled to your money and/or car back?
amazing
YES about time that lady got told  23:28
Great News! Cant wait to se The new build 🥳
To be honest, I really would love to see you getting the original car back, even if you just burn it, bcoz that's wrong to be taken from the first place, which that car is rightfully yours, and it is just good to see things taken from these bullies.
I bet Chris felt AMAZING when he hit the "publish" button on this one.
I didn’t think Denice Helicki had anything to do with the 2000’s movie. I thought you just couldn’t refer to any car as “Elenor” from the 1974 copyright. BTW I can’t watch that movie ever again #tainted
Eleanor who? Yeah build a bad ass shelby tribute. A buddy of my in Holland had build a .... style car. He was obsessed with the 90s movie. He was at a show. His car was in the parking lot and a media team had seen it. Took a picture and placed in there Dutch magazine with blurred out license plate. He got a letter and in a week his car was gone. I have heard the contacted the magazine bullied them to gif details and found him. That all took 3 mounts from show to gone. We joked gone in 60 days haha. Was longer than that but come on. Glad someone has the fist stop in place. Shelby is the real rock star. Not her. 🤮 I don't think she is going to heaven if you know what I mean. I'm excited to see the SHELBY build guys. And criss damn what a great attitude bro. Respect 🙏
I love this channel, I hope the they get sued by all the owners for devaluing their cars
You really do not have to use the Lord's name in vain when you are describing somebody who is really talented at what they do. Yes, God did give Shelby really GREAT gifts at designing and building cars. We LOVE you and all you do. May God overwhelm you, your staff and family with blessings!!
@3:14 Chris you’re the start of Covid! Guy had Covid back in 2002! 😂
when is the DeLorean coming back?
In my opinion f those guys for ruining your build
Well done!!!
Eff them
This might just be my favorite video of yours!
the sema mustang is a million times better looking than the ewwleanor
Build a Carroll Shelby inspired Mustang 🐎
I think there is a game people play when you say "In my opinion"...
You're missing one main point. In the Nick Cage "Gone in 60 Seconds" Eleanor represents ANY 67 Shelby GT 500. It's not just one that has a few mods and is painted grey. If you remember from the movie all the cars have names. Before they have seen any of the cars they are going to steal, they give them names. Now the names are more nefarious because it's a code for cars they want to steal but the fact remains, the crew sees 67 Shelby GT 500 on the list and they immediately say Eleanor and refer to that car as Raines' unicorn, which he refers to it again when it's being crushed. At the end of the movie Kip buys him Eleanor which is a rusted out in need of restoration 67 Shelby GT 500. Not painted grey no additional mods but a stock looking 67 Shelby GT 500. At best, because the grey restomod (what I'm calling it) was the star of the movie, they might be able to make a claim on that particular design and paint color but nothing more. Here is the kicker. As you pointed out there are some mods on the movie car that make it NOT a Shelby so maybe it's a Shelby clone or maybe someone killed the value and modded it. Back to my point, Shelbys are numbered chassis. If the car in the movie is in fact a Shelby GT 500 then it's already copyrighted. If it's a 67 Mustang made to look like a modded Shelby then again the only claim is to those specific mods and the paint color because they sure as hell can't copyright a Mustang. I realize all of this is moot point but I just wanted to mention that I'm glad a court told them that you can't stand on the shoulders of icons, give it a paint job and fog lights and say you own the design.
Hell yeah!!!
Been waiting for this, Legal B.S. at its worst.
I still don’t understand how this was ever worthy of them starting lawsuits. It’s a GT500 with a body kit. Imagine if every R34 with a body kit was viewed as worthy of a lawsuit because of 2 Fast 2 Furious. Absolute stupidity.
Let's call it what it is, Nick Cage Eleanor is a Chip Foose enhanced GT500.
Looking forward to this new mustang build! B is for ShelB is for building awesome cars!
Imagine being so greedy that you destroy your husband's legacy. I hope all the money and property she stole will be returned with damages and loss of business.  Also, you can launch a civil suit in California against her personally for filing frivolous lawsuits and drag her for every dime she has or will ever have.   Eleanor is dead to me, she killed that dream by tainting it with greed.
O' Yeah ! Like my man Emperor Palpatine would Say, " Do It " !  Awesome
Please call it something really straightforward and also dumb … like “Belle-anor”  And then shorten it to Belle or Bella
Well, that's a great way to start the day. Well explained Chris (and Team!), so glad that this came full circle and something which is a big part of our Petrolhead Culture is now free! Brilliant idea to do another Mustang in tribute to Shelby. Bravo! Love you guys.
Good for you!
Congratulations Chris. Glad that you are planning on building 2019 gt and 67 mustang body swap build to make it a GT500 tribute car. Ignore the fiasco with Denise. Glad that your building thr gt500 that you envisioned for a long time. Hopefully the build will happen in the future.
Ah... It seems that Halicki flew too close to the sun. I hope she loses everything
How much money was spent on illegal licensing to build this car. All those people should go after her now.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I WANTED THIS
i guess dropping the name and renaming the playlist and video's wasn't an option, including bleeping the name in each video
to be honest this was the best response you could have given. good work.
YAY!  Epic video.  Did my heart good to hear it all.  Yes, go for it and build it to YOUR specifications.  Happiness and Health to you.
Superb video and response Chris. Kept it classy. Stoked you'll finally get to do the fastback build.
B is for bull shit
Hope you're able to counter sue to get your money back and then some. I'm not a lawyer to know if that's possible. Good Luck
chris well said mate! if your gona support someone.. u rather support someone with integrity, a true vet, seasoned racecar driver etc. Carroll Shelby is a legend. Halicki is out of her mind for all those years of abusive behaviour. shes a disgrace if u asked me!
British fan here.   My thoughts exactly. I've stopped watching the movies now because the bad taste the whole fiasco leaves. Not seen them in maybe 15 years.
Your GT500 is going to be amazing!
Now Shelby is getting their lawyers already for licensing 😂
Awesome…. I can’t wait 🤩
Has anybody forgotten she was married to him for slightly over 3 months?   That's all!    She was previously married to Robert Kardashian! Nuf said.    ''Robert Kardashian Sr was dating and engaged to his 3rd COUSIN, Denice Shakarian Halicki after his divorce with Kris.''
It hurt ford too. It hurt the Mustang brand.
Time to counter sue for damages.
Liked, subscribed, and commented. I’m doing my part to help you fight this fight.  Screw them!
Please (pleeeeeeeeeeease) don´t rush this build, take your time, make it perfect.
This lawsuit killed any respect I had for Eleanor. I always wanted one until this lawsuit happened and it is so dead to me that after this point I refuse to use that name ever again. In my opinion the only things that exist are Shelbys and ripoffs.
HELL YEAH CHRIS! Don't think anyone could disagree with a single word you said. So pumped to see you finally have your (and my) dream car. You deserve this and I couldn't be more excited to see it happen 😁
I don't think I'd buy any Mustang after all this.
can't you claim back your seized car?
How can someone own a mustang Shelby 500 .the only person who owns that is ford and Shelby. I just don't get how someone can own a car it's not a person or a movie it's a car made by Ford so if someone car looks like mine I can sue them ?maybe I'm just a hillbilly but I don't get how anyone other then ford ND Shelby cand own a mustang and sue over it.
Shelby cars are way cooler.  Fk eleanor
Epic
You started in 2002 a few months after covid hit? Think you meant to say 2020?
Oye, you can't just mention that 2007 Mustang and not give us a update on that beast!! Where is it nowadays??
Eleanor was a over rated car I never thought it anything special
Literally can't wait for this build its going to be awesome as per usual 👍 love from the 🇬🇧
Native is the best! Glad they’re a product sponsor for this channel! Thanks for sponsoring this channel and Chris/Chelsea’s future builds!!  Chris you are the man!!
American courts are trash
Halicki might own the rights to Eleanor body kits, but she thinks she owns the rights to any mustang that  looks remotely like a Shelby GT 500   Thats delusional since they were built in calibration between Shelby & Ford and existed before all Gone in 60 seconds movies.  Agree the Eleanor body kit is mostly Shelby's design and is almost nothing  without those elements.
Also… gotta watch Ford v Ferrari for Carol Shelby. 😊
Gg Chris for this informative video!
Yeah, why would we wanna build something that make we feel euhhhh because of the owner and better pursuing real deal 😍😍😍😍
This should of never been a battle it’s a Shelby Car not hers Elenor is a mustang how are you gonna claim what is not yours 😂
I’m all here for this build!!! Can’t wait to support Shelby and b is for build
I have never seen anyone try and abuse copyright law this much… holy hell. Glad to see the court finally have enough of her shit.
They should be ordered to return EVERY CAR they "stole"
3:13  2002? Man It's been 21 years already.... Time sure flies right bud?  lol.
Class action counter suit time baby!!! Screw the unethical money grabbers.
It has been a very long time since an individual has summoned such an extreme level of disgust in me. It has been years since someone has bothered me this much, just such a completely shameless, 100% self centered conwoman. I’m glad that things look like they are turning the right way here! I hope everyone who has owned an Eleanor gets the outcome they deserve. I’m rooting for you!!!❤❤❤
4 movies?
Yessss!!!  I’m excited for the Mustang!
Greed
A new car, project name CARrol
Yeah I was watching that build when you announced what happen. Pissed is not the word. Glad you get to do it again.
Wait what. Co  Vid hit in 2002? Where was i the last 20years
I love! Now that she can’t stop you you don’t even wana bother with her knock off!
interalia means "among other things" or "in addition to"  This phrase is often found in legal pleadings and writings to specify one example out of many possibilities
Now I can’t wait to see u build a Shelly 😉
You may never get back what they took, but glad to see that eventual justice does exist....
Don't you think people who watch your channel or other channel's on building an elanor already know about the lawsuit it's called the world wide web just another youtuber with no content to show there subscribers absolutely terrible how subscribers wait for build content and all you get is story time BORING from B don't build sorry to say
Did anyone else notice the red, white, and blue fireworks behind Chris while he stayed that Shelby was a “….Goddamn American hero”? I may have heard the Team America theme song as well, but that’s just my opinion 😬😆😆😆😆
Proud of you, and an amazing end to this shitshow that the "Eleanor" company started. You say the law system was flawed yet decency  prevailed. Can't wait for the new build
There's actually room for a criminal suit because their attempted extortion.
Been waiting for the sea to part and justice would come in your favor. 🤞🏼👍🏻👍🏻 You deserve to have a mustang build that has your imagination and skills be remembered.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Denise can Halicki deez nutz !!!
Hell yeah
Glad everything got figured out in my opinion people having a 67 fastback that were being attacked was definitely wrong
I emailed them and told them they had damaged the “Eleanor” name beyond repair because of their action against B is for Build, never heard back…😂. My opinion is everyone should build an Eleanor….. just to piss them off.
Funny fact it already happened with a guy on tiktok copyright of lighting m 🤣
Looking forward to that Shelby tribute build.  That money grubbing whore had it coming, screw you Denice whatever the fuck your fullname is. Yes offense.
Can wait to see that built!! I was pissed when you told us about the last built, lawsuit etc. Well I hope we won’t have to wait to long!! Great work guys.
After this I'm never gonna watch "that" version of Gone in 60 Seconds again.  Their tweaked take on Eleanor was basically the best thing about that remake and now knowing what a carnt she is, I'mma never watch anything she's associated with, ever again.
Rename it Eleanot
Denise halicki should paypack EVERY CENT she screwed out of people and fans who had to PAY HER for copyrights to have an "Eleanor"
YESSS LETS GOOOO. This was my favorite build series yet can’t wait til it comes back “kinda”.
Oooh he'll yeahhhhhh... This is the reason we subscribed.. PEACE
U should never have allowed them to make you feel guilty.
The other people (Denise) used a 1971 mustang: A completely different model that FORD MOCO. Produced… Carol Shelby used a 1967 Ford Mustang with a little extra fabrication to it… well said…
Awesome!
Denise soured the Eleanor car for car lovers... talk about milking every penny from a crap director
Thanks for explaining what you could. I can understand why you don’t want the original car back, However….  I think you should get it back because what’s-her-name just shouldn’t have it. Finish the build and give the car away. I have no idea how feasible that would be but, it seems that it would be a fitting end to the situation. Just my opinion.
Man oh man, shit all i can hear is "and here we go" - heath ledger joker
The astounding 'only USA could be so stupid' quality of this, is that the courts allowed a movie (that's fiction) to reach outside of its genre and grab the actual working world by the balls and squeeze for big money.  That is TRUE social insanity.
Not being a mustang guy, until today, I thought the car in the movie was a Shelby…named Eleanor.
YES!!! 🤘🏻😁🤘🏻
Move on.
Yay... We can all look forward to another cut corner shitty build.
Finally some justice, f that greedy b.
Great video! Can't wait for that build! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
ITS AMAZING its just simply amazing how he said "fuck that stupid eleanor i dont even want it now" without actually saying it indeed Carol Shelby was a legend and i would love to see you build a mustang in his tribute  much support
They all looks the fucking same and the mustang they use isn't even what they say it is because its so fucking generic. They're court bullying for something they shouldn't be able to sue for in the first place.  It's like if I sued someone for having a Samsung phone because I have one. Absolutely stupid
RESPECT!!! FUCK ELEANOR
Me having a naughty smirk over them losing the case.
Really Can't wait to see that Build. Good work Team B is for Build.
Surely it was a typo you meant L and R
So we can't call it a Eleanor now as Shelby claims is his design instead....  Should learn from Back to the Future and the De Loren....   No buyer will buy a Eleanor or Shelby look alike and be mistaken that's its a actual Shelby
You neglected to mention the Carroll Shelby's Original Texas Chili Kit.  You too can have your very own Shelby creation for less than $10 US.
Yeeesssss well said
Yes! Can't wait for this build! Love the Shelby GT's!
Finally some common sense prevailed!!! Yeah guys a Chelby tribute car, can't wait for that build to start
Stick it to the woman, Go Shelby!
Hell yeah the answers we've been waiting to hear x3
it was all that bullshit that brought me to your channel, and I've enjoyed every video you've made; seeing your projects get so much exposure is the best F.U. to the scumbags that tried to shut you down
useless people
That last part was fn fire way to go 🤣 now let's see this thing come to life sooner than later like while the wound is still fresh js
Good for you ! Much love and respect!
Fuck the Eleanor "brand" and the asshats who "own" it. LMAO.
Loved this. And being in the music industry, I'm a bit of a legalese aficionado.😁
That doesn’t sound like you had a SLAPP suit on your hand nor is your explanation good. SLAPP suit is a kind of baseless revenge suit the Defendant can prevail on and recover atty fees. Nevertheless, these people sound like jackasses and were looking for a ‘nuisance value’ settlement/judgment.  Inter Alia = ‘Among other things’…need to learn some latin when you go to federal court.
ELEANORE is played out really tho you aren’t missing out on anything but you want to know something that not a lot of people is that mustangs in general tend to go after people on the side of the road so if you think about it you dodged a BULLET no pun intended tho.
Wish there was some way you could sue for damages and lost revenue now
The cars more like 90% ford 10% Shelby.... some slap ons don't make it his either really alone.
FINISH IT!!!!!
2002 ?
YYEEESSSSSSS!!!
XLNT!   I can't wait for your  new 'Shelbynor' build.   F Denise. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Karma! Beautiful Karma! So happy for you!
THANKS!!! Extremely thoughtful explanation - Kudos
Eleanor's A QUACK!
For those who haven't seen it, Ford vs Ferrari is an awesome movie about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.
go ducks!
Fantastic news on these types of builds Chris.  Best wishes from over the pond 👍🇬🇧
Glad to see degenerates finally getting put in their place. That would have really been a crappy time going through the court case with unreasonable people, and I'm glad you came out of it in a better place.
WD SHOULD GET ONE😂
I loved this video! Carrol was the man!
Elenor was just the code name for a general "type" of car(67' gt500) to steal. The one they found to steal just happened to look that way. It became a character by happenstance. The whole lawsuit was ridiculous AF across the board.
At  21:25 i fell in love with you again.  And im not American!!
Such a good video bro and a crazy story. Enlightening.
I love all 23.5mins of this video and the decision you came too! F Hoelicki lol
America!
Your build was looking great I hope you h ave
How can we contact to  tell this Halicki WITCH how horrible of a person she is??
First off this is not the only subject where the American Law/court system is failing but that’s beside the point and second that is a great idea and i think a great mindset and tribute to Mr Shelby. Good choice man 👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏻🫶🏼
I’m so looking forward to this build can’t wait
Let's go!!!!!! Can't wait 😜
Did I miss if there's any chance of getting the card back?  Forget finishing it as an Eleanor, I get that, but there were a LOT of good parts on that thing that could be sold or used in other builds or...given to me?  Maybe?  Nah 😢
Didn't even skip the advert.. And commenting for the engagement points.. Nice coverage!
Sue them for the original build back or for the value plus damages. F*** them man.
They just wanted a build you had already started for them to sue you for
Sadly I had a company not pay me and used simaler tactics not to pay me . They  tried to use their legal costs as a way to break me I know what strain it puts on you. I won and the bullies lost thankfully but there was times the fight was stopping my life moving on. Good to see they haven't beaten you
Love it. I hope no one ever buys another Eleanor again. Shakarian has completely ruined that car and tarnished her late husbands name all out of heartless greed.
Very well said Chris. Carrol Shelby is a f**kin legend and icon in car history can't wait to see what you create next
Hell yes! I'd like to know what Chip's stance is on this whole ordeal.
Hell ya I'm soo happy to hear  ALL of that.. Carol Shelby was a great man!!
You already kind of stuck it to her lol For the shift knob On the white Mustang
well shit dont do a ferrari build 😇
Awesome news! Just can't wait to see the new build start! Really hoping it's in the next month rather than next year it starts! 👍
You the MAN!!! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Big FUK8N MIKE DROP !.....😆😎
Love it Yo the man💯👍🏻
Best news ive heard in a while, glad for you and your team ma
awesome
Denice Halicki was engaged to her cousin after the death of HB.  This is a fact.  That cousin was Robert Kardashian (OJ's lawyer).  Also a fact.  These are absolute garbage human beings.  That part is my opinion.
I'm glad you're deciding to body swap a classic again, but I can't get over the fact how amazing your last Eleanor build would have been if she didn't cease and desist you. But I'm looking forward to this build.
Let’s goooooo Chris!!!
Hell yeah I just love those modern chassis with older looks on it 🤘🏼🤘🏼 very glad you go for another one after your previous builds.
I have been waiting for a video to come out for so long and finally glad it’s been explained. I cant wait to see you come back and build that Shelby tribute car and show us the build process!!! Hopefully it’s this year, dying for some new content!
Don't use Native if you're sweaty, the coconut oil will stain your favorite shirt, ask me how I know.
So excited to see this build, you’re an amazing person with an amazing team and your builds are second to none you will do Shelby proud with your recreation and I can’t wait to see it!
I’m with you on this one. Shelby was a car god. Tribute him and not a fake movie car.
Fist pump!
LETTTTSSSS GOOOOO!
right on man ......!!!
Not going to try and get your old build back?
Proud of you on this man!
I’m very conflicted on this there is a difference between the Shelby GT500 and Eleanor . So if I started building replicas of the mustang you built for Sema this year would you be OK with that
How was she not classed as a vexatious litigant 10 years ago?
Badassery at its finest. 👏👏
Waiting for the build❤️😍
The unanswered questions.  What happened to your unfinished build?  Can you recover it?  Was it crushed?  Suggest a Go Fund Me to raise a war chest to get some payback.  I think the car community would support you in that effort.
Damn straight!!
From this day hence forth I shall never call any mustang an Eleanor. Even it's as an exact licensed Eleanor. I will call it a Shelby.
I'm glad those people got what they got you build cool stuff 😎 keep us the good work 👏
I know it’s a small trivial objection but Shelby didn’t build the cars he was just a visionary and and a great salesman when it came to his cars. He knew how to get the right people involved to create his idea.
This situation and conversation make me wonder if there is a license agreement required to build a “Christine”?  I doubt it.
Fucking love this! What a perfect FU! Beautiful! Build on!
tell them you want you car back!
Yay!!!!!  I’m so glad to hear this!!!!!  I loved that build and can’t wait to see you guys do it again
CANT WAIT!!!
4 movies is a joke. 2 are just re-edits of footage from the first movie with additional scenes shot to move the story along I believe. And one wasn’t really completed for obvious reasons.
This is so sweet! I can't wait especially since you guys have much more experience building these now so the end result should be even better!
💥
Wouldn't that all be just settled If Ford just interjected Into the conversation or Litigation Because technically they own all the rights to any Ford product Shelby or not That's the reason why In the movie they "d to be a modified Ford Mustang Because they could not Get the rights That's the reason why Shelby gets royalties and so does Ford from selling toys of Eleanor But What about a mock one Mustang It was considered Eleanor 30 years before 67 Mustang Because of the 1st movie gone at 60 seconds
Hell Yeah Brother 👍
I like all of your videos. But this one, I fucking *LOVE*.
Awesome, looking forward to the new Shelby build
Yes can't wait to see this please start straight away, and YES you are right the GT500 IS Shellbys and always will be , I'm from the UK and even I agree with every word you said that car was Shellbys heart and soul that's a fact and its the most beautiful muscle car made I absolutely love them so you Motley Crew get ya tools out and build that B IS FOR BUILD dream and ill be hear watching you guys, hell yeah.
I literally want to give you a fukn man hug and fist pump. This was a totally engaging episode, giving the man the business! There are so many flaws that I saw as Joe Public, let alone a lawyer! Gratz man... Fukn gratz from Down Under!
Best ending to this story man
Great video Chris. Thanks. I'm looking forward to you shelby tribute build.
Wow actual douchebags.. Glad Shelby won their lawsuit. That's actually crazy that a car, not even made by someone, can be considered IP because of a body kit and a name.
Four movies? Geez, I would never guess there was this many movies. I mean, I don't even like the Eleanor that much, I just watched the last one because of Angelina Jolie
You get a Eleanor! you get a Eleanor!  Everybody gets a Eleanor!
Denice Halicki is a total dumb*ss golddigger. You can't copyright someone else's creation. Chris couldn't have said it better in that Eleanor is a Shelby Mustang with minor changes that don't amount to a verifiable new and/or unique creation that she can claim legally. If anyone has a right to sue anyone it's the Shelby corporation suing her as they did.
So did the original bodyswap mustang get scrapped? assuming so but if its still out there could chris get it back?
So are you considering to going after that team for lost revenue from build videos that you produced and would have made income from because you had to take that whole build series down?
Hell yea excited for the new build and I so am hoping that bish is seeing this video and wish she didn't take your car away from ya
I met you at J&B during that Eleanor build and you gave me a preview of some of the work you hadn't shown in a video yet. It was disappointing to see it get taken, but I can't wait to see tribute build.
Lawyers have skip tracers on payroll, finding someone's middle name is the least of their abilities.
The court system can be nuts. You get a loser that has done next to zero with their life, so they try to milk every drop out of the only thing they can.
Please do a Carol Shelby biography
BRO SO YOU GETTING YOUR CAR BACK? PLUS RESTITUTION???
This is awesome, glad to see it worked out in the end.
You are a legend man! I'm so stoked you will be doing this one when you could easily have been too scarred from the last, and all in the name of Shelby!
Love the support for Carroll Shelby, but it sounds like you're talking about him like he's still alive?
Absolutely perfect description of your position.. Thank You! God Bless Mr. Shelby....
Cucumber mint...you big girls blouse 😳 what ever happened to the man's manly smell you know the one ...Good old body sweat and gym bag's 😂🤣😆. The name Eleanor is also a main character in a movie called Rose Red if this crazy woman and her team of henchmen are nolonger able to fleece money from the pockets of honest working car builders what's next is she going to be trying to go after the movie industry or just people who have the name Eleanor 🤔 🙄.  I guess you can say that the Bank of Eleanor has stopped trading 🤔 😉.  You can't leave it until next year to build your not Eleanor car especially when it's all still a shithot interest to everyone who watches your channel.  Also what's the score with the boat build 🤔 when will we be seeing that video???. As alway's buddy 💯%   👍   🇬🇧.
Man I’m glad to see those idiots lose in court. Shelby is a legend
Then add at the end. ….. and imma copyright it as my own. Drumsticks 🥁
Much love and respect to this man
Big Win and looking forward to your Shelby tribute car
I still refuse to even watch or recommend gone in 60 seconds of any era cause of Denise. Its not even on my recommended "car guy" movie list. i hate that wench so much.
I bet she just crushed his build thats why he wont talk about getting it back.
My favorite part of this was Rockstar trolling them by selling a car called the Ellie and looks like a gt500
Personally I’m glad that Denice and her goons lost the case. But I really want to see you get the car that they took back, because now that their copyright has essentially been destroyed (that’s if I understood the whole situation correctly), they have no reason to have taken your car then right?
Mannn oh man I’m hyped
They pretty much destroyed the name Eleanor in the car community...
Sue happy for sure
To be honest if anyone should hold the copyright to the car it should be shelby America and ford.
That woman must perish.
You should sue Halicki and get your money that you had invested into the "Eleanor" build!
I'm not a lawyer... just an MBA with a lot of interest in law. I cannot speak for Shelby, but what stands out pretty prominently is the potential damage to the Shelby brand done by Halicki - which is why, I would assume, Shelby filed the additional lawsuit after the previous settlement. If Halicki continued threatening lawsuits against owners, businesses, and auctioneers of high-value Mustangs/GT500s, it damages the value of those cars (i.e. Would someone want to purchase one with the understanding that a BS copyright action may be taken against them?), and therefore damages the brand Shelby.
I'm looking forward to one HELL of a tribute to Carroll Shelby...!!! I'm seeing the whole Eleanor brand in a different light too.......
Not sure the appeal of this Eleanor car, its kinda ugly and boring
You are so epic, Chris! Excellent coverage (in my opinion, I believe) of the court case. And flawless logic for the Shelby tribute. Everything you decide and do makes me happy to buy your merch and subscribe to your content. Please continue doing what makes you happy because I truly enjoy watching and following it all.
Can’t wait to see it
🎊 🎉
Denise Halicki is not a very nice person.
Great news, can’t wait to see the build of that Ford Shelby
You should name your car Denise!
Much respect!
Eleanor? More like Eleabore... Or Eleasnore? Maybe Elearottentothecore. I'll see myself out...
Very well put man! That was a fascinating listen and watch.
She didn’t create squat, spent money to have somebody else create something had that built by somebody else that creates it in real life then tries to make money off other creators with shady PIs and lawyers. Screw them and I hope nobody in the car scene ever does business with her again. Would also love to hear the uncensored retelling of this saga at some point.
Looking forward to the tribute build.Thanks for sharing and taking us along
❤LOOKING FORWARD TO THE BUILD❗
Awesome
Denise who?
I like your style my friend, now go build that bad ass Mustang lol. What a pain in the ass this Karen is but it makes for good content ;-)
Fuck the Nickolas cage gone in 60 seconds 67 gt500... the original was a fugly  73 mach 1....
The Daniels test works like this:  1) You take a shot of Jack Daniel's. 2) Somebody tells you the copyright claim. For example "That black 2007 Mustang GT is an Eleanor copy." 3) You spit out the Jack Daniel's in disbelief. That's a failed Daniels test.
Fk yeah!!!!!!!!!  Hoped this was coming after the decision was announced.
This update makes me so so happy 😃 I was beyond bumbed when that build got snatched away. Your closing comments about Carroll Shelby and doing it for him instead makes it perfect. Hope to see this soon 🤞🙌
I hope everything they own is stripped from them and they live a long but painful life without love. Not only has she ruined the Eleanor name she has ruined the Halicki name. RIP H.B. Halicki a true film legend.
👏👏👏👏👏
Hell yeah!!!!!!!!
Death to Eleanor.  Long Live Shelby!
I’m excited! I’ve been watching for years! Denise and her team are pariahs. I love how you’ve focused on building a license tribute care to Carol Shelby instead of the Eleanor garbage . Well done sir!
Love your work
they think cars are regulated the same as a mortgaged house... always paying taxes. and that makes this lawsuit a municipal landlord's over reach to manipulative strangulation to persons that may have slight cognitive problems, known or unknown can provoke reactions of unwanted nature thus making there overreach in bylaw enforcement unconstitutional... tho to the specific situation is an uncanny waste of ones time and the extrapolated efforts of many others. "wannabe dictator took a shot and is no longer allowed to vote in elections, mental health act."
This is so great. Thank you for being passionate enough about it to make this video. Keep making awesome cars!
Check mate… well done 👏🏼🤙🏼
So glad you've decided to do the build, and totally agree with doing it as a tribute to Shelby instead. Really look forward to watching how it goes
Greedy bastards just wanted your car because they liked what they saw. Good reddens  they lost the court case
I wish you could get your car back though,  cause that shit was stupid...
100% agree. Building an Eleanor is now the same as playing Stairway to Heaven in the music store.  So Lame.
Now every time I see the name 'Gone in 60 seconds' I'm going to be reminded of what assholes the owners are
Nice work mate
Well done to the legal team that stopped the parasites, I fear the damage is done to any one with a licensed E car thou. Can’t wait to see the fast back build.
What an excellent job you did explaining this travesty. Screw Denise Halicky!
Good ! Fuckem
😎🤙🦅
Fantastic outcome!!!
Your right he is an absolute legend, I'm not a Ford guy but I respect the talent
love it  f Eleanor and the movies will never watch again. absolutely discussing way to conduct oneself. can't wait to see the carol Shelby tribute.
Chris you ever seen a ta race stang
R.I.P Carroll Shelby
eleanor was always overpriced trash sry.
FUCKIN LOVE YOU CHRIS!
Awesome news. I think the Halickis may have shot themselves in the foot. Cannot wait to see your B is for Build Carroll Shelby Shelby GT500 tribute car. Bring it on!!!
Your speech gave me goosebumps man. Carry on and don't be bothered with a..holes. Can't wait for the next Mustang built, big fan🤘🏻
I’m about to watch this video, not sure if your getting the car back (doubt it) or not yet… but I just want to say this was by far my favourite build you’ve done. The modern touches on a classic built to be a daily… loved every part of it. I like the white one but it’s not a 5.0! Lol
I am so glad to hear that the "Eleanor" copywright is now debunkt and that Mr Shelby got his justice.  Now looking forward to seeing that GT500 daily driving tribute come to fruition.
build it and we will watch
🙌👏🙌👏YYEEESSSSSSS!
Now my question is this, do you get all of your stuff that they seized back from them?
Steve Lehto has a great video on this on his YouTube channel.
Full support for this!
Love it! Thanks for the details! And, lets never speak of Ela$@?0r again!!!
The best response I could imagine to the crap show that was Elenore.
Everyone that got screwed with this Eleanor lawsuit should be compensated and she should have to pay damages to those people purely because her company tried to copyright something that really wasn’t their design. Out of all this though you need to ask would this channel have become what it has if it wasn’t for the lawsuit? This lawsuit is what brought me over to it and I’m sure many many others also
Thank you, for your fight Chris. Greetings from germany.
You are spot on and I love your style!!!!
Fuck yeah!!
Hell yeah brotha. Cant wait for that build to start
Shel-B-ys-4-build
can you get your car back the original one though
Some people are hellbent on what others wrote for them and other people understand cars and car culture.  Glad we're in the second camp.  Carry on, Chris.
Im really hoping you go to ls fest west again so i can see the updates on that mustang. Saw your builds at the 2022 ls fest and they were amazing
I lost 10 thousand  dollars on not dyeing last year. I think you did something close. I'm not done yet.... so yay
Citrus Herbal Musk, a musk you actually want in your life.
YES!!!!!!  Bring on the new GT500B (B is for Build) build.  I'll be watching each video twice, to help recover the money that some evil woman stole from you.
I have been waiting for this a long time.
Man, I’m super stoked for this build!! I hope you’re able to get that shop built beforehand!!
The “Eleanor” in the 2000 Gone in 60 seconds is quite clearly labeled as a ‘67 GT-500 in the movie when they have the list of cars twice, once on the chalkboard and once in the warehouse with the glow in the dark paint. Quite insane to think you can tweak an existing car’s design and claim it’s yours.
I remember when it all happened, I was so excited for the build. Denice and her people can shove it! I’m glad your gonna do a new build to honor Carroll Shelby and his designs
Sinister diesel did this with the color blue once. 16:00
Do it, do it, do it. Shelby 500 all the way 💖
Fair warning, my filter is turned off on this one...    I am so happy you decided to go the route of honoring Carroll and everything his company has done. They are absolute legends and deserve the credit for a car THEY created.  In all honesty, the Nic Cage version of "Gone in 60 Seconds" WAS one of my favorite movies, not CAR movies, MOVIES, period (I was in Film in college, I really like movies, I needed to make the distinction). I haven't been able to bring myself to even watch it since this trash went down, and honestly I don't think I will any time soon.   Clearly her legal team is simply cherry picking fans of the movies they think have money to try and squeeze what's left of the franchise to keep some money rolling in, and with a face that (in my opinion) looks like its had more work than either of your mustangs, I'm assuming its (allegedly) going to take a while to pay that shit off. I mean H.B. has been dead for 33 years, and the last movie (shockingly) came out in 2009, whose title I won't even mention in the off chance someone might actually funnel money towards this (allegedly) garbage human being. Time to find a new idea to run into the ground, ma'am.  I'm happy you're shifting gears and making a Shelby tribute build, I'm hoping its a fire-breathing, daily-drivable monster the first one should've been, a HELL-anor if you will. So glad you made this video, and so glad to keep watching. Thanks for doing what you do and letting us live vicariously though you and your teams exploits.  Also, if you named the car HELLanor it would be super dope. But I understand if you don't want to rattle that cage.  Cheers!   (Oscar did a great job on that car.)
2002?  That covid fudged your brain 🤣🤣
Can't believe this BS going as far! By the  way...whatching your and now your teams creations since 20k subscriber and it is still amazing to watch how far U brought your channel!!!
what are the 4 movies with Eleanor in ? i know the 2 gone in 60 movies. but i dont know the rest
What happened to the original build?
Call it the Marilyn....... Way more sexy of a name The Karen Stang? Build another and pick a Chick name, any name.
Man I can’t wait for that build 😮
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS !!!!
The body swap old mustang body and modern mustang internals, yes please continue. That's the only build unfinished. Now the technique will.be more improved from the previous one
Disney Corp. lobbied Congress to change Copyright Law  into the monster it is today.  Fight to return Copyright Law to its original intent and out of the hands of those that subverted the law for greed and control.
Excellent! It's great to see this all laid out, and to confirm where (we all knew, really) the credit was due. I support everything you do, Chris.
Hell ya! Can’t wait to watch the build. Shelby FTW!!!
Denice really ruined her husband's legacy huh hahaha serves that bitch right
Mrs Halicki, has a long history of trying to get money from Shelby manufacturers, and others like Chris, based on non-existent copyright.  But what would you expect from a woman who had sex with her cousin, Robert Kardashian.
Kick a$$ Chris, glad to see that they lost.
Sadly Carroll Shelby died in 2012.
Why can't I like this vid a million times.  I love this idea like I love my GM trucks ❤
Hell yeah brother!
Awesome. Can one sue for past bad judgment?
I was wondering when you would revisit this subject. I love the redemption build, but I would have loved to see the OG build.
Fantastic video bro wow. I'm shocked you didn't have a few beers during those stressful times lol, i know i would have.
It's BROKEN on PURPOSE❗
We have always stood behind you, good man!
Screw Them!
Yesss!
Gosh your like me if I had money 😂 *buys more mustangs* 😂
I’ve been waiting for this video from you! LETSSGOOO 😈🔥
🐺🖤🐧🐧🐧🏆🎉
Sorry man, I tried to help with the legal fees, but Paypal does not let me use their service anymore....
Dang! Take that Eleanor! Shelby is a GOAT
ahahah..good job
Built over 100 AC Cobra replicas over 20 years a while back. the consensus was, i am copying Carol Shelby's AC cobra. Well, if it wasn't for us and hundreds of other replica builders around the world, We The People would never be able to experience the freedom of building an absolute legend. Carol was a Legend in his own right, and even tried to stop Replica builders from making AC Cobras, he even sued a few with little success. In fact, Ford tried and failed as well, all due to Badges. Mercedes is the only one that has succeeded with the gullwing replica.
I found your channel on the first few video's of the E build and have loved this channel since. ON TO THE NEXT PROJECT
It's pretty much all Denise and her bs. I'm REALLY surprised Ford didn't step in and do a big backhand to the whole thing because ultimately it destroys their brand and we all know corporations are more important than individual people (that is sarcasm by the way, I know there is always one that takes it literal). I know for the longest time I chastised the car and anyone who showed one off after this debacle happened, even though I loved the movie. Greed on this scale is more ugly than a homeless crack addict camp. I know I got into it big time with AutotopiaLA for showcasing a "denise" approved car and the guy just couldn't understand my anger and frustration. I tried, in vain, to explain to him that if we do not boycott then people like that woman won't stop until they destroy the industry entirely. Everyone affected by this needs to go full court press and sue for legal fees and additional damages and talk to every reporter they can.
Greedy woman
It's great to see this issue settled and to see you move on in a positive way! I'm always impressed by the positive attitude Chris and the team has.  And it's also extremely disappointing this costly protracted legal battle was settled when a court finally evaluated the films, came to some obvious common sense conclusions and made a very clear decision.   It's possible those very dry remarks about "embellished facts" and actually "watching the films" was the court's way of calling out their peers for doing a truly terrible job with this case.
Yesss! I'm sending you an email with an Idea and a story!
so do you get your old car back?
Man the whole video I thought you were going to cuck out but you just go next level with the Shelby break down and now a Tribute car. There was a recent movie about Shelby it was, I think, for a car guy a good film that showed his passion. Edited to add movie title Ford vs Ferrari  Shelby building the LeMans winning GT40
Stick it to the man!!
Random weird detail, but Denice Halicki was once engaged to Robert Kardashian. Also, he was apparently her cousin. So, I guess shady legal stuff runs in the family, haha.
You should call it the "Carroll" build 😆
I'm glad you put this out ,payback by James Brown is the sounds.The rest well is history to Carroll shelby.
I feel like the builds definitely gonna be white with blue stripes. 🤷🏽‍♂️
4 movies? I only know Elenore from the nick cage, gone in 60 seconds.
dam finally it has been an eternal mystery for the past few years
Fantastic news #teamshelby
sue that bish for damages and get your car back just to send a clear message my man!!!
F|_|ck Eleanor!!! I loved those movies until I saw what they did to you!!! Anything "Gone in 60 seconds" or "Eleanor" related became a bad taste in my mouth after I watched hours of you building a car, just to get sued for copyright infringement! I've told many people about this because I love mustangs and I can't stand greedy people! To me, when people are copying you, you've done something right! Hurting them because "you did it first" only hurts you in the end! You were using the name Eleanor throughout the build. Anyone watching would have researched that name, came across the movie and watched it because of your build. This would have generated revenue for the franchise and boosted their sales in my opinion! Now that they have chosen to sue you I am totally against anything Eleanor related!!  I also work at an auto parts store and give my opinion on this subject to all my fellow mustang enthusiasts! Most agree with me and have your back!  F|_|ck Eleanor!! And f|_|ck that b!t$h and her crew!
2023 is gonna be epic!
Is it just me or the shelby gt500 was actually looking way better than the elanor. 😅
Bad ass!
Excellent choice!
It's all my opinion, please don't sue me!
I was so bummed when this happened to your guys. I can wait to see it come to life!
Bullies. Why.
Can you PLEASE find a way on the new build to somehow section the rocker or get the body down low enough so you don't have that weird giant rocker panel/sideskirt looking out of place on the car..  That caseys customs clown promised his build wouldn't be that way but in the end he couldn't pull it off either..  Be a hero and do the impossible.
You couldn’t GIVE ME Helicke AT THIS POINT. Clown people in clown world. Seems to me they are trying to copyright a WORD….i don’t think you can do that …. YET.  mr. Shelby is a legend!
Finally someone says Chip Foose.
Heck yeah my guy! Heck yeah…
This right here, a Shelby tribute car with some b is for build flair will be a stunner!
MURICA! So stupid
What bothers me the most is that you only used the elanor name and they came after you despite you weren't even building a replica of it and only a shelby gt500 with some of the touches of the elanor to do with the bumber that again is shleby design
Well said and done look forward to the Build :).
U guys made me like mustangs, I luv every build tho, u should take her back to court now, karma's a biatch
Counter sue their asses
I didn't even realize there were 4 movies..... They way over did it lol
The Eleanor copyright BS always drove me nuts because of what you said its Shelby's design just smoothed out a bit. I always thought Eleanor was over done. So the fact you want to dive into Shelby design. Awsome man. So happy for yah man . 😁👊👍
Spoken like a true gentleman.
I'm glad the courts finally came to a reasonable conclusion.  It was clear to anyone from the beginning that it was nothing but a cash grab.     Lesson of the day:  _Don't F*** with Caroll Shelby._
Ford and Shelby have far far more of a right if there are rights to a car reproduction. Shelby specifically.  Haliki has no rights to own a design of a car that is a modified Shelby. Doesn't make any sense to me.
A Shelby tribute build is way above any movie car
What happened to the one they made you stop building
F yeah!! I learned everything I needed to know the difference between the two cars !! Awesome!!
I heard Denise and my “Karen alert” went off in my head lol
yes! bro for some reason I had to redo my notification bell because I wasn't getting your video upload notifications. Works now, love b is for build.
I love your take on this and the lambo analogy was great too. Imagine changing a huracan with some skirts and bumper and now thinking that it’s now your IP and Lamborghini can’t make/sell any more of their own cars of which your design is based around… what?!   Fuck supporting people like Denise, I’m all for the s550 chassis with fast back shell swap in the name of a true legend Carol Shelby, not some movie that has left nothing but a sour taste in my mouth.  Great vid Chris.
Big win. You don’t need to build one.  Your rear engine SEMA mustang is the end all be all. Best modified mustang in existence and blows that old Elenor away.  Your builds are more sophisticated, interested and beautiful.  Love your stuff.
The vague copyright issue reminds me of when Apple tried to patent a rectangle with rounded corners.
Hell yeah
Ya were stupid for letting them take YOUR🫵 car dont ever let some one bully you
Don't forget the Chilli!
what 4 movies? i only know of the 1974 movie in which a 71 mustang was used and the 2000 movie where a 67 mustang was used. maybe there are 4 cars that are considered eleanor, being 2 in each movie. one in nice condition and one not in nice condition. the 71, one gets destroyed and then he steals another at a car wash. and then at the end of the 2000s movie they buy randall a 67 from a junk yard.
-  👍 👍 🔧 -                                               👀❤🤍💙                               Nice Job
I just want to see your Mustang returned to it’s rightful owner.
Wait so do you get your car back that they took from you?
I was saying this when this kicked off: in the pursuit of exclusivity Heliki excluded the fans. I'm happy that the courts finally gave a crap and stopped her from doing this to even more people. From what I've heard from other sources that was her MO of bullying builders with huge legal fees and "precedent." And much like the bully trope she decided to pick a fight with someone who was willing to fight back.
Does this mean you can repost the original videos back?
What happened to your hard work? Where did your E.......R go?
If two of the four movies that Eleanor has been in are the Gone in 60 Seconds movies, what are the other two?
I am glad for your team, Chris. I hope to see the build within 2023. It is going to be a great addition to the build series.
What are the four movies??
I love it! You kick ass! Simple as that.
Sucks you went through that but I'm glad some type of justice is served. My guess is that she's been having some not so nice social interactions as of late and is hopefully rethinking how she's treated folks in the past. I also applaud your(or your lawyers lol) obvious restraint during the recap of the story. Looking forward to the Shelby build!
In my opinion… Eleanor has been killed by its creators. In the movie they call it a GT500 and the car was his “Elenor” because he kept getting caught or wrecking the cars when he stole them. Elenor was never a casted character. It was a curse. Let me say that again in my opinion “Elenor” was never a single car it was a curse every time he stole a SHELBY! GT500 he wrecked it or was caught. When I was a kid I didn’t want an “Elenor” I wanted a SHELBY GT500. Because Elenor wasn’t a car Ever… period… thanks for fighting for common sense. Hopefully one day it will prevail in its entirety.
Looking forward to this build 🎉🎉🎉 not an American muscle type viewer but all this heat is just so nice. Do a Shelby appreciation meet once you’re done with the build.
Thanks for the update, best of luck with the upcoming Shelby tribute build.  A '67 that has all the bells and whistles of a 2019 GT is gonna be epic to drive!  Great idea.  Will be watching the entire build as always.
Okay, but where is you project? Cant you get him back, based of this recent events. Dont let that w h ore win
That last part where he says he’s gonna build a tribute car for him gave me the chills. He truly is an American icon and I see him as my hero.
We need Emily D. Baker to go over these legal documents! 😂
hell yeah man
Looking forward to this build. It will be amazing. Lawyers - go home!
Omg!!! Can't freaking wait.... whatta win for you Chris
What happened to his original car?
epic chris can't wait for the build
Honestly, screw Elanor and that movie franchise. That shrill karen of a human being has sullied the brand and intellectual property too much. I just see nothing but disappointment and bad vibes when I see any shelby in that color scheme even. If she wants it so bad, let her have it by herself, alone, without any further royalties coming in. Karma.
What a miserable woman. Hope Shelby cleans her out.
This is gonna be great. Fuck the Eleanor.
Hell yea. F**k the Eleanor name.
this is the best news in car culture for quite some time 23:13
Wow I love it! Been waiting for so long to hear this good news! Good job brother and good luck!
Hell yeah, brother! I support the Shelby legacy. Halicki and their serpent lawyers can suck it. Eleanor is dead to me.
Fuck Eleanor that white one you built for Sema was way way cooler!
So what happens with the car you guys already put your blood sweat and tears in.. anyway of getting that car back.?
Well said sir. Stoked for your new build!
Good for you! Thanks for sharing the back story of this entire Shelby fiasco. When this suit first broke, something seemed fundamentally wrong/autocratic/monopolistic about the "capture" /reclamation mechanism. Happy to hear that the chips fell in what seems to be a very logical place within the legal spectrum and that you are preparing for a reboot Mustang version in the future.
That was Great 👍
Well said Chris! Can’t wait to see the build
Lol 2002
Damn I'm so glad your fighting this cause this is the next generation Eleanor and the is no reason this car can even match even know you used the name. Keep grinding and get it back... can't wait to get my new gummy bear deodorant lol just ordered to try out...
Greed will land you in a world of destruction. A good movie and brand  has now been tarnished due to someone’s thirst for money.
Shelby comes back and sends a fake lawsuit just to mess with you 😂😂 wish you could get all your old stuff back so you didn't have to start from scratch but about time getting a solid update and excited to see the vision finally come to life
Should've invited Nicolas Cage to your shop while presenting this  :)
I really wish you had the money to take these asshats into a court and destroy them!  They robbed YOU of a great car and they robbed US of seeing an EPIC build!
So do you get your car back Chris?  This DickLickie chick really peaces me off!  Bastages!
So what exactly happened to your Eleanor that was going to be built on the channel. I’m guessing it’s gone as part of the “settlement” and you left that detail out on purpose but would love to know what actually happened.
Fight your fight bro, hell yea, this is why I recommend this channel to everyone, you never stop
Love your video and your explanation Chris, glad that its sorted out, , I honestly think you should counter sue for damages and loss of income - that lady needs a world of hurt for not only putting you through that, but also putting the whole car community through it... she clearly is NOT a car lover, just a hog for money and perceived power... I have a suggestion, you may or may not ever see this or react, and thats ok, but how about get Kyza to help design a kick ass daily-able 'tip of the hat' design to Carroll Shelby? nothing to bonkers, but a true modernistic respectful nod to a guy that will live on in car automotive history forever... just a thought - thank you for your time and efforts :)
Eleanor scandal left a bad taste in a lot of mouths. Glad that chapter was closed and you are on to bigger and better. Incredible how those goons destroyed a (formerly) iconic name.
Я тут как-то пытался объяснить, почему твой чудной мустанг такой странный и что это вообще не мустанг, а фейковый бугатти. И историю почему так вышло. В России никто не понимает этих заморочек. Все эти претензии звучат просто нак набор слов.
OH SNAPPPPPPP! Love this vid and Love to see that you're gonna be building the body swap version again as an homage to Shelby! Ps. If you ever figure out how to route side pipes on the body swap, let me know, haven't figured it out on my swap yet haha.
Can we get a Legal Eagle, B is for build calab?????
Chris, you are an American Hero. Cheers, brother!
Bravo Chris  this whole build you were doing was really great.I really wanted to see you pull it off and for it to be cut short in my opinion, really pissed alot of people off so sorry I posted the daylights out of this and tagged you in hopes you could get your car back glad to hear your plans moving forward
Flares and side exhaust pretty signature
2002, COVID?  Is B is for Build linked to The Simpson's DUN DUN DUN.   Maybe back to the future?
Immediately no.  10k for legal fees.  Rich guy tears soap and deodorant.  Goof.
Does this mean you could get your old build back?
I guessed you would build another "body swap" mustang...  but I KNOW....   I can damn near 100% guarantee I can predict what paint/color scheme it WON'T have.....😁😁
Ask  Mr Shelby first? lol.
Hey after all the legal s***just be sure that you don't piss off Shelby industries lol
Not sure I’d want to own an “Eleanor” now either. Damn Chris hope you getting some good sleep!
I have been for years for this
Also, her copyright is about the GREEN ONE not the silver one. From what I understand!
Thank you for making this video and explaining your situation.
W
Well said, well explained. Love your new direction!   Eleanor and the whole Eleanor car design really screwed their reputation with all of this BS. Glad to see common sense prevail!
Those suits look like a cash grab.  She is just searching for someone dumb enough to just pay out.
All I can say is… hell yeah!
Can't wait for your next build ...
Thanks, sounds like a real cool build.
Way to go Chris! Can’t wait to see this tribute build. What a win for the DIY car community as well.
Can't wait to see your Shelby brother :)
Wow, thank you for telling the story.
Bring it on!!!!!!!!  I can't wait for your new Mustang/Shelby build.
Glad to see the update.
Wow this really came full circle! What an amazing story that I’m confident you’ll be proud to tell friends and family for life. Great job, Chris. Can’t wait to see your build come to life in an even better way!
So what happened to the car they took away from you? (The GT 500 “Eleanor”)
You gotta get yours back
That’s crazy for them to go after you and others for Mustangs with Shelby designs in return to receive a cease and desist from Shelby. I’ll happy you’re honoring Carroll Shelby with the next Mustang build. Can’t wait for the notifications to pour in when you guys start it.
Was wondering when you would post a video about this.
Man the Eleanor folks need to chill. The only true owner to anything is FORD. And car makers don’t bitch over car culture, they embrace it! There’s been thousands of Nightrider KITT’s, Dukes of Hazard, Love Bug’s etc built over the years and that type of fanatic following creates a legacy! Why stunt the growth of your brand?! Fuck Eleanor!
Great update and great news. I support your decision to build this to represent someone who is a real hero- Carol Shelby!
Nice dude.  Congrats.
Inter Alia: means among other things.
Built mine in 92…. 65 Drag car (street legal)
Good shit.  I'm proud of you.  I'm glad to see Halicki's copyright completely invalidated, and I'm glad the Eleanor is not a copyrightable character.  They can pound sand.  Carol Shelby is an American legend and deserves a tribute more than any movie car ever did.  Can't wait to see how it turns out.  Keep on B is for Building some sick rides!
W video
LLLLLLLEEEEEETTTTTTSSSSSSSSS GGGGOOOOOO
Way to go Chris..full support on it..❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Do u get ur build back
If (Redacted) ever wanted to make themselves look bad, They sure accomplished it!
A god damn American Hero! *Salute*
Heck yes!!!!
I learned a lot watching this
stay away from these meme movie builds they are tacky overdone and at this point a meme, fast and furious cars and gone in 60 secs cars are lame asf, keep it OG and create your own concepts i can relate to that more.
Bravo
Can't wait
Let's go we back in the game. Can't wait for the build 💪🏽🔥
3:13 "started in 2002" bro needs some rest 😂
I love it!  Can't wait to see it come together.
If you showed me that pic but red or another color I would 1st this mustang 500 not eleanor
Hell yeah
I'm so happy 😭 I've waited so long to hear these words 🙏
Are they gonna give the car back or what?
so, _my_ question is: did you build oscar another mustang for _him_ or are you giving him your sema project? because i heard "my mustang" referring to it...
so, _my_ question is: did you build oscar another mustang for _him_ or are you giving him your sema project? because i heard "my mustang" referring to it...
What are the other 2 movies ?
Thanks for the video explaining the lawsuit! You definitely redeemed yourselves with Oscar’s car and your SEMA car, so Hala-whatever people can suck a lemon!
wow scummy.  should call the car Justice
Did they take the 2007
The first gt500 used cougar tail lights the next version used 65 Thunderbird tail lights.
2002?
I hope the price crashed 😂
Fuck yea
The funniest part is the "Eleanor" mustang she's trying to protect is a 1971 mach 1 mustang in the 1974 original gone in 60 seconds film produced by her father
You and your team sure stuck it to them with the SEMA mustang bud!! It’s a cross between the two different Elenors and you used and actual movie chassis to put the Cherry on top :) it makes me smile and hope it makes you feel good to the absolute core!! Hell yeah Chris that’s bad ass and congratulations to you and your team
Chris I love all you’re builds and your channel has been so cool to see grow. I remember your white gtr
You 100% should have fought this. You should have asked the community for help. This count have been fought and you could have won! Next time, trust the community and fight!
Ahh the video we’ve all been waiting for. Do we learn that the build got crushed? We’ll find out and I’ll update once watched.  And of course he doesn’t answer or even address that question. I’m assuming it’s because the lawsuit he lost demands he never talk about what happened to it.
Was it 2002 when you did this didn’t think I’ve been watching you that long haha
Shelby is like man f these Elenor guys
Immediately thought of you when I heard the news.
As soon as I saw that report, I came here hunting a reaction video.....   After not seeing one for a while, I Figured it was running the red tape gauntlet with your legal team.   good to hear how shady the whole thing still comes across after legal censored it
2002 is way before covid, prehaps you meant 2020?
Well that makes me feel better in selling my Ford 😅
Deff would love ls frs brz
Didn’t they take his car?
The woman that owns that copyright is an extortionist, ruining what is still a super cool concept of a car.
Hey mate didn’t know we had Covid in 2002, you mention it around the 3 minute mark
"This all started for me around 2002, a couple months after Covid hit."  Whoa whoa whoa, am I missing something here?
I COULDN'T HAVE CLICKED FOR A VIDEO FASTER EVER BEFORE
Random midnight BifB episode! And a very awaited one! 👀
F them and F eleanor
What isn't 2020
He said 2002
2002? After covid hit?
I don’t think Covid hit right after 2002!!😂
Hello Yall 👋
the hell... this is a late drop, but well liked...
2002 covid hit 😂😂😂
I'm too early to go to the comment for TLDR/W
Refreshed my feed at the perfect time lol
One thing if you were making them "plural" to sell. You weren't, it is just an icon car.. get it back!
Thank you Chris
I still call bullshit
Wish yall would be re compensated for your other project that got crushed because of these mf
best of luck
1st
