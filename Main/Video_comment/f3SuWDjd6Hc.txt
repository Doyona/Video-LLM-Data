how do you like the new additions ? and how do you think the new squad will do ?
With lebum lakes is a joke team
That training jersey looks better than the statement jersey
If I was the Lakers coach, I would make Lebron do 100 push-ups every time he thinks he has to go with bath slippers on the court 😀
Cole is my man 🍊 forever you guys got a 🪣 geterrr
Sa pactice shooting magaling ang Lakers..
All: 3 points are scored in good sneakers LeBron: In slippers.

Look like AD is gaining weight
compared to the chicago bulls training it seems a lot more kick back and playful
Its the lebron fanbased that hates russ Lmao🤣
Man u stupid to be honest .. i like russ to but you wont win anything with this man expecially at his age now forget about it .. they make the playoffs but they will not see the conference finals, there is no way this team just not good enough
3 LA Chokers
Poverty franchise
Lebrick and Westbrick is the greatest duo of all time
Lacrybby is no Goat needs a super team to win a championship. Alwys looking for the easy way out ring chasing CHUMP
Waooo
AD got injured here
meanwhile in GSW's practice nobody is missing from 3. we better play big and power them up.
So excited to see you again Lakers playing..new squad, new faces to watch. Hope this season will gonna be great. 💜💛🫰
Westbrick gogogo xd
Russ is a liability
Omg I'm so excited..
These Lakers can’t hit three in a row in practice yet Steph is out here making hundreds of threes in a row. #different
I like Cole swider match with Klay Thompson
Leflipflops
As a L4L fan, i now see why coach Ham is being loved by all already!!! Totally agreed with everything he is selling so far.  Only one thing caught my attention out of all his comments. ( playing FAST???) I look forward to the all star break!!! Hehe
The clippers managed to build their own home arena in LA With all the bricks made by LeBron, Russ, and AD.
Russ bring back you're triple double!!!! seasons🔙💥
Russ back
Picking up a player with all the. Team heads advice is a Kobe ....  Spirit that would place a positive mentality when in possession of the ball and instead of worrying if he belongs ...   Hello. Yea. He belongs. ... Baby. Westbrook.  They. Brought you. ...   Now. They have. To. Support you ..   that's. The MAGIC AND. KAREEM AND KOBE. WAY. AND. NOW. ITS. UP TO THE KING TO HELP AND HUDDLE ALL THE STARTING PLAYERS TO BE ON RHAT SAME POSITIVE FEEDBACK. WITH WEST ...
Not a good sign that they all miss
Those shots easy to Steph xD
Ok new season everything fresh lets go late show
It's a beautiful thing to see them practicing together. That's all they need to build their chemistry together as a unit. Don't tear Russ down. We need to build up this man who has given so much to the game of basketball.
Tomara que este ano o time tenha um desempenho melhor e consiga brigar pelo título de campeão! Mesmo morando no Brasil o Lakers mora no meu coração deste a minha juventude!
They are looking healthy, i definitely think they can challenge the splash brothers and their gimmicky offense 😳
Pat Beverly 👌👌👌💪💪💪
Russ will never shoot the same way in the games!
Aa
They have a crutch ready for AD😭😭
HAPPY, HAPPY,  HAPPY to see our roster. Let's stay posiive and pray we won't have any wounded during and after the season so we can have an amazing playoff. Hopping the media will stop feeding negative distractions that could after the moral of our players. My expectation is for the best and excellence.
Just let the players play their game. When you're a die- hearted fan, you keep supporting and encouraging your team. Most fans only care about winning so they are very disrespectful. A strong force behind these guys will make them victorious.
We all know dat Bron gon win 🤣
Who won 🤔
Be careful AD.  Don't want you to be out 3-4 weeks
RIP!
I'm looking at the Lakers games last year before all the injuries happened and they were playing good Westbrook is definitely going to get less minutes with the starters but more minutes with the bench rotation and I think he'll look like his normal self and the players they're bringing in it's looking like Davis will play Center alot which in today's NBA Davis is the best "Small" ball lineup Center that you can ask for.... Idk why people sleeping on this team Plus this amazing new coaching staff!!!
The surprise this year is going to be Lonnie Walker! I’ll bet you Lebron had something with him coming to the team…. He is a hidden talent that wasn’t appreciated by Coach Popovich
Russ doing that massive jump almost looked like cgi
In order for this to work I will say it again Bron has to let Russ b the point he has to b Mj or Scottie 33 let Russ put everyone in there spots jus run and score the ball that’s it Russ can do that
Lakers fans just shut up and accept Russ....Y all hurting but he is on a NBA team and y all sitting down in your room playing video games with your lazy as*
Only in practice actual games nothing to prove..
https://youtu.be/YmU9LipWjSI
Just like clay 🔥
My boy bacon
Russ shouldnt be doing thress in games he's more of a slasher type guy
My man have a bad season. Why are you guys trashtalking Him when he only messed up 1 season? My man has been a beast at OKC for YEARS
Lakers could use a better center and some more shooters look for a trade mid season. I don’t like the roster. Too too heavy
Russ is so inefficient man and the team has no depth they will barely make the playoffs if anything. Lebron age and injuries will be even difficult for the team to overcome
Y’all go bump my music 🏂💜
practice rub of the saw  baseline who ad risk play all la wants. meek
https://youtu.be/YmU9LipWjSI
lebron is the worst 3pt shooter of them all
Training camp but no seriously to the practice
Feel like the lakers are handling the media well they got a good squad so far I think they going to surprise this upcoming season
Ima Russ fan but I’m basically Lakers Nation at this point 😂
Make sure daddy's boy gets in
Westbrook won the contest for most side of backboard shots
El cuatro, we miss you. From spurs fan 🖤
If Russ hit more 3's than everybody, the Lakers are in trouble.
Good luck Lakers ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am from Iran, please be our voice ✌🏽🖤 #mahsaamini  plz

These lakers pretty good! Wow!
Pride night are you kidding me I will boycott the Lakers
Boycott NBA
Eliminated in play in tourney...even playing better. The league is too much for these clowns.
Let's go Russ ❤️
leotard jane .
This is a great group of guys!!! Let's Go Westbrook
Russ is right up there with the biggest wastes of 47 million in the history of money.
mad props to the camera man
Screw China James
Let's go russ you know this your get back season. Niggas had you fucked up last year. Let's get it brodie
Steph can hit 100 in a row
Personal accountability is underrated. All these flowers for Russ is great but everything that has happend to him with Lakers is self inflected. Vogul was his biggest supporter and just like when he was in OKC know one really challenged him to elevate his game from his college game. He is the same guy now in 2022 that OKC drafter back in 2008. His shot isnt better , he never played defense and his decsion making as a pg hasnt changed. I like his energy but energy with no intellegince is useless.
Hopefully AD mae it through this shoot around without injuring himself. 😏
I’m happy we are back in training camp. Enjoying the vibes. Let’s keep elevating. Let’s go Lakers Nation.
Havent watched the vid but im betting russ lost
You matter  https://youtu.be/nTaym1ye-cg
The world competes against each other, but the body of Christ builds each other!
LaFlop fell 3 times looking for a foul.
Sign Dwayne bacon
Russ ALWAYS looks good in practice. So nothing to get excited about. AD looked like his head was someplace else. He looked non motivated.
When Russ gets wide open threes in a game he need to shoot the ball the way he is practice shooting.  In games Russ jumps really high on his shots and I believe that throws him off a little on the shot.  Notice how Steph Curry shoot his threes.  He don't elevate high unless a defender is in his face.
people in Iran are fighting for their human rights. be their voice, they need support 💔#MahsaAmini
Was this a three point contest? I thought they were building a house with those bricks.
West brick can shoot now? Cool amazing
ngl where was this last season 0:22
brick contest
Fun to watch and all but it's early practice. Even fringe NBA guys are so good, they all look like they can shoot (even the ones that can't) I do hate to read all this racist sh*t about Swider. I don't care if he's green or purple, if he can play great, if not so be it, but I'm for all to stfu about his race.
So ain't nobody gon give russ his props on actually shootin better than LeBron n Ad? Yall lowkey talkin about everything else u feel yall but focus on the main thing n be men this ain't gossip girl tf
God bless you
i'm sorry but the camera makes me dizzy!!!
AD hurt his knee during the shoot around and will be out for 4-6 months.
Dwayne Bacon cameo!?
1:0300 👀
Lakers rotation my opinion C Davis low post scorer and shot blocker Pf James go to scorer and playmaker Sf Cole swider stretch shooter  Sg walker slasher and perimeter defender Pg Westbrook playmaker, slasher   Bench Schoerder playmaker n perimeter defender Beverly energy guy n full court pressure defender Reeves spot up 3pt shooter Bryant low post scorer and 3pt shooter Jones low post defender  Brown perimeter defender and slasher Bacon scorer  Christie 3pt shooter Tsa shooter and perimeter defender Nunn playmaker n scorer and slasher
Jesus loves you all give Him a chance none are promised tomorrow and I promise you, we will all stand before Him when we leave this world. ❤
Move to China if you want to be slaves.
I hope Lakers win it all just to shut up all the haters
if this would be in a actual game where they were like lightly covered it would be the worst display of 3 pt shootong EVER
Keep practicing bois. You might be good someday But not you queen
Lachina James the China ccp operative,,, pos non American!
Westbrick can hit a 3 when no one is in his face, no shot clock, no crowd noise, no pressure.
Lebron taking easy bto
Need a better camera man
Really hoping for russ to be a all star again
What a bunch of worthless clowns.
Tell LeBrown to shut up and dribble
COLE SWIDERRR
my goodness would you just pan the camera back and stop trying to follow everyone. horrible video shooting
meanwhile Steph is shooting 50 straight somewhere, casually :)
West BRICK BRICKING MORE SHOTZ!
Westbrick getting ready to shoot more bricks for the Lakers this season.
Ham to AD “when you have the ball, just take it, don’t pass.” Ham to Bron “when you have the ball, only pass to AD.” Ham to Rus “when you have the ball, just pass it, pass to anyone.”
Russ is to busy trying on dresses 😊gtfoh we need new younger players that just wanna play basketball
Russ looks great. Can’t wait to see Him get comfortable. First consecutive season in the same jersey in a long time.
I'm excited to see Swider this season,  I'm predicting he gets a similar start to his career like Reaves.
Plot twist: Steph Curry won
Only thing bad about this is the camera work. You have 1 job…
Rare footage of the dude from space jam playing with a brick and a shard of glass
Aaaaaah the look at me me me tour continues
And there is also Cold Sniper.
look at bron acting happy to still have russ lol
I didnt know the NBA was using guardian caps.
Jesus Christ Can Save You! Repent & Believe The Gospel! Eternal Life Is A Free Gift! Hell is Real!!
AD needs to worry about getting to the rim
who is coach David Fizdale ?
Come on Westrook, I'm rooting for you if no one else is!!! I admit, he had his worst season last year (& still averaged 18ppg 7rpg 7apg which isn't too shabby let's be real). Hopefully he bounces back this season with all the key players being active and healthy. Westrook should focus on reducing his turnovers and not miss as many open looks as he did last season. Although a trade appears to be imminent and on the cards after the acquisitions of Beverly and Schroder?
They should have a free throw contest
They have good chemistry but last year nobody could stay healthy Russ is a beast I think he will dominate this year and they have a good chance of winning if healthy sign MELO what ya'll waiting for
No typa 3 AD ://
Russ gone prove everybody wrong this season
Cole swider would be a big problem for defenders if he’s out there with bron and AD you can’t leave him open at all and it takes a man away from helping
Sadly, this is what's wrong with the Lakers.  Lebron turned the best back -to- the- basket big man in basketball into a spot-up 3pt shooter.
Westbrook still with Lakers na ..
360
This is a winning culture?
We just witnessed one of the 48 rule to success!!! Never show up the top dawg.
Russ keep doing wat u doing one of da 🐐
Pairing Beverley with Russ could possibly bring out the best in Westbrook.
1:24 AD too cold 🥶
Russ changed his shot mechanics and it is working, that's why everybody is happy 😄
Coach Phil Handy has crunches ready  just in case of AD hurt himself 🤣
They will not win a championship this year! That’s it!
All 3 of them should give that shot up none of them making it when it counts  consistently 👀  working on something else🤔 like running a offense??
Let's not work on our chemistry, let's jack up three pointers...  -the goofy Lakers🥱🥱
Swider looking niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiioooce (In Stu Lantz voice).
Why is he still there?? 🤡🤭 I thought he will be traded???
AD looking leaner or is it just me. Hopefully he gets to play 100% of the season
Swider > Kuzma
BRICK CITY
The responses are HILARIOUS! If they don’t play DEFENSE & REBOUND for 48 minutes they’re not gonna win anything!!! EFFORT & HUSTLE is their problem! Vogel was the same as Ham & if this team doesn’t match the INTENSITY of other teams who want to beat our @sses up & down the court they’re done, every 5 minutes they can’t repeat that LACKADAISICAL play they pulled last year! BOTTOM LINE IS EFFORT, HUSTLE, HEART & NOT PLAYING guys for long extended times like a whole quarter which makes NO sense!!! Gotta rest players not wear them out!
I don't give a rat's ass if Westbrook makes 100 three point shots in a row. It's practice. Plus, he'll ALWAYS be an average 29% bricklayer from that space. I just wish that sum bitch was somebody else's 47 million dollar problem this year. Can't stand him in the purple & gold! 😡
Lonnie walker gone be a problem
Roster should be Front court players  James  Davis Bryant Jones Swider Tsa Bacon Ryan  Backcourt Beverly Brown Walker Westbrook Shoerder Reeves Pippen Jr
Thanks for uploading this looking forward for more of Lakers practise clips
Anybody who understands basketball can tell Russ has been working on his game. That’s the best response to critics.
Just need AD to stay healthy and the rest will fall into place
That crutch is not a good look tbh
With Kawhi coming back will this team even get into the play ins lmao
*0:55* *Ok Google, how do I stop rewatching this all the time???🤔*
I don’t know
The worst roster in the league
Those training jerseys are awesome
Lord please keep Bron and AD healthy all season long and please cure Westbrook of whatever was killing him mentally
The one thing I notice us how many negative comments our Lakers fans have...it's almost comical, are you guys fans or haters? My goodness, the season hasn't even started and I'm tired of y'all already...can we root FOR our team not against them?
Cole Swider!!!! Dude!
I'm really hoping AD can stay healthy for the team, if he can just be that same animal when he came then we'd definitely be contenders for sure!
Everyone’s a sniper in practice
I hope every game is just a practice so russ will make his basket efficiently
Hmmm! This team stands a chance if Bron and AD are healthy.   Lonnie Walker has talent. If Cole Swinder can give a Duncan Robinson-like presence with the vets… I like it.   Lakers will be HUGE, mobile and have spacing.   Also wishing Dwayne Bacon well. He’s a professional scorer. If he can contribute off the bench… then we’re on to something
Looks like Lonnie really does want to step up his defense. Good to see!
Imagine having this many misses with the warriors 3 point contest each one they miss is prob like 5 min off of play time
No disrespect. But who is the white guy? His play looks good.
I think they gone shine together!
they look trash already. this gonna be a bad season
I'm just impressed about how Ham's vision, approach to the game. I really looking forward to see it with the implementation. He has a younger team than Vogel, so that is already an advantage.
Dwayne Bacon 👏
https://youtube.com/shorts/zCLVZBjOTHY?feature=share
I always like bacon wen he was on the hornets
You gotta love how Russ is just the same dude no matter what's happening around him.
Super curious to see our 2 and 3rd unit line ups. Interested to see how players like d bacon, Scottie pippen, and cole swider could be utilized
I’m surprised AD didn’t get injured in their shootout
I actually want Russ to be triple double Russ and win a championship for his hometown. It would be a nice redemption story!!!
really hope this is a healthy season man
But where is kendrick
Swider is definitely a steal he looks like klay out there just give him some time
Game show not talk?
6:10 is this the cole swider ya all talking abt ? Looks decent from jumpers . !! I m excited ✨🥳
How is 18-7-7 a bad season 😂 poor Russ lakers fan are trash fr
We’re in for a rough year😂🥰🫰
What is the name of the white dude wearing gray shirt and purple shorts that COULD SHOOT LIGHTS OUT?, NOTHING BUT NET, Lakers need definitely ❤️👍. Pura Vida
What is the name of the Caucasian dude wearing gray shirt and purple shorts that COULD SHOOT LIGHTS OUT?, NOTHING BUT NET, Lakers need definitely ❤️👍. Pura Vida
Who is the white guy? He moves and shoot like Klay
Why to many attack on russ yet AD is not full time playing 😁 russ do his thing... He do rebound while what are some doing?
Before I watch the video we know whose not winning🤣🤣🤣
No offense I know its training camp but they need to stop having fun and practice.. other teams getting prepared
Swider looking like Klay, Man a Walking Bucket
Keep Russ in LA 🔥
My G.O.A.T. Russ is looking tuff here!!!!!
Lonnie Walker gonna avg like 18 a game watch 🔥💯
Russ nunn Bron troy brown ad starting 5?
43-39
Lebron looks pissed af.
I'm waiting to see what Nunn is going to be like when he gets back.
I know it’s only day 2 of training camp but I’ve seen enough of Cole Swider give that man minutes please
It's all even.
All I'm going to say is get AD away from them crutches he doesn't need to see or hear about anything involving injuries.  He got osmosis when it comes to being injured
The chemistry was wayyyy off last year its takes a while to build the right infrastructure and they seem happy its going to be a better year than last this sport takes chemistry watch my boys work we just need to stay healthy
Stop with all 3’s you bums, take it in the paint like man and you idiots might win a few games
Please have a redemption season Russ 🤞🙏💯
i think this year is gonna be russ year for sure he needs to prove himself .
Who the hell is boul from the 4 minute mark to the 6 minute mark draining every damn shot
Lakers will go no where this season .(bad roster)..The speed bag don't hit back ! !
Cole Swider deserve a slot for lakers roster
8 seed incoming
I’m not a laker fan, but I honestly feel like laker nation should be excited for next season because honestly y’all kind of have no choice but to improve. For one y’all will prolly be more healthy than last season, no way Russ plays that poorly again with a year of chemistry under his belt. The lakers should look a lot better this season
BROWNS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS 12 tribes of Israel we are God chosen people the real Hebrew Israelites of the earth we are the real Jews repent
That is not Lonnie walker😳
Lakers suck
This season Lakers is a happy team .
Russ being na great leader??! I hear he a great teammate. So if this translate Russ back to being Russ?! I pray so because the media had a field day with his last name this past season
3pt contest my ass you’ve been not even entered play offs last season
betting site should now put how many games till AD gets injured.
https://youtu.be/0WxmIDrQg-k
JTA on the lakers!?
Lonnie n Bacon was a good pick up. Didn’t even know
TBH YALL NEED RUSS ……….he should embrace his new role he a legend n my eyes
Three barely shooting mfs
play-in here we come
I don’t know what it is but AD just looks soft
Lonnie is such a great pickup.  Hope to see him play well
Man. Don’t let skip bayless see this lol
The thing I notice that's different with LeBron or AD, Russ versus Warriors practices is the level of concentration. Those boys in San Fran don't mess around, every shot goes through the net, and they put in 1000s of reps. I can't even picture one of them wearing flip flops on the court. Ever.
Doesn't matter. AD will get injured half the season, Westbrick will keep bricking and Lebron is 100yrs. They ain't winning shit.
❤Search miracles of the holy "Quran" / "Qadir khutba"!
when they all missed the second shot I got nervous lol they look like they having fun though
AD need to be working on mid range and post moves smh same results
Lakers better hold on to Swider and not let a team like GS get they hands on him...the Lakers tend to let a lot of good talent walk
As a certified Russ fan since his OKC days lol u can tell that man hungry he coming with it this season just watch lol wouldn’t be suprised if he averages another trip doub and the lakers get a top 4 seed
This year is a redemption year for russ!!! 🤞💪
So ready for this season 🏆
Russ’ jump shot changed it looks like. Quicker release, pray this man has an ok-great year.
Who is the white guy at 5:00 draining shots?
Looks somewhat different from Steph's & Klay's shooting practices 🤣
AD never looks like hes practicing hard, dude needs more intensity
Swider reminds me of klay Thompson
Cole "Swish" Swider 🏀👌🔥
Bru of course leGM pulls up in slides
I’m happy they got younger. They definitely showed they’re age last year. It’s refreshing seeing some young guns on the team that’s going to give maximum effort
LeFlipflops
Russ nice lil shot looks better
Let’s forgive Russ
Lakers are one of the worst constructed "superteams" in NBA history. You can't fix bad fit without getting rid of the bad pieces.
They should've brought Monk back instead of Shroeder.
Almost like they want him there, they should help him fit, some kind words and great attitude go a long way
That blonde reporter tho...
Where the fuck is the 3 point contest
it is kinda cool to see so many randoms in this video that you never saw before that look fire,  that you know may not even make it to the rotation but still is better than any random ball player.
Yo! In Golden state they had the splash bros, then the splash trio now its a Poole party! But out in LA they got their own kinda party it started with the duo of LBJ and AD combining to make the Brick Bros, now with the addition of Westbrick we have The Final Piece of the Band.  The Bricklets.  Coming to an arena near you!
I would’ve got Marc Jackson as a head coach.
Gotta love Russel Westbrick and Anthony Brickdis
I love to see AD having a good time I would love it more to see him working on his frail body 😩
yo, just put bron back to PG and russ at wing/slasher/ off-ball player.. I swear this team will do good.
What kinda practice is this LA we gotta do better guys
Starting lineup I can see: Russ, Lonnie, Bron, AD, Thomas  or Russ, pat or Lonnie, Troy, Bron and AD
mark my words Bron gone get all the young talent traded just like he did with lonzo and Kazuma dude his a great athlete but will fuck yo roster up 🤦‍♂️😂
Lebron has the new fake hair and the shirt off probably with some new non fda approved supplements.
Is AD wearing a wig?
Can already see Ar15 and "Cold Cole" (Cole Swider) being a devious duo in the future if developed correctly.
Quero muito que o Westbrook dê a volta por cima, ele é um cara bom de grupo, tralhador e merece ser campeão
expect championship ring.
Hamunin nila gsw😅
We should win 50+ games this year
I literally dk who 98% of these mfks even are..?
Let's go Lakers 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
yet another bust season for Bron, not saying they'll be bad but I just can't smell Nba Finals with this team and Bron one of the players that plays Championship or bust seasons
Ad 🙏🏾 please stay healthy this season
LeBron shooting in sandals 😂
Imagine how comical this is for a guy that just spent an entire season with Steph, Klay and Poole. 😂😂😂
i am almost as athletic as Westbrook when Russel is a sleep of course
I’m cheering for Westbrook so hard bro , like I wanna see him succeed in our colors so bad . I believe in you Russ 🫶🏻 watch him quiet all the non believers
I’m keen for Lonnie Walker aye, he’s putting in some work
Nothing but bums on this team
Forget about Russ for a sec.  Taking bets: AD will get hurt in training camp. Still hardheaded and doesn’t do enough to protect his ankles
Good shooting ranges by Cole swider..
damn, AD looking really fresh with that haircut
Russ shooting form, looking improved
No surprise AD clanking those 3s
3 old bum contest
I give russ this. He could have been a cry baby like Simmons and harden and refuse to play but he hasnt
500
I love Lebron's snickers!
This is the worst Lakers ever I have ever seen. Russ is still here. He proved that he does not fit in playing with Bron and AD. Also, there is no big trade in the off season. The roster is too bad.
Golden State would never miss so many open 3’s😂
the warriors can hit 100 in a row
Lakers taking it all!!!
was that lonnie walker without the hair ? dude is buckets !
Early exit
Expect the unexpected this year. ✅
watching this makes me want to throw up
Cole swider's jump shot is butter
I just want Darwin to keep his pipi in his pants. We’ll be fine.
Cole Swider going crazy in the workout meanwhile Lonnie doing dumbshit💀🤣
every fuckin year we see russ have a great jumpshot form in training camp, none of that 2 step herky jerky bullshit, and then we get to game 1 and its back to the 2 step shit. Praying to god he can keep the form good this time lmfao
Lakers will be lucky to get to the Playoffs with this Team!!  SAD
Lakers will make playoffs
russ can definitely improve his shooting, if he doesn't have to jump very high and release the ball at his apex.
yup lakers are fkeeed! thanks for video proof.
Swider is the next allay but bigger and stronger
Why does swider remind me of Klay Thompson a little bit lol
Big3 james Anthony n west.
Cole swider 🙌🏽
Dude really getting paid to stand there in cargo shorts bruh
Cool
all im wants westbrock need stop turnovers and stop shooting brick shots and gets defensive player
Wtf was that Dwayne bacon?
Don't sleep on laker hamm got plan ad looks in shape n dey playin wit a chip on shoulder no cap lol stay safe RIP PnB Rock pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze 🙏
LeDurag James
At this point any div 1 school can out shoot the Lakers
This team is doomed. If they wont hustle, they will not even come close to playoffs
cole swider will be the next x factor of this Lakers roster this season..
Ad looks like 19% from 3 bron look old af and no one here cares we just having fun and being old like ad
Lakers suck jenniembus and rob pa Dinka suk more LeBron can’t shoot neither can any laker .
During games it’s in his head
JTA gonna be the new Patrick McCaw man ... everywhere he goes they win a chip xD.
Russ doesn’t deserve to be a Laker… why is he there 🥹
I'm happy for you Russ
AD’s fooling everybody again, he’s the same guy as before y’all will see.
Dwayne bacon wowwwww hope he makes the lineup
Dude with the camera... I'm dizzy!
Dodnt realize that was juan seating there
Cool
They're already having fun during practice; you know what that means...another losing season. [whoever recorded this is trash for not keeping steady]
Russ needs to get the layups and mid range shooting down first. A.D. needs to be working on Kareem’s sky hook and Hakeem’s dream shake.
They mid season form already 😂😂
That kid swagger has a klay style I feel like lakers have copy of one the splash brothers 😂but he has a good 3 point shot
hella bricks 💀
Cole Swider taking that final spot
Dey got Dwayne Bacon…
Cole Sniper
Pls trade Westbrick 🙏🏼
I really feel Swider's gonna be the first sharpshooter of Lakers, he's gonna be fire on the court if he continues that shooting skill..
& hes still shooting bricks in practice😂😂
They still not making the playoffs 😂😂😂
Love the chemistry
cole swider!!!!!
Cole Swider remind me of Klay he gone be monumental
What’s this bricking contest
AD needs to sit down before he gets hurt for the season
If Russ can atleast shoot like Harden. thats a threat
Wow my bagong shooter na ung Lakers cgorado Nayan sa play offs
It’s incredible how so many of them knock down shot after shot in practice
Swider can more or less play defense like Melo did last season. Hopefully Pat can really get his teammates thinking defensively like how to guard certain guys, last year I saw Melo guarding DeAaron Fox close asf and all the way at the 3pt line.
Whether ur a Laker fan or a Russ fan or not, the world really wants to see Westbrook finally get a ring. He deserves it through all the shit he has gotten his career and all he has put his body through
useless old player
If you ever called Westbrook Westbrick your a FAKE ASS LAKERS FAN! 💯 cause your favorite NBA player is Skip Bayless!
the 3 stooges. all 3 are scrubbies.
They suck
Trade Russel for Tyler herro ❤️❤️❤️
I just don't like the way he acts or dresses. Lol. All that extra he was doing was like aren't u even afraid for ur job? All that walking round talking made my nerves bad. Watch him and cam Newton start a clothing line. Lol
LeBron, Russ and AD 3 point contest? Why does that sound so wrong
Don’t let skip Bayless see this 😂😭
Phil Handy: I have the crutches ready AD.
Ham seems to have a better grasp of what to do over Vogel
Lol LeBron won easy
AD still wearing fuckin low tops. With the comments about not changing up anything in regards to hiz workouts and STILL wearing those  low tops, he has to be the most delusional fuck I've ever seen. Just a matter of time before Mr glass breaks again
I was expecting AD to be injured while playing in practice lmao
Lebron on those flip flop though!!!
Glad to see Dwayne Bacon playing for the NBA and not Overseas
1:23 First he missed 3 Three pointers then he goes and misses a lay up
Can’t wait to see media outlets take this video and miss analyze it & turn it into something it’s not
The shortest 3-point contest ever
Look as bad that is supposed to be.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Loudest guy in the room = biggest clown = Westbrick 🤮🤮🤮
Russ is also an overpaid L
If it looks like Russ, shoots bricks like Russ, turns it over like Russ, and complains like Russ then it probably is Russ. Russ is who he is,  everyone needs to stop thinking somehow this dude is miraculously something different because of a summer off.
AD IS a massive overpaid L
Smoke in mirrors  🙄.
Let's go LAKERS!!! I can feel the title already... Lakers 2023 NBA champions 💪
cole can let it go fr
They’re trying so hard to look like a team
can u do these for the rest of the week lol if u don’t mind i enjoy watchin these 😂
All this shows me is we cannot hit the 3 even this year 😢
This was fun to watch I hope they have a great season Everybody seem happy and chill
i don't know how this season is gonna go but i do know there are gonna be a lot of highlights cause we have a lot of high flyers lol. Lebron, AD, Russ, Lonnie, Damian Jones, Juan Anderson, Nunn if he's healthy.  We definitely have a lot of speed and athleticsm. It's just the lack of wing and shooting that very concerns me.
LeFraud and the Fakers ft. Street Clothes and WestBrick!!!
AD such a brick bro
Who says that Westbrick could shoot 3s💀💀💀💀💀
Why is AD practicing THREE POINTERS!!!!? This is the exact opposite of what he should be doing. Practice getting your 10 foot tall azz on the block!
Expose
Rob pelinka must be fired, should he trade away Russ and our 2 draft picks....... he's made some senseless decisions as Lakers GM.... he's not looking out for RUSS. but speaks the same language of racist, white, meatheads media.... Should've never brought in bonehead Frank Vogel as Lakers'head coach in the first place... that's why we're having all these problems. all the blames should rather be on Rob pelinka and Vogel, not Russell. Pelinka gutted a championship team, and brought in old heads and legs, with the intention of winning a title. on the other hand, he also hired  a so-called Bonehead in Frank Vogel, as head coach..... by Laker standards, both decisions were  completely reckless .  It's the most senseless decision ever made in the history of sports by a GM......Rob pelinka.  Miss. Buss better stop the media's attack on Russell. else, we will take to social media and demand her step down, or sell the franchise.....Dr. Buss would have never allowed such madness!  Lakers land must never allow any player , who wares the Lakers uniform to  be treated inhumanely, by allowing white, racist, meatheads medias to use their platforms and racially assassinate Russell Westbrook's and his family's character.  This is complete witch-hunt against Russell and his family, by white, racist, boneheads and their platforms....it  has got to stop now! NBA commissioner better step in and put these racist, good for nothing clowns in their places.... Until then, I consider   Lakers and the entire NBA,  a racially organized cult ...
Aye I’m ngl we need to give this man cole sniper that last spot he look like he got IT😂
AD cut yo fuckin hair dawg come on bruh. Lookin like a damn fool
Coach there just acting because camara there take them to mountains trails and leave then there one a phone they have to work as one to get back to camp then we see
Who’s the lady at 9:20
Hope Russ can turn things around
It looks like a lot of playing around going on. Not alot of focus. And where is pat bev ugly ass?
Happy Russ!!!
If we get our defensive caliber back to 2020 standards, then I like this team.
I would love to see K.J Martin, Boogie Cousins, & Scottie Puppen Jr. On the Roster Opening Night
Lonnie Walker is a great addition to the squad
Cole swider will fill up shooters that what we need . Hopefully he can get playing time...  S
The rim needs a cigarette and a realignment now
How many of you fans watched when we had lottery picks in 16 and 17.. been a long road since Kobe retired.. crazy seeing those picks being legit pros in the league now and all gone..... future is gunna be tough and yes I know that's how the Lakers have been but still.. always gunna believe in the Lakers but last season was a joke.. yes they were injured but lebron played way to many minutes.. and once he sat we could actually play some defense.. hopefully he's coachable this season and understands his limits.. man's pushing 40 so there's no reason for him to play 35+ minutes
Clase rey de los cronistas que no le dan su lugar a otros muy  pero muy buenos jugadores.
Como siempre a LeBron le buscan jugadores que le hagan el trabajo y luego se excusa por no clasificar.
This camera work kinda mid
Shoutout to Russ for still being a cool dude among all of the shit
I see the reserved crutch for AD on standby 😂
Repent of sin and seek Jesus Christ for salvation and healing! He loves you and He’s coming back very soon. Hell isn’t worth it! God bless! ✝️❤️
skip bayless gonna have a field day tomorrow about that 3pt contest  lmao
Idk why this is making me think about Kobe 😢
Cole Swider can be a deadly Sniper💥🔥
Cole Swider got some shades of Klay Thompson in his game. He will be good!
For the love of the game.
That white guy is trash he's missing everything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 sweating like a ***🤣🤣🤣🤣
Primetime for Swider
Will they win at least one preseason game this year? Stay tuned.
Russ😂😂😂😂😂 MANE DAMN!!!!
After all the Westbrook slander I have done… I’m finish.. he taking his L on the chin and playing thru it.. I genuinely hope this man has a comeback season..
Westbrook shot so flat. Plus his shooting form I don’t think is same as his game form so don’t think anything will change
The Old Russ is Back  let’s go Laker
A.D already looking like he got that I'm getting hurt in less than 8 weeks going😂
whatever happen to lakers team..except injury..i always hands down to westbrk..respect..
should’ve drafted cole swider instead of max christopher… it will cost $7M now for swider to be  signed to the 15th roster spot and FO won’t be willing to pay that
If AD and LeBron stay healthy and Russ step up his game they can make it to the final.Let's go Lakers !
Lakers fans better hope they are not jacking up threes all season. I hope they do though. Easy 🍞
why does phil handy have  leg cruches lol he injured or smth?
I'm a believer of Russ! Let's go!!
OK man I don't know if it's just me but I'm looking forward to seeing Scottie Jr and swider play more than anything
I am sorry but if AD is healthy. GAME OVER !!!!
Russ needs to come off the bench and let the game come to him and slow his A** down instead of playing way to fast and out of control 🤫
Don’t know why they bother Jacking up 3s. When they don’t have the quality to make them. NBA sure is a copy cat league
Russ probably would’ve been a great football player, sometimes people choose the wrong sport. Lebron probably would’ve been a average tightend and wouldn’t have realized he would’ve been great in basketball so maybe Russ should’ve played football 🤷🏽‍♂️
I like what I saw from Lonnie Walker...he looked quick and strong.
Russ who??????? 🤔
If Ljames can improve his shots then AD and Westbrook should b practicing getting better
Hope the lakers play a lot of pick and roll so the wings can knock down shots ''3's'
Cole and pippin are gonna be exciting to watch!
This man LeBron is in impeccable shape
I really love these three Lebron, Russ ell and AD.,
I want Russ to humble himself and just come off the bench. But people need to realize Russ was not the only problem with our team last season.
We just waiting for Kyrie Irving next season
I heard AD won the 3pt contest
Russ looks great. Can’t wait to see Him get comfortable. First consecutive season in the same jersey in a long time.
I hope 🤞 Lakers going to win the NBA finals
This is essentially the NBA’s geriatric team
swider looking like kuzma 2.0
Is that Matt Ryan????
If Russ Fixes his jumpshot It could be interesting
Meanwhile Steph Curry hitting 105 threes in a row from the corner 😂
With the amount of guards they have, they can actually play really fast. I hope coach Ham makes flexible and solid lineups.
Lonnie looking strong 💪🏽
LeGm I need 1000 3s before and after practice
Not these guys again
A.K.A LosBrickers
Where's my Caucasian brotha Matt Ryan ???
Russ is in better shape this year.  Lebron is not in shape.  Davis….
James 6 🤣👍🏀
wow That rook Swider barely misses👊👌
Whole lot of bricks
Westbrook  mvp 2k23
These 3 men are done.... It's a young, healthy man's sport.... NOT MAKING THE PLAYOFFS... FACTS....
Lebron got on slippers that’s super goat status 🐐
As a person that like the lakers this practice!! Ass water ..smh This Sad promo like i want to see how they look playing I guess each other . Like how AD shooting when he go defensive on him. Like they pro’s they should be able to make a open 3 smh nobody wants to see that & why LBJ in slides WTF bro can we get  2 more rings so you can go down as the greatest. Go bald bring 23 back & get two more chips .

Is Russ fans know what we about to get. The haters just don’t #whynot
Cole swider gone be a problem watch 🕺🏽
Dwayne bacon 🔥
Lakers going to get they ass whoop this years out in the first round 😢
I hope we keep swider fr
Excited to see nunn back. I wish he could’ve played last year. I think he would’ve made a difference
none of them can shoot. but we already knew this.
If AD stays healthy nobody beating Lakers everyone knows this.🤣😂 but they still act delusional about it. Him and Bron unstoppable
Russ screaming not to many people hit 3 in a row in the Lakers facility is a sad truth.   The whole league is smirking the Golden State Warriors are laughing, Klay is calling y'all Bums right now.   Call it raps on the year. 🤣🤣🤣 Save your self the misery.
Coach ham gone have these boys ready. 💯
Russ still has game he was just in a slump
omygodddd did i see some chemistry ??? ohhh this gone be goood season for the lakers!
Can AD please wear high tops
Cole Swider 👌 the next big thing ....
I'm quite surprised AD didnt get hurt during this session 🤔
One thing that needs to improve big time is their free throw shooting collectively.
3 below average 3 point shooters...what they having a contest over?😂
They look like trash 😆😂😅😅🤣
I bet a new stadium was built in this contest.
Stop playing around and start running some drills
360 looks fine together. wonder why the social media narratives make us feel there's something bad between them
Just realized, I genuinely like Russ as a human being.
nice shooting form russ.
Russ practicing free throws acting like he was always at the line last season. Lol He should be practicing his 3s and defense.
Sigo creyendo en Lakers para esta temporada Vamos Lakers
Why is Lonnie Walker's shot arc so low
Let's Go Russell
Cold can be a lethal shooter i like his shooting form
It’s crazy there are sponsors logo on training shirts lol
I’m i the only one who thinks this season will be special 💯
To much playing around need mamba mentality we not making playoffs
It just feels like Iman shumpert should be there
Lebron still look like he 25 bro
Russ to excited abt 3 n a roll
And the media says they don’t want him, they look cool to me. Media always twisting the truth.
No surprise there lol
AD got some crazy hair genes
I can’t wait to hear what Shannon Sharp and Skip says about the Lakers 3 point shooting this year 😂
4:00 who is this guy
Russ looks like he is having a good time. Good to see.
I wonder if they see those names up there on the wall and get nervous lol
Im excited to see d lakeshow!!!
JTA like: "this(Russ) talk to much not like curry when training" 😂😂
I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
They’ll be wayyy better than last season‼️
Caption lowkey disrespectful when it added Russ 😭😭😭
I hope Russ cooked this year
AD's shot just like last year.
swider reminds me ok KLAY
So Russian can shoot in an open gym against non shooters interesting. Lol Every NBA player can shoot in an open gym. Russell was dead last of all guards in the league in 3 point percentage. And his free throw shooting was 3rd worst. SMH
I personally think Lakers have nothing but guard's on there team. Front court is 🗑️ outside of 👑 n ad hope for good season
Bruh........... the most crazy thing about this.... Lebron James is about the same height as Anthony Davis 7 foot frame... SHEEEEEEEEEEESH
Dude they showed after russ ad and Bron remind me of young Ray Allen,  he kind of shoot like him too
Notice how AD & Bron consistently float around one another 👀
Russ shot looks different 😮 doesn’t jump unnecessarily high on his shot anymore. He may have a better shooting season this year
Laugh in golden state
Lakers bout to have a long season
The rookie look good
Team Lasker NBA 2022 -2023💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 Next month October 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
not enough wings 😣
Ham finna turn Lonnie to great defender underrated pick up
https://youtu.be/adXx5-tBlSY
Nothing is guarantee in life, but will certainly see a more united Lakers team proving the basketball analysts wrong. The expected and anticipated trades never did  realized and there's truly a reason for not happening. Behind every dark cloud there's a Silver linning. WE'RE COMING! TAKE HEED.
they are throwing bricks.
Awesome
I believe Russ is gonna show up this coming season I think his confidence is coming back because the coach believes in him unlike frank
I'm excited to see Swider this season,  I'm predicting he gets a similar start to his career like Reaves.
i love darwin ham
These dudes are going to get torn apart next season...
Cole Swider is Bro Swisher.
Must’ve been a loud ass practice with Al dem bricks going up between the 3
Imagine if this was golden state.  It would be like 20 in a row before someone misses.
Idk if y’all see what I see but this TEAM is going to be AMAZING
AD was roasting westbrook’s shot lol
Street clothes is gonna be in street clothes real soon 😂
Coach has gat to figure out a way to give swider some minutes
First to one
The LA Clankers
Lonnie Walker gettin that starting 2 spot!
Most overrated nba team
No playoffs again
Cole f ing SNIPER🎉
If Westbrook plays defense and offball, that’s a chip.
How many did Russ hit just board
A 💩, West🧱 And Le'🐐
Crazy how the media portrays the Lakers team and its players hating and wanting to get rid of Russ, but irl they all buddies and get along. The media is the toxic one.
AD walking like his back hurt already
Russ lookin more happy then he has in a while with the lakers
I see a lot of Klay in swider I don’t know why ?
Max Christie is good for the three they'll need him
what camera work is this
The lakers hired lavar
Hahahahah laughable
🙄
Three bitches trying to shoot hahahah
U have a triple double season, then switch teams play bad one year and they call him washed. So disrespectful
Russ the greatest 3 point shooter ever in practice it just don't translate to actually games
They are trying to be like the splash brothers lol 😂😂😂
Cole Swider is a keeper
Whole lotta cussing out there lol
The Los Angeles brickers
Cole looking robotic out there!! 😳
Russ still in LAKERS????????????????????????????? TF?????????????????????????????????????????
swider got that republican game lol
They should sign Dwight Howard back
U can't teach shooting u either have it or you don't with that being said trade Dressbrook
These niggas aint making the playoffs….ill bet anyone a $1000
I want to see Jay Huff and we need a  rim protection
🤦🏾
Too many small guards
If Russ ends up staying with the Lakers this year we need to embrace this man we get nothing out of tearing him down if he is successful we are successful
3:29 HIS NAME COLE SWIDER HE IS A ROOK REMEMBER HIS NAME ✅
They better work with lethal shooter
Where is Malik Monk????
Leshooter
30 dubs
Los Angeles Shoe Squeakers. Russ is hot right now the rest suck. Russ will go out & give the ball away
Juan Toscano look on saying "these fools making two shots and thinking they doing it big. I was watching the greatest shooting background in a Poole party last season. This aight shit"
We're going to be better than ppl thinks
Coaching staff keeping the crutches on standby.
LeBrick, Westbrick, and Can’thony Davis having a 3-point contest?   That should only take about a year for someone to win.
Next MJ in da cut lol real ones know 😭
I just Subscribed to the channel. Keep the Content coming 🔥💯@Swish Cultures
Russ is the best 3 point shooter? This video is great! Lebron is done. Stick a fork in him
the worst camera work ever!
Coach ham will drill this team to become a top team, it will be a surprise for the whole league
Russ shot looking way more better
Lonnie finna go crazy watch for him this season
RUSS 🐐 !!! Are yall ready cause i am 🤞🏾 & i never knew we picked up dwayne bacon dude is a certified bucket getter

I really hope Russ is successful this season man, i really don’t want to continue disliking him as a player. I hope he can do it.
Yes Hello, 911 There's a Swiderman out here Sniping.Bang,Bang.
what was swider shoes though?
Great to see them having fun
From the looks of it, they still can't shoot...lol
Cole Swider Swisssssssh
Just hope they play hard throughout the season
Lakers are a problem if everyone plays their role. Key word IF
Why I think that was rich Paul in the purple as one of the helpers playing defense on the drill?
I’m most interested to see the offensive scheme & the rotation because they definitely have pieces!
Damn I ain’t know the lakers had my boy bacon!!
AD ready to play another 6 weeks
20 years in, still can't shoot.
Cole Swider is exactly what we needed
it wont work no shooters on the team
Let’s be honest yo, Ad healthy lakers will be formidable, Ad out lakers out really that simple
keep up the good work team💪💪💪
Bro I’m 3:00 is nice
yall sleeping too much on walker, this gonna hoop this season fr
ad keep the fro
Russell is so professional no matter what is said about him
Coach Phil on the iR?
We get it, your keeping Russ happy before you trade him
Go Lakers
Hopefully Russell buys into what LA wants him to do and AD can play a reasonable amount of games to LA be in a playoffs race and Lebron be lebron and pass Kareem
reverse grinches omg
how do you like the new additions ? and how do you think the new squad will do ?
