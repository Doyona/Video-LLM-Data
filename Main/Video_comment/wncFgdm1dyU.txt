@6:00 boy have I got news for you
❤
6:00 if only he knew where we'd be heading
Watching this in may 2024 is hilarious, players are still there😅😅
Watching these videos in 2023 and you really understand why we were so bad, and more importantly, why we are STILL so bad. 🤦🏿‍♂️
Looking back at this now.. and realising how far we've become  GGMU ❤️
Liverpool supporter can we play you every week?
Has anyone thought that Ralf 'could' have been given the job to weed out the poisonous players ? To find out which ones don't belong there, ready for the next manager ?
We United fans don’t get angry anymore.  We accept it.  What’s the point. No one should let a team full of crippled lambs ruin your evening.  Well done Liverpool. Great club and great team.
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come: And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.   (Acts 2:20-21) - It's a short-lived journey through life. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
We got ten hag though..definitely every things gonna be better now..grow up
Saying the players aren't good enough for Manchester United is wrong. This is who you are now. A mediocre team with a few decent players.
wan-bissaka should have man marked mane.
Over paid over privileged hard done by 💩basterds
Tbf Maguire isn’t even 8M player he’s absolutely dog 💩
welcome to our studio :)
Embarrassing season in so many ways 😶
Hey yall 🙂 how yall doing? 💪💯🔥🔥 if anyone wants to do a collab I'm down to I'm not that good but I'm trying 😂 I appreciate yall reading this and hope you have a better day then before reading this much love y'all 💙💪💯🙏🔥💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Sad thing is we feel like a mid level club
Salah, Mane and Diaz vs Maguire Lindelof and  Stones. What a mismatch
mark u should have a meeting with the glazers
Never seen anything like it in my 40+ years as an United-supporter….absolutely no pride or spirit…..sad!
Is Ten Hag another soft-spoken Dutch? The problem is not MAGUIRE ding dongs? The problem is rashford,  McTominey sancho and Fred.  Maguire. Lindelof, wanna bisaka. are. Embarrassing
rubbish united
Just play the kids at least they will show passion
I’ll never support some of these players again after what they have done to our club this season. Embarrassing doesn’t even cover it, it’s absolutely insane how these are so called professionals.
And to think we actually finished above Liverpool last season.
Worst set of players in our clubs history! My goodness.
Salah basically said that our midfield made it easy for Liverpool. All they had to do was defend. When our Captain has no passion and no urgency than we are dead in the water. Rashford is more of an activist than a player.
Man u fans need to stick together , if u really want mna u to get top 4 then  try to support the team and the players,I know it's not easy because of the current situation but  man u  need togetherness rn if we want to finish in the top 4
You lucky you got Ronaldo suii
Them three are so slow they've got pigeons shitting on them
Gonna have to disagree with you regarding martial. Guys as bad as Rashford. Not even Sevilla want him. Same things they’re complaining about are the same reasons we binned him off  No work rate, lazy, sulky attitude   He’s better off sold
Let's all laugh at man u Leeds Leeds Leeds 🤣
The fact that Maguire still starts every game just shows how this club is been run...
Maguire is a narcissist. They cant see their own weaknesses, insist on power, blame others, fume when better players play better then them, and love conflict. The opposites of whats needed to be MU captain. He has become toxic for the team, and his PL medal for Leicester only arms him with arrogance.
I just have to ask:   are these soccer players required to take several years of acting lessons before they are allowed to play soccer???  Please advise.
Maguire in maguire at the wheel 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
After the match Bruno said there was nothing to play for, geezus he should be trying to get Man Utd closer to 4th and take it from there, he's a defeated man from that interview

You moan so eloquently Mark.
Too many arrogant over paid  protect themselves British players who should be leading the line - hope this obsession with British players stops
“The three of them are so slow the pigeon is shitting on them”. Goldbridge with words.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       /.
Darren Fletcher should leave the club as well
That's why Bruno's contract should have waited but these board is never shy of failing
WHO IS REALLY PICKING THE TEAM?
Mark makes so much more sense than the so called "pundits" on sky and BT.
United fans praising Mejbri for his thuggish behaviour. How far they have fallen.
Salah said that about liv mid
How can Maguire sit in team meetings week in week out and watch his errors leading to goals on a big screen in front of everyone as captain and think he's good enough for united
Super league debacle:- I watched a clip last season where a reporter went over to Avram Glazer with a microphone, put it under his chin and said - 'Explain to the fans what you are going to do to correct the issues''. He didn't say anything, just got in his SUV and drove off. What this tells me is they can be got at... they don't live on Mars they live in Florida where I know many United fans live. Maybe it's time to ask the question; 'what would Silvio Dante do to remediate this?' - (MAKE the vermin sell). I think we all know what I mean.
Jose was right.
Man United gone woke... That's all you have to say mark.... Man United have gone woke, that's it...
Phil Jones should be in before maguire
"Keep Shaw" wow. "Maybe Bruno" double wow.
4:56 "Hannibal showed more passion and desire" .. maybe he did .. but the guy was lucky not to have been sent off .. the ref pointed as much out to him. Something seriously wrong when you guys are hailing a lad for kicking people rather than trying to play a bit ..
What happened to Fernandes this season showed a LOT of passion last season looks a shadow of himself this season
I feel bad for Ronaldo he should be with man city
At this rate Mark and United Legends owe Jose an apology.  Now you are seeing what he said all along. Pobga faked and injury to save his face. I never thought it would be so bad for United
thank God someone talked right about Harry,
Rashford and Maguire have 100% been the WORST part of this squad all season. They're the polar opposite of what Ronaldo and De Gea have been. Instead of scoring and stopping goals, they let them all in and never score. Whatever happened in that Euro sucked out any talent they had (if Maguire had any to begin with) and I'd rather cut them and eat their contracts than deal with them in the club anymore
Nice
Maguire is beyond rubbish. Steve Bruce 'now' would make a better job. 😡
When your captain becomes a meme..
Sell Maguire please. What is this weird support for Maguire within Man Utd and England. Everyone else knows hes terrible.
Maguire is not good enough for Man Utd or England. He should be playing for someone like Derby.
Rangnick is operating like a covert operative. His role now is to expose the players who are not good enough, showcasing out in the open for the world to see, 'this squad needs cleared out!' He's potentially doing his 'interim job' to perfection.....but i am just  being wildly, hopefully speculative....🤞
Tbf no matter who united played they would have clapped at 7th minute apart from city they actually have no respect for that sort of thing
They should have criticised Maguire and Rashford earlier. They didn't criticise them because they are British lads like them and they are only criticising them right now because the situation is critical.
The worst Man Utd side I've seen was relegated. Mind you, I'm old old bugger!!!!
Maguire Wan Bissaka Rashford Mctominay Shaw u r the guys what man u need
I think my lot saw you coming when you bought Harry from us. Over-hyped and always lacking pace.
Bruno panics in big games.. Rashy was dreadful..The entire defense line was extreme..There was no midfield! Degea was not good enough though always the fans' favourite even outside good results. My goodness only Sancho showed some spark. What a shame no more pain or remorse infact this has become another comedy series.
Ralf is the biggest fraud I seen came to coach united
Maguire would struggle in the Irish league I genuinely mean that.
why we always lost the game... because we not unite... not give 100%
again harry fail to conduct the defend
we need midfield, striker, defend with angry face.... anger to win... why put jones? no eric?... eric is better cb
owner glazer to step down only utd back for good
I wonder if goldbridge's second favourite team is Real Madrid?
Mark is  trending 2nd only behind the actual highlights. Wow
what type of player utd have.... why we are too sloelw, too easy to beat....
u know what, bottom team only lost 2-1, - 1-0, 2-0....but utd 5-0, 4-0
Sancho is a complete disaster
When you're saying Martial is an improvement you know things are rough. Cavani needs to be in that team as soon as he can be.
So sad. We have not been playing as a team for awhile now.  We need a new team. End of.
I think United need to fully commit to ten hag and he needs to ask each player if they honestly want to be at utd. He needs to give players like Maguire a season under him to improve and if they don't they should be gone.
Why is mark so convinced martial is good? The only way this season would of been worse was if we kept martial here hahaha what Rashford and Maguire are doing now is what martial does 90% of his games
When utd bought maguire and awb all utd fans where over the moon, I remember you all saying they were better than vvd and trent
Our United players are useless
Start of the season I was fuming whenever United lost.. these days I’m just waiting for us to lose because the club is full of donkeys that don’t have a clue
Roy Keane called out maguire back in 2020
i remember we would be 2-0 down vs villa or spurs under SAF and i knew we would still at least get a draw even under ole to some point i knew we would come back and create chances but now even 2-0 up against nowrich i have no confidence in us to hold on
So much spent, but at least not anything on attending games ;)
Call me a Sadist but I enjoy the agony of United fans.
i realised after the everton game that most our team is not worthy of playing in the shirt
Honestly seems like the players we have got rid of the past few years would be much better than our squad we have now, id rather a squad with Martial, Herrera, Van De Beek, Lukaku, Smalling etc, than any of the players we had today
Shows how bad the club is when McGuire is your club captain that sums it all up
They where disgraceful. Its disgusting how there man united standerd
Imagine Working For A Company And You Go To Work And They Give You A Project Which Go Accord With Your Scope Of Work And Yet You Can't Execute It And You Still Stay In That Company And Get Paid that Will be Madness, That Is What Man U Players Are, Why Are They Still Getting Paid Anyway They Make Me Sick.....
I WISH SOMEONE CAN LET MAN U DISAPPEAR SO THAT I CAN SUPPORT MAN CITY, I'M TIRED OF THIS TEAM????????
Hannibal MOTM after playing 5 mins. Maguire HAS to go.
Macguire  blamed the managers for playing him.....and he is right!!!
Nothing will change at our club until the Glazers are gone, the board are gone, the backroom staff fletcher particularly are gone. Get rid of most of the first team, and give the manager full control over signings and picking the team.  Otherwise, we will never get get back to the top.
Mark I lived and watched United in the 70s and we were never as bad as we are now.  Sick of wasting my time  watching now because it's the same old garbage every game.
Just watched the highlight and I think there was only one highlight of Man U in Liverpools half lol
we can win the world cup with me in the team...come on england - lord fucking fridge
i dont actually think that rashford should get a 2 i do actually think a 3 or 4
As a neutral, I think Jones gave it all for United last night. he wasnt great put he put in a lot of effort, Maguire should've been hauled off at half time instead of Jones. Also for the life of me, why try a new formation in possibly your biggest match of the season? lol Ralf has to take blame for the formation and team selection
Time to play the u23's or at least some of them at least they wood try, i dont blame ralf, players need shipped out now no pride no effort
Up and down like a yo-yo.
Im guessing Rangnick isnt the manager of any kind, its really Fletcher and Rangnick was just there to do the press meetings. The board
Just play youth players instead of people who are going, no more lingard, mata, matic, cavani or Pogba for the rest of the season because there is no point playing them
yeaaaa liverpool wonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Don't fret Mark you will turn into Liverpool when you play our lot on Saturday. Ronnie will be back and like Rooney always scores against us. We can't score in a brothel!
United would of done the same? Start of second half a large amount of United fans were singing “always the victims” and “sun, sun, sun” so don’t kid yourself
Keane has . Lol  Neville insists they all great players 🤣😂👏👍
Deffo a future hall of farmer harry
Ronaldo never gives up because he wants to improve his stats further! Thats all he wants! As long as he scores he doesnt give a damn if the team loses or not!
Need to clear this lot out for the sake of the club...as for Europe.... forget all about that..... because they would embarrass the club even more in Europe
Where are those knuckleheads  whose supported maguire when he got booed...........Man should be booed to death😡
We need roy Keane as out assistant to ten hag to beat some heads he certainly wouldn't start maguire
But Mark - its the coaching staff & the Glazers & the damage Woodward has done that needs to be called out
Although the players were terrible, the game was already lost when we chose to go with a back 5. At some point, Ragnick has to take the blame and this is on him. Can't wait for the season to be over and for him to get out of there. He might be forced to pick Maguire but he is not forced to not pick Bailly or Sancho. There was definitely a better composition than the one we put out.
Damage done. There’s no way back
The most annoying thing is when we get ten hag, the likes of rashford will get a clean slate even do he should be sold
Ralf is also not doing right.He can replace matic old leg.He can give more match time to hannibal and replace the crap f**k maguire
It’s beyond funny how England think they have a chance of winning the World Cup with maguire in their squad 😂😂😂
fark...yup...
Such class from Liverpool fans
Pornhub are our new shirt sponsors next season as we keep getting double teamed & shafted on a regular basis.
my MOTM is Mejbri... showed what it meant to wear MU shirt. We are never going to be mucked around by Liverpool without a fight
Lol
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Maguire has talent, but no brains.
God bless you man ...you are talking 👍🏽
Rashford should be "rehabilitated " in the reserves.a younger lad would atleast put in a shift .Then again as you say there's more than him jogging through games .
Mark, do you remember your premier league predictions where you had united finishing above Liverpool
Mark you're 100% right this team is the worst Man united team I've ever seen 90% of this team had to go,the new manager coming has got a lot to do,he need new players.
slabby cant defend,cant pass,cant guide,cant inspire the list goes on n on!!strip him of the capt!!!ole screwed us big time!!!signed slabhead awb n james!!!hw on earth is slabby n awb 80 mil n 50 mil only god knows!!!!!!
I swear there’s like a curse at man utd where we get a player, he has a great season then comes back and just doesn’t care anymore
"Softer than a Lemonade Sandwich." 🤣🤣🤣
Turned off the game at halftime but I heard many give praise to Mejbri was he that good could we see more of him this season?
McQuire is a legend..walking and watching the ball in a game.,again...wonder what he does in the summer vacation..fine tuning his walking and watching
I watched the whole game and I watched the highlights again to be 100% sure.The THREE first goals are Maguire's fault. The last one it's bass pass from Maguire, bad reception from Hannibal and bad marking by bissaka, at that level, imo it was mainly Hannibals but the fact that the other three come from Maguire it's shocking. Let's also point fingers properly, it cannot be that the defensive coaching is that bad. I've seen better Man United defense, Rangnick has to be blamed too for this shamble. And when it comes to other players tbh we barely had possesion so there wasn't much that we could do. I do think that the majority of the players can be kept with the exceptions of the defense line. I just I hoped Rangnick would set them properly but doesn't seem to be able to.
lol keano was saying this before you even had the thought.
To be honest man utd fans are the biggest embarrassment  and to say Ferguson is the best manager ever and leave a club in shambles with no future in place is a joke
You gon keep Fred? For the bench? I wouldn't trust Fred and wanbissaka to run a lemon juice shed. The recruit of ole's is down right dog shite. And Rangnik's choices of who he picks is pathetic. He doesn't like Mata, insted he chooses matic, he doesn't play bailey but plays the 80 million sack of potatoes. Our right back had been crap for a decade already and now wan bititchsucka is playing. Fred and wan btitichsaka are neee growls and they gotta go.
Ole was bang on when he criticised Rashford for not focusing on his job and instead on school dinners
Hannibal Lector?
We're going to be strong next season 💯💯
I don’t know why anyone is angry about this result  Did anyone actually think we would beat Liverpool?  Let Eric do his job and clear this out and bring in young players who are hungry
I don't know how this channel was able to comment on united's play for an hour. Srsly. There's nothing to talk about, how is this snow white able to comment on the tactical side?? Coz there wasn't any tactic. Eleven dude's standing in a field, they weren't even players. This dude yapping his mouth talking about tactics when you can't see nothing, no tactics no formation 76:24 possession in the first half , whatelse is there to talk about?. People were saying Rangnik was the teachers of the high pressing coaches like chelsea's and klop's?? Like i see a btitich with no brain standing on the side of the field.
Actually, to be honest I hope we do not even get europa league, could be a blessing in disguise. Even though nothings gonna change unless we let go of these clowns.
Maguire is suffering from the worst superiority complex syndrome. He simply refuses to accept the fact that he is the worst defender Man United ever had. Truth is always bitter.
Mark really gave Pogba and Bruno a 4, why? What did they do to deserve that?
Bailly is much better than Maguire and Jones why no chance for him??
Jose, Ole,and Ralf all got thrown under the bus why should it be any different with Ten Haag ?
We need to get rid of at least 12 players.
United glory days are gone forever.
Maguier turned Instagram comments off
Hi Mark have you ever been on a game
Move Rangnick upstairs so he gets the power to flushes them out. What is fletcher doing in Utd
Eric Bailly is Man Utd best defender... until he plays. 😮‍💨
RR very openly said in his post match interview that team needs a rebuild. He’s only got a few games left so he feels freer to say what we’ve been saying for months now. Get some new players and get the youth in because these players now need to go
Matic and Jones huffing and puffing in the first 20 minutes like they had been on the pitch 120 minutes. Complete shambles.
I don't think the players gave up because of the manager. The fact that the same under-achieving people get to start consistently and constantly cost us games  across multiple managers is the reason I think they gave up. If I start with McGuire, why risk injury playing my heart out because he will (and has - without fail) undo any good work the team does. The club doesn't value excellence and achievement. We buy players who do value these things, then show them that we don't do that here.
MU is where Liverpool was before Klopp took over... 6-7 years behind. Only players worth keeping are DDG, CR7 and maybe Bruno. Others lack desire, attitude or talent to wear the shirt. I rather have a full team of Brighton or Brentford players wear MU shirt because I know they give 100% effort when they step on the pitch
Look forward to watching Man U play at Whaddon Road in a couple of seasons!
9-0 hmmmmmm ....10 years of mediocre, openly disgusting management !!!!!
Ten Haag will do this, Ten Haag will do that, He`ll bring world class players, he`ll win a things, CAN YOU STOP FOR ONCE WITH STUPIDITY !!! YOU ARE THE REASON WHY THIS FOOTBALL CLUB IS GOING DOWN BECAUSE YOU MAKE EXPECTATIONS AND FALSE PROMISES, WHEN THINGS YOU PROMISED DO NOT HAPPEN FANS BECOME TOXIC AND EVERYTHING AROUND THIS CLUB IS TOXIC. SIince this channel came into being united got worse, it is a fact !!!!!!!!
Ronaldo is the body supplement that gives you that extra boost but if the general body (the general team) isn't exercising and eating well there's so much a supplement can do.
I cant wait to see the back of Lingard and Pogba..they dont care.
That was the best game Harry Maguire has ever watched.
Maguire aka Captain poopy pants.
It's a farce,  agree with everything Goldbridge said
I won’t watch another game until Rashford, Maguire, AWB, mcTominay are GONE!
Solskjaer wanted Thiago. The Glazers would not. Now he is king at Liverpool.
I don’t want to be that guy but I fee vindicated…I said it when everyone was talking up Harry when he was being targeted. He is the most mediocre cb in the league!!! Next is mcTom to be exposed as weak sauce
😂😂😂😂Softer than a lemonade sandwich 😂😂😂
This guy turns reaping himself into an art form
We all know Harry Maguire will not be dropped for any games ... no matter how bad of a shift he puts in , The man is inevitable to united
They've broken Roy Keane
Lol. In some weird way, we got so used to the mediocrity that it doesn’t seem to hurt anymore!
Not a single United player pressed. Sat back and watched.  Geggenpress Ralf.
If I was a Manchester United player why would I ask for a move 👍
Hannibal Mabry ran around like a chicken with his head cut off putting in awful tackles and everyone praises him.  looked a fool out there for 10 minutes
We need ten hag mark we got to use useful players like donny van de beek and sign players like darwin Nunez,nkunku,tchoumani  or Antony and a new captian like dea gea,ronaldo,rashford the best captian here will be ronaldo because he has the experience we need ten hag!
Getting UCL could be a defining moment for United in the coming years because the players needed for a rebuild such as Núñez, Torres & Nkunku have made it clear they will not join clubs who haven't got UCL football. Who would you sign realistically if they don't get Champions League football?
Finally, Mark admits Trashford is finished 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Ten Hag needs to sell anyone with a British passport . The less English players you got in yoir team,the better your chance at winning trophies: look at Liverpool and City. 1/2 max and they come off the bench.  I don't blame pogba for doing what he does.
Calling them shambolic is doing a disservice to shambles. It was atrocious, absolutely abysmal. The players should look at the game and be hugely embarrassed. But they won't be. What is needed and Man United is a fire sale. Everything that isn't a Spanish goalkeeper has to go, and I'm including a hilariously injury prone French centre back in that. I do feel an almighty swell of pity for Ten Hag.
willenhall red says  ' YOU HAVE TO BLAME RAGNICK ' HE KEEPS PLAYING MCGUIRE ' RASHFORD EVEN BRUNO ' SURELY THE MANAGER PICKS THE TEAM
A certain number of us blades fans knew from the start that Maguire was overrated. The season he broke through into the first team we got relegated to league one with his slip up at the back against Barnsley to let their striker in.......just saying. He's a lower prem team defender at best.
Just send young players to play
Maguire is thee worst footballer that has ever played for united.
Salah literally said 'they make our life easier' its just pathetic from united
This is there job in every other sector of working,  if you can't do your job you get fired ,these players get outrageous wages and can't do there job
The only good thing about Ole as manager was that the players played for him. They now exposed themselves as whiny brats who give up when they don't get what they want.
Bailly needs to leave the club.. how could Ralf pick Lord Jones over him I seriously can't understand 🤦‍♂️
When was the last time United played a good game from start to finish
There were two massive chances rashford had last night the ball over the top from bruno and his first touch let him down and the good run from sancho that he slip him thru but his shot let him down a year ago rashford scores this chances I don’t know what’s happened to him
Keane has definitely not protected Maguire this season
Marcus Trashfraud
The only positive thing from the game is the 7minute standing ovation by the Anfield crowd.
Liverpool don’t fear a high line because Alisson is a sweeper keeper who comes out and clears the ball
Mark un used to blame Ole but now you can't blame the manager but the players . Ragnick can't coach Manchester United. He is useless
All you Man Utd fans that wanted Jose Mourinho out, the man who said the club and it’s players stink. All you Man Utd fans deserve this.
Rangnick needs to show the players this video before their next training
Maguire is the best player. He is the most dangerous striker de gea has played against
And to imagine that Ole was harshly criticized😔
Being passionate is one thing … conceding stupid fouls is another. Hannibal made a couple of challenges today that were totally uncalled for.   That being said I hope we see more of him. We need some new blood in this team. Someone to lift the spirits a bit
When we lose to Chelsea time to drop lots of them and play more of the youth team.
Harry Maguire: "I wouldn't be playing every game for Man Utd in the starting eleven if I'd been playing bad every game or not playing well enough. There's a reason why both managers have put me in the starting eleven every game.". Now the fact Maguire thinks this is why we are struggling
I put 100% blame on maguire.
In all my years Supporting United I have never ever turned off the TV when a United Game is on although a lot of games kick off past midnight where I live I have always watched till the end even if we are playing badly or losing but it's really hard to watch this team play it's like watching a Sunday League Team.
ten hag comes in ........ the first thing we can see is maguire out and captaincy to ronaldo
And yet again jose is proved right about these players the special one's supremacy
Everyone knows Maguire is crap… except United coaches
Most Liverpool goals against united this match , no tracking player let player run , placement defending shocking , especially Maguire , midfield pathetic, Fernandes been very quiet for while not impacting games anymore .
Rangnick is not the guru of Klopp or Tuchel.  That is the biggest lie out there.
I swear I saw some of our players vent at half time. I'm not joking. They're sus.
Roy Keane has definitely called out Maguire and Wan Bissaka. He said he would of fought them
Mark  I agree with you   Except  these players ARE just not good enough  They don’t have any tools. To lay down  Ole ( the good man) has been collecting these rubbish   Just Get rid off them    Alex from australia
Now we all know it’s definitely not about the coaches but the players . No effort no fighting quality no will to compete no pride and no skill to adapt or improve . They should all be fined . As far as I can see rebuilding is definitely necessary, no one seems to know anything about predicting the game and reading a play or to break up a play in terms of defense . That is not even a performance to remember at all  . They the players just need to do their job and do it to the best of their abilities .

“I saw Eric Bailly, and Phil Jones. I pick Jones” LOL
Ollie>Ralf. The proof is in the league table.
MARK you are a legend.  Supporter in SA from 1975.  Right on bro... no more expectations..dissapointed
Disgrace
Ragnick said it was not in the plan to play a high line...and we conceded from the high line. The players are not listening to Ragnick.
Whats even worse that ten hag doesnt even want ronaldo. Like what? Who ironically is the oldest player and puts more energy and balls into utd than any player had in this game.
Its sad knowing these viruses which  are these players will never leave this club and nor will ten hag have the reigns to get rid off them.. sad times ahead
Liverpool Fans truly showed their class at the match 👏👏👏👏
Who cares anymore I’m depressed with this club
so slow pigeons are shitting on them 😂
If you throw all these Manchester United players in a pool of 🦈 the shark will come out of the water walk on land and say guys what the hell are you doing I don't want these bunch of primadonna's in my water put them somewhere else
I can't be angry every weekend. It's so much energy i'm loosing
So from what I understand, Ralf wasn't given a free reign now but somehow if Ten Hag joins, he will be given. Hmmmm
Lol softer than a lemonade sandwich. Classic.
It's all started when u lot paid ridiculously for sanchez & pogba,you made them into primadona & not a footballer's again,and its worsening every season 🤣🤣
You need to start by changing the back four,  you need a CB, RB, LB  Then you can talk about midfield, but first a young technical and pacy fullbacks who use their brains while running and knoa how to balance both defending and attacking and a world class CB is needed alongside Varane, then get a DM and a goalscoring winger /forward CB: Pau Torres /kounde / Kolibaly RB : Mazraoui / Dest  LB : Mendy (Real) /Theo Hernandez  DM : Tchouameni /Ndidi  Winger/forward : Osimhen /Danjuma ST : Darwin Nunez De Gea Theo-Kounde - Varane - Mazraoui Fred - Tchouameni - Bruno Sancho CR7 Osimhen
Veranne 😂😂😂 you'd keep mr injuries ?
Maguire is a disgrace. He’s a coward and a conman.
I just love it when we beat yee love it.
Not to worry, Rangnick says a squad rebuild will only take about six years.
Get rid of the maquire, rashford BRUNO FERNANDEZ wan bissaka n united will be free.
I am devasted i really am i wa hoping for a 2 0 but they let me down again
Anyone Remember when this guy said wan bissaka was the best English right back and bruno was as good as kdb hahaha what a absolute tool this guy is knows as much about football as i do about space
The worrying thing is Darren Fletcher will be still be there when ETH (hopefully) arrives. I hope ETH throws them all out and starts from the scratch. Both Van Gaal and Jose tried to do that, and the pundits (read Paul Scholes) came after them. What are the credentials of these pundits to comment on managers ? Paul Scholes quit after how many days ? And Garry Neville ? Garry is still a joke in Spain.  I hope ETH really throws them all out and starts afresh. We will know when pundits (read Paul Scholes and Garry Neville) start grumbling about "boring playing style". I remember, in one of matches against City, Garry Neville's analysis was that the defender's legs simply "are gone". It's called fitness!  If "the legs are gone" is the level of analysis from a "pundit", then that there is no saving from that.  It's rotten to the core. The entire ecosystem. At this point, I feel Sir Alex's greatest move was to take a smart retirement, because he could clearly see his powers waning, and he would end up losing his legacy.
Every team at the bottom of the table plays harder than Man United does. It's a shame they are the ones getting relegated.
TRASHFORD
Man Utd reminds me of President Biden...
Mark is being generous with all the 4s
Sancho and hannibal where the only good players that game
A bit harsh on Bruno he definitely needs mentoring for a newer role and Bruno’s pass range is def not bad at all he put a ball on a plater today for sancho, isn’t always a perfect ball but neither is the rest of 10/8s itw
If Ronaldo was there man utd won't lose by 4 gols
His done it again,macguire you beauty
If you give rasford to klopp he be one the best in the league something wrong at United
Shame....shame... Shame
Lemonade sandwich 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t get everyone going on about how great Mejbri was for fouling players, could have easily been sent off, that’s poor mentality, petulant and clearly not ready
Sell all the players, get better  new players, Man U
Me  *acts surprised* 👁️👄👁️
You could go to a comedy club and have fewer laughs than watching 90 minutes of slabhead's defending 🤣🤣.
There's a lobby protecting English player.
Man Utd pay their players far too much to sign for them....why pay them so much?  If they dont want to come for fair wages then screw them, let them go elsewhere!  AWB gets how much??  Maguire has a contract until??  How much is Rashford making??  Except for your Goalie, they are all paid far too much compared to other BIG clubs.  Its going to take a 6 years to get back to the top 4.
McGuire makes a lot of mistakes himself, but is openly complaining if other players make a possible mistake. A captain should be an example and be more graceful. And sportmanslike.
H🤡RRY M🤡GUIRE 👉🤡👈
Rather play the kids and lose 10-0 as long as they try, play the under 21s at weekend and see who want to be there because none of these so called first team players dnt
There are better pub teams centre halves than Maguire - but he doesn't pick himself. You're right for calling out Rangnick - personally, I think someone is holding a gun to his head in regard to picking Maguire.
Harry Maguire is United’s equivalent of Boris Johnson. Other than CR7 & DDG, the rest are toilet paper to me 💯
Ralf is a good coach , but why tf if he starting Maguire , why isn’t he changing the captaincy , he is not being his normal self
Utd didn’t back Ralf in January so the players knew this season is a write off.  Now they don’t even follow his instruction so unprofessional. Darren Fletcher with his suit on the sideline doesn’t help either
don't know the truth but i think eric Bailly must have done something behind the scenes
Poor phil was gasping for air in the 1st half
I wanna know how Maguire is still getting played. Is it as simple as he’s captain so he has to play?   Why is the media not asking the question don’t you think it’s time to drop him due to his bad performances, how bad does he have to play to get dropped?   If you have a player at the back who is positionally lost your gonna concede every game in the premier league. Make your base strong and you have a chance in every game!
They cant turn on and off .. you deluded mark …. FFs
Your right they don't care, as long as they get paid those big, big bucks h should they
I restarted my tools down Man United career mode a few weeks ago, not buying anyone until Jan transfer window.. I started the cleanout before that window though 🤣 A shitload have been put up for transfer haha Maguire went first for $40M, a few have now followed out the door. I have so far brought in Nunez, Pau Torres & Tchouameni.  Ajax won't sell  Timber to me as yet, they keep saying we don't have depth in that position 😆😂 Once a few more players get sold I might as well grab Antony while I'm at it hehe and another RB after AWB gets sold 😁
Someone has dirt on somebody in that club. For Maguire to still be captain and still playing baffles me! He kicked Paul pogba in the head in the Norwich game for God's sake!! Smh.
No wonder united are labelled as scums. No way of winning the game, players resort high and dangerous tackles to try and injure the opposing players. Disgusting bunch.
I remember one of Mourinho's last season at Chelsea, the players threw Jose under the bus. And then the following season with Conte, won the league. Honestly, could this happen at United?
Fulham would steam role this team
“They’re softer than a lemonade sandwich.” Mark Goldbridge
Let this be a lesson to other premier league team. No body beat united 5-0 twice!
The fact that Maguire cost more than VVD 😂😂
Keane has been the only one calling em out
Maguire is terrible, Roy Keane would have kicked his butt off the pitch
Our teams has lack of speed and movement. Each and every time we kept losing the balls. Ten hag has to rebuild this team and also take strict action with players like maguire, rashford.
This whole club is rotten. The board, the players, even the fans. We need rid of at least 7 first team players. Other than Ronaldo, sancho, Bruno and ddg the whole team is weak and pathetic. Our board is proven to not be good enough and all of us fans are just giving up and barely fighting anymore. We need more protests. Games boycotted. Get rid of the time wasters and do a complete reset. If it takes 5/6 years fine. But let’s do it properly fr the first time since pre-2005.
I thought Rashford did "well" in training?? 👀
Let’s not forget Glazers got us here too... Glazers out
If TH starts maguire I want him out! The 3 M’s gotta go. McMuffin maguire and Marcus.
Bruno is now on more then Salah let that sink in 250k a week😂😂😂
Only Ronaldo, Verrane  and De Gea are worth keeping. Maybe eLanga for the bench.
Why is everyone so delusional about Bruno???????? He is soooooooo overrated!!!!!
Once you appoint a caretaker, with modern players, it's season over. And if you spend 80m on a player, he will play.
LW: Sancho, ST: Ronaldo, RW: Antony CM: Tchoumeni, CM: Nkunku, CAM: Bruno LB: Wijndal, CB: Varane, CB: Bailly, RB: Lamptey  GK: DE Gea
I think they’ve given up but they don’t even realise they have. This is why they keep saying ‘we go again’, ‘we have to look at ourselves’, ‘it’s not good enough.’ No desire against our bitterest rivals who are going for a quadruple 🤬
Last time it was 5-0, now 4-0.. Maguire would think it's an improvement
with maguire on the pitch its 10v12
Not just players even Ralf is Shitte, I don't understand why he keeps on playing Maguire, Pogba Rashford and Bruno. Atleast play some youngsters. Fed of this CLUB
There has to be someone behind the scenes pulling the strings.
Why is no one talking about the low level of coaching and training that has been going on at the club for years. Players don't improve.  Even Kylian Mbappe will become trash if he comes to United. Look what happened to Bruno, Pogba, Sancho, Maguire, Fred, and more. Are you telling me all these players who were balling in their former clubs just became terrible players? I don't think so.
maguire has cost us at least 20 points, its boring saying it, credit to the scousers for the 7th minute applause.
The worst United players have ever seen me see fergie use 8 defender an win match all of these players should go asap
Best thing about this evening was the players are softer than a lemonade sandwich, cheers mark always a bit of humour in dark times
Personally, I would prefer we didn't qualify for European competition if this is the level of performances we will produce.
Bruno is a terrible footballer but I fear he’s too influential for a change at United
Only De Gea and Ronaldo should play for MUFC next season. The rest are finished.
Hannibal man of the match 🤣 feel sorry for u lot
Pay them a basic of 50% of what they are getting. The other 50% must be performance base.
Goldberg is delirious. Ragnick is no mentor to Pep or Klopp. This is what was sold to United supporters. He was not good at his last two jobs and was frozen out of management.
Mark you need to stop including Dan James with AWB and McGuire. I agree not the quality needed but he only cost 17 and was sold for 30 and like Ricky says his effort could not be questioned and is better than Rashford at the moment. Not as bad a signing as AWB and McGuire
These are the same supporters that wanted Ole out. Ole did a bloody good job with the shite players he had. Ralf will not do any difference. The only man. Erik can change this club. I still believe he will change this united side. He will get rid of the dead players and bring in energy and youth to the team. Trust in Erik Ten hag.
I Love the way he says Matic should be in the Guinness book of Records for playing 90 mins 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Three statues🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
mark! our criticise dont motivate them because they are so so used to it, these players got elephant skin.
Why is there no target man in our squad.  Big tall striker that we can just kick it up to and he HOLDS it.  I miss Fellaini's chest control🥲
Grew up with the ManU vs Arsenal rivalry. How the night have fallen 🤦🏻.
I wish we were as good as Liverpool
Bruno has " G O T " to b the most British like famed overhyped n overrated midfielder that we've seen in time 💯 ..
These players are weak. Ragnik at least exposed them that no matter who comes these shits are not gonna turn into gold
Manchester United must change the whole team
This team is a bunch of crap players
i disagree mark. You can’t blame just maguire for any of the goals. That left back however had a shocker
Well said Mark.  Absolute respect to Liverpool for their wonderful gesture for Ronaldo 👍
Fletcher's picking the team
The football reason has to be over commercial reason. Mcguire is not a football reason. How come he gets picked up repeatedly with such a disgraceful performance. Nasty blunt politics with weak club leadership. No backbone
You cannot blame the players 100%> It's all in the coaching and setup. It takes months and years to perfect the type of football a team plays. All this is because of the board and owners. poor hiring of managers back to back to back.   However 7 or 8 first team players should never play for United again.  Maguire, lindelof, bissaka, Fred, Scott, Jones, Mata, Matic, Martial. All have to go.   IF YOU had put up a Youth team. They would have at least not lost 4-0. This club is an embarrassment. When will this owners ever leave this club and let a proper owner and board who can really understand football and leave united.
Thank you mark, rashford needs to leave and everyone don’t want to say it he needs to leave. he can never play tactical football
Remember when we told United fans about Maguire, AWB, Rashford, Penandes... 🤣🤡
United fans crying 🙂👍🏾
United player’s will always play for themselves, Liverpool play for each other
mark! for me they are already worse man utd side I ever seen. forget they are going to be!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont believe these players.
I feel sad for Eric Bailey !!! I personally feel he is the most disrespected person by the manager and club !!! Good enough to be in the starting XI and still never get chance !!! F**k I feel sad for him and the useless plays all the games instead of him!! Maguire alone cost us min 15 points this season!!!
How the hell is Dalot not being slated?? He was diabolical tonight!! Liverpool literally went right after him as soon as he swapped with AWB. That’s how crap he is!
How do any of the English united players deserve an England spot? Pisses me off
There wages should be taken away stop all the wage’s
Always said it’s the over rated English players dragging us down.  Rashford, Maguire, Wan Bissaka and Shaw the main culprits, coincidence there all English and over paid!!
Mark you kept protecting rashford Pogba and even Bruno and Luke Shaw all the players that have been garbage and not good enough for United you have been propping them up for years only to know now that they are actually not good enough where they have never been good enough it's glad to see that you have FINALLY come along.
everyone needs to go, only two plays I'll keep. goalkeeper and Ronaldo. everyone else needs to go
😂😂😂😂comedy gold
I blame no one but the manager for this game from time i saw this formation
Pogba and Bruno deserve a 0 hahaha. Pogba gave the ball away every time he touched it, didn’t managed to play 10 mins and faked an injury to come off. Bruno was moaning all game and lost the ball more than anyone on the pitch. Giving them a 4 is like saying they weren’t bad.
So true why leave Bailey out. He saved us in the game against Atlanta He is fast and strong Yet Maguire is still there Absolutely unbelievable Ralf was no way the right choice no better then Ole
“They’re softer than a lemonade sandwich!”- The Prophet Goldbridge
Bruno's trying to do too much, trying to make something happen when there's nothing there...
To be fair to Ralf, he said in a post match interview that the defence didn't follow the game plan, and that they pushed forward too early. It seems like it doesn't matter if he gives the players instructions, they just don't follow them! Can you mark the manager down if the plan failed, if the players didn't even follow the plan? (Genuine question..)
Harry Maguire should never ever go anywhere near any type of ball ever again.
McGuire, Pogba, Rashford - OUT Rudiger, Rice/Maddison/Teliemens - In
We don’t just need new players we need a restructure of the club but this will only happen with new ownership
I would also give up playing under a captain like Maguire! Seriously! What a player to lead as an example!
How are they sleeping whenever they receive their weekly wages with this horrible performance every game.
This squad got no integrity...
Rashford should stick to handing out packed lunches.
You just said you think bruno is a fantastic player. When has he ever been fantastic mark. He is genuinely a horrible footballer.. you shouldn’t expect more from bruno. This is his level..
RR who? Godfather of football? SMH. He is a fraud and overrated. Just a German PE teacher. Nothing else 😉
Shambles
This game shows why we should just play the u23 for the rest of the season, Hannibal helped me enjoy United playing, and it started and ended with him. Play the u23s, fair and simple.
Did Man Utd play this evening? Just watched LFC beat a bunch of school kids from Salford doubt any of them will turn into professional footballers, they were useless to be honest. Look on the bright side, your next two league games are Arsenal and Chelsea !!
10 in that would suit eth tactic  *adeyami(lw/rw/at) rb salzburg  *junior adamu(rb) rb salzburg *josko gvardiol (cb/lb) leipzig *nico shollterback(cb) frieburg *jurien timber(cb/rb) ajax *florian wirtz (cm/am box to box) leverkusen *konrad leimer(dm/cm) rb leibziq  Is that 10,?i really think this is a realistic target if we really wanna push,especially adeyami,since hes on the verge of joining dortmund..this kid is a gem and wouldn't cost no less than 35/40 millions 🙂
How have United been fighting for 4th spot with Maguire as captain and leading the defense 🤔
Your introduction is 100%
cost us the game lol doesn't matter what manure formation played they were going to lose badly manure players are on the beach already Saint trashford will be doing his normal day time job with Google and feeding starving kids
Fucking glazers need to sale the club not backing the managers and getting the players us fans deserve
Mark mate can you please pick my next lottery numbers
I just don't understand why youth have not been given more of a chance
You have to protect a block of cheese you’ve absolutely WASTED £80million on! He’s a *****
If the owners and directors don't give a shti about winning it is no surprise many "stars" are only turning up to collect their cash. The only people invested in the club are the supporters and that way leads to Newcastle. Of 12 months ago.
There is not in booing and blaming the players, they don't offer these obscene contracts to themselves. Its the people offering them new contracts even though they don't deserve it, that are to blame. Come on if I was told your no longer working hour shift, instead your gonna work 4 hours and will get a pay rise. Who would refuse that?
I am a software engineer making barely 1000 pounds a month, but  believe me i have more dedication and commitment towards my work than these bunch of bloodsucking parasites, a disgrace and they actually go to collect their cheques after putting in a performance like this is embarrassing.   The whole system is rotten to the core.  The Scouts are incompetent at best not to recognize the flaws in these average players we signed.   The previous manager had no continuity plan and recruited based on pure sentiment instead of statistical analysis and data.   The players are average at best and some of them are borderline delusional about their abilities, very few of them will actually have a proper future post United because they declined from running back and pressing which is a demand of all top sides in today's football.
Listen we can critique Rangnicks tactics and setups etc. but he holds absolutely no blame for how this team is performing, I genuinely feel sorry for him
Liverpool fans will always show love and support! God bless you cristiano on your loss! The footballing world is behind you and your family at this most awful time ❤️
Maguire is a Liverpool spy
They are the worse set of players they r so lazzzzzzzzzy what a disgrace!!!
Man United fans singing 'always the victims' after half time...for that to happen after Anfield to a man had clapped Ronaldo on 7 minutes was absolutely disgraceful behaviour.
Shout out to the Manchester United fans in anfield who showed their class today 👏
Ronaldo must be kept this is imperative!!!
Hanabi have to be the man of the match he was only the good players also lingard did well although he was not getting balls
These senior players are seriously a fucking embarrassment to themselves and to the club. I seriously couldn’t give two shits if our whole team is sold for 20p apart from a very few select players. I’d rather have the U16’s playing instead.
This team beat Man City just saying
I love Eric bayy
Legit terrifying that Southgate is still going to stand by Maguire for the WC
Roy Keane called them out on Sky this evening …. Then again Roy has been calling out these players for over two years …… Bruno Fernandez has been just given a three year contract …. Another lightweight …… not strong enough for the EPL …… MU still making wrong decisions giving out long term contracts ???
Rashford has been protected by Neville and co.
i know we lost 5-0 at old trafford with ole but we have fell off hard since sacking him. we actually made progress with him 2nd & 3rd and semi finals. i believe all managers should get to the end of the season and then discuss where they are.   love u ole x
The team refuse to play how long you want to take to understand that? Useless Maguire as he is the worst. The team is died
Explain to me why C. Ronaldo is the problem at United. I want him to get a better team. He didn't play and the scoreline is 4-0.
Salah basically said that our midfield made it easy for Liverpool. All they had to do was defend. When our Captain has no passion and no urgency than we are dead in the water. Rashford is more of an activist than a player.
ole was laughing at home watching
What kind of excuses Rangnick will have to present to MU Fans ??? Before it was “ Ronaldo’s the problem “, and possibly“ D De Gea ‘s “after a “ ???? RRangnick should stop passing the ball and honestly  face himself  !!!
Mark supporting utd 51 years this is the worst team I've ever seen their attitude effort and desire is deplorable we had weaker teams before never with the attitude of this bunch I know you won't agree with me but roy keane should go in with ten hag get rid of 7 or 8 players and make no mistake keane would have ten hag back.mark also a fact keane has been on this team's back since Mourinho leopards don't change their spots you must remember that quote.
All we did is add value to Liverpool players and we still stuck with H&M as captain 🥵🥵😂😂😂😡😡 Got out
LADY MAGUIRE MUST BE BANNED FOR PLAYING FOOTBALL ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THEY ARE LOOSING BECAUSE THEY WANT THEY DO THIS TO TAKE REVANGE FROM ONE ANOTHER
Sancho get rid
Subbing off phil jones is insulting to him, especially when it was maguire who was the worst of the 3cbs, especially considering he could’ve played jones last week to get some form rather than chuck him in against liverpool as his second start in the season
Embarrassing it's so hard to be United😓🙉😠⚽🇬🇭
Idk why I find us funny 😭
Matic to be in the guiness book of record for playing 90 mins😂😂😂
Ragnick has been shocking
This is chicken soup for the soul🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Need to stop buying top stars and start buying young and prospect players who want to win and play for the badge
Mark you are wrong about bruno he's not united quality
Mark hammered pogba once and has consistently given him a free pass sonce
The team privileged spoilt brats getting there 200k a week and going on with their lives. I know for a fact you put that under 23’s side for the rest of the games we will get 4th because desire and passion to win is what keeps you in hard games like liverpool and definitely win games like Everton
Bruno is shieettt!!!
There is no honesty with our club No honesty from the top and no honesty on the saying side Lindelof and maguire have been playing together for a few seasons no understanding it doesn't work full stop  the interim manager is just trying to get euro football at any cost    Instead of blooding youngsters  and dropping some of the deadwood  tactics not working  no honesty if we get ten hag please give him full control and let him build because if not we're finished
The better question is, who is playing well in this United squad besides Ronaldo, De Gea and occasionally Bruno?
Heard ten hag get's revealed soon, they better reveal one hundred, ten won't be enough to save this lot
Mane is less than salary  rashy maguire bruno sancho de gea is madness  i think same salary jones
Very simple. Make a public statement that the squad is getting a 30% pay cut and we will see who really wants to play for the badge
Roy Keane has called out the Man Utd players time and again, to the point of almost being speechless with rage.
What a loss mason greenwood has been
If Maguire and Rashford aren’t the two worst players this season then who are? I can’t name two that have been worse
Maquire played ok bassaka again was so shite dalit to
This boys sack the managers for fun⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽😥😥😥😥😥😥
How Ronaldo scores 20+ goals with this poor united squad is the biggest wonder to me.
Rashford gets off scit free because he is Black
“I play so well each time even the other team loves me” - Maguire
Bruno got a new contract, one of the clauses included going missing in big games 🤡🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Mate. United players have not been coached well for the last 4 years. They did not down tools. They are clueless. Not for lack of effort. They are also not that good.  So calm down
Marcus letting me down !
Those were so scared, their legs were shaking. Couldnt even pass the ball
Things won't change until the parasites that own the club have gone!
All players need to be out bring new best and worthily player like Sancho's like Varan like alanga , brouno the rest all out
With Maguire United are playing with 10 men and the opposition 12. its over before it starts. Get rid of the guy tonight.
Everybody get excited all you want man united will never change if the scavengers called the glazers are still here
This all because of ole. Poor decision making. He make harry captain just a week after transfer to Manchester united, who dont know philosophy and playing style yet.
Feel so sad for Sancho. He shouldn't have transferred to United. Why did he think the risk was worth it
There's level's and maguire's is Leicester, at best.
They do try, but they ain’t got a clue, they need removing.
Man utd’s player are bad at winning second ball and tackling. So bad.
ive been saying that the Youth could be our signings
Roy and Graham absolutely spot on. They all need to go!!!
Naa you can't go after Keane about Maguire. Keane has been destroying Maguire weekly for his atrocious performances
Keep Luke Shaw  really mark? The guy has one good season for 7 years maybe Mourinho was rite all along
Maguire was at fault for 1st,3rd and 4th goals. The third one was just awful, left Mane to go and mark some space. He truly is the worst player ever to wear the shirt.
Fucking Maguire 😂😂😭😭🤡🤡 ive never seen a worse CB
Wow, you guys are bad… 😆
“The three of them are so slow the pigeon is shitting on them”. Goldbridge with words.
United have completely the wrong mindset where they play their terrible high priced signing instead of turning younger or more hungry players into £80m players
Man utd arnt a big club football wise anymore players who want to win go to city Chelsea or Liverpool players who want paid and social media expanding go to utd
That was like watching a kitten being thrown in to a cage with a bear.
🤣🤣🤣💀😭💔
Man United fans should boikot & stop going to Old Trafford.. send a clear message to the board, mgmt & players..
This Man U team do not deserve to play together with CR7.....I'm fedup to watch them
I truly don't understand why Ten Hag said yes to United. Any manager in europe knows what's going on with United. It's not about playing better football, it's about ego in that dressing room. Certain players set themselves above the club and the manager. Just wait and see certain players feeling threatened once Ten Hag takes over. Just wait and see...
EVERY PLAYER THAT LEAVES , WE GET BETTER !  JUST DISGRACEFUL . FIRE THE SCOUTS ALSO . PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE THE DECISIONS NEED CALLED OUT.
We've been made to believe that these lip-service merchants who pretend to be footballers are good, they 'just need the proper coaching'.. Bloody bullocks!
Hannibal motm for United…. Came on and had some heart about him
I’m assuming this is the exact reason Ten Hag added in the clause he needs control bc these lot will throw him under the bus without a 2nd thought… what’s mind boggling is that they don’t even care about their legacy, so shameful
Roy Keane passionate analysis on sky making me sad. Good old Roy ❤️🟥
RALF RAN NICK MAKES THE MOST SENSE. PITY HE’S IN CHAINS. SAD
Roy Keane has absolutely destroyed Maguire this season. That's the one thing mark got wrong here.
Manhistory FC
Go back and watch what this channel said when HARRY MAGUIRE was signed,read the comments
Was honestly in a dark place today. Thanks for breaking through with this ray of sunshine! Honestly Mr Goldbridge I've never, ever... ever had any sympathy for scummers but today i honestly do feel for you all as fans seeing that.
Good point about Ole getting slab,bambi and chicken .....160M total waste by a moron....2 idiots left are worth 30M for both!!! If your lucky?
I like you Mark but Roy Keane was calling out Harry Maguire before you ever did.
THEY SIMPLY DONT CARE
Yes. Do agree. That Hannibal lad did the right thing. HE RUNS, HE CHASES, HE ATTACKS. THIS BOY IS GOOD. HE WILL MAKE IT IN LIFE. SEND HIM OVER TO MY ACADEMY. HE CAN TEACH THE BOYS FROM THE FAR EAST A THING OR TWO.
Maguire is terrible terrible terrible he no better than a mid table team him
This bunch are a perfect reflection of todays society, soft as piss, inflated for nothing egos with no responsibility or interest in critiquing ones own performance to succeed at the highest level, pathetic.
Rubbish. How can utd ever turn these things around now we will be in religation battle next few seasons
Players checked out a long time ago and Raggnick checked out this month what an idiotic starting lineup can we please bench maguire and rashford for the rest of the season
Lack of accountability and self-entitlement is rotting the club. Ten Hag needs to clear out the entire first team squad (with very very few exceptions eg Sancho). Bring in young and hungry players who actually want to play for the badge. And the board NEEDS to revamp the wage structure because we cant keep splashing 200k+ per week on players who only care about themselves.
Dalot,awb,telles, mctominay,rashford,maguire and lindelolf are championship level
United need to sell everyone!! Jus keep Varane, Sancho & Ronaldo but everyone else can get on their bikes!!’
Mcguire is absolute trash. He has no ball sense and the media keep protecting him.
You sign ronaldo, sancho, varane and yet you continue to fail under any manager that leads you. Why? Because there's a massive problem in the changing room and also the backroom staff. You can't change manger and still allow the same backroom staff to stay on. This has alot to do with how they're coached and how they set up for the opposition. These lads have again thrown another decent man under a bus.
How are u saying carragher keane and scholes haven't called out rashford maguire. Marks special
The whole team should be sold except Ellanga , Ronaldo , Bruno ,Varan and Jadon we expect six to seven players to come with  Ten Hag to play his style and real United football team for the name and history of the club
CLOWNS. Goldbridge went in on one of the comments because they asked why we didn't play young players.   Lets be honest... We were going to get hammered eitherway, may as well drop the undropables and give the youth a try...did wonders for Fergie. Pellestri is our most technically gifted young player and he's not even at the club! NEVER would have happened under Fergie. All the young players that got given a chance have done quite well.
Lindelof, Bailly, Maguire, Phil Jones, Bissaka, Telles, Rashford, Mctominay must leave this summer
This most bitter blow we had ON MAN UTD PLAYING LIVERPOOL.  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
Mark, would it be fair to say you are just a very, very rich version of Blackburn Rovers these days? United is rotten from top to bottom, just like Blackburn. Owners don't give a crap, just like Blackburn's. Players couldn't care less. Yep. Standards are on the floor. Yep. Not looking good for either of us.
They are softer than a lemonade sandwich - Mark Goldbridge. LOL 😂
You are so right
I honestly thought it would be 7-0. Nevertheless Hannibal is man of the match for me along with sancho.
BRING IN JIM RATCLIFFE
At least Roy Keane has not protected these kids. He is pointing out 'lack of discipline' of this shambolic team. It is a night I miss Roy so much on the pitch.
Mate  stop crying 😂😂
Maguires ball to Hannibal was an insult! 10/10 Harry for wanting to give the ball to him but ducking seriously?? 😅 the kid must have thought this is the first team? 🤣
JIM RATCLIFFE NEEDS TO BUY THIS CLUB IMMEDIATELY
Leave Keano out of this, he was the only one who called these players out.
Maguire coming out and saying "I wouldn't be playing every game for Man Utd in the starting eleven if I'd been playing bad every game or not playing well enough.” Is quite possibly the most delusional statement from another human being I have ever heard.
The board are protecting Maguire as they realise that they have made a huge mistake spending £80M on him!!!
I actually turned off after 20 mins or something. Had a much happier evening. If the playing squad have completely lost interest, then so have I. I'll watch the Pre Season games, see how they are looking. But I just don't care...... At all.
Rashford tonight gave me some hope he wants to fight and stay
Man Utd are like the Hampster wheel from hell. They can't seem to get out of this cycle. This has gone on for 9 years. It looks like it will continue for at least another 9 at this rate
The win over Norwich is an overstatement, this is the real United.
bring in jim ratcliffe to buy the club
I don't really like maguire 😂 don't worry no-one does
I've been saying this for a few years now the entire team of Manchester United is absolutely horrific and garbage. Every single player needs to be removed the entire system entire player and the coaching have to be completely changed from top to bottom this is shocking the level of bad players.
Totally embarrassing once again from Manchester United players Brighton or brentford would of gave a better match against Liverpool smh
Let’s all bombard Maguires Social media and let’s get him out !!!!
players are not honest saying that they are not good enough or don't understand manger style, they will blame mangers like Pogba saying Jose gave me depression and the press believe his stupid behavior. who to blame today, is it Jose, Ole or Rangnick?
De Gea OUT. The difference between keepers tonight was mindblowing
30:56
So Goldbridge praises the foreign player for "passion and desire" yet has regularly criticised English players and called them "passion merchants" 🤔 Desperate to get likes from all the Anglophobes lol. Embarrassing.
Ralf not picking the team the board are
How you giving Bruno a 4 hahahaha
Are they really better than this Mark?! I don’t think so! They’re average at best and don’t deserve to wear the shirt. United are rotten from top to bottom! I’m not sure what Ten Hag can do with these useless bunch. He can’t sell the whole team that’s for sure.
Salah: they midfield and defense made it easy for us.😭😭😭😭
Lol
Some improvement from the last game,  The players still need more time to gel. Once Greenwood is back it will be a different story.
Awful from United once again but did anyone expect any different?!  No passion, no skill, no hope
Always blaming wan bissaka never dalot
United small club now.
They all took piss saying Ole was a PE Teacher…does that mek rangnick a prison PE Teacher then 😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂not forgetting a certain someone (Van Gaal)getting sack after winning FA CUP 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Bruno has one bad season and you lot want him out
Solskjaer deserves an apology from the fans.
Maguire and Rashford have not been protected 😭😭😭 They get daily abuse. Far more than other players.
Check out Rangnicks post match interview. So brutally honest
ETH has alot of work to do. Needs atleast 5 players. Maguire and Trashford need to be kicked out of the club.
Did Phil Jones play tonight?
Good to see others waking up to the fact that we are a bang average team, with average players. Something tells me things are about to change. Have faith my fellow reds. 👊👊👊
Well done Liverpool... It's there time and there smashing it... This is a lesson we need a over haul or we will carry on feeling like this... If we some How make champions league it will be a magical success... But are we that big of a club to except that... Players need to go and a new team needs to get rebuilt.. come one ten hag
Like Roy Keane said  Dey may be great but wen da watches n cars come in, da passion goes
Bullshitt Man U
This team is just an absolute fucking shambles all I wanna see is a team with players that play for the badge I say we drop half of those twats and play de gea telles  hardley baily Dalot matic Bruno Fred garnacho Hannibal Ronaldo
Didn’t expect anything else they are world class side and we are mid table/europa league at best. ETH needs time to get rid of the trashfords and maguire so we can progress
We keep mentioning Man United, What is manchesterunited? We don’t have any name, we list all long time a go
TOXIC UNITED
"There's a reason why I play for Manchester United" your price tag that you're not living up to
Too funny
Rashford developed into the 'Mane position' (as Jose liked to call it) then Ole came in and Rashford tried to make himself a 9 again and his general game kept regressing. He just wasn't humble enough to accept that he isn't a 9 and didn't learn the skills required by a winger.
Make me sick how Gary neville never has a go at Marcus rashford prob cause he's English 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
Ten Hag will fail if he doesn't sack these players. There's no way back for them. It has to be a new fresh project.
I'm happy Ten Hag is coming this Rangnick guy claimed to be the godfather of Gegenpressing😂😂 we are playing more bad under him than we played under Ole
Cant defend your block Maguire
7:20 guy😂😂😂🤣
That's one of Cr7s biggest strengths, he has 100% given up on United, but he hasn't given up on himself. Other players play for the badge and when that fails, they fail. Ronaldo plays for himself and it works.
Just swap in a full squad of youngsters and they would show more willpower and play for the badge.
Liverpool's WAG's showed more effort getting the kids ready for the school run!!!
They said bruno was better than King eric. Sell them all
Ten haag is another tony pulis, no way he is better than David moyes, Jose, lvg. If cluless united board had backed jose we wouldn't be in this position
The whole team are a shambles, there all as bad as each other, you can’t keep going in a Maguire and then on the other hand bang the drum at how much a CDM is needed. Put Van Dijk in United back four with the headless chicken in Bruno and Hollywood Pogba and he would look like Maguire. it’s a team game, the midfield is a shambles how do you think the defence are going to do with no protection. Use your heads ffs, I’ve played in decent teams where the centre backs are amazing but the midfielders are shite and you wonder who looks worse? The defenders because that’s where the goals go in
Man Utd in their absolute prime would still lose 4-1 at home to Liverpool so this isn’t a shock
This is just a case of the players trying to get ralf out before he gets them out. Ralf said we need a clear out. These man are gone if ralf goes upstairs
4:0 TOLD YA!!!
Maguire the best cb that ever put on a English shirt ..guaranteed to win the World Cup ..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keane has not called out Maguire? He's been ripping on him for at least a year and a half!
i wish i was there when maguire said that they pick him becoz he is good;  i would slap the delusion out of him 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😤🤬
De gea should be fucking knighted for the work he’s done for us the last 7/8 years. Honestly sick of this entire squad except him and the younger lads
hann said i not getting the bal, mejbri ill try for the red
Our best players was Hannibal and Sancho. Hannibal looked at the scoreline properly and he was like "No man we are Manchester United"
As for the fanboy who are saying we've lost all games Ronaldo have started. Give me a break. He didn't play today because of difficult circumstances. He's played in bad losses, he's won us games. Simple
Embarrassing squad. Full of headless chickens only want to collect paychecks 💔. Ten Hag really needs to be backed if he wants to succeed.
Pogba waved the white flag as usual, didn’t want to be there running around earning his massive wages
Rashford & Maguire they are not good enough from the beginning & overrated.
Way to many couch potato footballers at Man Utd. Sick of them!
Everyone giving hated comments to maguire(ok it’s true) but questionable formation from ralf. What rubbish is that? Truly amateur formation to set against liverpool
Off topic, Ralf has been saying Rashford has been good in training... Even my 12year old brother would look good in training playing this defence
If that his best team i am really believe the other are worse. Just question marks?
Rashford is sooo overrated ☹️
Trashford nothing more to say
Marking Mane today was a bit tricky he kept dropping, at some points he'd be on the shoulder of Maguire
I've said for a long time now, rashford needs to be the first out of old Trafford, followed by at least another 8 players 👋
Maguire rubbish😎👌👌
Maguire WTF.!!
We have to pressure maguire into leaving. I hate that it's got to this but his time has come. He has to go!
Yes we can attract players but we are no bigger attraction than Liverpool, City etc. Also, won't players go Erik Ten Who? It's like you lot think Ten haag is this worldwide know World class manager. He's a manager with potential
do not be surprised that we lost. be surprised that it was by only 4 goals... Only 4 OMG.!!!
Nothing will change, the players will just go and hide behind another manager. And the glazers probably didnt even know we played today.
Don't know what to say. Even in the second of the Dutch league there are no players with less passion, less work rate and less motivation than in this Manchester United side. I leave it with this, because I am lost for words. I really don't know what to say anymore .....
Bruno can do so much and no more..the other clubs realize Bruno is the heart of the club so they just shut him down...
Jose warned us about Rashford, Martial, Shaw, Pogba etc and we didn't listen. Sorry Jose.
Pogba suffering 'friendlitus' in a Liv - Man U game.  After 5 mins!  🤣
Mark how could you even say AWB had parts to play in their goals. AWB was arguably our best player today and he’s arguably been our the best in the back 4 since he joined the club!!!!!
Mark is targeting Bissaka unfairly. Dalot was the one getting beaten and wasting passes.
Leave keano.. Ricky on United stand called out these players and others laughed at him…..
Keep calm and be happy that we are still playing in the premier league
Marcos Rashford can't run at defenders without 100% of the time losing the ball or passing to the opposition. It happens every single time and now every time he gets the ball I'm just waiting for it to happen, I don't expect any other outcome. On that basis alone, he simply cannot play in this team
We United fans don’t get angry anymore.  We accept it.  What’s the point. No one should let a team full of crippled lambs ruin your evening.  Well done Liverpool. Great club and great team.
Maguire is a camouflage 5, just hides and gets caught out
I honestly do not think the players are good enough, yes some have downed tools BUT many of them simply ain’t good enough.
Watching Maguire is the worst
Pogba bottled an injury he knew he was getting cooked.
Keep Ronaldo and De Gea and get rid of the rest of the team they’re are all SHITE !!!
Mctominay and bailly would have actually put in some fight...and they on bench...worst selection ever...
Harry Maguire is the symbol of this comedy club.
Roy Keane has called them for so long now, embarrassing I thought United would have put a bit of effort in, but Liverpool are and will always be the better team than United
Jeez
29:56 there are 0's there too...do we need to lose 10 nil for them to get 0's ridiculous...
What goals were Bissaka at fault for?
I’d like to see AWB move from RB to CB instead of Maguire
Keane called them out . Especially trashford and the fridge
What would happen if the fans decided to pull their support on mat h day.
Our beloved treble. Manchester Utd's crowning achievement is in grave grave danger of being eclipsed by Liverpool. By Liverpool of all teams.
I love the fact that U don't mince your words!This team is being haunted by themselves ....grrrrrr
The right back was alright
How do you still think Ten haag will fix this? Why can't fans wake up. How many more projects will this club sell you, how many more managers will they appoint and how many more "big name players " will they sign before you realize none of those things will make the club successful. The ownership needs to change. It's good having a "potentially world class " manager. How's he gonna reach his potential with this structure. Nothing will change
Can you do a follow up video on reactions to the post-match interviews
Mark's calling out Keano, but he had the number of this lot way back during Jose. Said they threw him under the bus and they'd keep doing it because a leopard doesn't change its spots. Mark's only just caught up to that now after giving them all "clean slates"
They used  us to do training
Rashfords crap
Love seeing Fergie,s face at these matches. I think Charlton has give it up
Hannibal is getting the mctominay treatment i see
Sorry, but please explain what “the Professor” has given Man Utd in the time he’s been here.
i thought when AWB went lb he played decent up against salah
Man. United.  Are.     Crap.    The.    Players.     Need.  To.     Go.
It's impossible to be that bad...but we are united...capable of anything impossible...we must have had a bad connection or something...they all laaged behind...
Players out of contract have left already! Rebuild? Yes! You think a new manager is going to solve this? No!The very sad thing is if United did not have Ronaldo at 37 years of age- we would be close to a relagation situation! Work the maths out! Now that is what is very scarey! The talent of Man U players is totally over rated- not one would get into the Liverpool team-I even look at Arsenal and know players like Saka- Gabrielle-Martinelli -Emile Smith Rowe  could be in the their team- even Ramsdale as a backup keeper would- we would not get one player into the Liverpool team ........NOT ONE .....and they would take those Arsenal players as the Liverpool team is ageing ....now if we'd kept Moyes ......we would always be in the top 4...I'd just play the youth team and avoid 7th place
"If you're nothing without Ronaldo then you shouldn't have him"
No hate but why do you bother doing a match reaction just save your energy and time there’s nothing more to add we’ve known for months how crap these players are
Liverpool for the league title
Erik Ten Hag will be announced in the morning.
Worst utd of all time, best Liverpool of all time.  9-0 on agg.    *The perfect perfect storm*  🤣
Hannibal showed more spirit passion in 5 mints than other senior players did in 90 mints  They are embarrassing us every week
Maguire>>>>>maldini
Maguire was world class
Atleast it wasn't 5-0 💀
Regardless,....;.Respect to Liverpool paying respect to CR7 and family on the 7th minuite!!!!
