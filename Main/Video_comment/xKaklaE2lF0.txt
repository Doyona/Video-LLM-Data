I am a small fishing content creator I started just because of  you can u please like to fishing  friends
That zander by CAL first CAST!!!!! WAS INCREDIBBLE😮😮😮😮😮😮!!!!!!!!!!!😮😮🎉
Mr Carl I fish since I was 6 I’m old man at 40 now and fish whenever I can. I’m originally from Poland but live now in USA. I’m always missing the fishing in Europe with all the available species… after your USA videos I have a hope for my future endeavors about carp fishing! You have to come back to USA and make a series about Buffalo fishing. It’s only native to North America and it’s big and strong as carp! They also most of the time eat the same thing. I just landed a 37 lbs last weekend overnight and it was a blast! Keep up the great work! Your videos are amazing! Fan for life. Tight lines boy!
Hey Carl I’m the the US ILLINOIS to be specific next time your out here I’d love to fish with you I don’t want screen time just memories and fish time
Hey carl there's a pond called bridge cottage fisheries it's not got 50 pounders but small carp roach and other species it'd be amazing if you came to this pond
Love this video Carp are a good to fly and i love it  👊
Are you in England or somewhere else?
Who else had no idea his carp reel was $115
Sean from @SnaggedBro will show you all about bream fella .Iol maybe you could do a bream collaboration pmsfl 😂
keep up the  good work
Wish I could catch wels catfish like that in the states.. such amazing strong fish.. I mean yeah we have blue cats and flat head cats but wels grue to real monsters
Where can i go in surrey to catch trout thats not a lake fisherie i want to do fly fishing but i dont where to go for trout
Amazing video. It is so interesting to note the different fish species and fishing gear compared to the Canadian context. Dad would take us camping and fishing in Algonquin Park.  We were always up at the crack of dawn, lunches and gear packed, we'd set off in Dad's Chesnut canoe.  The canoe would glide over beaverdams. We'd  see huge snapping turtles swim beneath us and painted turtles sunbathing on logs, loons (hear them first), otters, bear, moose and deer. Despite the scenery, our goal was to return to camp with dinner.  Depending on the lake we would catch walleye, perch, pike (I never caught a muskie), bass, brook trout and lake trout.  We used Rapalas, red devils and worms for bait. I never touched the worms. Ick!  I shuddered when you opened that box of creepy crawlies! Lol.  I miss Dad.  I am sorry for your loss.  I hear you.
Fun fact, I caught carp, crucian, catfish, perch, roach, bream, pike in one day in Astrahan, Russia 😅
I want to know the book name,thanks!
0:05 that barble 😮😮😮
Brilliant video well done lads 😊
ik im rly late but if anyone could respond it would help, does anyone know how to setup the net that carl uses in the beginning ? im new to fishing and unsure how to tighten the end.
Nice fishing Carl 👍It's unbelievable  👍👍👍
Seems to be A LOT of relatives of carp in England… weird
30:34 just to inform you I’ve been fishing since 8 and mate that fish isn’t a perch
Hello! Can I order the book and have it delivered to me in Romania?
Should have kept the bass and put it on the BBQ!
Video ini adalah video terbaik dari semua video mengenai memancing ikan dan jenis jenisnya
rip roger
Matt Hays was the first to do this with the great rod race.
I play cricket and I fish and I love how an angler says cricket is boring😂
Great to see Chris assisting
niceee video
24:28 holy crap that’s a massive rainbow!
The fact that im watching this video while flying a plane
BREEEAHHHMMM
You should try the multi species challenge again
snagged bros friend tom once said 'With eel, you have to stroke them till they get stiff' RIP Roger too, he's looking down at you Carl. Well done.
You inspired me. After some serious knockdowns in my privat life, now i'm in fishing again. I've been fishing since my childhood. Lost it and now it gives me the calm i need. Thx Carl! Greets from Hamburg/Germany Sven
Why did the eel remind me of my cat 😭
28:37 what fish is that?
Shoutout to the eels, the best fish ever 😂
Where is this? 1:00
Cut out the bit where he illegally throws the crayfish back 😂
what size hook is he using for float fishing
Lovely video! Thank you for sharing this.
6:14 marvelous! 🤣🤣🤣
Can’t believe you were up my neck of the woods in braunston. Cracking place to fish. I find that zander are best found the other side of the long tunnel.
I mean everyone hating bream but i can't even catch them cought only one in 3 years😅😅
What reel were you using ?
He forgot the blue gill
Why do you not use braided hooklinks? They work just fine for me and they don't snap all the time.
My birthday is the 17th of August😂
ive been watching u since i was 6 i am now 10 and still adore ur vidios ur the best fisherman ever keep the insane work up
Best video ❤
thats one crazy rainbow
Your struggles with the sea trout are very similar to fly fishing for big native Brook trout in the national forest where I live in the mountains of West Virginia. They are like ghosts. Makes you really really appreciate catching one!
12:20 Foreshadowing his brother...
I have these type of fish
It is such a joy watching you and Carl going on adventures
31:12 @gingerfisherman could catch a Barble in under 10 mins
Fav video you did love the challenge
Not a true "expert" fisherman, but certainly avid angler and long time doing it..... perhaps you should try SETTING THE HOOK. And you won't lose as many. @6.15
RIP Roger
It's a young person's privilege to forego rest and sleep.  Enjoy it while you've got it.  It's nature's gift to young people to help them through the tough times when they are young.
The eel is so cute 🥰
maga voters are thick poor and dont buy teslas there done for
This video gets better every time I watch it! Do you think there might be a connection between your respect and admiration for your early mentor Roger, and the fact you still consider Gudgeon one of your favorite fish to catch?
1 van 2 guys 🤔 hmm sounds a bib sus to me 😂
What whip are you using at the beginning I would like to get one for the kids as rod a reel would result in multiple birds nest lol 😂
Thanks Carl - must have missed this one - reminds me of Jim Gibbinson catching a goldfish from a tiny pond 😂
Is that the same tree at 20:18 / 20:19 ??
I'm sure that "Bream" was a Hybrid
That happened to me but in cape Breton with mackerel chunks and lobsters
The anglers paradise lake you fished looks amazing and exactly the venue I had been looking for, unfortunately I live 5 hours away from it so I was wondering if anyone knows any other venues like anglers paradise where you catch catch species such as carp, catfish etc.
All the best to Rogger( if you spell it so)
Thanks!
Where can I buy the book?
Always have a battle with the fish don't just scoop it up
What was the name of the 3rd lake, thanks!
Best fishing video I think I’ve seen in a while❤
fishing in the UK is the easiest thing in the world
Thank you Roger for teaching the man who will teach millions.
barbe takes cheese and bread
Hi  Rob here true story to took the kids out sunday we all got sick well i watch alot of traveling shows fish camping etc anyway over sleep i woke up to this guy Name alex and he was traveling then he did a Q&A and he mention you i have been searching for this kind of fishing fun for 4 years now Fishing has not been the same since i lost my son your joy and your energy reminds me so much of him thanks for helping this father to find his passion again
Hey Carl this is really my fav film you ever made keep up the good work❤
I’m not even lying my name is Gavin😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
The reason you keep missing the fish is because your not setting the hoo hard enough you need to give it a good tug
Should have some to dalrey Dale for your trout chub greyling and barbel the river is stocked with them
hay lắm bro ơi
WHAT RIVER DO YOU GO TO KATCH CHUB AND BARBEL
I've not completed the list over all my years fishing. Haven't had a barbel yet but that one you got was a beauty. I may have to search one out myself.
I have caught an eel
1:27 what is that fish called
Rip❤❤❤❤ roger
What rod is that u use at the 0:49 mark?
Your fishing journey is wonderful and interesting, wish your channel more and more development 🎉
I live in Southampton
Hey Carl id love to buy your book, can they ship it to sweden?
Tick of the mino
you might not respond because im a bit late but do you reccomens pole fishing rod fishing or both
Thank you, for doing so much quality videos, youre my favourite fishing youtuber, and u have teached me alot, thanks mate, love you!
Your fishing video's  are always so relaxing❤
Bro, catfish here in freedom land are crazy Wierd. They poisonous, venomous, AND have spines. YALL just got size
Omg in Winchester
15:57
I also identify as a eel fishing loonatic also ❤❤❤
Your naration kinda sounds like a young Jeremy wade
That bream was a hybrid I reckon
is that a species of walley? at 27:23
What is his whip in the beginning of the video?
what rod did he uses for the barble and chub
Perch? Thats funny, what you call a roach n what i call a roach 💨😂
carl you inspired me to go fishing for catfish thank you so much
What was that lake called when you caught the catfish. Great video as usual
I fished for 11 hours on method feeder and caught 11 bream 😂!
Do you and Alex still have the ownership of the carp lake
Was that bullhead real? I’ve never seen one that big
Just found your channel and subscribed, why when James caught a sea trout fly fishing ,why did you move away from that area and carry on spinning rather than fly fishing???
Cricket is fun
Wow, super neat just right across your channel. By chance what was the name of that book for you were checking off the species?
what an awesome journey dude 👍👍👍
River seven has lots of barbel
I love how no matter how small the fish you still release it safely and don’t just chuck it back
I absolutely love your content! I recently got my daughter into fishing and i was wondering where is situated the very first lake where you've been, the one with crucians and gudgeons . I will love to take her there so she can have a small dose of my childhood. Thank you in advance!
35:00 I like how you slept behind the van, instead of in front of it for some security.
32:34 the most Chaotic moment ever 😂
I absolutely love your content man been watching for a few years now before the solo ventures and all. Just so informative, well made and enjoyable. Hope you continue to succeed on youtube mate best wishes to ya from little ole liverpool
Hi Carl what was the lake called for catfish
25:19 the Zander has now moved to United States and is in a lake in north dakota
Carl, I have a challenge for you. Something I think you can't do you get a year to do this fishing challenge the challenge is you have to catch your all of the fish in your log book but... each one has to be your pb. And there's a forfeit if you lose you have to take me on a fishing trip but i you win you can give me any dare just don't be to mean I am 11 after all.
I do not know if you have any use to this advice but in mainland europe, we use a lot more stops and breaks during the retrieval of soft lures for zander. They mainly attack on the zone in which the lure either drifts or sinks slowly towards the bottom. With a constant retrieval, the fish are at times a lot less tempted to strike. Cheers
Hey Carl You need to come to Australia and try and catch a 200lb Murray Cod that’s our biggest fresh water fish and I’m positive you would catch a 60 to 100lb carp in the mean time.
Hey carl i was wondering if i could use a similar layout for my videos of catching every fish in the uk i just dont want to get sued 😂,  Please like this so he sees it
I recently had the best days fishing down at sherwood forest fisheries.  Didnt catch any monsters. Just a lot of half £ common, mirror and curcian carp. Bream roach,. Really enjoyed myself.
If i get 30 species of fish in year my dad pays me 100€
But how do eels get into lakes?
In Ireland if you catch an ell you have to release it asap you cant even take a picture
Omg I've realized after what is the breem😂😂😂, the least fish I want to fish but it hooks most of the time
Hi Carl what’s you pb perch and brown trout
BRO WHYY
Let me go is so funny he’s talking to a kreyfish 7:16
Caught an eel before .. by accident. Hardest fish to unhook!
For me, my first fish ever were 5 bass, i was living in Cornwall at the time and my grandfather was helping me with my casts, im so grateful that he helped me. Your videos inspire me :)
Should do more videos like this love the different species
46:18 very strange looking Carp i think that might be Koi Carp
Scarlett & I are very sorry to learn of your friend and mentor ‘Roger’s’ passing. I am sure he was extremely proud of both yourself and Alex… great video both of you.
the trout counts its still a stream id count it
What is the lake where you caught the cat fish called
in that one lake how are there so many koi fish
Iv been watching these for years. Seem so down to earth id love you meet you on the bank one day. It was watching your videos that made me go fishing and now i send too much on carp gear so thanks for that 😂
This is the most watchable 50 minutes on YouTube. Props to you Carl
Cum to South Africa  and fish with us
What a fantastic film guys!!!
Hi Carl, just wondering what rod you were using in the start of the video when u caught the small perch because I’m thinking of getting one do u mind telling me the brand that made it? Thanks
Haha Leif your Reel on the Fly Rod is backwards!! Haha it’s for right handed reeling and left handed casting haha! No worries! You continue to entertain!
Cracking video boys
You should get a submarine and use it to fish from. Leave it on the bank and use it as a platform. With the airplane being in the pond put the submarine on the land. Jobs roles reversed
Cals a great companion
You know its illegal to fish off a bridge
Best YouTube Fishing video I have ever seen, loved the comment where you said  Salmon takes you to nice places but expensive places! one of them would be Ireland, Its gone insanely expensive over here for fishing, but who cares once the line is tight eh.   Really enjoyed the episode mate , tight lines in future
what was the net and handle you used for chub and barbell fishing (the one on the backpack) or do you recommend any other travel nets
Excellent channel Carl 👍
“Or has the eel got me” famous last words
I hate you because I can’t fish in the uk and you can 😡 Great video!
What about Zander?
That eel part has got me in stitches Carl 🤣🤣🤣 the way he turned and looked at u hahahahaa never laughed so hard in my life what a brilliant video ❤ RIP roger 🙏
Carl i once caught a seven pound bream
Very cool can’t believe I didn’t see this last year😔
Great  video pal
Has anyone seen a man named Gavin?
16:05 i got the eel or has the eel got me
Pike fishing in april is not a thing you should post online in eu it triggers the pike ppl, but uk i dont know, but most of eu have rules about targeting fish in breeding times, denmark has all of april no pike fishing, i am not saying you fish pike in april. Just some bonus info.
I got your book. It's really handy. Do you have any tips on how to handle perch. I get a bit afraid of one biting as I struggle not to get pricked by their spikes. Is there any gloves I can get that are perch-proof but don't harm the fish?
You were too slow
you filmed this video one year ago on my birthday😎
Where is the lake at about 18-19 minutes?  Looks really cute.
I’ve been watching this vid over and over and only just realised the end I know this is late but I’m sorry about that Carl
1 van 2 guys and 7 children in the back
Also living in Hexham I wish I was there to tell you that you can’t use the front entrance to the county hotel, you have to use the side entrance and then you can sleep there. Just a tip for next time.
When I was living in England saw matt Hayes the great rod race,  this reminds me of that.
Hey, I have your simple fishing guide and just to flex on you! I caught a sea trout 😂😂😂. On the Tyne aswell. That’s 1 nil of sea trout to me and 0 to you! Also RIP roger
One thing is for sure: We never forget the people who learn us how to fish. This video took me back, thank you!
This seriously a gem on youtube!! This remind me a lot like river monster documentaries, the way the presentation and naration! Bravo
I keep watching this 😂
in poland we call perch an okoń
Ahhh mate. The eels😅  Catch them down here all the time in the down under. I shriek when i see them on the end of my line 😂 You were very brave!
🎣🥲
I've suggested this to many, but no  youtuber dares to do it unfortunately.  Would you consider doing something similar in southern Europe where there's NEW THINGS to show? For example, Greece has over 100 species of freshwater fish, with a huge portion of them being endemic(found nowhere else). Or, Croatia and Bosnia is another option, you'll catch some weird looking trout species there that your audience probably never saw before.... and that, i believe would be a success!!
TO CATCH EELS U GO IN A DEEP-ESH RIVER WITH A SPOT LIGHT AND LOOK AROWED AND SCOOP THEM UP WHEN U SEE ONE
Great video bro , I like the different species you have in GREAT BRITAIN!!!
Hello. Can you answer which rod (name,model) it was when you fishing on a method feeder?
Excellent video!!  Enjoyed every minute you are fantastic anglers and video creators.. Roger would be proud, and you are following in his fishing footsteps inspiring youngsters to fish.. thank you!!  Tight lines!
Thanks for your vids  bro
i love watching British people having fun
You look a bit like just alex
Carl you done exceptionally well catching all those different species in just 7 days I'm not being funny but I thought I know all the species and I've never even heard of a sea trout that's a win in my book mate 😉 well done
Are all the drawings of fish in the book drawn my omni ??  If so does she get a percentage of each book sold 😂
I'd rather watch you guys then any other fishing channel. Keep up the great content! ❤
I'm rewatching this for the 1000th time and its funny that he calls those hooks big for catfish. we run hooks 100x as big as that here in the u.s.
I caught my first barbel on a stick float in that same spot, lovely fish of around 8lbs, lovely river that I like to fish after fishing the Trent
Love Carl's energy!!! Awesome videos mate!!
Who else has watched this like 5 times😆
Such a good video
Lovely sentiment at the end Carl ❤
if you want to catch an ell you need a sundew and go night fishing
in czechia we are catching more bream than carp😁
Little tip , u can catch sanders on worms and maggots , I actually caught pretty big ones on maggots.
I learned in my youth that eels indeed need some time too bite !! 👍 Loving this content I really wanna do one some day !!!
if Jeremy wade had a son it would be you!! when you were holding the eel you looked just like him you even quoted him "do I have the eel or has it got me"?
Have you ever thought to do this but with saltwater species?
2 nd lake the beautiful flower shot at the beginning is Himalayan Balsam a very invasive weed. Not sure if you should report it to the environment agency 🤷‍♂️
Did you go to koi wholesale 11 months ago
I live in the last location 😂
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
R.I.P Rodger the GOAT ❤️❤️❤️
In my country we catch breen everyday
Caught an eel with my bare hands once we dont need rods
EEls we take flurocarbon leaders ......................wire whaaaaat
The way u setting the hook no wonder it fell of ..............
I honestly can’t stop watching this! I’m actually thinking of doing my own 7 day multi species challenge!
You are the best YouTube fish a man and your brother
I would love to fish with you guys cause I need so much help with fishing
i love the videos i watching your videos before i have  a competition
What rod are you using. Also nice vids
I very much enjoyed watching this, so many things that other fishermen can relate to.
Even Jeremy Wade won't touch those bream. I think I'm not touching them either😂😂
Great video and awesome effort.  Many memories flooding back of my time fishing in the UK before moving to Australia.  But intend getting back into it after moving to a more freshwater area :D
You deffinitley helped me get into fishing . Some great memorys to come thanks to you . Vids are allways great and really enjoyable .
a local indenpendent restaurant :)
One of the most well done youtube videos I've ever seen.
Can't believe you got a salmon,a sea trout aswell was asking alot, Wales would have been an easier place to get the last hardest species
1:04 - Perch 1:28 - 1:33 - Crucian Carp x2 2:10 - Gudgeon 2:35 - Crucian Carp 3:15 - Tench 7:10 - Freshwater Crayfish 7:44 - Common Roach 7:46 - Rudd 7:58 - Bream 9:50 - Catfish 15:53 - Eel x2 18:20 - Common Carp 19:52 - Goldfish 20:03 - Mirror Carp 20:28 - Dace 20:45 - Common Minnow 21:45 - Pike 22:32 - Brown Trout 23:30 - Grayling 24:28 - Rainbow Trout 27:28 - Zander 29:05 - Perch 30:35 - Common Roach 31:52 - Chub 33:40 - Common Barbel 39:24 - Salmon 40:25 - Sea Trout 46:17 - Koi Carp 46:25 - Catfish 46:38 - Koi Carp 46:45 - Ghost Carp 49:15 - Pollock 50:12 - Wrasse 50:55 - Sea Bass All of the species that Carl and his friends caught
For zander reel in 2-3 rotations and then let it drop to the bottom and repeat. You can use a 15cm shad easily. For the jighead the lighter the better (less weight is more droptime between the 2-3 rotations)
Hahaha the bait was still moving when you went after the eels
Quality 👏
just clicked join and watched the video on there, made me all emotional, on the struggle you battled.
Keep up the work
Any chance you’d let a fellow angler lnow what stream you caught your trout and grayling on?
It was like a film
one ik on this vidoe = one prayer for roger
Being a bass fisherman in North America, some of this technique is very odd to me
Flat head catfish
Wow as an American angler this opened my eyes about fishing around the world
You are asome❤
The zander looks like a walleye
16:48 not a fan of your voicesrry this vid was auto playing when I came back inside
Mach das auf was du Lust hast , 👍😊
What are those rod holders called?
I love this video this is the best 51:41 minute in my life❤️🎣
You call that a Bream lol, would be great to see a specimen species challenge like a Bream over 6lb or 2lb Roach, now that would take time but Im sure you could work it to your schedule.
I. Love you  karol
Day 5-6 is like my Idaho trip. 5:45 hour of driving $240 on flies 3 days and 1 BABY brown trout. Then stopped at another lake to kayak fish just to realize we forgot our paddles. 5:45 back home and when we unpacked. OUR FLIES WHERE GONE
the funny brittish man giving the crayfish a talking to was the best part for me
great  show from your mate in San Diego California  your a couple of real sportsman
Hot Cheetos would absolutely kill an English person
my 6 year son loves watching this video he's watch it like 100 times over now he cant wait to get on the bank again. I'm mainly a carp angler so teaching my son mainly carp but no he's like I want to catch a bream, roach and so on. so thank you for making him aware of the so more species out there.
the fact that   this  is from  britain ehances my  experience
Why dont u finish reeling in so u dont have i put the rod behind trying to grab 10 feet of line out lol. Finish reelin in
There are fish in the UK?
Its incredible how hard this challange can get so quick. You could catch 90% of the species with a worm and minnow in a day. Than the last 10% will take the last 6days if your lucky.
From my experience, bream catch best on basket feeders on a telescopic
Fishing for zander is quite easy you just have to go to the bottom of the canal and then 1 or 2 turns with your reel and then repeat the proces
Oh no lake 1 is closed today 😢
Carl while fishing barbel: NEVER BACK DOWN NEVER WHAT ?
When u did the one overnight why u usisg Alex’s tent
Awesome video as usual mate 👍
For me it was seeing my dad playing a fishing game on his phone, so he took me to this commercial and i loved it. Back when my dad set up my rods, reels, floats, hooks and literally i just sat there and got it handed to me. Best thing aswell, didnt have to deal with all the tangles i got into 😂
God this was an amazing video. The audio. The visuals.
you’re doing roger proud mate. caught my first couple of perch this past weekend at my local quarry thanks to your videos. you’re smashing it keep it up 👍
please do this video idea again, its so good i watched it 100 times.
That was an awesome video keep up the good work your doing
The fact that he takes time to reply to his fans is just too wholesome❤❤
I just got you simple fishing guide book and I am so happy
did your freind died ??
That’s a big and odd looking rainbow trout 24:32
As an American fisherman, the differences between the two different areas of fishing are quite cool and unique, incredible gadgets, I learned a lot from this video!
i m crying
Wait where is he fishing at😮
alex: "catches a salmon on the first half an hour of the fishing"  me: "dosent catch a fish for 4 hours fishing the same spot were you were behined the rock"
The don't look at me like that, has been the best thing today
hey love the channel but is expensive gear like u use really necisary
Hallo Richtig cooles Video! Darf man fragen wo das war?
What was that second fish
Were can i buy the book?
can you dm me that spot for trout and greyling? i live in hampshire and ive been trying for ages to hook a wild trout
I wonder with videos like this how many different tickets or research is undertaken to find out what tickets or licenses required to fish all these different locations
Where the first lake on day six ?I like coicarp
What a wonderous video. I'm just starting out fishing and your videos are definitely helping me to get ready for my fishing and keeping me exited while I waited for my own gear, I'm definitely getting that book.
Smoked mud eel in Nova Scotia is uber tasty.
Well done u are amazing at fishing 😊
i love you vids. for the bass and wrasse you went to moushole harbour witch is very close to were i live do you think if we can get in touch that we can go fishing together one time
Can u do a vid when u do a full video of float fishing on the pole
Hey that cat fish is a red tail😂 love this video keep it up Yo can you shout me out please and thank u And ihope u get to 1 million subscribers before the  End the yea hope u have a great day 💛 💗 💓 💕 😊 💖 💛 💗 💓 💕 😊 💖 💛 💗 💓 💕 😊 💖 💛 💗 💓 💕
I love this video for no reason
do you have to set the hook for British fishing because it dosent look like you have to
I live about 30 mins from Wolverhampton 😂
This made for a great video. I love multispecies videos. Great persistence.
he sounds like mr illustrated a bit and i get that kind of vibes from him
What country did catch in the video
I hate bream because I catch them too often here in Finland 😂
i have them socks they are very lucky
Big up Bude haha
Do y’all know what a brim is
As always he doesn't fail to impress
I love your videos so much!!!
Fish at robertson in South Africa 🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟
Nice pub on that stream in hampshire
well done on the video, i was “hooked” from the very start. And i would like to say Rest In Peace to Roger.
So well-done my friend. A joy to watch!
Some tips to get a brim is to use dead bait like perch with a strong smell
Where is this place?
Carl have been fishing braunston spot all week lures dead bait everything nothing and advice
This could be a show on the air
It’s crazy how they can just set up a cot on the side of the road and sleep safely
Hey Carl would love to get some eels or some good fishing in Northamptonshire the nene is boring and is that the old estate fisheries
What type of paper do you think when you cut those pretty Gold Fish?
Wrasse is super important for salmon and reefs if they go extinct salmon will get lots of parasites
This could easily pass for a BBC fishing series
If the sun don't shine we'll get a tan standing in the English rain.
What kind of set up were you using in the beginning of the video. I would love to find out. Thank you and great video.
Transition at 20:18 is so good! Nostalgic shots
That transition at 20:18 was so clean tho
I thought that you where supposed to kill zander in the UK
Loved seeing you fish the seas of my home county. Condolences
Never seen someone disappointed to lose a bream 😂
Sorry for your loss, but he inspired you like you inspire me to go fishing everytime i see your videos just because i get jelous of the fish you catch and it makes me want to fish like you in holland.
Hello from the Czech Republic! I love Carl´s videos. I can also learn English!
funny, i literally stopped the video to buy the book, 5 mins before he mentioned it in the video
What an absolutely brilliant Video!!!! A real great effort from you guys, I am so pleased I found this video and will now hit subscribe! ….Smithy
Carl this is piece of art. Roger rest in peace.
27:28 it is technically illegal to release zander back into canals in the uk however I don’t care about that law
What catfish bait was that??
I am doing this challenge too but i am not going on the beach this year so i only have 72 species to catch i only caught 7 species i have only 65 species to catch.
Haha I don't like it looking at me like that   *5 seconds later*   Seriously bro, we got a fucking problem?
Does anyone no were to get that book? Orsome vid 😎💣💥
Im from Newcastle 😀
This video reminds me of an episode of river monster just with the style of recording
My grilfriend loves it when i come home with a big chub.    That's a joke. I ain't got no girlfriend, haha.
Daventry is where my grandad moors his boat
Nice video carl. Hello from germany.
Great video Carl!
You can’t put your rod over your head but in your eye site at the tip
Awesome video can’t wait to buy myself and fill in the book
Have to say those editing skills are on another level completely 👌 💯
Great vid
The ginger fisherman ruined this for me so for the first time ever thumbs down 👎
Does anyone know where the canal bridge with the mallards on is when they're targeting zander please?
25:32 Glory to Ukraine!
Met Carl at The big one. Really nice fella and he and his brother got me fishing again in lock down
Thanks for this video. I loved it, and I've never seen so many small species makes all my catches look massive lol ,well done you two and friends.
is there any way i can get this book shipped to mid eu?
I never watch videos this long, but this was an exception. This was absolutely amazing!!!! You've gained a new subscriber.
Love the detail and enthusiasm!
You need to be wearing a life jacket when at sea!
Im going fishing tommorow end im going feeder  im trying too catch a crap hopfully a 5 pounder
Eels are so delicious 😋
It is so relaxing to watch you videos
Should have kept the crawfish and used him for bait 🙃
Great video, sadly not the sea trout, thank you for making so many really good videos that helped me catch so many fish. R.I.P. Roger.
The way he says I’ve got an eel or has it got me 😂
Disliked purely for the cricket slander
What a great video, keep it up
Can't believe I'm only watching this now ,great video and great to have those memories with your fishing mentor
As an American seeing a one and a half hour drive being called a long drive gave me a bit of culture shock
A1 Quality content, Carl! Thanks for helping me identify new fish species. You are one hell of an angler! This is a wonderful tribute for your mate, Roger.
24:56 "... healthy breakfast at a local independent food retailer we found" 🤣
بالتوفيق
Carl I love ur vids and took inspiration for my pfp and since I started fishing last year I havent stopped watching ur vids thank u for the help and that’s amazing the way u caught all these fish I squashed it down into a 53 min vid ❤
I saw cal at the fishing show yesterday
Its more than just fishing-its about respecting the very source that created ,nourished and sustained all life . RIP Roger. great job of passing on the torch.
Not into fishing, but that was so good to watch..well done fellas.
Amazing as always Carl. Looked so much fun.
Hey man great Video... And I think you can count the Salmon for the sea trout also, by the way your friend caught it !! Defo getting your book Cheers man
You truly are an inspiration! Keep it up. Definitely inspired me to get back out there 😀
"I've got an eel or has the eel got me?" phahahahahaha
9:30 Come to Hungary or check out some of the Haldorádó fishing videos. A lot of peopel using 2x24mm boilies to catch carps in here :D
Are u related to the channel "Just alex" u look familiar please respond. I need to find out
Big love to Rodger , he started god knows how many kids and people down the path of a tranquil and exciting lifestyle of fishing the beutiful wilds and waterways of the world. People  like Rodger are those salt of the earth men whom we never forget. Fantastic video.
Awesome journey, almost felt like I was there! Thanks for the video!
Best ever! What a perfect adventure. Cheers from Brazil. Sorry for your loss.
Excellent video chaps and a fine tribute to your inspiration.  Carry on that legacy
Only Babys?
Kudos for not calling it a sea bass
8:40 "Big, strong hooks now…"  Americans be like, "YOU CALL THAT A CAT-FISHING HOOK!"  *HOLDING 12/0 CIRCLE HOOK*
Vass waders are absolute garbage.
The ginger fisherman ahoy !
Mirrors and Commons are the same species
Great video I’m not a fisherman only been mackerel fishing in Devon a few times n shark fishing in Mauritius as a tourist but really enjoyed this programme  could you catch some ghost carp or gold fish some time please and video it cheers
Would love to know some of the locations you fish as well as how to fish the areas (club, day ticket, private etc). Great vid though Carl and sorry to hear about your mentor Roger. Tight lines mate
I used to watch you at the start of covid and i have to say that the video and editing quality has gone up unbelievable. Looks like something you see on Discovery Channel
R.I.P Roger 😇❤ great video buddy
If you want to eat fish from a lake go to poland there are many fish there like here in england but the most tastiest are big bream and roach and pike and zander plus catfish so maybe try to go there if you like
that's a nice red fin perch mate in Australia we call them reddy's / redfin hear  just wanted to throw it out there if anyone wanted to know something about us down under
has to come to australia and catch a murray cod and a golden perch or a silver perch or maybe and estuary perch
Lovely video can’t say I truely had a Roger but did have a neighbour who took me fishing to catch my first Roach on the local canal , I’d like to think that I was an Uncle Mark to my nephew who I fished with for ten years until he was 16 and whenever I see him we reminisce, his love of the outdoors has seen him progress to wild camping and swimming and next week I’ll be dropping off an old telescopic rod and a box of small lures as he wants to catch and cook some trout from small streams in the hills and mountains he now visits . Great video really enjoyed it .
I was at home fighting a bad bout of the flu as Well as depression, you don’t know how happy your videos make me, I kind of just want to get a line in the water except it’s winter in the states. Thank you for the videos.
Quality video,
Lake? Fishing in a toddler's paddling pool! 🤣 God you poms are odd.
Well done on the attempt lad great angling.  One thing wrong is next time when out in a boat use a life vest. Correct me if you guys had one on and I didn't see. 🎣
I this canal you went to Newport ?
The toon for salmon yes lad
Epic video Carl. I am ready to get back into fishing. 👊🏻
the best ever fishing channel that i aver see... lot of education about fish in your channel . i can just watching 50 mint without skip bro.... the way to enjoy your life is traver like them hihihihihi .... gogogo make my life happy when u 'FISHON'...WELL DONE
Rest in peace Roger. I started watching you and Alex many years ago and loved your videos from tanyards. It looked like such a great place and you guys always seemed to enjoy it, I put it on my bucket lists of places to fish. I moved to Brighton in 2016 and took up fishing again and popped up to tanyards and I was not disappointed, it was great to see you back there (now renamed) at the start of the video. I never had the pleasure of meeting Roger on any of my trips there but heard a few good things about him from the people there. He will be greatly missed.
What's the name of the rod he caught the catfish with
Yet another cracking video. Rip to your friend Roger 🙏
Sorry to hear about your old friend he would be so proud of you bro
Enjoyed that, immensely. Good job
Dear Carl,            My name is Michal Haley, and I am 12 years old. I have recently started carp fishing, but I don’t have that much gear. I know that you have a lot of gear so I was wondering if I could have some. Thank you some much everything that you have taught me.            Happy fishing,            Michael Haley P.S. I am a subscriber
Absolutely BRILLIANT! Really enjoyed that. Crayfish 😬
Do you guys in the uk have walleye
great vid , but how comes you didnt fish in kent nor london plenty of lakes and canals also a few docks worth fishing in london
bro is the xander a walley or is it different
So, does this mean we are getting a dedicated seatrout video?
I'm so sorry for Roger that last part made me cry
Really interested in those rainbows in the stream in the garden, has he dammed the stream and stocked them himself in the stretch in his garden or are they wild?
Enjoyable video.  RIP Roger
Loved every minute of the video and always picking up new tips… thank you lads and I’m sure your old buddy will be proud of you up there. ❤
Them lil goldfish be perfect for a garden pond
Just wanted to stop in and make another comment;  This video was seriously incredible.  No joke, I don't think I've ever felt this inspired, hopeful, and just happy from one youtube video.  That little ending bit was very touching, I genuinely just can't overstate how much I enjoyed this.  Props.  Hope you enjoyed making it.
it was interesting to see you talk about the lake at 10:30 as if it was huge;  I'm from Michigan where a 12 acre lake thats 35 feet deep is tiny.  I have a lake about 5 minutes from me that is over 3 square miles and over 100 feet deep.  However, the ease with which you're catching trout over there is crazy! I've been fly fishing for over a year now and have yet to catch a trout.  Super fun watch Carl, keep it up.
I never knew Roger, but we have all felt the pain of losing someone who has affected our lives in some way. A fitting tribute and a great adventure.
black nymph and a maggot for zander
Do you miss making videos with Alex?
Eels are one of the most interesting fish species ever.
British people do not know how to fish. Just hold the rod and use a worm????
Amazing film, Carl! Through and through super quality content and production.
Rest in peace Rodger ❤
Do you have freshwater bass over there? They are one of the best fish here in the US for sport fishing
Loved the film mate. Can I offer you a tip if you're ever going catfishing? Try using molecrickets as bait. I grew up fishing for catfish on the Danube and molecrickets are by far the best bait for them
That’s a Wells catfish. I didn’t know that they were in Britain. We are extremely lucky here in America, we can fish just about anywhere for free and catch so many types of fish.
Great video, really enjoyed
Awesome film. Well done 👍
I watched the 51:41 minutes without stopping the video at any time. The videos you make are like a movie, once you start it's easy to get hooked and watch the whole video.
Where is this filmed at because I love fishing but I have never heard of bream or Ruds I’m just curious
Y’all guys should come to America I’ll take y’all to catch some monster catfish and bass
Great vid ! I live on a narrowboat and the reason it’s so hard to catch zander is that the crt cull them every year now because they are invasive,  your at braunston and they cull it all the way down and up party of the Ashby seen them in the boats sending shocks in the water then the catch all the big zander and believe me they are big !
Can't believe this guy is fishing with Jamie Lannister!
if u ever in cornwall again hit me up
Absolutely love your content, just purchased your simple fishing book to try and hook the kids on fishing. 👍
Brilliant... and respect to the camera man cal , and some food friends you have keep them close ... loving the videos as usual an i follow ginger fisherman an snag bro too all enjoyable ..so glad you doing some together.. 💪🎣🎣
Zander is that like a walleye fit North American
A wonderful watch Carl. That's what fishing is all about 🎣💦👍🤟
This is the best fishing video I've seen so far, Not screaming for every catch But also entertaining as well.
We can catch in capital of Finland 32 different species at 24 hour.
Old vibes from back in the day trying to get all the badges from improve your course fishing magazine. Honestly think this is the best angling video I have seen on YouTube. Roger would be proud. Can't wait to see what's next.
London Kentucky loves ya
Rest in Peace Roger.
Where I live, you can catch a catfish first cast
Great video!
this was a movie! thank you so much
Im sorry for your loss of roger another great video. What do you use to edit your videos and could you check out my first video to see if you have any tips of improvment to make it better>😃
What a fabulous film!!! I've been fishing for 50 years now and I know that it's not just about the fish...... it's being there. Great video.
I love all of youre  Multi Species Challenge  videos  allrond angeling rocks
This was amazing. Loved the whole thing. So glad that you are so passionate about fishing. Thank you.
Im going to say the rainbow counts 100%. The small streams are equally as important to the environment as the big rivers
Brilliant video and great achievement 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I find this very exhilarating. Very big thank you to Mr Carl.
Incredible video yet again you’ve reignited my passion with fishing after such challenging few years recently got myself to get out fishing and after getting soaked and freezing caught my pb pike at 21lb 6oz the bite came in the last five minutes before I packed up too 😂
These videos always bring me so much joy mate. Really appreciate it and keep on rocking! 😄💪
Fabulous as always Carl thanks for all the videos thoughts on the loss of a dear friend
What a watch and a very touching end,tight lines.
Sorry but steroids and fishing don't mix 😂😂😂😂😂😂🎣
It's illegal to return Zander once you've caught them.
this is sooo amazing, wow great camerawork. Great commentary, absolutely sublime. 1000th reaction btw, send me some stuff! hehe
being from the US it's very interesting seeing how yall do it over there and your level of excitement
Is your sea trout an ocean run brown trout, or something seperate?
Amazing video guys! The afford that’s in this video! Immense! Lovely 💪
Brilliant, best 51 minutes I’ve had in a long time well done Carl
In Brazil u can do that in only 1 day
Brilliant watch. Well done Carl & co :)
Dang, absolutely phenomenal video. I love your content because as a man of the U.S, it's so cool to see the species you all have in the UK. And they're all so unique and different from what we have here, and yet you guys also have stuff we have, like perch, pike, and trout. Great stuff man, hopefully I'll be able to visit the UK and do some fishing someday!
ells. A bag of liver shredded liquid pop it right at the bank below your feet and a piece of liver with worm beside it. Put holes in bag the blood brings them in they come in lots and actually attack the bag. Big els 10ilb
I remember Matt Hayes and Mick Brown did the rod race challenge to catch all the species in the U.K. they even caught Artic Char. The Sewin made an appearance so we got to see him. Brilliant channel .
This was a great video...I'm stoked you managed to (nearly) complete the challenge, that was no mean feat you set yourself. I'm gutted that your friend didn't make it..... I guess he's kicking back by a lake somewhere with wet lines and screaming reels.
Very enjoyable video and awesome fishing. Huge respect for the multi-species fishing skills and tenacity.
I am sorry but what is the rod that you were fishing with at the start of the video?
R.I.P Rodger, taught you both well 👏 cracking video well done lads 👍
So many of us were inspired to fish by an older anglers  Mine was my grandad, would fish with him every weekend from the age of 3 float fishing for perch and rudd  When he passed I didn't fish for about 5 or 6 years till I started watching your videos by absolute chance on YouTube and decided to get back on the bank ❤
You sound so similar to Jeremy wade
in poland
You can catch eels with your hands by the way
Another cracking video , you are the only fishing person i currently subscribe to on youtube for the simple reason that it genuine and honest. You have the highs and the lows of each trip and the edits are bang on. Great job guys
Hi Carl love the video! Think you should do a video with Chris ( the ginger fisherman) in the future I would definitely watch. ❤
I m italian and the present in your country aren't very popular in my country
It's a dream for me
This guy is playing pokemon fish world irl
Wow. What an emotional journey that was! Truly Incredible to watch from start to finish. Take care
Great video lads 👍
Rest in peace Roger, your legacy continues through Carl
Please tell me that first cast with the worm and two shot was featured in a matt Hayes, total fishing episode? 🤔
I'm named Xander 😆
Great tribute to roger and good to see a little collab with the Ginger Fisherman! Keep it up
Krafish pov:give me that met
Just lovely 😁👍💫
Also, caught an eel on a maggot feeder on a canal once. Thought it was snagged for the longest time (must have been swimming backwards against me).
Perch is the first fish a lot of people catch, how fitting that it's the first one you catch here!
Did this in florida in 6 hours
We are you from?? England???
Rest In Peace Roger hopefully catching fish in the heavens.great job Carl and cal
If for any reason you ever target eels again. Using lugworm on freshwater has caught me eels from places they weren’t even supposed to be in. They love them more than any other bait
Can honestly say, for me it's even most enjoyable catching micro and small fish as it is enjoyable catching large fish.
Just found your channel, and already loving the content a ton.
The gudgeon shouldn't have been a bonus fish. It should've been standard... Moreso than the sea trout. We all loved a gudgeon.
Hello! You’ve got a cracking pond man looking for a bit advice I’ve only ever done fishing but I’ve never kept koi July this year I built a 500 gallon pond where now in winter my pond is heated to 16 degree Celsius ph is at 6.8 what’s the best ph range for koi I’ve heard from other hobbyists to use bicarbonate soda how fast or slow should I bring the ph up I don’t want to put them into shock do I add it everyday or every few days advice would be greatly appreciated dazza.
Are you able to let me know where the spot for salmon was in Newcastle, as I live hear and salmon is one of the fish I’ve never caught or targeted before
Requesting a personal video thats more on the short you posted with your lady, if you are willing to share.  Fishing is so more fun and rewarding with family and friends.
saw your short with your lady.  Came over to the channel and subscribed. I like the idea of 22 species in a week.  I am going to do something similar, living just outside of Washington DC and learned to fish in South Florida and Southern California. I just got some size 20 hooks  . . . and at the other end of the spectrum, I have some size 16/0 forged marlin hooks with a 7 cm bight.
nice, say hello to the Ginger fishman, nice u know him he is really cool
Thanks for taking the time to make these truly amazing videos for us to watch Carl.  How about next time you compete against 1 or 2 of your viewers, just a thought?
Amazing Trip!
really an awesome video. nice trip nice fish and great attitude..well done
Damn epic stuff.
I hope to do this with my son 1 day ,great video
These guys give off the vibe of River Monsters
Do you sell that species tick list on your site? Great video as always. Tight lines 👍🏻
i got 31 species in 24h
RIP Roger . Great video Carl and Cal
Hi Carl, do you know when you are able to send delivery to the Netherlands? I would like to have that guidebook😄
Amazing content - watched all with no skip - every bit was great!
I live in the USA, how would I purchase you simple fishing guide book,  Thanks. love you videos!
An absolutely brilliant video! This is what fishing is all about!
They netted the fish at Bude due to oxygen deprevation. They also dregged the silt out. Its normally a lovely spot, very strange freshwater fishing hearing the waves behind you...
Robson Green would be proud...
King
Rest in peace Roger.
Great video!  Was that dace a dace?  Haha
I remember the first time I caught an eel. Completely by accident, didn't know what it was, dad had to take it off because I was not touching it.
What rods and reels you use in minute 7:42?
Great video and adventure! Hello from Los Angeles, CA.
that video was great!! dont feel bad about the sea-trout i seen people go seasons and not get 1
That gudgeon was massive 😮
Fishings bent
Absolutely love crays, I've the biggest blue I have ever seen, not even local fish stores have seen them as big as her. So much character, amazing lil personality and incredibly intelligent.  On the other hand, if I pulled one out of a lake I'd want to run the signs over on the way out lmao  Edit: they have cats too? Miss my air breather, he was brill. Maybe I'd accept the crays at that point lol  Sorry about your pal Roger, seems that he was a good mentor and that he had a big part to play in this channel without realizing.
looks at land? " theres a boat over there"
WOW! Amazing job with the video and also with the angling! Love the video and I would probably look the same with an eel in my hands hahaha 😆
Such a great video in tribute to Roger. Rest in peace.
Great video
Rest in peace Roger! 🙏❤ The excitement when you caught that Barbel and Salmon is what truely fishing is all about! Awesome video! 🎣👏
"A fish so fierce not even Jeremy Wade will touch one, a bream." Carl, August 2022 😁
Dear Carl, you are an huge inspiration for so much fishermen. I am thankful for everyone of your videos. Greetings from Germany ❤
What a awesome video guys. Got so much inspiration from you through the years, thanks.  Tight lines🎣❤ Best regards from Denmark
Reminds me of a bit from DFW's short story collection 'The Girl With Curious Hair', wherein a particular women is described as being like one of those modern rifles where 'the technology behind aiming and target acquisition far outweigh the technology behind throwing the bullet'.  I mean, I've sadly invested in some ridiculous fishing equipment, but don't you just need patience, a comfortable seat, and some stuff to look at?  Maybe a cooler with some beer?
Great video Carl and a fitting tribute to Roger, he would have been proud I’m sure 😊
Great video again Carl love your videos mate please never stop making them
Zander, the fish of 1000 casts. I did 10 today, as we had the first snow.
some of the best film making and producing i have ever seen. you need to get on with whitehouse and mortimer going fishing.   great job Carl and cal keep up the goood work
in 46.10 what is the location name?
I think what makes your videos so inspiring is your tenacity. You don't give up, you just change up the tactics. You always give it your all, that's something you don't see a lot of nowadays. Plus, you treat the fish with respect and dignity. It is of utmost importance to respect the animals that we are fishing and hunting, especially catch and release.
May Roger go to fishing heaven
Could we get an update on the names of the new fish and how their doing in the new environment I think quite a few people are curious about them aswell
Great video. Too cold for fishing on Bassenthwaite today so we are catching up on this. Quality stuff.  Eel used to be annoying. Sadly I never see them now?
You are the person I look up to fish carp and Mt pb is 22lb and j am 12
I love these multi-species videos, they always make my day. Great job carl!
Fabulous video. However it's ileagal to return non native fish i.e. zander into the canal system.
i really enjoyed this carl. thanks
Rip roger
Odd corner of YouTube I've reached, not my area of interest, although I think it has to do with SerpaDesign. However, you make great videos even for someone not in the know on this subject
where did you catch that zander? im from around the area you where in west mids but couldnt pin point it
Carl, I live in West Sussex, any chance you could start tagging the locations? :(
Well done unlucky but you did amazing 🎉
Mrbeast of fishing  videos 🎣 👌
fiar play to you mate love watching your videos just wish i had the time to go fishing really miss it 😪😪🤙🤙🤙
Awesome video lads! Keep up the good work! Great to see a UK channel doing so well.
Stunning bit of film making. RIP Roger.
Chubs in Oregon have a bounty (northern pike minnow)
This is an interesting documenting of UK fish that my west coast Oregon state fisherman self would have never have known about.  I've traced my Chase lineage to 1304  UK and honestly I think I want to come try this.
Great video brother
Y'all have some weird ass fish across the pond.
Wow, what a great video. RIP Roger, his character lives on through you!
may Rodger be in the heaven of sea trouts!!! you were inspiring... you could be easily tasked to film these challenges in any country and be a tv series!
Well done Chris for helping out he's a great fisherman himself I watch daily
You were having problems with catching zander because they're mostly nocturnal. The best times for zander are very early morning (4-7o'clock) or even better late at night (21:00- 03:00)
Ffs Carl !!! You were in my hometown of Winchester!..... down next to the skateboard park !....some 2 lb roach exactly where you caught that Pike! .... honestly there's some beautiful red-fins up to the bridge! ....gutted I could've come say hi!
what canal did he catch the zander?
Great video mate loved watching
You really are an inspiration and brilliant angler Carl . Your tutorials and videos are 1st class .Cal is a brilliant cameraman and colleague. Always enjoy and learn a lot from your videos.. all the best 👍🏻
I want to see a youtube species challlenge, you v snaggerbro v gingerfisherman etc
Hey Carl just asking on that last pond where you and cal had the cat and the three kois j was just wondering where that was because it looks quite nice and I could maybe have a do one day. Thanks mate
R.I.P ROGER.  How did you logistically manage so many different day tickets? Had you planned out the trip long ahead?
Yet another awesome video carl please keep up the great work also I have to say RiP to your friend Roger such a shame he couldn't join yourself or even see this great fishing trip you had but it has to be said I'm sure he is truly so proud of you and Alex an will definitely be looking down on the pair of you wishing you all the success in your lives.
Great video 👍👍🤠
Great video 👍👍🤠
Another excellent video and just got my lad the book too.
Absolutely outstanding video🎣 such a great inspiration to all anglers🎣
are you the river monsters voice over ?
This is a grate video would love to see some more content like this keep up the grate work Carl 💪
Great video Carl! Loving these kinds of videos. They remind me of watching River monsters when I was younger
A ginger fisherman cameo, perfect!!
Great video
Get well soon Roger
Love the video Carl👍🏾,Could you do more videos on new species love the tips and stuff but I can’t really use the rigs yall use in the UK here in the U.S keep up the great work love from Pennsylvania 🦌
do you guys do lure fishing in England
Liked the video unlucky lads
Where can I buy your book dude ?
Brilliant, simply brilliant! 👌
so sorry to hear about your friend Carl, awesome video as always, good to see Ginger Chris another of my fav channels...
Bro went from cornwall to tenby for a couple of fish, purely incredible!
Great video and epic adventure. Sorry to hear of your friends passing and you have done him proud. Just think of all the people you have inspired.
Oh man you caught the gracious , magnificent otherworldly...cosmic archetype of fishes titled ..the epic nemesis... of Jeremy Wade.....the mighty Bream!....Barbless hooks for eels.....!! Nice Amazon delivery driver man...so Zander are taking over the UK...I've never caught one!!!none around much far s I can see..those prickly things that adhered to ypu called burs .. absolutely hate em?...myself!.. salmon in half hour...well that's salmon fishing...the river looked real good in that given moment! Keep up with that inspiring!...
Carl I am really sorry for your lose. This maybe the best video that you have put together.
Hey Carl , i was curious what rod and reen do you use for carp and feeder fishing . Or what do you recommend, i am looking to get into it, it would help a lot . Thanks .
So sorry about your friend roger
Another great video Carl! Keep it up man
Quit worrying about what it’s going to be and reel the damn fish in dingus. Sorry hookset plus just staring at it equals no fish for you.
editing looks even better this time
Love the video as allway, Carl, your very inspirational Bro and I have a few locations in Hamshire where you would love to fish A steach on The River Wey! Free Fishing with some amazin Perch and massive Pike! The stretch is about 2 miles long and branches of to a tributary to the Wey! And an old abandoned pond That used to be a match lake- hidden away in the forest! You would love it and it makes for some really good filming! If you ever fancy giving it a go one day hit me up bro and ill get you on it 100%
What cane pole was he using at the beginning? I'd love to have one that short for quick trips.
My condolences on the loss of your friend. And I love watching your videos been watching them for 3 years or so now. Keep up the great work. Claude  Ontario Canada
I've been subscribed for years, but just unsubscribed after Cal called cricket "the world's most boring sport"!😠
Amazing  video  keep it up sucks to lose a drone
Absolutely brilliant your videos bring smiles and joy. You and your brother are the reason i got back into fishing.. i now carp and match fish and hopefully in the summer get on the rivers 👌👌 keep up the good work. One of bedt fisherman ive watched. So passionate in what you do and have achieved a lot. Well done🤌👍
Brilliant Thank you.
Jumping for the Barbel and Chris straight in there with you 🤣 brilliant upload fantastic again, a great upload and tribute to your friend  👍🏻
Great cider choice at the end 😉 Great video mate, I hope you’re all doing great 🎣
What a fantastic video, Carl! I love the schoolkid enthusiasm the both of you felt after yet another special catch. What a wonderful, truly  fitting  and moving end to  the story. Most of us have a person that guided us into the magical world that's called fishing!
That was a lovely viewing experience, thank you. I’ll order the book to help inspire others and hopefully introduce a new generation of fishers. Extremely poignant and I hope one day, like you I will be someone’s Roger.
That was inspiring 👏 awesome watch again mate 👍
thankyou
simply incredible, absolutely loved this mate, keep up the good work! <3
wow, what a video i want to be like you guys one day
Caught 4 salmon fishing everyday in the river Faughan in Northern Ireland this season which lasts April to October 20th and you caught one in half an hour lol jealous lol
Gòd
5:00 It's funny you mention Jeremy Wade because the two of you have the same voice lol
Fantastic video Carl. For me it was my Grandad who took me to a local canal when I was 5. We had got a small tin of maggots from a local farmer who always hung a dead sheep up in his barn and allowed children to come and take the maggots for free !  We sat on the canal and the first time I saw my quill go under and the feeling of hooking in to a small roach was indescribable, as I sat there I asked my |Grandad if there was any pike in the canal. He said if I put my hand in the canal andd lost a finger there was aone, 2 fingers there was two etc. I sat there dunking my hand in the water and pulling it out telling my grandad there was no pike in the canal !!!!!!!!!!

Hi Carl! I found your channel just in that moment when Alex decided to go his own YouTube way. I'm a mostly predator angler & fishing guide in southern Sweden, with roots in Poland. I planned to comment many of your film productions before, but my english dictionary is not so good to describe all my feelings. You're doing the massive job, your movies are so perfect made then every detail counts! It's much better an any tv nature movie production and most important - this is the really truth! Fishes, nature, trips and the way you're mixing this together is just brilliant! Like I said - I'm mostly the predator guy, but with big pleasure I'm backing time on your Youtube channel and discover this movies one after another. Wish you all the best in future! Ps. Merry Xmas & Happy New year🤗/Pexfish
When I was a young teen, back in late the 80s me and my brother went boat fishing with my dad and his friend, off the coast of Anglesey, in an 8hr sesh we managed to land 18 different species, this challenge brought back great memories 👍
I love your video mate!!!! can I have some information about your tackle box organizing? The box and the zip pouch look really well organize!!
Sir Izaak Walton on the float, "Beautiful in its appearance, more beautiful in its disappearance".  Love float fishing.
A brilliant tribute to your friend Roger, and he would be very proud of how your inspiring the next generation of younger anglers. Keep up the brilliant work
Roger!!! He used to do the junior matches at Crowborough angling!? I hope he is well!! Was that First location was pennybridge? I used to fish the junior matches there and the other Great Lakes on the association a LONG TIME AGO, I take my daughter there now! 😅❤ love the vids Carl and would love it even more if we could go fishing one day! Tight lines!
Honestly mate out done your self on this one. What a wicked watch. Been watching since the start and honestly been such a pleasure pal such a top lad working hard to achieve his dreams, yet still so humble and takes so much time out to help young anglers class all round 👏🏻👏🏻 RIP to your buddy Roger very sad news 💙
Fish=bait (if its not ur fav fish)
Take your fish for bait
Great video man love how good you are at fishing
Hi carl good video thanks 👍👍👍👍
Great video ! 😁 greetnigs from Poland 👋
loved it
20:10 the Wels catfish isn’t shown when you show all the fish you’ve caught
Great video Guys, thoroughly enjoyed that
Don’t look at me like that 😂
Great video. Really inspiring.
RIP Rodger and a work of art as always Carl and Cal. Well done to you both!
Thank you Roger
Amazing video
Absolute Great Rod Race vibes. Unreal content.
If you want eels, come to Stourport and fish the canal. Thousands of them. Great video 🔥🔥🔥
Fantastic video I truly enjoyed this one and well done Callum on your first Zander a species I'm yet to catch and 1st cast is a brilliant story to tell 👍👍
This took me back, it's been a while since I have been to some of these lakes.  I still remember fishing with you and Alex at the lake in Hartfield, must have been 15 years ago when we were all young!  Keep up the great work with these videos, they're brilliant!
Lost my love for fishing but this has re-sparked a fire to get out on the bank
Third time watching this getting my self motivated for a cold fishing day in a few days
Awesome Carl! 👏
what bait did you use to catch your first fish
I would love to see you fish with pigpatroltv from Nebraska, lol he catches a lot of carp here in America.
Well done lads some nice catches there just ordered one of your books hope to get to read it soon thanks for another cracking video boys😊
Don’t think u have ever made a bad video imo .well done boys top angling
I remember James winning the big fish on bbc with matt hayes judging! And obviously the great rod races from years ago... and this is such a quality video Carl, can't beat a species challenge! :)
Wicked 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
Thoroughly enjoyed that Carl.  So sorry to hear the loss of your old friend Roger. I had a similar old boy who inspired me when I was a kid and this year, I finally tracked down his son, my old friend and neighbour, Kes Gray the children's author. We met up for a drink and went fishing again and it turns out his son is Cypography's Elliot Gray.
Brilliant film from start to finish
Your videos have been great for passing on your knowledge of fishing and as of now been fishing for a year and caught 5 species will try for more species next year.  Your nv200 must have moon mileage on it now it’s part of your set up now
Another great video again well done. I moved from Henfield to live on the canals and I believe they are trying to eliminate the Zander, electro fishing has been done to remove as many as possible due to the impact they are having on our native species.
Great film mate you smashed it. Roger would be proud of what you have achieved for the sport 👍
u make the best fishing videos ever guys!
Great video, really enjoyed it. Thank you 😊
Brilliant watch
great vid Carl as always , i thought that was TGF,s river , now we know his name lol , would love to fish that river..
Epic challenge guys and an awesomely entertaining video. You guys did great, shame about the sea trout. Look forward to seeing you next video.  Sorry to see about Roger. 😔
well worth the wait for this, sorry for the loss of your friend
only just had chance to sit down and watch this and I must say what a great bit of content Carl.  I am sure Roger is smiling down at what you have achieved . keep the videos coming .
absolutely one of the finest fishing shows ive ever seen, really, really enjoyable. i live abroad at the minute and am missing getting the rods out with my mates, this took me back to it. well in boys
It’s a massive loss I still remember my junior matches with Rodger at pennybridge rip Rodger Funnel 😢😔
Rest easy Roger ❤. Thank you as always Carl, for a wonderfully brilliant film. x
Another awesome video as always and such a lovely tribute to a lost friend. As others have said, brought back memories of watching The Great Rod Race when I was a kid! Are those black baseball caps going to be available in your store soon?
So is a zander like our Walleye over here in the US.?
Love the video ❤ sorry to hear about your friend!
You've got to watch those bream  they can be savage and many anglers hqve broken rods and bent hooks on them. Btw great video
just ordered 2 of your books for my son and nephew, your video has inspired us to do our little advantage next year to see if we can tick all the fish off the list and hopefully take us to new place and even catch new Species of fish.
Gratulacje! Super film!
Nice one Carl awesome as always bud 👊
Amazing content mate can't imagine how much time that must of taken to put together, soft touch on the last few seconds too Love it now onto the pike videos big respect bro  tight lines   @thepikewhisperer420
R.I.P. Roger
Reminds me of Matt Hayes and Mick Brown well done lads 👍👍👍👍
Sorry to here about Roger. I'm sure he would have proud of your effort. That was worthy of Matt Hayes and Mick Brown.
1 of your most enjoyable videos yet, a legend in the making 🔥🎣
I only started fishing this summer with my little lad, your videos are an inspiration, i must have watched your tutorials at least a dozen times each and owe most of my fishing knowledge to your videos, this video was a fantastic watch, I thoutoughly enjoy all the content you put out, thank you for the time you take not only for entertainment but also the knowledge you impart to others. My sincerest condolences on the loss of your Mentor and Friend Roger ❤
That was a skimmer blicca bjoerkna  not a bream  abramis Brama
"C" also stands for Carl 😂
You know what I like about you and your bro the most, Its not that you both make awesome videos and shit like that, it's that you both actually take the time to reply to comments, I've had conversations with you in last and many with Alex on Instagram, you're both awesome people, I dread the day you both call it a day, but for now I will enjoy what you both do, I'm sorry to hear for your loss :(
hold the eel on its back and its calm!!!!
I thought that chub and barbel river was the Ginger Fisherman's manor! Sorry to hear about your friend, but doing what you do is in itself an excellent tribute, and that there were multiple examples in this film alone of how you have inspired and helped other anglers (young and in many cases not so young alike) only reinforces that.
magic programme carl!! dyin for the fishing to start again its baltic and the lakes are flooded!!! alan in dublin!!!👊👊
Great video as ever 👍 never stop doing what you love mate all the best
I am so fucking hyped for this video
thanks, so wholesome!
Your presentation (driving) of soft plastic lure is too aggressive for zander.  Of course, it can vary from case to case, but... I will put it simple: Cast, wait for contact with bottom, jump, pause, jump, pause, jump- jump, pause. You must "read" the bottom with lure. When the lure jump, 2- 3 seconds until it touch the bottom and you must keep the tension on the line.
I’m happy to see a good teammate with good chemistry going on. Still don’t know his name, but he’s well in. Good effort, lads!
A brilliant film. RIP Roger.
Great video, Roger would've been so proud and honoured
that was one insane challenge. you guys must have been so exhausted after finishing the challenge. i was hoping for your friend's health to be better throughout the video. I am sorry for your loss.
First time I've seen some one be happy with a bream..
Some amazing fun and fishing but so sad your mentor Roger didn't get to see it as you say.  A few years back I took a young teenager Kal fishing doing a similar thing but over a much longer time. What a revelation that was, more enjoyable than years of specimen hunting.  Unfortunately Kal passed away not even into his 20s after a tragic accident but I take comfort in knowing that we shared such fun times over his relatively short life.  Such a natural angler, not many have caught a 30lb plus canal carp for instance.   The renewed fun of fishing for species variety will stay with me always.  Loved the video, even the eels.  After many years wearing eel bracelets I now handle them with ease. Just cut a shallow V trench in the earth, slide your eel into it upside down then run a finger along its belly slowly  nose to tail. Somehow it sends them into a trance like state and easy to handle!
Great watch well done 👍🎣🌟
You won't remember me but the junior comps I used to compete in against you! Junior matches at pennybridge and various other waters with Roger leading the line in promoting fishing with the youth around town is something to remember. I'm still local and still a member at this club to this day. Can't beat your younger years learning on these lakes. Various people including Roger taught me alot growing up, right till now setting up my own fishing business for beginners and novices to encourage people to get out fishing and achieve their goals. A true gent and it's nice to see how many people he helped! Great video again Carl 🎣
U should do a multi species challenge in america and canada like your muskie video. Luv the vid btw
Amazing video Carl and perfect tribute to Roger - proper gut punch ending ☹
Such a fitting end to have 1 piece of the puzzle missing...  R.I.P. Roger
Great videos I enjoy watching them ... have you ever fished for barbel and chubb in Cardiff ?
I love your videos mate pls never stop, and your 41 on trending 👏 let’s goooo ❤️
I'm so glad you guys visited my local (and my favourite) river for Chub and Barbel. I fish that stretch a few times a month and it never ceases to amaze me the stamp of fish that little river so regularly presents. Chris is a legend around here too.
Love these challenges mate. Keep up the good work. 🎉
RIP roger he passed some great skills on to you and alex🙏
Amazing Karl. Well done 👏
Mate this is a banger what an awesome video ive always loved your vids and this is a banger keep them coming
“Don’t look at me like that 🤨” 🤣🤣
Finally the old eel.  Well done, had me cheering and getting all worked up. Merry Xmass to you and yours.
Nice of you dedicating it to where you started with help from Roger R.I.P
love the vid mate keep it up
"raging eel fishing lunatic" is a t shirt you need to make!
BRILLIANT Carl.     What a great blog and nice to see a longer Vlog.     Keep up the good work    .   Need to get myself a book .   Keep ya eyes open for my order  lol
Well what a video unreal love every min of it.
My fishing mentor was called Roger changed my life..
Getting a decent bream as a proper treat for me, don’t know why people don’t like them so much
I guess we are spoiled. We can catch 22 species in one day on the same 100 meter stretch of the river. And travel 10 miles and catch another 10 species in the same day in salt water.
Great content again as always, should do what Matt and Mick brown did for every pound of fish you travel a mile 😉
Where did they get the book from and what’s it called
Great video Carl, you guys gotta make another trip back to BC for some more salmon fishing!
HELLO!Do you know whats the name of some little fishing rods that you throw and they are going far with one hand?You used one too in the video and they are thin you used it when you went to the bridge
Carl quick question I'm just curious. I've been rewatching your older videos and I've rewatched your america journey, seeing as the pack bait method works so well over there for mid 20s and up, why don't you ever use it in the UK. I know it's not how we do it but I could be just as successful. Right?
I loved watching this video! What a great quality of video is this!!!😍😍😍😍🥰🤩🤩🤩
I would say that was a win carl a sea trout was caught in company, you personally didn't catch the zander but you counted it, I would count that sea trout it was caught in company you definitely completed that challenge
Brilliant video sad to hear Roger didn't make it I started watching your videos when I was 23 when I bought a cheap float rod im now 25 and own 7 rods for all different types of fishing and thats all because of you and Alex,  the ginger fisherman Chris and snagged bro Tom and Sean
Roll on summer :( Amazing vid as usual Carl
Fantastic fish for the week. Well done. Sorry you lost your friend of many years I’m sure he will be looking down on your journey.
how are you not on tele i will never know, am 52 and its so nice to see young people doing so well for our sport, ive  followed from nearly day one years ago and you and your brother do such a amazing job. thanks 4 posting guys.
Watched some Saturday morning went out fishing got back and watched the rest unlucky not to complete the challenge but what a  session totally enjoyed that both 🎣👊
Epic mini film, Carl!!  Thanks for pumping out the content.  Watching your videos over the weekend is one of my favorite things to do!  Cheers, mate!
😂
Fish on fish on fish on fish on
awesome video
Awesome video guys! Me and my son are hoping to head over to the UK next year. I want to see you guys eventually make a trip to Norway for those giant cod!
cool bass never seen one like that and it was in salt
Amazing video Carl, very similar to the great rod race but filmed at a nice fast YouTube pace. Keep the content coming!
GREAT video guys Jacob loved the cray fish at the start 😆
make a video how to catch zander with dead bait and with spining
Yet another quality production, great job and well put together, thoroughly enjoyed.
Beautiful video as always lads 👍
i dont think ever heard someone beg to get a bream
Is the old estate lake a public or private lake And if it is a public could you tell me what it's name?
Thanks to roger too god bless him
Great watch maté really enjoyed that and iv had the book along time now and being a carp angler I’d never fished for anything else so wen I decided to target all fish this book has helped no end so well done on that book well worth having 👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Brilliant fishing video one of the best I’ve seen on YouTube technically you’ve done it really it was just a friend that caught the sea trout instead this video had all very well done
Bravo
Great video, and cool concept! ✌🏻 If you ever want to join us in Denmark for some coastal sea trout fishing, please let us know. Could be a blast! 😎
Would really like to buy the book but you don’t ship to the Netherlands, is there anything I could do to buy it?
Why doesn’t the rainbow count?
One of the best videos ever on the channel imo, really enjoyed it keep up the great work.
Could you try a multi species sea fishing challenge so its the same layout as this video but all sea species. Great video really enjoyed watching it 🎣💪
crazy
What reel is that
51:27 that gave me goosebumbs............. RIP Roger Funnell❤
A fitting tribute. Great angling guys
Great video as always And Great challenge . As iv never fished rivers or canals and always wanted to Do you need permits or permission to fish them or did you just turn up and fish . Thanks Keep your video's coming always entertaining and educational 👍
Amazing to watch what a barbel that was also a big thanks for all the fishing tips iv picked up from both your channels ❤️💪🏻🎣
This is so good video Carl. You inspire me to do this challenge too
Ginger fishermen , absolute legend . Well done for getting all these little cameos in your video . Loving the colabs
Great entertainment. Not that it helps but I’ve never caught a sea trout either..😂
Does anyone recall him catching a dace? Saw it ticked and dunno if I just missed it but don’t recall a Dace 🤷🏻‍♂️ Top quality video 👌🏻
Carl this is just mind boggling to watch how much you have grown and how you can do this now that you have built a community I started fishing nearly 11 years ago I’m now 15 and I wanted to stop fishing after a Tim got bored as I just wasn’t catching then I started watching your and Alex’s videos a couple years ago and now I’m booked on to fish road lake in gigantica but thank you for everything and we can all tell you truly try your hardest these vids
Rip roger :(
Any other video that starts with “one van two guys “ im straight off, but bro you have an exception , sick vid 👊🏼🎣
Probably one of your best videos to date congratulations
Genuinely the best content on YouTube, If I hadn’t watched every single video 3 times id spend every spare second binge watching this channel.
That pike was awesome
Well Done Carl
You should make a tutorial on eel rigs I would love to catch them more often ☺ I normal just catch them on the canal while float fishing
Thanks so much for sharing mate, I really enjoyed watching from overseas with a cold beer on a Sunday afternoon :) I have your book which you had kindly posted to me, its a great read :) Thanks again mate , Rodger is smiling :) Cheers Rob.
Blinking sea trout! Good effort though!
Carl not only are you a great angler , but your character and your heart make a positive difference, keep up the good work and encouraging those kids you meet along the way, top work 😎🎣❤️
you were soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo close😭😭😭😭😭😭
Great vid mate! Loved it!!😎🎣🤙
Hi Mate I’m no Bude expert but wasn’t that the river rather than the canal?  I’ve got Mullet ( ledgering chub style) and eels in the river - the canal is full of course fish
Watching Carl get mugged off by Bream Hahaha... But seriously awesome video guys .
this is like a modern version of the greater rod race
Amazing video 🙏🙏🙌🙌
Your ability to combine great fishing and fantastic videography with beautiful dialogue/storytelling never ceases to amaze me. Well done lads.  P.S: Sea Trout are basically just Sea-migrating Brown Trout so you shouldn’t be to hard on yourself seeing as you already had a Brown.
Brilliant video. Sorry for the loss of your friend.
hell yeah.. smoke em dude!! Some of the best footage anywhere as usual.. just awesome
My fisherman's heart was jumping throughout the whole video! Love it
Rod race? Nah Carl's a god race.
Gudgeon society!!!!
Never expected to see Chris aka ginger fisherman on here. Especially, after just watching him. Another great video. Thank you, guys.
I don’t know weather I fully believe about the zander myself
Rest in peace, Roger. Thanks  roger, we have one of the best fishing youtuber of all time
nobody EVER has celbrated catching an eel. it is THE WORST!
hey carl  I just love this video thanks for the effort 😁
Well done on almost completing your challenge. Also may Roger Rest in Peace.
Absolutely fantastic watch! 😎 Sorry to hear about the loss of your friend and mentor 🙏🏼  Tight lines bud! 🎣
Love this video keep it up. rip Roger
Well done guys
Rip Roger ♥️
Mint to see you back up North again mate especially in my neck of the woods should join me for a carp session sometime
Truly awesome video as always! They are always a joy to watch. So sorry to hear of the loss of your friend. Keep passing on what you learned from Roger and keep his spirit alive!
Such an incredible video, and a beautiful tribute.
You guys do some seriously amazing cinematography, you need to update to 4K next ❤️❤️
Once again Carl , an amazing video , the way you can portray a story and an adventure in a video with the camera shots and dialogue in such a way is astounding. Always waiting for the next upload from you and your brother. Much love from Ireland , you should definitely visit for the fishing here , just a stones throw away for a nice fishing holiday/video. Also sorry for your loss.
good vid girls
Loved the video, great to see Chris acting as a ghillie for you. Local knowledge is always great to have.
The situation with the zander is really something, think we all have been there. Fishing for hours without a bite, than the friend try it once or twice, fish on 😂 great moments
What a wonderful and fitting video to your mentor Roger sorry for the loss of your friend.
Brilliant Chaps!  Toodles…
Epic few days!
That was an amazingly difficult challenge to set yourself, and though it might have been your guide that got the sea trout, we saw all the species brought to bank. I'm sure Roger would have been very proud, and this video is a very fitting tribute to him. I lost my dad earlier this year, and although we rarely fished together he was my inspiration. We never got our last trip together, he got a carp pole set up and I was going to take him out and try to catch his first pole carp (he was a sea angler, and rarely course fished), but we never got to do it. First Lock down, then leukemia before finally Covid got him. I took his caravan and just his tackle to a campsite with a lake, where I had the most emotional days fishing, and one of my best ever total catch weights of pole caught carp.
Nice vid mate, loved this, keep the great videos coming!
Hey there! I want to buy the book but your Homepage doesn‘t give the option to choose Austria 🤔. Any Suggestion?
Loved seeing you in my home town for my favourite fish chub and barbell
Well done Carl & everyone involved , enjoyed watching this one ! 🙂
Get well soon Roger! This is the content I live for and  the fishing I dream of doing myself!
NICE!
Can always count on the ginger fisherman, what a guy. What a video. Lucky guy, one day i hope to do the same..
Amazing videos as always
Also love the vids
Where did u catch the barble and chub
Need another vid at tanyard 😢
the best zander bait is dead gudgeon
What a video! My favourite by far 😊
Ahh dude, that was epic but that mirror carp was a cop out 🤣
Awesome vid as usual 👏
I thought I recognised the spots for barbel and chub and then the ginger fisherman arrives 👍
Well done buddie always look forward to your visit been watching for years now .love aswell how all you main big youtubers know each other Chris snagged bro etc
What an impressive film! Can't believe you almost made it. How did you decide which saltwater fish to include in the list? Aren't there actually, for example, mackerel or garfish? Also great that you thought of your first fishing instructor. He must have been a special person. RIP
Cracking vid Carl, fair to say you’ve done roger proud there. RIP
Epic 🎉🎉
I like that you said "my friend Cal , and not the  cameraman "  After i bet an insecure  time , it is  great to see it is working out.  For both you and your brother.
Also you should do more collabs with ginger fisherman
I've followed you about 4 years and I think this is the best video you"ve ever made.  Keep on going! Greetings from Hungary!
So sad to hear about Roger - but just look at his legacy - and you're paying it forward as his memory lives on. And a marvellous adventure video too - go get some sea trout!
Awesome as always carl. Thank you
This video felt like the old carl and alex videos good job 👍
Probably my favourite video you have made. Well done!
Brilliant, loved every minute. Sorry for the loss of your friend.
. Catching a specimen of each fish would be hard
Good effort Carl 👍 great video. So sorry about roger R.I.P
Absolutely brilliant video Carl. All great fun and hard luck with the Sea Trout...but if you don't succeed as a Sea Trout angler you can always get a job as a late night saucepan delivery driver.😆
where is this place in day six ? the fish are absolutely beautiful!!! good angling
Mega video Carl I am sure your friend Roger will be very proud of you and how you help so many people including the younger generation, keep doing what you do buddy it’s truly great 👍
Reall nice bud as usual
Cracking video and entertaining watch and to only miss out by one fish is not bad going Matt Hayes and mick brown would salute you Carl. My condolences on the loss of such a good friend, mentor and by the sound of great bloke all round I don't mind admitting when his name popped up at the end with the years of his life I got a little teary may he rest in peace.
A great challenge and beautiful message ❤🙏👍
good to see Chris (aka The Ginger Fisherman) helping you out
Brilliant video. Really well put together. The tension was palpable at times! That Barbel was the highlight
Brilliant video! keep up the good work Carl. Tight lines🎣
Great video Just watched Chris,s latest video of catching big perch  You two should do a fishing video together be cool
Anyone know the song name that starts @3:47 ?
hi there carl love these video could you do more videos like this. and I buy one of your books too  lol keep up with the work.
Such a good fucking video. Smashed it. Well done, guys!
Carl, Newcastle is over a mil people city. Plenty of hotels and some nice little ones too. Try Gosforth next time for warm bed and nice breakfast. Geordies are good people :)
R.I.P Roger sorry to hear that someone u know has left the earth but God takes them for a reason but love u and ur Filmer Karl Iv been watching for a while and everyday I look for a new video thank god I came along ur videos.
Carl, I'm so sorry fo Roger. I'm sure he is gonna live in your heart. You need to continue straight and I wish you everything good. I'm sure he is watching.🙂🙂
This was a beautiful video!
Well done Carl so impressive in 7 days keep up the good work
If it wasn’t for Roger you wouldn’t be Fishing and without your channel I wouldn’t be Fishing so big thanks to Roger and Carl 🎣🐟
Why u guys afraid of using baitcasting reels
That was really really good dude watched it twice 👌
What a fantastic video Carl! And what a clever way to also promote the new guidebook! Well done!
Great challenge and truelly exceptional filmography and production.  RIP Rodger I'm sure he's proud of what you're achieving Carl 👌
I'm usually a river fisherman but I went sea fishing for the first time in my life with a couple of mates a few months ago targeting smooth hound's.....they both landed a couple each...... I managed to land a 49cm bass 😂
Always love your videos alway waiting for the next one to come out .keep up the great work
Well done mate! I think Roger would be proud. Keep up the good work:)
Cracking watch mate cheers
Hey Carl, are you going to the Essex carp show ?
Every part of this video was an absolute joy, Carl and a wonderful tribute to Roger. I think it's safe to say he was proud of the angler you are today.
A lovely film Carl and a nice nod to your inspiration.
Amazing film, roger would be proud. I will be purchasing your book within the new year to challenge myself to all these species, spice up my fishing adventure.
Amazing❤
Well done guys and a touching tribute to Rodger.   RIP Sir.
Also just brought your simple fishing guide book I think it’s class and will be a huge help for targeting fish species I’ve not gone for before 👍
Brilliant video, keep it up :)
I love this type of Video👌
best youtuber right here
Great video! Even though you didn't land the sea trout you still got one on camera! You're an inspiration mate..  Fish On!
Great video buddy.... I'm sure you have made Roger proud. Your videos are inspiring my two boys and helping them along. Keep up the great work.... Hopefully we will meet you on the Eden one day 😉
What is the lake called where u got that cat please carl
YES!
damm i love this video :D
Sensei Ginger saves the day!
This was a brilliant video. Thoroughly entertaining and informative.  So sorry about your mentor. RIP.
great video, as always...advice for zender, use small dead fish, like minow as bait, but not to small, maybe litlle roach is better. You can cut of the baits head also and set it on bigger hook, and also crank the bait a litlle up and down. Zender favorite spots are rocky shalows. Hope this helps in future zender fishing 😉
Thank you for the nice video sir.  My personal favourite: 20:05, what a beauty! And my second favourite: 33:44, what a stunning barbel!
i reember once i fiched the karasjokha river in northern norway and it was in the middle of the night i the summer and i caught about 12 graylings on the fly all over 2 pounds in about a couple of hours never had anything like that happen before or since that. it was crazy.    love the channel and these videos. cheers carl and keep up the good work!
Nice too see you out fishing Carl and a Great challenge too start it of with. Love it 👍
I spent SEVEN years fishing for salmon on the Tyne between Hexham and Prudhoe. Never had one. There's been some decent nets of dace and chub out the Tyne in the last few years though. Again, I haven't had many
Great video as always, ordered the book for my son so he can tick a few off this summer. Keep up the good work and inspiring others.
Where was the mirror?
I was the kid that came up to you on the beach, was great meeting you :)
Brill video
ty Carl for the vid great as always love the challenge vids :)
A lovely tribute for your friend 👍
Sorry for you loss Carl great video
What an awesome week! Brilliant video and a perfect tribute to your friend. The difference one person can make to our lives is incredible.
Your choices of words for narrating are quite pleasing in the ears and made me enjoy the video. Thank you and more power to you! ✨
pure class
Takes me back to the great rod race with Matt Hayes and sir mick Brown …   Solid video tho lads thoroughly enjoyed it 🎣
If I could turn back time, I would have loved this challenge, full watched to the very end, full respect to you guys, and a massive well done.
I love ur videos carl and Alex you have taught me so much
I tried this Michigan a few times, but there are like 50 species here. I always fail finding and catching a lake Sturgeon and a few fish that only get caught seasonally.
Beautiful video mate..i am following ginger fisherman aswell
I cannot believe how big that Grayling was
roger would be proud mate. great video
Great video and well done 👏🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
That’s actually quite impressive to catch that many different species in a week
you can catch eels using a method called clotting. a piece of rotting or pungent meat, with wool wrapped around it, as bait. the eels teeth get caught in the wool.
Next level mate…again! Thankyou
Hi guys fantasic video, and well done,  landing a skimmer, loved it, and you have put me back on the banks again, bad lads,  all the best, and tight lines.
you need to do some videos with the ginger fisherman ;-)
Wel done lads.
Great video and a beautiful tribute to Roger 👍👍
Working in a tackle shop this and the tutorials page are the only online advice I recommend to new anglers and it’s a blessing.
Why do you not do hoodies
Everyone needs a Roger in his life. Mine was called Gilbert. Still love that man, even if we grew apart.
Great video Carl! What a journey, you've done Roger proud mate 👏🏻
definitely worth my 51 mins :)
Love these multi species videos please keep posting these and keep up the good work huge fan 🎉🎉🎉👌👌👌👍👍👍👍
Just wondering when this was filmed?  Time of year I mean.  Great video thanks 👍
I enjoyed watching this video thanks 👍
The fact that this was filmed in august and its relesed now in november just shows how much time he spends on making the best videos for our amusement. Thank you for it.
Amazing Carl! Thank you that was great, laughed at the Zander 😅
Absolutely mint guys.
Loved every part of this video and felt like I was watching a movie at a cinema. Keep on going mate 🙌
Camera man has his nice watch on the wrong wrist lol
Fantastic video Carl, RIP Roger bless him.
Carl you will probably not see this but I have in fact spoken to Rodger before as he was part of my local club just a coincidence as I looked on the membership and saw his name on it
i bought you'r book and i live in denmark
we done you two very good, didn't Chris won't to be on film lol, Thank you
As an actual independent food seller that lives in the east midlands that comment hurt.
Fantastic, I love the multi species stuff and this one takes the cake!! ❤❤
Arrochar, head of Loch Long in Argyle. . Caught many a sea trout on small lures. If you're there in mid july using small lures, lf you don't catch a sea trout you will have a mackerel a cast. 👍
Amazing video and a great tribute to Roger. Bless his heart!
Brilliant watch carl. Zeds in the mids are hard atm, esp with all the zapping we have on midlands canals. Wish they would leave the canals alone imo its no good on the rest of the fish. But yeah im sure you inspire lots of young anglers to get out there. My two boys are now sitting and watching with me so your doing something right mate 👍👍👍
Had great fun at latchetts lakes a couple of months ago. the fish loved my offerings of Lidl's kabanossi cut into 15 mm lengths the packet lasted all day and I still had some left for me to eat.  Great video carl also a member of the club where you went first and took my grandson for his fist gay fishing there
Amazing video Carl, loved every minite of it👍👍
RIP roger ❤
Just ordered the book dude, great video again & now I have a great idea to do with my boys! Legend
That was the best behaved grayling I’ve ever seen. Often they’re impossible to hold for a photo. I’m also sorry to hear about your friend Carl
your a great person carl and a great angler too boot that was super enjoyable thanks so much for sharing your fishing life with us
Mate that barbel capture was hysterical 🤣 😂
Really enjoyed that Carl. Talking about Roger reminded me of a guy called Dave Pendleton who ran the Milton Keynes angling association junior section. These guys are unsung hereos.
In that shot at your local independent food retailer uh um,.... You really looked like your brother, be good to see you guys fishing again
Carl that was one of your best. Absolutely brilliant. The thanks you give Roger is amazing to see in today's world. 🙌 thanks for sharing your feelings for everyone to see. Keep up the amazing work you do. But mostly keep inspiring all to get out there and fish ..
eels have quite a cute face haha
Fantastic video Carl! So sorry to hear about your friend. Cheers
Ideally Carl what you wanna be doing for eels is using drop off indicators like you would for pike. Essentially scaled down pike fishing except the trebles etc. That would probably help with the dropped runs. You can also make rigs with a little bar on it. To avoid deep hooking them :)
Chris's video's are awesome his underwater footage is top notch
Awesome stuff Carl I find these days there’s many that only fish for carp. You ever thought of doing a free to fish series ? Think that would be cool for the younger generation. To show them that you can fish for free.  It was nice to see you call Cal your friend today. You maybe never noticed previously but you always called him your cameraman and even comment of you being his boss. Knowing with no malice etc intended it really is nice that you view him as a friend. Good work mate still looking forward to the American trip
🔥vid mate I love how long it is
i am sorry for the loss of your friend.  i think he will be proud of you for making these videos and inspiring others to go fishing. The video's was great. Makes me wanna do a multi species hunt here in Holland. Till the next video :D
Looking forward to this, reminds me of the great rod race by the legendary Matt Hayes back in the day.
Wow, that's a lot of fish for a week! Amazing, keep it up!
Fantastic Challenge Carl well done . Nice bit of Sea fishing at the end there which was Great. R.I.P Roger
new vid lets go
Congratulations, Carl, Epic video. You deserve more subs.
Another great video Carl!! Thanks for making my day again!!! Theo
awesome work as usual carl! and good to see the ginger fisherman make an appearance!
What another amazing video I see at fishing in some amazing spots keep up the great work 😃
Awesome Carl! 👍🏻
Beautiful shots again! Great challenge as well better then the previous one and really satisfying to watch especially as an allround fisher myself. I don't like watching long video's if the content is not amazing and this is just perfectly on point. Well done this episode gives me chicken skin on the feeling of how it would feel to be a full part on this journey! Edit: Just wow, this is the best fishing video I have ever seen ❤
Actually Brown trout and Sea trout are the same species, so technically you did catch them all. Great episode as always.
its so annoying that its cold   i barely go fishing now   [ ure my fav youtuber ]
Brilliant video Carl 👍🙂
Just purchased three of your fishing guides for me and 2 mates to do a 2023 full year fishing challenge to tick off every species. Not sure how it will go as I've tried to catch a barble for the last 3 years and failed.
Don’t look at me like that 😂
Another top video lads tòp viewing cheers
Seatrout are quite hard in the river during the day but not impossible, with upcoming tide and darkness is the best chance. Also not superhard on the coast as well, if you can find rocky shallow coast with seaweeds, you can catch them with spoons like in denmark.
Awesome watch and the eel cracked me up 🤣 well done not a easy challenge
great video mate!..😊😊
That's was a great watch takes me back to my young days that did class vid lads
Get Well Soon Roger.
Cracking video this!
Top video as always 👍🏻🍺⚽
As always cracking video mate!
Wow what a watch. Brilliant 50 mins of you tube. And it just about fishing. No rigs or brands. Outstanding  Gents
Hey carl you sent me a package and it still didnt arive
Awesome film. Well worth the wait for your videos when they are this good.
Such a nice episode. Really enjoyed watching it.
Interesting and entertaining video.
Again Carl, bloody brilliant mate.
Sorry to hear about your friend Roger. Brilliant video. Have to try it again next year and see if you can get the sea trout too 😉🤣
Amazing video Carl!! Keep up the amazing work and I hope you have a good Christmas
Cool video, every year i challenge myself to catch many different species and break pbs, i this summer caught the finnish record dace by bottom fishing, i also caught a grayling again, like Last year, i actually end it 1.11 but start the New one right away, this year i got a friend to compete against me, i already have the grayling, i caught it 3.11,on my birthday, i also have perch and roach from the rainbow trout/brown trout spot
This video bing the phrase “one last cast” to a whole new level
Awesome video, but you guys did complete the challenge it's just that someone initials goes next to the trout 👍
Great vid! What rods are you using whilst fishing for the grayling?
great video looked so much fun next time you get them all and so sorry to hear about your friend and mentor 💔
Bravo.Carl
Is it worth fishing in river or lake in scotland during winter months?
Amazing video!, Had a blast watching.
Love to see these vids from you Carl keep doing what you’re doing
Verrryyyy goooooodd video loved it
Amazing mate! 👌 u are inspiering me and i live in Sweden ❤
well done mate, incredible video, puts the great rod race to shame, I can't believe you got a salmon so quick and no sea trout, its usually the other way around?  we need more videos like this, you and Alex and snagged bros and ginger fisherman and adventure fishing Uk and bang average fishing should do the same challenge next year and see who the best is 👍👍👍👍👍
I'll challenge you to catch as many fish as possible with just one tin of sweetcorn and one loaf of bread. In one day.
Nice video but sad🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The film making, the adventure, the ups and the downs, this video trumps any of your previous and it’s a testament to your commitment to the game. Absolutely fantastic work mate I really really enjoyed that one. Looking forward to getting back out on the bank with you and cal again hopefully soon! Big ups
rest in peace
That was amazing Carl, top work there. Your videos are an inspiration to all.
Nice to see you back at fishing after a month can’t wait for the next vid
At 35:14 this temporarily became an Alex video
YES ITS FINALLY HERE
Would love to see you do a collaboration with Leo from Extreme Philly Fishing when he comes over here. Leo often reference you in his vids and livestreams. Check him out guys, very educational.
Fantastic adventure, so enjoyable to watch.
Very entertaining
👌👌👌
Multi species sessions are the best content ♥️♥️♥️ cheers mate !!!
Hello! Great content! By any chance, do you ship to romania?
Nothing like a good Carl video to start the day
Sidemen Vs Carl sounds like a banger to me
For those who watched the Great rod race it’s actually incredible at a lad can just smash it out on YouTube in 50mins. Well done.
Be nice to get a venue list of the ones that are day ticket 🙂 See if some of us subscribers can visit
Sick session mate, the amount of planning and dedication you needed to make this video! I wish I was as good at fishing as you are! Keep up the great videos and enjoy your Christmas!
I hope Rodger recovers well from his stroke. I suffered a stroke 2 years ago at the age of 38 fishing helps me hugely.
I love the fact that in UK,yall call it a session,we call it just fishin
Sea trout and brown trout are actually the same species (genetically). So basically you completed the challenge ☺️
Wow! Thats a lot of planning and dedication. Hope you had as much fun fishing as I had watching . Brilliant video !
carl is the only fisherman who would attempt this
Is lachett lakes the new name for tanyard from back in the day?
