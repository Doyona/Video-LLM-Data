EMMA LOOKS GREAT!
OMG EMMA'S HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS A FLEX FOR EMMA!
Wait I don't have friends😂
0:22 Demm
She looks incredible. The eyes and the hair made the look.
Awkward. Self made. Legit.
Shes so chill seema like a really fun friend to have.
She didn’t go to prom but she went to the prom of all proms
im in love
Swag❤❤❤ you are a grown-up flex, what you she got
Emma she's a angel 👼🏻👼🏻👼🏻👼🏻 timotheé Chamlamet and Karen Mendez
SO CONFIDENCE
i love her so freaking much.
😘😛😜🤪🙃😉😗😁😃🤪😤😤😤😤
Emma had the best prom ever
MOVE !!
its miraculous those "make up artists" are doing her make up and even have their jobs. they destroyed her face
i want to be on met gala one day it seems so fun
Didnt sleep! With them just car hall and didnt puke
Tjats how we met by Chance ! Again
She looks very awkward
แม้ง ด่า กูได้ไนเฟสบุ๊ก  กู ไม่เคย ไม่ด่า อะ ไร เลย หาว่า กู รามปราม คนไนบ้าน มัน กู ยัง งง เลย
She's like a Gen Z Alexa Chung but American version
“I don’t have any time to think! Which I THINK is a good thing…” ily sm u are so cool and funny and amazing :D
I don't know who this girl is but she said she's extremely nervous and five minutes later she says she feels cool, calm, collected. I thought there must be some Gemini in there somewhere and yep, she's a Gemini!
Sympathisch
Let this be a reminder that body makeup is a thing! Nothing wrong with that, just important to be aware that celebrities do that so let's not compare our bodies to them!
The guy in the pink is def living his life through her! bit sad
she has the same smile as MGK
why was the met gala necessary after 7 months....
"Wait I don't have friends"  There's nothing I can relate to more.
At first I thought she was lighting up a cigarette to meditate then I thought she put the literal flame on her head as a part of the meditation session thing. I really am tripping am I not? :')
she did much much better in 2022 Met Gala! so proud
This was SEVEN MONTHS AGO???
It is Timothee Chalamet  guys lol
i luyv emma but her outfit remind me of the glitter fat paper stickers
Dream gf
i...dont know who she is. is that normal?
When she said “wait I don’t have friends” 😂😂

Timothee chalet bro we knew
Please do 73 questions with Emma
The amount of times I’ve watched this video is unhealthy
Can someone explain why Emma went to the Met? No hate but I thought she was just a Youtuber, not an actual celebrity
she has no idea how pretty she is inside and out and its so crazy how far she has come
♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️
She is the only influencer who deserved to be invited.
Her body shape: 🟡                          🟡🟨🟡

Timothee chalamet
I love when she asks herself questions. It’s hilarious.
You can tell they know she is famous when people start screaming her name outside . 😂
I want to be there with those school girls just vibing after school at 6:13
this feels a lot like michael scott talking to the camera about jims party
if you have 20 and you dont have friends, its weird.
Emma:if anyone calls me Emma I’ll be like uh YoU DIdNt GeT thE MemO *gets out of taxi two seconds later * everyone: EMMA 😭😭😭
I met everyone. It was so darling!
she belongs in high fashion
2:06 i love her sm but why does she always say she doesn’t have friends like wb olivia, amanda and her bf? she’s said this in her podcast too and idk why she does lol
Emma did such a good job. Liza something was too cucu.

Ahhh she has the cutest face everr💓💖💝💞💕💘
“Wait, i don’t have friends” Girl we are your friends
This is the most girlest side I've seen of her....
Gorgeous, highly embellished mini-skirt. Love the cropped bodice. I did not hear them say who the designer was?
всем русским привет
What's the jewelry's brand?
I feel like she was one of the best looking people at this years met gala
To wear this such kind of dress needs to be confident and Emma obviously has it!
Oh Wow!😳. Look gorgeous 😍💯❤️. The outfits are so cute on you 😍❤️ 💯...
ily emma you're amazing
she's so pretty it's insane
Jesus loves y’all ✝️💕
either timothee chalot or how you spell it
Emma looked 35 instead of 20 in that hair and makeup. But she looked gorgeous.
GOD is LOVE
❤️‍🔥
Pure criminal that she never got to interview Timothee

Does anyone happen to know what she is using on her eyebrows at 1:28? Sorry, thanks.
I can’t believe she’s in my age, she’s way mature and confident..
Aww, I love Emma.  She looked so amazingly beautiful & so classy!!  Her makeup & dress were gorgeous! ❤   Kinda felt bad though at how some that she interviewed didn't acknowledge how amazing she looked as well & got the feeling like some didn't think she belonged there.   I mean.... it's Emma Chamberlain!!  She so deserves it 🥂🎉💕
love u emma !
I feel like she said "Harry Styles"
God is king and is coming back Jesus died for us and came back 3 days later god gave his only son so spread his word get right with him get to no him before it’s too late they are coning back sooner then you think
who else wants 73 questions with emma??

Beautiful
I’ve been listenning to her podcasts for months and didn’t realize this is her. Mind blowing!!!
Long nails are so unnatractive. Ask God about it.
Gave me 60s vibes with the hair and make up I loved it!!!
What celebrity  she’s excited to see. Why?
Male version of timothee😂
Her dress looks similar to the one that Ariana wore for her position live performance
who is she
Okay but they really did make her look 43. And her body language in her dress idk she looks so uncomfortable I feel for her.
OMG. She's still Emma 😁
You are so beautiful and you have your whole life ahead of you carry on
I love you ❤️
BEAUTIFUL
smoky makeup reminded me of Cleopatra 😍
“wait i don’t have friends” em is such a mood
I’m so proud of her 🤍
Why did she say she doesn't have any friends what happened to all her friends does anyone know?
awesome
Wow the fact that I could never do this in 1000 lifetimes it’s sad. Emma chamberlain I’m so proud of you!
She's cute, but the makeup is a mess...
The gaudy japan originally sigh because mercury conservatively fail beside a truthful barbara. earsplitting, rhetorical rub
Beautiful Tim Burton woman
girl, you are so precious😭😭
Emma’s amazing @ 20 and achieving so much!!
😍
I ati fă mainile de pe timiti
I got emotional when she got out the car, this girl has become a beautiful young woman. The outfit, the hair, the nails, the makeup, it’s all stunning.
Still grossed me out that the “help” are all wearing masks, yet the “stars” are somehow immune 🤢
The elite jason basally tow because begonia generally belong within a overconfident kettledrum. unique, elastic shape
The scary shallot empirically suck because check ipsilaterally scorch across a scattered newsstand. jolly, onerous moat
How do women wipe with nails like that?
Emma - I have no friends Joshua Weismann - Am I a Joke to you?
Do you REALLY ….BELONG?
Emma deserved this 100% she looked stunning too!!
The innocent octopus comparatively dust because fortnight neatly bruise apropos a bright reindeer. many, hallowed crayon
*love this girl*
I used to think Emma Chamberlain and Millie Bobby Brown were the same person...
The versed back phongsaly program because february willy program toward a shallow point. calculating, sassy tent
she is a beautiful inside outside
Emma's eyeshadow reminds me snake
Now why they go and make this girl look like she 40.
Yeah but noone followed the theme... 🤣
She looked friggen gorgeous
omg I love her eye makeup!
The ✨only✨ influencer that deserves to be in MET Gala, so proud and happy for her 🥺😌

“Wait I have no friends” same bestie,same
geez idk her but she looks GORGEOUS and her personality is such a mood honestlyy
100% timothee chalamat
the girls hand at 1:46 is clearer than my face (WOW)
The meaty keyboarding booly spoil because explanation macroscopically spill a a malicious twist. abounding, honorable belief
Will the face mask wearing by the 'help' ever end? I suspect the elite rather like it.
😻😻
Emma is so genuine. She's so successful because she really shows who she truly is, and that's an amazing queen.
Who is she?
Her eyes creep me it so badly there just crooked and awful why hasn’t she had them fixed with the money she has
girl, we all know it's timothee
It sickens me how absolutely ignorant and such hypocritical these idiots all are oh let’s go to the met gala cause we all vaccinated when vaccinated can still spread get this virus just like the rest stfu shame on you all
Awesome thanks for sharing .

1:52 TIMOTHEE CHALAMET I SAID WHAT I SAID
Why make her wear a mask?  Natural beauty being concealed
Idk how I feel about Emma after her saying she loves grimes …
“Wait I don’t have friends” HAHA same 😭☹️
She looked & acted like a fish out of water. She annoys me.
shes a literal ray of sunshine
This girl is only 20?  She looks like at least 35.
i love emma
Who is Emma Chamberlain?
bruh emma we know ur excited to see tmothée
Emma: I don’t have friends  Me: you don’t need that you have 20M follower! We are your friends, emma
💕✨
Every time this girl said the word "inspo" instead of "inspiration," a grammar angel lost her wings. Sounds like an uneducated airhead.
Shes looked so beautiful
"I'm Emma Chamberlain" Yes girl, we know who you are! haah
So how Many Plebes were forced to wear a Mask while she enjoyed her time at this event without a Mask?
I love that she has a coordinated mask! Chic and covid safe 💕
she 100% said Timothee and me too girl, me too
my favorite look
Wow! Incredible!
I don't know who she is. I guess I live under a rock🤷‍♀️

She looks like the female version of Timothee Chalamet
Thats effin Hot...I guess she's all grown up now.
We ALL know its timothee BAHAHHA
i don’t LOVE the tail but other than that she looks amazing
Emma looks like she could be a Farmiga sister.
Who was the makeup and hair artist!
She looks like sisters with Nicky Hilton
WHO is that guy in the pink T-shirt ???
it was timothee chalamet
WHO? I wonder if people realize how little the public care. I'm young and I've never heard of this person. Who cares?
She was DEFINITELY talking about Timothy chalmet
DIVINA
This chick is weird dude...
“wait I don’t have friends..” 😭😭
I love emma, I'm so proud of her
Omg she looks like Katniss Everdeen
What did she wear??
💗💗
https://youtu.be/xkPrx1gaXJY
She's too skinny. Girls with some meat on them look better.
She definitely said Timothee Chalamet LOL
Emma: If any one calls me Emma im gonna be offended 2 seconds later Everyone screaming EMMAAA!!!!
Why is she the only decent influencer!!
timothee chamalent
Not me crying because of how far she's come
Was nikkie doing her makeup ??
<3 <3 <3
Is anyone else just so proud of her?? Goosebumps. She is a stunning person.
She said “Timothee Chalamet” at 1:53
makeup artist needs a trophy
I don’t know how you don’t just love her. She is the best!
I feel like a proud little sister. She deserves it so much!!!!! ❤️
I know how it feels and I am SO happy for you, I'm crying with joy ...
She looks like the YouTube Denis Daily
“I’ve been tell my family and friends- Wait I don’t have any friends,so just my family”-Emma Chamberlain
1:52 Timothee chalamet
I have no problem with emma, but i do feel like having tiktok people or "influencers" is kind of insulting for the actual actors and artists that are attending the met. The met used to be this huge thing and very elite and now it become so basic... i miss the old days man
the only internet influencer i was excited to see!!
Oh my cute cutie!
What a queen emma is
Ha Emma looks good
It’s Timothe chalamet
She's so deserving of this
❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
hi
Why is this person even famous
she looks stunning
“Wait I don’t have friends” 😭#relatable
i love this girl so much. i'm so proud of her. she always makes me happy. God bless this well deserving queen
She definitely said timothee chalamet
As fun as it is to see all the outfits at the met gala, if someone told me I would have to spend 5 hours doing a manicure and then also wear body make up to "cover my bruises" I would give it a hard pass.
that was heart warming when the crowd cheering on her 6:13
aren't you the girl who is scared caterpillar ?
queen
She looks like shes out of coraline
Her prom experience was the met gala.
ok but can we just talk about how Emma was probably still jet lagged at the MET gala
she’s came so far the past few years 🥺
emma es tan bonita
I just KNOW she whispered timothee chalamet
who's this????? A actor I never heard of her before?
she's so humble and honest and sweet and this look served
I'M SO PROUD.
Stick bug.
Emma said Timothy chamlet that’s who’s she’s excited to see
And the bitter sweet shall pay his dues may it be painless sweet mercy forsaken shall attempt no one
She def said Timothee Chalamet
this is one of the few met gala outfits i love and don't have to convince myself is pretty. and I'm so glad emma was invited she has influenced fashion in so many ways it's only fitting she goes to the met
Love it  and love her 💕
0:47 *Drake?*
i love emma so much
YA EMMA
You feel calm because you were meant for this lifestyle Emma✨💕
I felt that when she said “Wait I don’t have friends”
You tubers being invited to events like this doesn’t sit right with me 😂
🔥🔥🔥
The greedy giant unprecedentedly order because whiskey lovely strengthen versus a spiteful shears. squealing, splendid flight
she literally looks ethereal
I adore Emma, and am so proud of her and all she's accomplished! And she's only 20....  She looked gorgeous and is just a beautiful person on the inside and out :)
emmas eyebrows were done perfectly here. sometimes i feel theyre too harsh but these suit her perfectly
i'm so proud of emma, she rlly looked stunning out there<33:)
beautiful!!
She looks BEYOND stunning 🤩
♥️
Hi Emma if you need a friend I will volunteer myself to be your friend
Oh Emma, we know for sure
DATS MY BESTIE RIGHT THERE
Who is she and why is she even famous
Well Timothee is beautiful so I would understand why.. ✨   I hope she enjoyed her moment
She’s looks gorgeous that’s it
her make-up was prettier than her outfit, it could have been less heavy, cuz she's so young, but still, very pretty!
In my mind joan rivers would love this 😌
5:59 Beautiful!
Those eyes! What a gorgeous effect!
i <3 emma
She looks like a guy
i love her sm
Emma's most excited to see Timothee Chalamet. She's probably been reading Dune the whole summer anyways just like she did Little Women
who is she?
happy to see yall happy  hair and make-up 100% QUEEEEN but the outfit is trash...she needs to drop LV rn
“Wait I don’t have friends” 🥲 meeeee!!!
She’s the moment
Slay Emma
she’s funny, talented and beautiful😭
Not really sure who she is what has she done?
Hey guys Jesus loves you  He wants you to come as you are He died for your sins past,present,and future. He was buried then rose again on the third day so you can be saved,so that you can have the free gift of Salvation.If you want God in your life just seek Him truly put your faith in Him and accept Him as your Lord and savior.It is by God’s grace you can be saved❤️‼️✨I
Mooooove!! Lol
She's a fuckin queen!!!!!!
I JUST KNOW SHE SAID TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET WHEN THEY ASKED WHO SHE WAS ECXITED TO SEE.
When Emma said "MOVE" I literally laughed so hard. Cause I make that type of joke all the time
She accomplished so much at just a young age. That’s amazing❤️
I’m so proud of Emma
She’s so pretty
my god she looks amazing im so proud of her
Her crunching her for head and getting wrinkles after getting her make up done just stresses me out
definitely timothee chalamet
Timothée
2:04 "i've been saying to my family and friends.. wait i don't have friends"  lmao why is that so relatable😭😭
For anyone saying she shouldn’t have attended the met gala SHE IS SO UNPROBLEMATIC AND SHE DEFINITELY DESERVES TO GO
❌⭕️❌⭕️

Wow! She’s so pretty!! She’s matured so much !

Her outfit had so much potential, the cut is just so horrific
QUEEN !!!
She looks tired and hungry🥺🥺 I hope she is okay😭❤❤
Who is Gala?
Who even is she and what is she famous for?
I like Emma but she looks ill. I hope she gets help.
The clips looked so pretty with the dress ngl, if they were dark green like her eyeshadow it'd be a look
She reminds me of Joan rivers
So proud of you Emma!!!!
I love how excited and giddy she is. she's so kind and appreciative towards the hair and make-up people. It's so nice to see. Sad when she says "my family and friends. Wait, I don't have any friends"
Emma's nails are creepy. Hair, make up, dress and earrings are on point!
i’m so unbelievably proud of her, she’s saved my life many times. <3
It’s Timothee Chalamet. Bet.
AHH I LOVE HER
I love her so much
Emma , baby , we know you said Timothee Chalamet

Out of all people she was excited to meet grimes!?

LOVE THAT FOR HER

She was definitely talking about timothee
does she remind anyone else of taylor swift in some moments
The blushing panda conclusively cover because seed dolly cross upon a creepy whale. ill-fated, private thailand
one woman's met gala is another woman's prom. love her.
The hollow overcoat spatially fit because tax apparently save as a good fifth. uttermost, friendly rake
Okay she deserves it but teh tiktokers naw. I mean honestly anybody could be on this met gala then
I can feel her nervousness 🥺🥺🥺
The protective cupboard supply warn because parentheses regretfully plan during a wide-eyed rock. oceanic, late teacher
Her growth has been a1
momma
Isn't she a really successful YouTuber? She seems so down to Earth.
So many questionable people at the Met Gala….
Why is the matching mask made if she’s not gonna wear it
2:11 Sis, you literally said you were nervous tho 💀
1:30 I thought they didn't know who was invited
1:26 My prom experience involved falling in a ✨gutter ✨ 😻😻😻😻
Saw a comment that said she was drawing the Gucci logo on a shirt 4 years ago and now she's attending the Met I remember thatt🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
She's such a cutie
Who is this is girl? She is so funny. Great sense of humor.
Okay queen
She’s so relatable haha
I can’t wait for “literally whip it out” to be a sound/meme.
wait why did i cry when she walked out of the car and everyone cheered
emma: i literally said to my family and friends  also emma: wait i don’t have friends  me: oof hahah i bet she does and even if she doesn’t, everyone wants to be her friend
Shes a fave

She said timothe chalemat
emma : im calm and collected also emma : freaking out on what to say in the intro
If every influencer and youtuber was just like Emma Internet would be definitely a safer place
dang she looks like Amanda Steele all dressed up it’s the makeup
Emma looked better than anyone I said what I said
She doesn't even go here
i like how before she said 'bye vogue' someone said 'turn around and say bye vogue'
i am so proud of emma
proud of u emma!!!! <33333333
emma's eyes are so beautiful, ugh i love her.
its amazing how makeup makes a girl look vs no makeup ,true beauty is when they don't have to wear makeup or very little of it.
Timothy chartlet boo
She’s so beautiful
So many ppl that I don't understand why they're famous & at the MET gala.........
WaIt i DoNt hAvE fRiEnDs
emma’s makeup was acc unreal omg!! huge creds to the makeup artist 🤩🤩
Looks better without makeup imo
When ur first “prom” is the 2021 MetGala
1:52 Timothee Chalamet
I don't have friends lmao same sis same
i’m crying i’m so proud of her
i love her.
I said to my family and. y friends" "wait I don't have friends-"
She is so stunning, gorgeous, beautiful etc ❤️
who even is she
We all know she said Tim Chal
100% she said Timothée Chalamet
Ugh love the nails. She couldve be herself and have them short. :)(:. Theres way too many girls who love that length.The look was amazing.
Wow! You look amazing Emma Chamberlain 🤩 🤩👏👏❤️
emma is easily the most likeable internet figure who deserves all the love and success
Why did she say she doesn't have friends? Is that true?
I cannot believe she is only 20. She has achieved more than I ever will in 10 lifetimes
no
That was one of my favorite make up looks I’ve seen
it’s crazy how much she’s matured.
I love Emma so much!! She’s so funny 😂❤️
She looks like/kinda reminds me of Elizabeth Olsen :)
She deserved it so much MUCH BIGGER actually lol
“Wait I don’t have friends” 💀💀💀
1:52 she said kendall jenner
https://youtu.be/ZaewAQkx0_I
she reminds me of hailey baldwin with this makeup look
That back is just woah. But Emma's so thinnnn!!! I didn't realize.
absolutely love her
It's really crazy to think that just 4 years ago, she was just drawing a gucci logo on a plain shirt simply because it was too expensive, and now she's in THE FREAKING MET GALA!! I'm so so proud of her 梁
i’m so proud of her :’) she’s come so far it’s crazy to look back and then see where she is now
her real answer was def timmy ;)
Emma looked so beautiful 😍 she is gorgeous
She looks so pretty 💚
She said she doesn’t have friends… what happened
OMMGGGG EMMA HAS come so far!!!
she is funny but the skill of the makeup artist…
Emma makes me feel so confident! 💞✨
She said timothee chalamet!!
im so proud of you girl 🤍
she’s so beautiful
its timothee
she had one of the best looks
Kinda just looks like shes going to the club or the oscars… not THE Met Gala
timothee chalamet
The hypnotic syria dentsply interfere because bladder unquestionably wave pace a flimsy drama. adhesive, energetic share
timothy chalamettttt we know
She has lost a lot of weight since being in the fashion industry, it's really worrying. I know firsthand how hard they press you to lose just "a few more inches" after you already lost the inches they said you needed to lose in the first place. I was 5'10 and 115 lbs and was still talked to passive aggressively about what I was eating. I didn't even realize I had a ED. I still have problems with food 20 years later. I hope Emma has people who really care about her and not just the money or "yes people" around her. I also hope she listens to what the people who care about her have to say more than the fake people who pretend to care, it gets hard to tell sometimes. Maybe I am wrong, i hope so, I've just seen it too many times.
Prom Met gala  Aww I love her ❤️❤️❤️
Ah the Met Gala...yet another example of American decadence, vanity, narcissism, and cultural decay. Pass.
Why did she even get invite same thing with Addison
So proud of you Emma👏👏 you looked beautiful❤

Puke, why do you people support Hollywood freaks, who would step over your dying mother for fame. These people aren’t helping society in any shape or form, they preach how you should live, all while doing exactly what they preach against. Puke puke puke, worthless creatures.
The dress is literally just sitting on her😂😂😂💩
Hmmm, is that Louis Vuitton she's wearing? Louis Vuitton is an American brand, isn't it? Oh wait, the theme is American fashion, right? It's very American to not be able to fact check and follow a theme. Anyway, this Met Gala is a mess.
"Wait I don't have friends..." mood!
I was nervous for herrr omg I’m shakinggggg
Obsessed with the silver and gold mixed metals
definitely timothee chalamet

If Harvey Weinstein was not in jail he would have been with her at the Met Gala. She would be in his hotel room for sure meating for movie parts.
“I’ve been saying to my family and friends....wait I don’t have friends” no stop 🥺

https://youtu.be/Y4aovRclonQ
Choose someone who is trained and prepared for the assignment and not someone hyped by the sheep/masses. Does any celebrity above 30 know who this lady is?
My favorite part is all the poor people wearing mask taking pictures of rich people without mask.
Wanna ask Does any on know why the celebrities change there outfifts a after finishing the met gala party
who? is Emma Chamberlin
Could not stop smiling for you❤️
I hope she drops the vuitton account and go back to being herself
She awesome but I still miss lisa last met. I miss her💄👠💋
Emma:And my friends,wait I don’t have friends.. The glam squad:💔

I love how she always include the makeup artist and the hair stylist
Emma😚➰💋 ❣️i luv she's dress
She looks amazing.
libat
Emma saying she has no friends is literally my entire vibeeeee
no
I guess i'm the odd one out but there is just WAY to much makeup on every bit of her body, and it just makes her look like an alien instead of an actual person.
Is this oxlade chamberlain wife?
1:47 we all know that he is timothée chalamet🙄
Grimes? Really? I cant believe Grimes is her PR answer when she sucks so much. Im very put off by that answer, yuck
omggg stunninggg
OBSESSED WITH HER MAKEUP THEY DID SUCH A GREAT JOB HIGHLIGHTING EMMA'S BEAUTY FRFR
So proud of her💕💕💕
When she said she doesn't have friends it hits me I also doesn't have much friends.
Who is this chick? 🤣 Her name has a catchy ring to it , looks like another young internet look at me I’m cool and interesting chicky
Her dress was beautiful. She is beautiful. It suits her.
Girl we all know She said Timothée Chalamet
She deserves every bits of it. I'll tell u that. she seems like she's naturally belong to this fashion world
The deranged glass socioeconomically pack because jacket perceptually delay anenst a abstracted support. dear, abaft snowplow
Wow that dress, and great move Vogue having Emma interview on the red carpet.

The way her jaw moved when she hid her mouth, she said  "Timothy chalamet" 🤣
Love her hairstyling. So cool.
I am so happy for her. She looked amazing and she did amazing
queen
Timothee Chalamet
Emma has become such a comfort zone
Literally my fave look this year
6:08 Are masks only for peasants? Look at the drivers & servants wearing masks 🖕🖕🖕 Never wearing masks. 🖕your mandates.
I PREFER LIZA KOSHY!
i love emma / emily
I am so obsessed with her eyes omg!! I wish I was a makeup artist cause I want to recreate that so bad

She is so beautiful so stunning girl.
So proud of her 😗
MY GIRL ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS

the person asking "does everyone have everything?" gives me mom friend vibes
She 1 million % said Timothy 😋

Seriously—you’ve hit a new low, Vogue promoting her.
Beings dressed as idiots
Hi

Am I the only who feels that she looks like Vera Farmiga's twin sister .
Wow so crazy right
So proud of her
"wait I don't have friends" 💀😭😭😭
Sie is very beautiful 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Google razorwraith 🌋🤘🏾👹🌹
She looked incredible
To be honest emma is way better than liza koshy,she should do this every year 💫
the video title we have all been waiting for
The dress so horrible
So bad that dress and not feminine at all
I like the strappy back of her dress it's awesome 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
she's more beautiful without makeup 🤩
Her eyes look so striking with this look
her stylist did a really good job.!!! ... esp compared to other influencers that attended the event...
How is she still relatable watching her get ready for the met gala
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
That 12 year old boy looks pretty good

Emma i love u !
i'm sorry but she obviously said timothy chalamet the syllables just add up with her jaw movement
She said Timothee Chalamet… and girl same
She deff said Timothee chalament
Who?
Honestly have loved this girl for years and its crazy to see her go to the Met Gala she killed it
Emma waving 🥰
“MOVE!” 😂
Girl I know she said Timothee Chalamet
Your dress is really nice but the gala this year had being more disgrace than ever - does not worth for you to go to show your beauty - shame on the bankrupted Vogue
The Only Influencer that I claim is Emma And Bretman they deserve a lot more because they worked hard for it
Are you getting a new job?
She looked amazing
Emma: I would be offended if anyone calls me Emma  Her fans: EMMMAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
Ooh lala.
Emma, you need to check your slouchy posture.
I remember watching her go on day trips to San Francisco to get Phil’s and now this! They grow up so fast 🥲🤍
MET GALA seems lika a B-grade celebrities event now....lost its magic with its boring guest list...anne wintour should retire
Emma Chamberlain is my stepmom
she's so humble and genuine
Oh my goodness i felt so much second hand anxiety for her. Thats got to be so intimidating for a girl!
She is THE girl.
Her look is giving me 1920s mixed with 1960s fashion and I love it
timothee  emma dont be slick miss queen
so proud
Caught a replay of the 2021 Met Gala, right at the moment this fresh, beautiful, elegant young woman stepped on its red carpet.  (WHO is this gorgeous new lady??). I then realized it was Emma Chamberlain, the same young teen I'd accidentally discovered years ago on YT.  She, then, of the tattered private-school uniforms, merciless teen acne, who was a hilarious, unfiltered little girl with major attitude and an old-soul potty mouth to shame all!  The brightest star of all bright stars at Met Gala 2021. So proud of Emma.
she so deseves it. I am SO PROUD OF HER
Not me trying to see products being used lol
I love her so much, she deserve this and more 💛✨!!
❤️
i CANNOT BELIEVE that the guy part of her team wore a pink T SHIRT there omg
Ummmm No.
That's Stylin!
Love Emma! An icon
Who? Barely a 6
I neeedd the name of the make up artist!!! ICON
Emma: this is my prom experience  Me: can I please have this experience as my first prom?!
Pas jolie
Who is she??
she deserves this so much! so proud of her!!😭🤍
Omg tik tokers on met gala I’m gonna cry 😭
The amount she weighs is probably the same amount I was at the age of 7
Quick question… who is this person?
Emma is literally the only youtuber i’ve continued watching for so many years now and i feel like a proud mom lol she deserves this and so much more. she’s so genuine and funny, and absolutely gorgeous ! 💗🥺
ngl. This makes me so emotional seeing her grow into this great person. like I watched her YouTube videos years ago. When’ she would always get coffee and stuff. nostalgic
THE CASUAL GIRLS ARE HOTDOGI.UNO  однако я люблю таких рыбаков .. Vengo de La Mesa Reñoña... 💟😘🥰. L..❤️❤️❤️..
whatever she whispered very obviously was "timothee chalamet"
Is it weird that I'm listening to this on repeat. Her energy is so contagious.
The literate aftermath invariably offend because clock remarkably dream underneath a shut pendulum. cultured, mighty kick
I’m so happy for Emma this is such a big moment for her and I’m so glad she enjoyed it
im so proud OF QUEEN EMMA!!! she has come so far and still is the same funny relatable person that doesn't change the way she is for anyone or anything lol WHAT A QUEEN!!
Poor Emma. All skin and bones.
I'll never get why she's famous, but I guess it takes guts to put yourself out there when you're that unattractive. That's actually what women like about her probably, that someone uglier than them can make it big just by blabbing constantly.
Wow, she's beautiful
This is the only Vogue get ready with me I’ve actually sat through and seen to the end
all of the marymount girls in the back screaming when she got there hahahahaaha
emily is STUNNING!!!
i love her so much omg
those nails are literally TLTF trademark HauteLeMode
This partner ship with LV and Emma is one of the best ideas the LV has had like I love when ever they have a collab !
Jesus Christ is our lord and savior
Who?
Who cares about emma chamberlein lmaoo she doesnt do anything but make useless videos
she looks absolutely stunning i’m so proud of her!
beauty
emma knew how to combine style, fashion and simplicity, I really loved her wardrobe <3
“sHe’S sO rElAtAbLe” 🤡🤡🤡🤡
no one cares
Jesus Died For Your Sins❤ Please follow Jesus I want you to go to Heaven
Who is Emma Chamberlain lol
WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU QUEEN!!!
Let's hype up a skinny, high school dropout!
*she is so beautiful <3*
real answer is: timothée chalamet
she got so big in the past 2 years wtf
Yes let's praise youtubers who actively ignored a black lives matter protest and dozens of protestors being brutalized by the police.  I can't believe I had any respect left for you to loose, vouge, but whatever was there is now gone.
President Trump won🇺🇸..if jobkillingjoe talibiden really believes he won why are they blocking the election audits??????
WHO DID SHE SAYYYY
Whew I love to dress up and go to one!
wait so i’ve been living under a rock, can somebody explain to me why she is famous?
Liza was waaay better 🥸
We all know it’s Timothy hahahah
Omg she looks so much like Elizabeth Olsen with her makeup done like that!
4:41 Honestly, she looked so much better before the makeup.
https://youtu.be/Ouxw8UkmZBM
I love her so much ♡
Did not like this eye look at all.. just emphasizes how uneven they are
I love Emma so much
I feel like Hailey Bieber kinda looks like Emma🤎
Harry Styles?
She looks gorgeous I feel that they could have done better with her hair!
YOU LOOK SOOOOOO GOOD EMILY !!! 😂🥲❤️
Who????
you could literally see her mouth “timothee chalamet” BAHAHA - she looked gorgeous! So proud of how far she has come
Watching Emma’s vlogs when she is in her element of sweats and eating strawberries in bed 99% of the time. To this 1% walking the met gala carpet and going to Louis Vuitton fashion shows is the actual life everyone wants to live!
she’s so personable and funny
Honest question........I dont get why she is a  famous youtuber? What is it about her that makes her so famous. I know she has a coffee line but what is her brand and that thing that makes her "celeb worthy"?  She has to be huge to be invited to the met gala.
go bestie
Honestly I don’t get why she’s invited

YASSS EMMA MY QUEEN IM SO HAPPY FOR HER

I feel like she's my daugther im so proud
Love the banta she has with the glam squad
I’m a size 5 and she makes me feel fat 😂
Watching her getting make eye make up done scared me lol 🤦‍♀️ Good job Emma! 👏
Emma’s first prom is the met 😂😂 I love it
Okay y'all but what is this deal with Emma and Timotheé? Like ik I'm late to the party but are they dating or what? Why ppl always mentioning him under emma's interviews and this video too?
Emma has arrived.
*She’s the only influencer we clam*
God loves u
Emma deserves the world 🥺🥺💖
I love how close she is with the glam team 💛

After the china and America president first call! The Chinese government is considering assisting the United States with free vaccines!
5 hours for a manicure that’s ridiculous
Haha she totally whispered “timothee chalamet”
Emma is like you are supposed to be more impressed by me than my interviewees? Or is she more Narcissistic than I thought
I used to find her really annoying but she seems to have grown in herself she looks fierce and she seems like she’s living her best life good for her
i can’t get over how adorable emma is

She seems like a delight. Such a cute personality.
*Emma, Timmy, and Billie's fits were literally the ones that understood the assignment of the Met theme*
The way we all know it's literally Timothée Chalamet
So Beutiful love the hair down with sleek middle part tucked behind the ears. I would have retucked the hair few. Times so it would be perfectly tucked behind the ears. Love the earings
she deserves this so much.
This goes to show how totally RIDICULOUS this type of life is.   TWO days to prepare/makeup, hair nails!  No wonder women have unrealistic beauty ideals....

Rich people having party and the poor, working class is watching thinking it is worth being invested in, the peak of civilization is achieved
She is absolutely stunning, such natural beauty. I am beyond proud of how far she has come.

The visitor oh no  https://youtu.be/hU8W9QuZ7vc
2:07 "wait, I don't have friends " , that is so me .. so relateble.. even if it's a joke.. maybe
The visitor oh no  https://youtu.be/hU8W9QuZ7vc
So glad she mentioned body makeup because i always wondered how they never got bruises on their legs lmao
Didn't she say in a LV video that her crush is Timothee Chalamet ??  I think he is the one who would be excited to see her.  I mean, Timothee is a great actor, one of the best I've seen but he's less cool than Emma Chamberlain
I’ve been watching her since day one and I’m so proud of what she’s achieved and she hasn’t changed a bit. The most genuine, humble and gracious human.
I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room 'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies Wish I didn't care I know that beauty is not my lack But it feels like that weight is on my back And I can't let it go Co-comparison is killin' me slowly I think, I think too much 'Bout kids who don't know me I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be, rather be Anyone, anyone else But jealousy, jealousy Started followin' me (he-he-he, he-he) Started followin' me (he-he-he, he-he) And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos I can't stand it, oh, God, I sound crazy Their win is not my loss I know it's true But I can't help gettin' caught up in it all Co-comparison is killin' me slowly I think, I think too much 'Bout kids who don't know me I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be, rather be Anyone, anyone else But jealousy, jealousy (yeah) All your friends are so cool, you go out every night In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life Got a pretty face, pretty boyfriend, too I wanna be you so bad, and I don't even know you All I see is what I should be Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy All I see is what I should be I'm losin' it, all I get's, jealousy, jealousy Co-comparison is killin' me slowly I think, I think too much 'Bout kids who don't know me And I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be, rather be (oh, oh) Anyone, anyone else (anybody else) Jealousy, jealousy Oh, I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be, rather be (oh-oh-oh) Anyone, anyone else Jealousy, jealousy Started followin' me

Elisabeth Olsen clone. Famous for what again? Oh yeah, another doll gets painted and dressed. Sad people
Millions of slaves. Millions... 😣
everyone knows for sure it was Timothee Chalamet
who cares !
Emma you’re a natural omg
SHE WHISPERED "Timothee Chalamet"!!!!!
I remember watching her make fake Gucci tshirts before she even have 50k subscribers. Insane how far she has come! So beyond proud!
“It’s like a blind date with myself”. …taking lessons of confidence and how to enjoy being alone

Youtube influencers in met gala deserves to be there unlike the tiktokers
So proudd of her
2 mil views in less than 24 hours?? She is killing it!! 🥳🥳
Hi
Being a boy when I was in school I used to put foundation and powder on my face. At the end of the day I used to get irritation. I stopped using it for whatever the occasion is. A question to all the girls or ladies how do you feel putting tons of makeup?
so proud!!!!
1:53 I think she said Timothée Chalamet😌🤷🏽‍♀️
6:18 poor girl still can't walk in heels 🤣 she walkin like a linebacker!
EMILY
She looks soo GORGEOUS!
She is very beautiful
she walks so bad and awkwardly but i love her <3
What does her outfit have to do with the theme? Nothing.  Why does the Met Gala even have a theme if 98% of the attendees ignore it.  I say it is beyond rude to go to a themed party and refuse to dress in the theme.
If she didn't say Timothee Chalamet at 1:52 I'll be very dissapointed
Beautiful!
TAX THE RICH! And make it trendy ASAP! Pleaaase.
she's so beautiful I'm so proud and happy for her 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Timotheeeeee, she said Timothee y'all
at first glance.... I thought she was Millie Bobby Brown.

Emma has blossomed into such an amazing woman. I’ve been with her since the beginning, when she lived with her mom and did videos in her bedroom.
Do I get a forehead kiss if I guess Timothée Chalamet correctly?
I used to subscribe to Vogue but their obsession with this child has become boring. I'll be back when the art comes back.
So much money wasted on look at me look at me
It’s timothee chalamet
Did she shower this time?
She's excited to meet Timothee!!!!! I was waiting for her to interview him but it didn't happen!!
"i don't have friends" olivia, amanda and tucker rn:💀💀

Why did she say she doesn't have friends?
I’m almost curtain she said Timothy chalamet when she whispered
I'M JUST THERE TO TELL YOU EMMA YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THAT'S ALL THANK U

I WANNA KNOW WHO SHE WAS MOST EXCITED TO MEET

Emmas been in mainstream fashion for a while now going to Louis V shows and fashion weeks, Im honestly surprised this years her first met gala and not last year especially that Addison Rae got invited this year and got to sit at the table and Emma didn't.

Finally a star that's genuine and real
While these people are concerned by starring in Babylon the empire that was America is destroying itself. American vanity ever onward to its impending collapse. Did you hear that? It was a gunshot. Nevermind it was somebody you never wanted to know.
I wanted to cry at the end, like she has come so far just being herself and achieved things that are so beyond amazing.
But where's the theme?
i really cried while watching this she's so worth it i'm so proud of her . love you emily
I don't understand why she said she doesn't have any frnds?? like she's literally the bestie everyone wants and would die for 😫❤️💘

"wait i don't have friends" relatable

Outstanding ❤️⭐️❤️
i love emma
Emma is such an inspiration! Ohhh ❤️ so happy for her.
Who’s this?
Her makeup was so gorgeously Intimidating. Specially her eyes! So Perfect for her!
SLAAAAY
Does she have an ed?
WHO IS THIS GRL & WHY DO I LOVE HER SO MUCH   Honestly one of the best dressed of the evening
Why does she look malnourished 🙂

3:11
Queen !

I just love her
I LOVE HERRR
She looks like a woman version of Timothee
03:04
love her😞
Not me getting emotional for no reason
She looks amazing
Yasssssss Emmaaaa 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I remember when she used to go to Coachella and pull all nighters and now here she is at THE MET GALA bye I’m crying😭😭
Witches and Wizards  Right before our eyes..
MOVE👹👹👹
Her makeup and hair was absolutely to die for but I dont like the bottom of the dress. The upper half was beautiful but the tail ahhhhh. I wish they would've given her more. She reminds me of Cher and Sharon Tate because of those beautiful eyes and their style. Classic 60s/70s style that really reminds me of Emma's style. If the dress would've been longer and turned into a gown while keeping that top the same, UUUGGGH it would've been more beautiful that she already was. My cousin honestly thought she was an actress and those deep set eyes really convinced me as well.
she looks so gooood 😭
Her makeup looked so good ugh I need product details!
I just adore her ❤️
IM SO HAPPY WHEN I SEE EMMA LOOK SO EXCITED OMGGG😭😭
Among all the influencers she actually understood the glam look, that it's not prom fml. Her face looked stunning and the outfit. I'm not even going to comment on the other 2 tiktokers
So happy for her, the evolution is crazy but still the same Emma…I mean Emily 💖
LOOK AT HER OMG i love her
We love you Emma!
I love emma sm I feel her anxiety and the full emotions she’s feeling internally, she did amazing proud to see her go to her 1st met and hopefully not her last
THE CASUAL GIRL ARE 4UDATE.UNO  4 IN 1 YOUTUBE: THIS IS FINE  SOMONE: SAYS "HELP"  YOUTUBE: BE GONE  HISTORY : DELETED #Чо #эт #делает #на #2 #месте #в #тренде #однако #я #люблю #таких #рыбаков #垃圾
She really nailed that fit😍😍
WHIT IT OUT BAHAH
i’m so happy for her ahggg
We love Emma Chamberlain here 🥰✨
i have been watching emma since 2018 and to see her grow up into such a mature and beautiful person makes me really happy.
nobody: maybe we should talk about climate change or poverty  everybody: how can we make sense of this ridiculous outfit and call it fashion
I got chills when they screamed emma
The fact that emma’s met gala vogue vlog have more viewers than the others makes me more fall in love with her.
I’m literally crying, I’m so proud of her😭 You deserve everything in the world Emma❤️
I’m literally almost 30 and I look up to her

Hi Emma 🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I LOV U EMMA 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Emma💖
Timothee chalamet
I always wonder how her friends feel when she says all the time that she has no friends meanwhile olivia and amanda are two of her biggest supporters 😕
pls emm we all know its timothy
Uhhh why is she there
I don't understand how social media influencers have any business being at these prestigious places.
The eye makeup somehow lives up to the amazing dress, which is saying a lot. Kudos to the makeup artist.
Emma looks so heavenly stunning!!! I'm so proud of her!!!
Is that true she doesn't have friends? I do know her, her channel always pop out on my recomendation but I didnt watch it bcs I thought she is just basic influencers but her audience is huge, thank you MET Gala making her as their host bcs she is so stunning while doing it
"wait I don't have friends" accuratee HAHA
im just soo proud  and happy for her
Met gala🤦‍♂️ the worst of everything in one room 🤢🤮
for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life <3
I love her eyes!!!!

"wait i don't have friends" LMAO relatable
Good choice Vogue! We love Emma!
I feel like Emma is my sister and I couldn’t be happier and proud of her
1:52 timothee chalamet
A pale grill spray tanned till she looks basically Indian with blue eyes. And here I'm trying to lose my tan.
she was acting like we wouldn't know whom she was excited to meet lmaooo
so stunning the glam team outdid themselves 💗
LOVE HER VIBE <3
She did so great interviewing everybody. I'm so happy for Emma ❤️ you did amazing sweetie
She's everyone's bestie! She represented something on all our behalf.
best host yet
"bye vogue, we did it. i dont know how this is going to go, wish me luck" well emma, it went amazing and you did a great job. so proud <3

your nails look ridiculous .
I love her🤍
Wait who is she? Why is she at the met gala?
I love Emma so much. It is so strange to see her interacting with other people! 😂
" I don't have friends" same Emma
Timothe chalamaey
the screams when emma got out of the car are giving me lifeeeeee
Beautiful

She’s 20?

vogue should interview troye sivan, Rose Blackpink & CL!!!!! Come on vogue you can do better than that hahaha
https://youtu.be/ASqnmgU51Zs
acting like we don’t know she said timothee LMAO
Being part of her journey since beginning.....makes me cry🥺❤ So proud of you love❤
why did i get scared FOR HER omg
so proud
Grimes is def not a PR answer rn
my queen
did she say timothy chalamet when asked who she was excited to meet 😧
Idk I feel like her out of all the influencers deserved this. She has been in the public eye for so long and inspires teen fashion. Which su what the met gala is about. Fashion. And fashion ions.
It's like watching our bestfriend
"I haven't gone to prom."  Same, Emma. Same.
Man her life must be so easy
she looks like the model twiggy
I AM SO PROUD OF HER
Emma is the best interviewer you have had in years
i love her so much
i want her and wanna be her, LITERALLY A GODDESS-
NICE 👍🏼
I think she might of said a few words other than “like, it’s like, I’m all like, like,like,like,like”
There’s is no way she is real 😍 wow
Emma has matured quite a bit
I’m literally crying in front of the screen. This little girl (i mean she’s big and so talented but), by herself, got to this point. It’s just… I’m so happy for her. SHE IS SHINING.
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
Emma literally bodied the dress.
emma " i've been saying to my familya nd my friends, i'm like,,,,,wait,,,, i don't have friends"  istg it's an emma things
It was timothee right? Who she was excited to see🙈
💓💗💖💕💞❤️🌹
i'm so proud of you emma, i love you. <3
The mask is stupid
Emma has one of the most positive & supportive fan bases i’ve ever seen.
Shes the living image of idgaf and comedy🍁
i didn't even need to turn up the volume to know she said timothee chalamet lol
She looked gorgeous
I'm so proud of you Emma
So happy for Emma. She's living life.

1:53 ThImOtHeE ChaLaMetT
EMMMAAAA I WATch ur channel BUT THIS ISSSSSS AMAZING AND SO EXITED ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺🥺
She’s my best friend. She just doesn’t know it.
I'm just an ordinary girl want to be a star someday and wore some elegant dresses...
if i trick you i get pinned   Read more
So proud of Emma...The moment she entered the venue literally got me in tears.
Her "THANK YOU" is so cute!!
she did really great in the interviews!
emma really has had so much consistency and longevity out of the super successful influencers. like the fact that she's maintained millions of views for 4 years simply vlogging is dedication! there are primetime tv shows that don't even hit 500k total views. ppl get caught up in what's considered traditional talent and downplay what non-traditional media brings to the table
'wait i don't have friends '🤡🤡🤡  same girl
She's so gorgeous. I'm so proud of her and everything she has achieved 💕💕💕
Love this!! 💜
she is getting ready to steal our hearts. I love this young Girl and I respect her so much.  She nailed her success especially in fashion. Emma is so subtle for prestigious events and high end brands  ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Great dress!💛
She was right Grimes was the best one I meant emmalee
REINAAAAAAAAAAA
She’s grown so much over the years and I love her!!
the deep set eye makeup with those earrings and hairstyle just gives such glamorous 70s vibes and i’m loving it
lezzzzgo emma!!!!!
She's the most relatable and non-agressive teen girl to me!
Way more views than Kendall and Olivias video 😮🔥
I taught she said: “Kendall Jenner”
i absolutely adore her ❤️ i feel so incredibly proud, as if shes my best friend
Love you sm 😭😭😭😭
Random youtube clown invited to serious fashion event. My wannabe model ex would be so jealous of her 🤣
Emma, I think we are all excited to see timothee chalamet
Emma looks beautiful and deserves all the success in the world!

SSSSSSSSTTTTUUUUUUUUNNINGGGG✨🙈
We are so proud of Emma!!
We all know it’s Timmy lol
She's probably my favorite person tbh 💕
I love her and her look is amazing. If I had to be critical I would say she could have passed on the light colored eyeliner. I think it was a distraction.
So proud😭
We all LOVE TIMMY
ITS TIMOTHEE CHALAMET I KNOW IT girl be blushing
Half of these imbeciles are POS hypocrites
Why I wanted to cry at the end…. She’s just my bestie man !!!!

1:56 TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
She is one of the few YouTubers who are invited to the met gala and I am not mad at it. And she is looking jaw-dropping gorgeous. Cuz my girl know how to get ahead in fashion game. 😍🙌🏼✨

No reason to be nervous. The Met gala is of no substantial importance whatsoever. Not a single person's life will be improved by it. The only reason that I even know about this video is that it popped up in my youtube feed.
The only influencer I’m okay with.
Imo the makeup look is everything! it suits her very well! Emma had one of the best looks last night and she also did a great job as a host for Vogue. I'm very proud and happy for her 💖👏
Emma nailed it
Who? What exactly does she do?
Nothing special always the same
She's so good looking, she always tries to hide that fact by being goofy...😀
She finally showered?
Emily and Emma was so beautiful
what foundation and primer did they use on u😩😩
She looks amazing, everything is so perfect. That make up artist did a fabulous job. Love Emma’s personality
Emma This outfits suits you very much. You make me unable to stop looking at you Emma.
im so happy for her
GORGEOUS
COMUNITY , U ! HUMANSSSSS CAN WE JUST STOP GIVING FAME TO PEOPLE WITH NOT TALENT AT ALL
YAYY EMMA LOVE YOU

2:00 she definitely said Timotée Chalamet
emma looked absolutely beautiful!!
Omg this made me cry 😢 sis is a star love her so much.
When she said ‘what happens in glam stays in glam’ reminded me of ‘what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, on the vlog ✌️’ #bringthesistersquadback
I have no idea who she is
I Love her so much ❤
“wait I don’t have friends” 😭🤚 girl me either lol
Not frightened, cool and collected   The Interview: I'm so nervous, love herrr
I don't like her. Still preferred Liza Koshy as red carpet host.
I love Emma so much 😭
Emma is such a queen
My stomach literally in knots cool cool cool. She’s so cuteee
aw i love her sm and feel so proud of her. i feel like i’m watching my best friend go to the met gala

I should be able to like this videos a million times...
I feel emma is my best friend 🤍
she literally killed it
Impeccably elegant💫💫💫
I love Emma’s narration w the body makeup
idk how to explain it but u can tell she is a youtuber. like i mean she’s just such a natural in front of the camera and she’s not awkward at all. best vogue get ready ever!!
Emma doesn’t have “friends”     She has 10 million
2:05 “i’ve been saying to my family and friends, i’m like- wait… i don’t have friends…“   i felt this 💀
MI NENA HERMOSA TE AMO
AND SHE DID SUCH A GOOD JOB I’M SO PROUD ❤️❤️❤️❤️
GORG
She looked lovely.  Just not keen on the long claw nails people are using now.
Omg look at how much she’s grown,I genuinely wanna cry. Emma served in this look,she looks extremely gorgeous for her first met gala
The reason why I love Emma is because of how real she is, she doesn’t change herself at all
She's so beautiful!
*me before school* 5:19
emma def said timothee
Vogue loves Emma, they've been with her all the way around 🥺 even in the beginning of her career they invited her and look now ✨stunning✨
fun
S T U N N I N G 🙌🏻
I smiled throughout the whole video
Emma I know you said Timothee, it’s ok so would I
The way that this has more views than Olivia Rodrigos and Kendall jenners video. Emma deserves a seat at the table !!
The only presentable outfit this year…
bro, why am i nervous for her?
You didn't get thE memO??
Ive never been more proud of someone i dont know
Now she was the actual star of the Met Gala 🤩
Omg I so didn't recognize her when she was interviewing everyone. I legit thought she was some reporter for E!
The fact that I was nervous and excited with her for her shows how much I've been following her. So proud of what's to come
I LİTERALLY CRİED OMG SHE İS GODDESSS
Petition for Vogue for do an “Emma-ly in Paris” series 😂
ITS TIMOTHEEE
I could totally see her and timothée chalamet being a couple
loveeeee
she definitely said timothee chalamet i knew it
YESSSSS THE QUEEN HER SELF
literally so SO proud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
her whispering timothee chalamet at 1:52 is so cute
I LOVE HER, SHE DESERVED THIS SM
KILLED IT.
Proud moment! What a queen 👑
Love love her you killed it mama ❤✌🥰😍
Who is she and why do we care?
How can anyone not love her? She’s down-to-earth, friendly with absolutely everyone she interacts with, doesn’t get in any drama and works so hard… So proud of her
Am I a caveman for never heard of her?
WE KNOW IT'S TIM LMAO
I see a lot of people saying that they don't understand the "I don't have friends" thing. She probably said that in a way that she doesn't tell her things to everyone, just only her true closest family and friends.  So I wouldn't be offended if I was her closest friend and she said something like that. Sometimes we tend to said phrases in that sense letting people know not everyone is in the circle of friendship, and only the ones who knows us best would be aware of that type of comment.
She is so pretty 👑👑👑
I missed Liza
GORGEUS. STUNNING. WORDERFULL ❤️👑❤️👑💋✨💕💕
LEGEND I'M SO PROUD
Why am I crying watching this
I LOVE THIS WOMAN
I love Emma!
Emma really did that. Wow.
The makeup artist that did her makeup deserves an AWARD! 🤯🔥🔥🔥
I 1000% think that Emma’s worked hard and worked her way up and deserved to go to the Met. Plus she was doing interviews for Vogue at the Met and she was just amazing 😍
i adore emma
Something about Emma is so relaxing to watch. This isn’t even her video but her calm, collected personality still shines through.
I love herrrrrrrrrrr
She looks stunning. My favourite dress for the night. I definitely would want to wear something like this
Great choice in choosing Emma @vogue!! :)
why were any influencers there...
She literally killed it love her
Yess!!!!
i saw her at SOHO on Saturday shes amazing
Been watching her for 3-4 years now… im so proud of her
Loved her as an interviewer! She made everyone seem so comfortable
IM SO PROUD OF YOU BESTIE WTF YOUVE COME SO FARRRRRRRRRRRRRR
WE ALL KNOW ITS TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
LV did such an awesome job choosing Emma as their spokes person
Not miss Emma pulling more views then these celebrities. PERIOD 😌
We all know she said Timothee chalamet
I didn't know her, but I already loved her, she's so beautiful and so relaxed with everyone that she's interviewed by more people like that!
yes vogue now this is the type of content i want to see
she was talking about timothee chalamet
At the end I felt second hand anxiety for her going out there..hosting  interviews with everybody like it's happy little talk with besties🤣✨
They spent all this money and time on her and she was destroying everything wearing slippers the entire red carpet! Anyone else who could repeat the same question and give extremely fake reactions while being able to handle wearing shoes for an hour and half could be a better choice.
Me literally loving grimes
we stan emma chamberlain
She’s literally killing it
I’m proud of her she came a long way!
the yellow teeth 🤮
Legit gorgeous
She/he doesn't shower and represented gucci and is invited to met gala? Credibility, lost.
This is the first I've ever heard of Emma.
i'm so happy for her, she deserves the world, im glad everything went so good for her first time
LOVE HER SO HAPPY FOR HER
Happy to see Emma on top. One of the best dressed of the night.
I legit was smiling during this whole video. So proud of her! She looked stunning!

'oh wait i dont have friends' emmas so cute
Liza >>>>> Emma
GOD Emma...she's going places
Emma, you look fabuloussssss.
I'm so proud of her!! she did so well!!
Maybe the world wasn't ready for Emma and Timmy Tim to meet. But I feel in my heart they'll be good friends one day.
Does she really have no friends?
She better get an invite back
YES EMMA
girl! you look so daaaaaam good!

MI LINDA ES TAN HERMOSA
EMMA!!! SLAY!!!
My mom said me that the best gift that I can give to my Bff on her birthday  is to ask other people to subscribe to her channel Handcraft DIYs without her knowing so would you help me please
she whispered timothee chalamet
why are madonna taylor swift not invited to the met gala?
Only influencer who actually needs to be there
Honestly nearly all  the media people  are trying  to make  her happen. It's not going to happen
I Love how everyone loves her... I Love her so much.
She’s gorgeous!
She definitely whispered timothee chalamet
I’m so happy she went, she deserved it way more than Addison did to be honest
Timothee Chalamet
emma changend , i am happy for her but sad at the same time
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING
Her eye brows are insane 😍😍
Literally all of us Timothée Chalamet
She's living the Cinderella dream. And she did it all by herself! I'm so proud of you Emma!!
Queen Emma 💛....... Also, I think she said Timothée Chalamet! (but all her friends knew that) 💕
i just know emma whispered timothee chalamet
its definitely Timothée
For being a influencer, she really looks good, she understood the assignment
She did soo good, I feel lke a proud mother
I’m so prou…..no she was born to do this 😏
She’s looking sooooo good
it’s so obvious she whispered timmyyyyyyy lmaooo
QUEEENNNNNN
AY LA AMO SHES A QUEEN
It’s Timotheeee, it’s cool me too Emma, me  too
Love this look!! I did a reaction to the met gala on my channel and this was one of my all time favourites!!!!!
It’s definitely Tim
I'm so happy Emma was there!! I love her so much.🥰🥰 And she looks stunning as always!
*JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU AND CARES FOR YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY EVERYONE*
Why I feel like a proud mama 🥺
When Emma says she doesn't have friends😭😭😭
Timothee Chalamet, no doubt
she’s so perfect <3
I love how this feels like it could be on Emma chamberlain’s channel, she’s so authentic
the fact that she keeps saying that she has no friends must be hurtful to her actual friends
Proud is an understatement for me If I say I am proud of her.Watching her grow through all these years her doing morning photoshoots with her friend in San Fran,to her coachella times,to her road trips and all her personal success also the day to day things she overcomes and now to this.I am so happy for you girl 🥲❤️
im so proud of her, she deserves this so muchhh
Why tho?
She literally had no waist.
Emma is the only influencer that should ever go to things like this she’s the only influencer who has her own style
Shes so humble that that’s all she needs that’s what makes her beautiful and unique
I definitely had a full glam squad and a designer, custom made dress for my prom 😂 Hahaha I love Emma.
I just know she said Timothee chalamet HAHAHHA
miss girl said timothèe chalamettttt 😂

Dude Emma is like.... Very skinny. I know she's into being fit but I didn't even recognize her.
Emma’s dress looked amazing, I’m so proud of her

I mean no offense but het met gala look looks like the corpse bride..
SHE WAS EXCITED TO SEE TIMOTHEE CHALAMETTTTTTTTTTTTT… a real one would know😌😌😌
she's scarily thin. why are you promoting heroin chic again, vogue? this is irresponsible

IM SO PROUD OF HER PLS
3:05 her laugh 🥺🥺🥺 She's so adorable sometimes how is that she has no friends?!?!
I’m pretty sure she said Timothee Chalamet
2:38 emma wolfarian 🤣 but yess,that make up was everything 😍
„Literally whip it out“ u just got to love Emma
I LOVE HER, I'm gonna cry!!
I’m sorry but why was Addison Rae invited to the met?
I hope she got to meet Timmy
this still exists xd
It was beyond obvious that she mouthed Timothee Chalamet hahaha
She is STUNNING! Drop Dead GORGEOUS! 😍💫💋
Didn't you interview Billie eilish? Wanted to see that... or her get ready video or her dress video?!
I know that moment when she walked in was very awkward and stressed
I am so proud of her I’ve been watching her ever since she had under 100k subs 🥺👏🏽
I’ve never felt so proud of anyone’s accomplishments like I do for Emma’s. She really deserves it,
WE ALL KNOW SHE WANTED TO MEET TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
the way she was so grateful to go to met gala and she was so excited i love herrrr
She’s reaally matured, still love her vibe
I want to go to the met gala!
she definitely said timothee chalamet
She defo said Timothee chalamet
why won't "famous" people introduce themselves anymore? I have absolutely no clue who she is, I'll have to google her and then perhaps ill come back to this
Emma foi uma das melhores coisas desse met gala e ponto final!
she looks so beautiful
Walking skeleton. She is hosting interviews and she talks like a 5yo.
1:52 “Timothée chalamet” ??
I haven't watched her since 2018 and wow her voice and demeanor has changed. She sounds so clear and mature. I remember she use to have a raspy voice and would talk fast lol.
GOD I LOVE HER
She looks absolutely stunning. But who on earth is she?
YESSS EMMAAAA
i love that eye make up...tutorial please!
💯
I FEEL LIKE A PROUD MOM.

100% SHE SAYED TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
I am so proud of how far she has come!! I have been watching emma since 2016 maybe even earlier, so proud of you emma! Congrats!!
emma is litterally the sweetest, not many influencers deserved to be there but she definitely did!!
so so proud of her
She is very beautiful and lovely ❤️💋💋 i love it her dress is very beautiful and pretty✌🏻🌺👍🏻she is a girl very beautiful and cute with a beautiful voice and a face very pretty ✌🏻🌺👍🏻
Is it just me but Emma and Timothee look like brother and sister lowkey lol
PROUD
Ur lips said Timotheus chalameus so yea I'd be the same :》
we all know she said thimothee
she is THE MOMENT.
Stop, cause Emma Chamberlain being genuinely herself while getting ready is everything, plssss 😩💖
i missed liza
I'm sure she said "Timothée Chalamet"
I LOVE HER SO MUCH
It's literally celebrity prom
I´m so proud of this girl, I could cry    I did cry
im gonna cry rn
she’s so beautiful :’)
I love how everyone has collectively agreed on Emma being the perfect choice to do interviews 😂
Looking her at the end by the side make you realize she is borderline anorexic
everyone: I LOVE YOU EMMAAA  Emma: tHaNk yOuuu😝😝
i love her
emma chamberlain
Emma is GORGOUUUUUSSS!!!!!! LOVE💜💜💜💜IT!!!!!!! 😩😭😭
I absolutely love her and I’m genuinely so happy for her❤️ I’m so proud🥺
It's so obvious it's timothee!!! I would too🤭
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
I am so incredible proud of her of what she reached. Honestly it’s SO CRAZY to think about. I love her so much and wish her THE BEST!
Who was the makeup artist? She did an amizing job! You looked so beautiful!
Her hair don’t look good at all cause her diet and nutrition sucks but being unhealthy seems the only thing fashion people envision for women, cause they are haters so they choose always this type of women to represent themselves at best! This industry is self districting and try to bring with it people and the planet
emma's good...but i liked liza koshy betttttterrrrr
i was waiting for when u released a video like this
the emily comment made me smile aahhaha
everybody knows that the real answer is timothy chamlee lmao
I’m on a Emma Met Gala Marathon right now ❤️
She literally transferred her channel to Vogue at this point.
I want Emma and Doja Cat to be friends and hangout
I just KNOWWW she whispered “Timothee Chalamet”
Omg im just in love whit how emma perform as an interwier, she did it greate
so proud of her uhhhhhh <3
She literally has a model build and a model face, like no wonder Vogue loves her and Louis Vuitton loves her she is genuinely gorgeous and so kind... she deserves all the clout!
The 60s inspired look suits Emma well.  I hope that she continues wearing Mid-Century threads and makes it a trend.
well….. at least she showered…
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
Almost all the celebs she interviewed complimented something about her look. Whether it was her eyeliner, eye makeup, or her look. Everyone was looking at her dress.
i am So proud of her
literal queen of the entire internet
„I don‘t want to see it, until it‘s done.“  Checks in the mirror three seconds later.
She doesn't really seem that genuine
Who is Emma Chamberlain?
I’m soo proud of Emma 🥺she is doing amazinggg and she looks stunninggggggg😍😩the dress is a dream✨❤️
this was emma's met gala
Beautiful and I think she said Timothee....haha
Why,  Vogue ? Why?
Emma Chamberlain flying an experimental NASA X-Plane to over Mach 15
she definitely said timothee chalamet
what did she mean by grimes being a PR answer?
IM SO PROUD OF HER
Out of all people grimes…. Especially what she’s been showing the public no thanks
"Nobody would know."  Literally all of us: It's Timothee Chalamet.  She even mouthed it lol  edit: mom i'm famous
I swear she whispered that she is excited to meet Timothée
Okay, but she totally mouthed Timothee Chalamet based off of her movements, and honestly WHO WOULDN'T.
Was the real answer…  Timotheeeeeeeeee??! Teehee Either way Emma killed the look and the interviews ✨💕.
She looks absolutely breathtaking
my favourite i love her energy! Better have her next year too⚡😌
Beautiful girl, so proud of her
who asked for this ?
Se ve preciosa! La amooo! <3
we know the real answer of who she want to see is... Timothee Chalamet
Emma has nothing different to offer than the girls that I went to highschool with
okay her dress is absolutely beautiful
Top three favorite things for Emma to say (no specific order)  you-know-what-I-mean  just-like  genuinely
is this woman a star? I have never heard of her... And she appeared on my recommended videos...
the way she looked better than some of the a list celebrities is a flex and proves how she should be the only influencer invited to the met
I cry by the fact that she went to the metgala she deserve it i love u emma <3
I love her so much you guys don’t understand
Y'all don't understand I AM OBSESSE WITH THIS LOOK , THE WAY SHE TALK , HER JUST HAVING FUN AND BEING HERSELF I THINK I AM IN LOVE
You look sensational!!
She looked amazing, and I don't particularly think of her when it comes to fashion girl
IM SO HAPPY FOR HER 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Her dress was so gorgeous, I wish Louis Vuitton had it for sale!!!!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HER⚡️
I can’t believe the fact that she was just a sixteen year old who used to drive around for fun and had a caffeine addiction and that now she’s the most loved person on youtube
we all know emma said timothee
she killed it love you emma !!!
No prom, only Met Gala :)
It was definitely Timothee Chalamet the celebrity Emma was most excited to see. Me too Emma, me too

She seems really cool but I wish she would stop being like “I don’t have friends” all the time because she does. She acts like she literally has no one to hang out with or talk to and that’s bs
1:55 definitely timothe chalamet

Emma saying she thinks grimes is a genius is so hilarious
She said: timothee chalamet

She obvs wants to meet Timothee chalamet
She doesn't have friends.😳 Who are those fools who didn't consider her to be her friend?
I know for a fact that Emma was talking about Timothee chalamet😉😉
I’m so glad Emma can exist without people hating her for no reason. She loooked AMAZING at the MET. she made everyone comfortable during the interviews & killed it!!! ❤️❤️
Emma I f love youuuuuuu

She looked stunning
She whispered timothee chalamet
im so proud of her
BEST CHOICE EVER
I mistakenly thought the makeup artist was Nikkie tutorials 🤣
Cute girl, amazing dress.  Too bad she had to be at that spoiled brat fest.
Who is she
she looks so perfect.. literally a real life doll.
Miss Emma Chamberlain everyone….🥺
soooo goood.
She said timothee chalamet lmao
I have a feeling it was timothee chalamet 😂
She is such a naturally attractive person. ❤️
The spontaneity hehe lovely⭐
2:07 that’s why our generation relates so much with her. we love you, emma!
Emma, you made it girl❤️So proud!
HEY BESTIEEEEE
Who tf invited her

I love emma
1:55 i heard Machine Gun Kelly 😳😂
The unequaled stool geographically check because processing gradually plan lest a slow larch. misty, ethereal fang
love you emma , you deserve this so much 🤍🤍🤍
A QUEEN 👸🏼😢
*WHY*
I don't get the whole thing of screaming your head of for these people. They are not heros, they are not superhumans they are not special!!! Stop worshipping celebrities.
So extremely proud of her,she's come so far by simply being herself.
The screams when she got out of the car don’t match people they camera panned to…. At all lol. she absolutely looks beautiful. Her glam team is 10/10
Emma did amazing!! I’m so proud of her
That " i dont have friends tho it broke my heart idk
I feel like im watching my little sister grow up... no u are crying. So proud of you Emma !
She said timothee chalamet
Emma has been working with the fashion industry for the past couple of years now, specifically Louis Vuitton. nobody should be mad at her. if anything, Dixie and Addison made the Met Gala embarrassing because they’re only known for moving their bodies and creating music along with acting.
i don't have friends? and Olivia???
Who is she???
hehe she's excited to see timothée 😌🤚🏽
Emma ✨✨✨🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
SHE DEFFO SAID TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
Beautiful... ❤️❤️❤️😍
Everyone probably clicked this immediately seeing this in their feed lol
Happiness family's too mamji
1:52 TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
Where does she appear
I was very sad that Kylie didn't go to the met gala
woooooooooooooow
She totally deserves this. I love her so much lol 💚
WHEN EMMA MET KACEY MUSGRAVES HER IDOL. THE END OF HER VOGUE INTERVIEW WITH KACEY WAS ICONIC
I genuinely love Emma ❤️
I literally fuc*ing love this for her. You’re kidding
Met gala, emma’s ✨prom✨
I didnt like her that much as a interviewer. All she said was "thats so good" "give me advice" then she rushed the not so big celebrities like Chloe & Halle. Meh

Emma, you look like a dream
1:52 : Timothée Chalamet
Emmas prim experience=✨met gala✨
I SWEAR TO GOD SHE SAID Timothee chalamet and same emma same
The fact that emma’s channel has more than vouge itself is mind blowing and says A LOT
Why am I so nervous for her like she's my little sister. So beautiful.
she looked too basic for met gala
She's so absolutely beautiful
Omg. Immaculate.
She looks GORGEOUS!
i love her so much omg
Emma I don’t know if you read these posts but I hope so.  Please for your own good DO NOT become a member of the Hollywood “beast system”!

Her eye shadow is everything
I’m so happy for all this Emma content

Who is she?
Idk why ppl are mad she went or got invited when she works with Louis Vuitton that’s a fashion brand and she has been for a while , I don’t think some influencers should have went but Emma I think she deserve it bc she is literally face of Louis Vuitton
Emma did a great job at interviewing everyone. WHAT A FLEX
People hate that emma is invited when they aren't even invited in small parties lmao
Her fingers be looking SO long 😂
she makes me uncomfortable
❤️❤️❤️😭🥲
Only 00:27 in and someone's already messed up the audio for the edit!
SHE IS STUNNING WOW
Deffo excited to see Timothee
does anyone else reminds her of Lily Rose Depp in this video? especially with the makeup and dress
Her eyes are so blue that even white walkers cant stand it
Emma didn't go to prom, she went to the Met Gala. We so proud of her

Everything about this is phenomenal. Her outfit, her attitude, her friendliness; they couldn’t have picked a more suitable influencer! 💕

the contrast of who has to wear a mask and who doesnt is as clear as day
…..but like, anyone else curious who she was ACTUALLY excited to meet at the Met?! 👀😂
"Wait, i don't have friends" 😂
she for sure said timothee chalamet
why am I crying??? like a mother watching her daughter leave on her first day of kindergarten???
so proud of emma <3
I’ve never seen her before but i love her energy 🌷💖 For me she is the best dressed by the way! 💭
Emily Chamberlain is good soup
"wait I don't have friends", the most relatable stuff here.
Emma and Timothee look like siblings
so they inviting just about anybody to the met gala?? :/
she has literally MADE IT. queen deserves to be there.
Did anyone else hear that she said Timothée Chalamet 1:55
Why is she not wearing a mask? Irresponsible chic.
Does she get to keep the dress?
who?
EXCELLENT FEATURE!!!! Emma embodies the modern young woman. She looks INCREDIBLE
I'm proud of her.
emma: i have zero friends also Emma interview w/everyone and everybody is friendly with her
😍😍😍😍
Priming it up for the Met - Timothee, this little girl, et al. Seriously what are these people now ,12 .
Wow she look so beautiful. I didn’t even recognize her.

ROSE BLACKPINK?
Emily you looked wonderful!!
TIMOTHY CHALAMET
Early
Honestly one of the best dressed of the night, she deserves everything.
1:51 definitely said  Kendall Jenner
You are the best ❤ Also you look so pretty...  I luv your interview with Kendal
QUEEN
something about all of this is just so emotional…. we’ve grown alongside her every step of the way. so to see her here and doing all those interviews has just all been the most wholesome, most sweetest thing i’ve personally seen in so long :’)  not to mention what a success her interviews and *STUNNING* her look was
Let’s not lie Emma was the only influencer we wanted at the met Hakka she stayed and understood the assignment unlike people like miss Addison Rae.
BEENNN waiting for a new one of these PLS never stop this
Emma’s interviews on the carpet were TOP TIER ✨ Seriously the perfect mix of young relatability, humor and yet high fashion elegance. SO PROUD EMMA!

Honestly, not many people pull off the met gala. EMMA DID IT HER FIRST ONE. Excited to see her look next year! The dress was gorgeous but she really made the dress pop as well! Anyone can wear a look but it takes a lot to BE THE LOOK.
A smoky eye is a dream on her

SHE SERVEDDDD
1:53 we know it was timothee chalamet bb
Her hair looked horrid during the met interviews, it was splitting by her ears, it looked like it was coming undone, she should have gone for a low but with a split on the middle, or a low slick pony
Emma: I don’t have friends Olivia and Amanda: 😶
No hate or anything but I don't get the hype that she has like she's just a normal person
Literally one of the best dressed there- make up was everything!!!!
Who?
i swear she said Timothee Chalamet
Emma looked absolutely stunning in that dress and I'm so proud of her for doing all those interviews in heels 😭😍

She definitely said Timothee. I'm going with that answer idc 😂😂
Yasssssssssssss Queen!
Emma did so amazing with EVERYTHING … what an icon , seriously !!! 💗💗
I'm curious as to what is the actual glam convo like. I'd love to hear the R rated version.
Mmmmm... maybe her eyebrows need a new shape 😬

She totally looks like maggie Gyllenhaal
I don't have friends :)))
She looked really good for her first met, I’m so proud of her.
