9:36 excuse me?!?! I love the combination :0
I think the “ banana “ nail polish should be named “ banana ounana “ 😂😂
“Holo Taco” no longer registers as a phrase in my mind 😂
zylers color is BEAUTIFUL bro
This video is so wholesome <3. I found Holo Taco because a friend recommended it to me. I fell in love with the brand and when I saw these 2 shades I knew I had to have them... Then I found this video and it made me extra happy to have ordered them.
ngl, love me some baby pink
This was the most random video I’ve ever seen lol
Look at her smiling like a pround mama haha  That donation ♥️♥️
This video will be always a remind of why the boxes are limited eddition 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
picked up zyler today 💞💞
Does this happen to anyone else where I apply the Holo Taco “long lasting base coat” but in a few days like 5-8, the nail polish pops off. It behaves exactly like the Holo Taco “peel off base coat” so I wonder if they got mislabeled or I get sent a faulty set?
🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮 TOCO🌮🌮🌮😋nope HOLO TOCO
Please try TUOSHI NP10 3d Intelligent Nail Printer Machine
There the boss of you but your there mom. 😂🤨
You should be proud because they landed in holo
All animals are amazing no matter dog or cat or whatever animal that are around.
2:39 i can clearly see dr.coco, Dundun and TT 🥰🥰🥰 i never imagined i'll see their thumbnail here. Adorable cats. Check their channel too its wholesome, goodvibes.  I love how tyler jumps when he saw the treats 🥰🥰 i respect hoomans who loves their cats 🥰🥰
you should make jeyyyn polish in either her favorite color or her lest favorite color
"These hoomans 'pect me to jump over this mess???!!!   I don't fink so!"  *proceeds to knock down polish.  "You're welcome!"
Is your favorite color gray
Sadly, I’m looking at the unicorn skin boxes and am like… I need you!! I missed out on the first round :( :,(
Please get more merch that gives $ to cat charities! I love kitties 💕 😻💖 More Zyler and Menchie, too!
Menchie: Doesn't jump over 8 bottles height of nail polish. Also Menchie : Literally jump onto Beyyyn's shoulder while standing .(instagram highlights)
Poor menchie didnt get any treats
Cristine saying 'What the fuck man' to Zyler when he tries to nom her is HILARIOUS
The clever tramp cytochemically influence because faucet reassembly wait behind a festive connection. lamentable, snotty mountain
Zyler is such an intelligent young man
i don't know why people would dislike on this viseo! she's so guudd and im from 2021
I'm sorry but 13$ for a some nail polish? That's over priced and should be much cheaper.
menchie’s polish is the best polish i have. it’s so easy to apply for a lovely glitter look and is also super nice to use when doing nail art. this is a major win for Holo Taco!
Cloud you do Ben  holo nila polish?
You should make a channel for your cats
Idk what she's talking about, but i really liked Menchie and Zyler shades together
Holowiin
did i just saw kittisaurus on a simply nailogical video at 2:40? IM SO PROUD OF THEM FOR BEING APART OF A FAMOUS CHANNEL
7:26 I wheezed 😭
christene is the the one person that can still rock cat ears like a BoSs
Menchie’s a little slow she’s so cute so it makes up for it 😆
Watching this video reminded me of the day me and my husband adopted or first dog Bella I spend my free time helping at shelters for animals
Zyler doing all the work:  Menchie: iT’s NoT a PrObLeM aNyMoRe
She has gonna old now
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE BABY PICTURE OF MENCHIE!!! SHES SO CUTE!!
Did anyone else notice that she had the Menchie polish on her left hand and the zyler Polish on her right                                       At LeAsT i ThInK   Directions hard understand
Pink looks so good on simply!!! It goes so well with her skin tone and the nails just pop! 🤩
Zyler is like a teen, only comes when where is fooooodd
Simply: Menchie you're smarter than this! Menchie: Yes, yes I am
I don't wear nail polish but I want the kitty nail polish! Menchie and Zyler are so cute!
Everyone just take a second to appreciate Cristine. She has 3 youtube channels, a podcast, her own brand, and a day job. Give her some love. Lots of it.
Cristine should google her cats age in human years and film her reaction
Lol
Jjjjjj
This was uploaded on my besties birthday just something that I noticed
Is there any way besides e-bay I can buy the older collection boxes from you?? I was finally not broke the last couple of collections and was able to buy them while the boxes were still available and then went to Ebay for the empty multichrome box, but I just can't justify buying the rainbow box for $300. Lol!
Cristine: How much collection boxes can my cat jump over? me: *sees menchie from the back* also me: well, hi menchie
I was today years old. Menchie is female
Ok I was scrolling and I saw a testing simply nailogicals holiday vid and the said.      “ this polish is not real holo” I was so MADD cristiene is dis true ? I hope not can someone please tell me
11:25 is perfeshom
I feel like people love menchie more somewhat, I feel bad for zyler. still, I love both. xoxo
I have Menchie on my nails right now, it’s such a pretty color!!!
Not to be dramatic but I would literally die for Zyler😩❤️
h
She needs to make a nail polish called “BEYYYYYYYNNNN”
Wait it can5 have been 5 months  already!
wait i just Realized that these 2 polishes match my Kids ( cats ) perfectly I have two kittens ( they'll be 5 months old in a week ) and my cat sunny is a ginger cat like Zyler and my other cat ash is black and white with a pink nose like menchie ( and sunny has a pink nose but you get the point ) I would wear these colors alll the time just for them
I got a kitten 2 days ago and she is 8 weeks old and is called felicity. And I wanted to get another one to call her Cristine or Chris but I was not allowed.
Cristine what peel of base coat do u use
holo*
cristine, i need a MATTE shade of nail polish, like the one u made with safiyaa in a vid 👀👀
what breeds are menchie and zyler :(
I was a dog person but menchie made me a dog and cat person 🐶🐱🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🐈🐈
What if the frozen yogurt place Menchie was named after  copyrights all these things you've been naming after your cat 👀
SO that’s why those colors are in ur intro that makes sence!
Zyler went after menchir
2.41 kittisaurus 💗💗💖💖💖💗🐈🤭
"and it turns amber" Americans: *forgets the USA is not the only country*
They don’t want to jump cause your watching and they’re trying to hide their talents. Lol
Menchie: I go first  Zyler: Why??  Menchie: BECAUSE IM A LADY THATS WHY
Cristine: i'm not a huge fan of pink also Cristine: includes a pink shade (sometimes two) in basically every collection
7:32  *Damn zyler snatched that treat like it’s no ones business* 😂😂
6:50 false I do American Ninja Warrior and they don’t make anything shorter/easier for the women or shorter people😭
I think Zyler did this better because he's more food driven. Lol
QUALITY 👏🏼 CONTENT 👏🏼
Do Canadians not call it a yellow light on traffic lights?? ✨amber✨
I live the bisexual box i dont think that was intentional but yay
I love Zeiler's and Menchie's nail polish because we do not have favorites.i to have the Feline animal known as the cat. I have 3. I hope you get more.all hail the cats
I LOVE YOU CATS
This is how animals should be treated online
Try and make a Maze and make Them come to you, that would be so cool🤩
Cristine always warms my heart whenever she talks 💓
So here I am recovering from the world's virus. I am laughing so hard that in coughing.  This is amazing.
7:38 👁 👄 👁
PEELY BASE POLISH MOUNTAIN PLEASE
Album career:  In December 2005, Karanfilovska said she had never watched 2006.
Does anyone know if aportion of the sales still being donated to the charity?
I'm not a fan of pink like I hate pink but menchies polish I love it
Zyler was helping menchie out by taking some boxes off 😂
Cats:jump on counters  Cats now: don't jump over the nail polish when they can jump on counters  Poor menchie
I love how Ben loves the cats and he treats them so good and he's still good cat dad and he's allergic to them
I can't say the word treat my dogs go crazy and then want one then they will stare at u forever until u give them one
😂😂😂😂 I think they did good
I know I'm getting the kitties set for Christmas and I can not wait to use them!!!! 😻
Shout out to Zylar for helping your sister and knocking the boxes down LMAO
Her kitty kids
Wait you call yellow lights amber lights
they both are so cute
7:27
7:03
zyler reminds me of peach ... completely food driven
Whenever menchie comes on screen my boy cat, Rascal, purrs and leans up on the screen
I’m sorry, I’m still stuck on you describing the traffic light color as amber... are Canadian stop lights different from US?
I am anxiously waiting on my cat holo to come in the mail!
Hi! So my family might adopt a cat, but we’ve never had one before. Is there anything that u can tell me that you have learned about your cats that might help potty train, be friendly, etc. it would rlly help!
Damn lower the damn microphone!!!!
This video was posted 3 months ago... why haven’t I seen it on her channel at all?
WAIT YOU LIVE IN OTTAWA HCHRNSHED WE ARE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AHH
My cat has a polish from you OnE coAT bLaCk
Ummmm that don’t look like a kitty cat
I’m watching this video so I can forget that trump is going to win re-election...
I just ordered the Zyler the Cat polish, long lasting base, super glossy taco, and protective peel💕😻
I think people start with one row then go up from there. But this is super wholesome content. Thank you for nothing to do with  WAP!
Hm, it would have been interesting to see these new versions compared to the old versions, but I'm guessing that for legal reasons she might not have been able to do that, which is understandable I guess.
I will be sure to get them both
So cute
I love this! You should do more videos with just your cats
Why dont you do a video about filling a nailpolish with as much holo as possible (btw love your videos you inspire me so much)
is it me or the menchie shade is lavender than baby pink??
Don't know why this matter but my mom bought us a holo shower curtin...showering in style
crying that i live in the u and want them sooo bad
Holy crap I just commented the other day on the rainbow video that I wanted a restock and now I’m seeing this video where there is a restock of the rainbow collection !! Going to go spend all my money now
99 bottles of polish on the wall 99 bottles of polish take one pass it around 98 bottles of polish on the wall
I should make a BeEeEeEn nail polish
You have to make one for binnnnnn in a banana shade
"who wants some close ups of menchi and zayler? " 😀 "the nail polishs not the cats" **le disappointment**
PLEASE WHERE IS YOUR SUPER COOL TRY DYE SWEATER FROM????🤍🤍🤞🏼🤞🏼💫💫💫
Hold on your traffic lights turn amber??
I love how she does such random stuff but finds a way to include nail polish in it
I hope you do a holoween collection next year with a black holo glitter 👀🖤
Hi
Raise your hand if your parents got an email saying that their kid was failing a class but not saying what class they were failing and none of the child’s teachers said ANYTHING about them failing OR emailing the parents about what class they were failing and now the report cards are only 2 days away and you might get kicked from one of your classes but the school is so lazy that they don’t even bother to say which FUCKING class it was and if they did this situation would never would have happened...🤚 (end my suffering)
hers is better XD
My cats on your nails!!     Me : yeah sounds about right
1 like = 1 treat for menchi💞💞
You should mix all your holo tacos together
I've worn Zyler's pumpkin twice already and it is so perfect for times right now. :)
Then why don't you have a dog if you like to support your animals if you adopted a cat won't you adopt a dog
Cristine should make a one coat holo nail polish.
"together... They make a kitty cat" 😂😂😂😂😂 yaaassss ur the most relatable person on the planet. Ur so excited about that. U sound like i would if i was doin the same thing 😂
Hey Cristine, how does it feel to be the only YouTuber that I don’t skip ads on? 😃
menchie really said "work smart, not hard"
Zyler cracks me up😂
Do you watch big brother????
Wait I’m confused is the nail polish for cats too lol???
My girlfriend was amazing and bought me machine the cat for my birthday (and a glass nail file) but then it drove me crazy I didnt have the zyler one roo so I just bought that along with all the unicorn skins and peely base
I tried to do this myself when I was younger and I’ve never jumped over anything ever again
Someone should paint there cat's nails menchi or zyler
My boyfriend told me he's getting me the one year anniversary box for Christmas today. I'm thinking I should put a ring on it.
I just bought these and I’m so happy and excited! I’m going to wear the orange non stop for fall and lavender during winter. They are the PERFECT colors
Note to self: dont watch this at 4 in the morning because you will laugh too hard and wake up your family.
where is the black holo???
Zyler is ~rambunctious~
*Nah I'm still here* 😅💜  **I've seen videos of people putting cups throughout the hallway of their houses and had their cats ninjally walk through them all so you could use nail polish instead** 💅🐈  *Catlogical*
7:08 zylers like "ill help my sister"
It’s not fair that zyler is more graceful than me
This video made me laugh after a long time i didn't
( 4:29 ) lmao why is ben climbing out of a "window"(?)
I would get the polish to saport the pets mart but i do competitive gymnastics so if you get hurt and lose air circulation your nails will turn purple so i cant wair nail polish
CATS + NAILPOLISH =     THE BEST VIDEO EVER!!!!
your a good cat mom
Zyler trying to help menchi jump knocks down few boxes
I love your holo taco line but way too expensive 😭 my life is miserable for that😢
Who else is watching 30 min before the multicrome launch
why do i feel like my personality is z;ylers nail polish
I was wanting to do an ace nail thing do you have any advice
Why does your nail polish cost so much?
4:32 wild Ben spotted in the background
Zyler: knocks down two boxes, I want to help my sister
You should make a holoween collection
Toilet paper challenge          With a twist
T-r-e-a-t-s  “I CAN SPELL MOM”
Zender tri to merder menchi
🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁
i have the old ones
cats can jump up to 6x their height
Is it just me or does everyone watch Simply Nailogical with their cats?
BRO I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH INDIVIDUAL POLISHES ARE! IM DEF GETTING THE RED ONE
We want 100 layers of holo taco.❤👀
This is to cute
I actually really like the menchie and zyler polishes together
You should randomly choose what to do on your nails based on stock photos images
Hey Christine. I made a video of me doing my nails. https://youtu.be/G-pjNHTnn7k is there any tips you can give me to do better😭😭
I got holo taco 🌮 peely base💅🏻
You know what I love about cristine is that she has not changed one bit since I’ve been watching her. So probably since 2015 and even thru different things like putting out her own nail polish and stuff I was expecting much change in not just the channel but in cristine herself. And that is not what happened and I absolutely love her for that even getting a bunch of subs and stuff she still stayed the same and I love her and the channel❤️
Please come out with a bright and light pink holo taco!! 😍 I need that in my life!!
Amber??
This is so incredibly stupid...         I LOVE IT
Me reading the title: ok, WHO GAVE CRISTINE THE BOXES.
remember when she didn't know what tiktok was
Ok but they look really cute together
Ok but what is zyler smarter I always thought of him as the less intelligent of the two
Not intending to be too personal,sorry if it appears so.. but did any of ur cats every had kittens, like do u have any grandkids, of either of them??
I need the Zyler polish immediately
I need a banana ben yellow
This is hilarious, I love when menchie just pushes the door open and goes in between the door and the wall and then they knock over the boxes, almost looks like they purposely knock them over!! They are so cute
When zyler pushed some of the boxes down to help his sister get over I nearly cried that’s adorable 😭❤️
I realy want to buy it but im from vietnam 👁👄👁💦
I’ve been looking around for this polish because I love baby pink but I couldn’t find it anywhere! I was hoping you would recreate it and you did !!
A holo taco mountain?
why did ben just walk through the wall at 4:29
I wonder if they’re both mixed together, if they would look similar to play rosé 🤔🤔
I would love you to make gel versions of your polishes, who's with me?
Can anyone agree that she should make a brown glitter polish called "Where's my tea?"
did cristine just call the orange light on stop lights “amber”?
Anyone else can’t stop thinking about the concept of traffic lights being amber/ embre(?)
OOO! I have an idea!  If you have a cat cut out somewhat of the same one as the new polishes box's, you can alternate the orange and the baby pink in that pattern! It would be a collaboration of both the colors instead of just using one! So no worries if they think the other child is the favorite!
This is giving me huge inspirational vibes to do a nail-art manicure based on my own pets. My golden-yellow, long hair chihuahua w/ some light sparkles to match her sparkling personality (the light colors in her fur, -maybe even some tiny black stripes to reflect the ones on her tail & her butterfly ears-  she’s a chi-papillon mix 🦋) & a sleek, sexy black To represent my beautiful boy cat who is a DSH black cat but his fur is so velvet & shiny he literally shines.  😱, so inspired. Merci bien Cristine. 👩🏼‍🎨
These are so beautiful. This was so fun. I agree my cats jump up really high when they think I'm not watching them.💚
Still waiting for those chocolate chip cookies and cream overnight oats... 😁😂
I can’t wait till Cris gets abandoned to a island and finds a coconut into a cat
The one thing I got from this was that she called the yellow light “amber”. I have never heard that before! Is that Canadian and yellow is American. Or is that just me.. lol!
I would two of each so one is meant box other is for nails that mwah just so beautiful
I recently watched a Threadbanger vid where Corinne cooks with Robs hands. You and Ben should do this!!
amber light? not yellow or orange?
Can you play dead in front of your cats to see how their reactions? (I mostly wanna see Zyler's lol).
I fucking cackled when Zyler stole Menchie’s treat.
Play fnaf
Will there be a silver linear holo? You’ve said yourself it’s a staple and I am waiting😔
This may sound a bit sappy but when my dad was diagnosed with cancer, it was rough and your videos were the only thing that could make me laugh out loud.  I'm sure you won't see this but if you do, I love your videos and thanks for making them!!!!  :)
I haven’t seen ur channel in so long😭😭😭😭😭
How are you? Now? How is your Inflammation?
I actually really enjoy the colors mixed. Very faux 60s hippie flower child vibes
Cristine needs to come out with a holo yellow polish called “yellow nails don’t matter”
You should try to put on your Pelee’s again on your fingers like your old ones stupid right love ya lol
I think it's adorable that the cats have a polish to themselves
My cat came running as I played this video.
I have to disagree: if you combined them with not milky white, they could make sort of a lesbian flag and it makes them a perfect match for each other! Menchie and Zyler said lesbian rights uwu
These cat polishes were made 4 years ago in a collab with Starrily, a Live Love Polish brand.

menchie's is so cute.... its a soft almost-lavender pink, A+
The savage energy from zyler is immaculate
I am from India, where Holo taco is not deliverable😒...but I finally got my first holographic nail polish from another brand, n I constantly feel like eating my pink Holo candy nails...
me: WOW i want that! *goes to mom* "mom, can i PLEASE get these?" my mom: "you can get those at Shoppers." me: NO YOU CAN'T YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BEING HOLOSEXUAL."
*No nail polish was hurt in the process of making this video*
What! Catitude is a real thing  Me going full speed to tell my sister I am not crazy ( mostly )
I just watched Safs video of pour art and I think you should do a video of art pour in your nails
Menchi is a lazy bean
2016-2019 Zyler(in french-ish accent): *everyone forgets me.... they only remember my sister...* Zyler now: I AM BEST KAT-
They chunkyyyy
I love to try holo taco in my ART 🖼
I love to try
zyler reminds me of my orange boy who left me too young from a stoke. 💔 i absolutely adore every video he decides to make an appearance in. petition to add more cat treats to videos for zyler cameos?? and menchie is the sweetest little button, so affectionate! i love these cats, which is why i instantly bought both polishes together. ❤❤❤
Zyler that was AMAZING😁😂😁😁👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
simply: new collection!! me: oooooo yes simply on every new nail polish line: *wastes a bunch on polish* me: simply: me: simply: me: *angry cuz theres so much polish being dumped out* also me: *still loves the videos*
I haven’t painted my nails for years but I never miss any of your videos! I love your sincerity and humor♥️ Lots of love from Turkey🥰
my cats usually jump onto my bunk bed but when I tried to do something similar to this the could barely make it 🗿
I don’t wear nail polish but that black with Zyler over it is so gorgeous!
I just got my menchie the cat for some reason I feel like I have diamonds on my nail of how shiny they are
Hey cristine why aren't you shipping your products to india pls start shipping to india also
Your nail polish is some of the best that I have ever used, and it makes me so happy every time that you come out with new polishes because I love being able to support your business. You are 100% the reason that I got into nail polish in the first place when I was younger. Thank you so much for all the work that you do in making amazing nail polishes for a good price because it is absolutely amazing.
I’m bout to buy themm 🥰🥰
The light turns amber????
My daughter just bought me my own Menchie The Cat holo Taco polish. I wanted to tell you I love it ...Thank you for making a great brand of polish...
Hey Cristine i would love to see these new designs i've seen pop up online using iridescent cellophane material. it gives a shattered holographic glass appearance.  p.s. i love your YT channel and work.  *hopefully you see this and obviously will slay it with the beautiful nail art.
im sad bc i started school and they don't let me wear nail polish I had holo toco nail for a month and know I hade to take it offf
Christine you should do another testing kiss toys. “Also I want her to do Klutz make your own mini erasers”
Wow Christine! Your voice has changed drastically! Btw I LOVE UR VIDEOS
I’m wearing Menchie right now💕 It’s so cute and I wish it wasn’t overcast outside, but it’s still good in the shade! Also, shipping was so fast!
rip my eardrums ouch
Me: aww cute but I don’t paint my nails so I don’t want- Cristine: and together they make a kitty cat Me: *i have a MIGHTY NEED*
Once I heard about the cat polish I had to get it, but now we need a Christine and Ben polish.... Perhaps a banana polish color for Ben?!
Cristine I absolutely love your YouTube channel. Been watching this for 4 years and im happy that I’ve found you because it always makes me laugh and smile. Even on bad days. Your energy is uplifting and honest and can’t thank you enough for the joy you spread. Love you lots. ❤️😸  I like when people donate to help animals. I don’t feel like people do this enough given how many animals there are in this world. Please keep buying her nail polishes this is a wonderful thing and you’ll get beautiful nail polish that’s made with love. ❤️❤️
YESSS, I'VE BEEN DYIIING FOR THE RETURN OF THE ZYLER POLIIISH! (Not sure if I'll be buying any time soon but I'm interested!) I LOVE these upgrades!
I’m not the biggest fan of PetSmart and how they conduct themselves so unfortunately I’m going to have to skip out on this one chief.
you should give some of the money to shelters instead because petsmart doesn't treat their animals right, also they have thrown live animals away before :/
My spirit animal is Xyler
OMG I JUST WON THE LOTTERY      Well according to christine on bitmoji story’s
You should try sfx makeup    Please help me make her see this
Instead of "Hallelujah" it's "Holollujah"  Idk if that's a thing already but oh well lol
Me
Cristine: Come on, jump!! Menchie: wait how do I get over there? Zyler: don't worry! I got ya! *5:14* 💅😂💅😂💅😂
Any new holosexuals notice holo EVERYWHERE ? 💿💫💫✨😌
Cristine: when you hesitate cuz the traffic stop turns amber me: I go when the traffic LiGhT turns yElLOw
pleaaase remake black holo witch !!!
aight i caved and bought the menchie polish
Who wants to see Cristine make a gradient between Menchie, Play Rosé, and Zyler?
Plz do fiber glass nails 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Have you seen the “tooth brush nails” fake nail trend? Whenever your feeling better id love to see your take on it
Idea:  Simplynailogical should make her own HOLO nail powders ...
I love them both but can't help but think her cats are a bit overweight
The intro made me respect you even more than I already did! Unproblematic qween
I want 100 coats of peely base. 😬😬
never have I seen zyler be the centre of attention and the favourite child for 5 minutes straight until I watched this video 😻🧍🏼‍♀️
SHES LIVIN IN A WORLD AND ITS ALL HOLOOOOOOO
I got an ad for gel nail polish. Oh how wrong they are...
wait do you watch canada big brother or us? bc i love big brother
This is the Jenna Marbles energy the Internet needs right now
Zyler is *T H I C C*
i just bought your nail polish! i'm so excited to have menchie and zyler on my nails 😻😹
Me, a crazy cat lady NEEDING the Menchie/Zyler duo...until I realise it’s over $40 AUD in shipping to send two nail polish bottles ☠️☠️☠️
I was about to pay for my own cat nail polishes and then i saw the damn shipping of 30 dollar and my coupon code doesnt work :(( fuckin hate living in the Middle East man
Can i buy holo taco in tunasia?
I’d love to see a gradient of the cat polishes + Play Rosé
Does anyone think that she should react/try to recreate one of or a couple of molly moo nails
It turns amber? wat
Thank you for this! 💕
i appreciate the fact that simply's video style hasn't changed at all since i last came to this channel
Amber light sound so cute... now yellow will seem so boring. Although coming from a place with amber as one of the things we have  lot of, I really can't see the color resemblance with yellow traffi  light 😄
I’d love to buy the holocats nail polishes, but unfortunately you don’t ship to Italy...
3:04 “Because they are the boss of me” I can relate so much with my two cats haha 😂
I know Christine is probably not going to see this but I have a serious question? How much does your cats weigh? They are thicc.
Just ordered a Menchie the cat nail polish (sorry Zyler, I'm just not a big fan of orange ☹️ but I love you too!❤️) I'm in the UK though so gonna have to wait 10-14 days, kinda long but excited ☺️💕
I found this so I wanted to put on one of the holo queen’s vids http://www.youtube.com/w/NIuUs_TodC4
1 like =1 theat for menchie
*Cristine stacks Holo boxes in the center*  Menchie: *sneaks through side gaps* HACKS
make a polish named ben and cristine
I NEED A CAT
me: * watching the video *  my cat:          *"TrEAtS?"* * clamoring over to my computer after hearing the bag shaking in the video *
YES MA’AM!
Who else thought menchie was a boy
She said don’t pick a favorite but let’s be real that Zyler shade is EVERYTHING 😍😍😍
My favorite colors are rusted orange and baby pink and I have 3 pet cats so I just bought these immediately after watching this video. They’re lovely Christine.
I’ve never heard anyone refer to the yellow traffic light as amber....
Menchie looks like my xena lol
Simply has evolved to a    ✨ B o b     T h e     B u i l d e r ✨  I'm so proud 👁️👄👁️                           💧       💧
U should make a ‘i tried to do asmr’ video even though it’s an old trend but I’d like to see u try😂
The video starts at 2:29 & ends at 9:07
Next video idea: Your gonna recreate your first date with ben like all of it except where you go because of quarantine, like what had eaten , what did you watch, what did you talked about and etc.
🐈😻😽
What about a "it's not a problem anymore" nail polish?
BEYYN GET MARRIED TO CRISTINE ALREADYYYYYY
I see that simply runs out of ideas.. So here is my idea for a video: simply paints her nails upside down somehow 😅..
omg I really want to order some polish but your website doesn't ship to New Zealand :( :( :(
Hey simply!! Do you know what happened to saf? Is she okay? Do you know why she hasn’t posted a video?
Omg i love the zyler polish love love love it Perfect for Halloween/fall. Now we need a brown
Zyler: Can be an Olympic cat jumper Menchie: Acts cute for Ben and Cristine
Who else still has the original Zyler and Menchie polishes from when she collaborated with Starrily?
U r mad I dont like ur videos ur mad
Idea: Simply should have a tea-ly bag too!
She should do a video making HOLO TEA!
Omg just got it its awesome a zyler nail polish reminds me of pumpkin pie omg thx i love your vids when a 12 i will get a cat am so happy btw am 9😁😁😁😁😁
A holo polish the same color as menchies eyes would be so beautiful! Like a sea foam green
ordered for my niece for xmas.... she probably wont notice if i steal the cool boxes...
You should do a video painting cow print nails
video idea: google translate nail tutorial!!!!!
something that most dont realize is that cristine has 5 channels with over thousands of subs and she manages all 5
Cristine, I love you and your channel - but please consider donating to shelters directly rather than PetSmart Charities. They only donate .90 of every $1, which doesn’t seem like a lot, but it adds up. For larger charities such as this one, it doesn’t always have an impact directly on your community. They can send the money wherever they want, which is important to help all animals, but you don’t know the quality of the shelter they’re supporting. The money left over goes back into their pocket to support the mistreatment of the birds, small rodents, reptiles, and fish at their store fronts!  Please consider donating to a local shelter that way you know where the money is going, it is benefitting the right communities/people/animals (not all shelters are equal!), and ensure 100% of the proceeds go toward the treatment of their animals.   Not meant to be a hateful comment, sending much love
Cristine needs to make gel tacos and colours 😍😍
Please see a functional medicine doctor/naturopath for your eye swelling.
I have a proposal for holo taco  I think holo taco should have a Holodays advant calander including the holo taco glass nail file, multiple holo polishes, protective peel, etc etc Thank you for your time
Video idea:  Painting your nails with makeup 💄
What's bolo?
Nobody:     Me: Cristine NEVER did any choclate mint cookies and cream overnight oats..! 😂😂
Why am I so poor? I love all your nail polishes and I NEED THEM 😍😭
I'm so happy you finally made a legit orange Holo Taco shade bc I liked the rose gold shade you've done before but I've been literally telling my husband that I'm wanting a good fall orange in Holo!♥️♥️
I really want to buy the rainbow collection but my mum said that i cant
in conclusion..     Zyler's the best
make banana bread with beyyyn
Smart cats 🐱 🐈
Cristine you should try following a bob ross tutorial with nail polish!
jenna marbles?
I hope you get better from the swelling :(❤️
animal related causes? wait! you mean meat trades YOU DEMON
I looked up holo queen and you popped up 😳
Does anyone know if holotaco is cruelty free/vegan?
Coming from your snapchat rant about the lack of walls in modern architecture and alls i could do was laugh and exclaim "preach sister"
ILY
make german nails plsssssssss
The cats names: Menchie and Zyler Subtitles: B e n j i and T y l e r
Video idea:you react to the oldest and newest room room video     It'S NoT A ProblEm aMy MorE
Please drop a skincare routine plz
Me: finally has enough money to buy Holo Taco nail polish Holo Taco: *doesn't ship to South Africa* Me: 👁️👄👁️
Hey Simply, can I have one of those unicorn skin boxes? The fact that I don’t have that box is going to be the biggest regret of my life! (Maybe a slight exaggeration xD)
Is there a place I can send you/simplynailogical fanmail
Are we going to get a black Holo witch?
I legit cheered each time Zyler jumped over the boxes! Poor Menchie 😂😭♥️ I adore cats so much, I have five of my own 🐈 ♥️
Personally I hate pet smart but it’s because my local pet smart gave me the wrong information for my baby gecko and he died due to their misinformation:(
Can you make a 100 layers of nail art??!!
Maybe a video where you mix all of the Holo Taco polishes together to see what you get? I love your videos and your podcast! Keep it up! 🥰
I TAKE ONE WEEK OFF OF ALL SOCIAL MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT AND THIS IS WHAT I MISS!!!! Are we kidding!!!! Of course I miss my personal most wanted launch ever!
Test Dixie and Charli's Orosa Nailpolish. Ik u don't do testing or swatching of other brands but they are like THE most famous people so I give u no choice. lol
I just remembered she had a bag with all her Nail Palese  she is like the girl in kakegurui who likes to Collect nails
hi!! i just saw your snap story and i had pretty much the SAME thing happen to me for like..6 months. check the stuff you use on your face/eyes, especially if it has vitamin E in it!!! i had bought a Vitamin E oil to help w dry patches (which is did), but it also swole me up like a BALLOON but only on my eyes. it burned and was uncomfy. i would put it on at night and it didn’t do anything when i put it on so i didnt think thats what it was but it would sink in overnight and id be more swollen and in pain by morning. vaseline is the only soothing thing to help honestly. stop putting any nighttime skincare except the vaseline and maybe a pain reliever or allergy stuff to help the swelling, ice packs for the eyes are just ~chef’s kiss~
you should do a (ben)ana nail polish
I'm worried about Cristine (Snapchat stories) I really hope she's okay and she'll get better 😞
Simply! Simply! Over here! Make a Ben nail polish collection :D
She revealed these to Suzie on nail career education. A lot of people guessed this right.
Can you please review the charli d’amlieo and Dixie d’amlieo nail polish
Hey Cristine! you shoud make a youtube chanel for Menchie and Zyler where you post vlogs and games with them
Cristiana can you do TikTok hair hack or hacks from Tiktok like This if u agree
I also wanted kittie close ups 😔
feel like youre replacing jenna marbles lol     (im kidding)
Wait...is it 600,000 or 6 million pets that PetSmart saves? 1:40
Can you make a video on how to get good nail shapes ,nail beds and cuticles?
Can I have a nail polish 💅🏼 👉🥺👈
YOU NEED TO REVIEW CHARLIE DEMOLIOS NAIL POLISHHHHH
7:09 zyler dead ass said BITCH HURRY UP SO WE CAN GET TREATS and i- 😭😭😭
Hey, i see your snaps, and I was wondering, I probably sound so stupid, but something similar happened to me and coconut oil helped. It wasn't like baby oil texture, but more like a kinda buttery think material. Idk you have prob already tried it, but figured it would not hurt to suggest
When this video was released i was on break at work, and i brought my laptop to work so while this video played on the tab over i bought these and i was so excited one of my coworkers at a table 6 feet away (social distancing) looked at me like i was crazy but they all know I'm crazy.  Love you Cristine, you're videos help me feel better on a bad day. Thank you!
What happened to your faceee, I saw your snap story 😯
You should try out the color workshop nail polish
Christine watch kittysaurus and claire vids, maybe zyler and momo can be friends, and menchie TT 2 queen, just a fans to cat iam
Wait menchie is seven? I remember watching you and you saying she was 3?WAIT how long have i been watching ur videos?omg i remember being 9 and now im 13 wait have i really been watching for 4yrs am i really having an exestential crisis abt how long i been watching simply naill logical🌝
💜💜💜
Your cats really boss over you😂
Menchie and Zyler are so smart😂
I still have the OG zyler and menchie polishes from live love polish (I think that’s the brand?) 😤 the new batch is definitely more vibrant
.....you've hit way above crazy cat lady at this point
I ❤ your kind
I don’t wanna see menchie in a cage ever again 😭😭🥺
You should've put some cat hairs in the bottles lmao
Well I really wanted a close up of your cats
When are you going to make a flag for the holosexouols
Sure halloween is close but its going to S u c k
The cats are too smart 😂
Video idea:back to school reaction
i have no money to buy nail polish, and if i did get some i would probably buy black polish, but DAMN if i dont want the menchie and zyler polishes.........  and the way cristine talks about them??? truly chefs kiss
Okay, but it's not fair to make circus animals do things they don't want to either. It's not like they ran away from home to join the circus.
Usually when filming this type of video, people will start low and work up to the heights you started with. Not only do the cats get used to jump=treat, but they''llget better and better at jumping as things go on.
do u like me zyler
that is zyler
i like someone
I love Menchie's tiny meow when you spelled treats
im reallyyy ugly
I think you should do a video where you buy  your own fake merch that other people are selling, 😂😂❤️
I love How you talk about nail polish like it’s rocker science (btw love ur videos, from: Tyra Holmquist in Sweden)
So first things I have a cat named moomoo and she adorable she's a lovely and she's pregnant
Omg simply there a nail app you need to try it called nail Solan manicure fashion game for Gil's they make you cut your nail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who else wants every polish in every one of her intros 👇
I got the original menchie polish from starrily many years ago and was thrilled to see this, but that shipping though. £30 for shipping? No, ma’am.
Haven’t been here in a while....... Now I gotta watch all ur vids and like them
video idea: painting my cats nails 2, but this time use nail caps from petsmart
do a home tour
Cristine a youtuber called Kristina Braly made a holo car! Please react!
When the light turns "amber?!" 🤔🤔🤔
The people disliking this video don’t understand wholesome content and don’t know how to enjoy life.
I've recently been seeing an increase in complaints about Not Milky White. On Facebook nail groups, Instagram, and on Twitter about how the formula is too goopy even after just getting. Polish thinner doesn't work either. I also had this problem but I only sent Holo Taco a PM about it and didn't wanna post it publicly because I thought it was just a problem with mine. Is there a chance for a remake batch of it to adjust the formula? It looks good in all the Holo taco videos but it's not that easy to achieve in person.
I just ordered a shitton of stuff from holotaco and Im so excited to Get it!
Omg  Ever scince I started watching simplynailogical I was obsesed with the menchie and zyler nail polish and I was thinking. She should sell them. Me: dreams come true!!!
You should make a banana nail polish for BENNNNNNN!!!
Can you do a home gym tour? I would love to see your setup! Your snaps motivate me so much! ❤️❤️
I just had menchie in my cart but this video made me add zyler too, such amazing shades - can't wait for mine to arrive!
Since you made holo tacos for Menchie and Zyler, you need to make one for MENCHIE GANG
Claire!! Kittisaurus was mentioned. My kids LOVE watching her kitties. Make more kitty videos please Cristine. We love your kitties.
I adooore Menchie...<3
You should try color street
This is so weird because I thought they already had their own nail polish? Am I wrong? Is my terrible memory coming in?  Aight nvm I watched the rest of the video XD
Hi! I am super late to things, but I just learned about spider gel. I would really be interested in a simply video on using/experimenting with spider gel
I Love These! 🐱 💅 You Know What This Means, Cristine With No H And Beeyynn Needs Polishes Named After Them Too!
I don't even like nail polish, and I feel the urge to buy ALL of Cristine's products....
Cristine: "menchie you are smarter than this!" Menchie: "bet."
7:32😂😂😂😂
Cristine:cat r not circus animal Also Cristine:zyler is a circus cat
I really hope you come out with a linear holo greyscale line!! Black, white, and a shade (or a few) of grey!!
Christine and Ben all gangster till✨menchie and zyler ✨pull up
Everyone gangster till✨zyler and menchie ✨ pull up
Everyone gangster till ✨zyler helps menchie
this has the jenna marbles vibes we all desperately need
Can you try out Crayola nail polish 💅 💿😸😸😸😸
However many likes this comment gets, is how many lies from troom says every second
Can you please more videos. I’m tired or reaching all you old videos lol! I’ve seen them 3 times each 😂
Since menchie is a girl and Zyler is a boy can they have kitties
see i would buy the polishes BUT HOLO TACO DOESNT SHIP 2 NEW ZEALAND ;;;;(
Can you make another episode of will it watermarble, pick that peely(redoing your own nail peelys) and more troom troom shiiit plllllz ❤️
you should recreate all of your peely's!!!!
That pink is to die for!!! 😩😩
She should do Polish mountain but with fake nails
I request that you make a black holo taco. I think it would look great and would work on neon colors.
I have an idea for your next collection!! Pastel holo!!!!! Or just pastel colors, or both!! 😻
please review the charli and dixie damelio nail polish!!!
Can you show your peely bag please
You should compare the old Menchie and Zyler polishes to the new Menchie and Zyler polishes in a video :)
I think Menchie was hesitant as she didn’t want to knock over mommy nail polishes 😉
Im honestly so glad she is back!
Ship to italy pleaseeeee❤️❤️
Unpopular question, Does anyone know what happened to safiya?
Don't lick it
The dislikes are from menchie because she couldn’t jump over the boxes 😂
Are we just going to ignore how Cristine called the traffic light amber instead of yellow?!
When a tragic stop turns amber..... WHAT
Cristine please do another overnight oats recipe please please...
what about a beyyyn nail polish
Wow... I used to not like holo. And now, I LOVE IT. Cristine got to me.
7:07 i dunno if zyler wanted to help menchie by lowing the wall or get the boxes to hit her
simply i whant you to do kpop nails but not only kpop nails bts nails pease make my dream com true please i beg you
Does Holo Taco ship to the UK?
My cats would never in a million years allow this
I broke my nail when I  watched your videos 😢
I’m pretty sure that the collection boxes next to her are the metallic polishes collection boxes
she called it amber!! i'm boggled, i love it.
Time to do POLISH MOUNTAIN WITH ✨HOLO TACO✨ 🌮🐱🌮🐱🌮🐱🌮
can u follow threadbangers latest video and try catwalk!!!
i really like the disclaimer that animals aren't here to get likes on the internet and that you shouldn't force them to do anything they don't want.
Do you know one thing that is crazy I have a holo lunch box
Does anyone else get Halloween vibes from these polishes
"And together, they make a kitty cat!" Me: oh no, now I need them both "This is why you need to get both!" Me: YOU'RE RIGHT
Wow Ben is such a great dad
I never got the notification for this and when I went to buy Menchie it was sold out already😓💔
You can tell that she’s running out of ideas
You’re the new Jenna Marbles
Zyler is so chonky he is adorable 😍😍
What’s the difference between lotion and nail oil and can lotion help your cuticles. ❤️
Cristine, I just have to say. I really love this style of advertising, how it felt normal, yet also clearly an advertisement. How you threw regular-type footage of you promoting it instead of only reading the script in front of the camera like a drone. And the fact that you didn't have any makeup on. I know there's the whole eye thing, but even still. This is why I love your channel. 10/10.
the duo is already sold out, i shoulda watched this vid when i saw it =(
She should do a polish mountain with your holo taco brand in rainbow order!!!
I  Know Im Gonna Get Some Hate For THis Comment But Petsmart Is Not A Very Good Company To Give The Proseeds To Because They Have Been Known For Not Taking Good Care Of There Animal/Not Feeding Them Im Am A Animal Lover And I Just Wanted To Point This Out Btw No Hate To Her I Just Wanted To Say THat Thats Not The Best Place To Put The Money Into <3
Lol the cats are so cute               Like if you agree
“And it turns amber” americans: can’t relate?
The only two I don’t have!!!,”
I think my favorite part was Zyler shoveling Menchie’s treat into his mouth.
When the traffic stop turns amber
Zyler is such a king
do you remember your cappuccino video that you posted on Nov16,2017 well in that video you should have mixed all coloured crystal sugar to make holographic crystal sugar can please make a part 2 of it with this idea that i gave to you pleaseee🙏🙏
When she calls the yellow stop light “amber” 🤔🙈
me and simply nailogical have the same birthday :D
Ok so I have something to confess I saw Cristine in the wilderness, a confident, *strong* woman But I didn't ran towards her to get a picture because I was scared to disturb her So yeah Cristine, if you read this... If you saw someone walking fast, looking at the ground, *that was me* But you probably didn't see me ... And uh Yeah
you should make BEYYN a polish
You have to go check out nail queenie on YouTube she makes the coolest holo taco looks
Woah Cristine was being sincere
Zyler is 👑 lol.
Hello- I love that u love helping animals but here in the states the petsmart’s aren’t that great. They sell animal like they are objects and  keep them in horrible conditions. I understand they may be different in Canada. Just thought I would let u know. I hope this doesn’t offend u. I love all that u do for animals!
I just had to let you know, I FINALLY was able to get in on the Halo Taco action and just submitted my 1st order! I'm so excited! Its everyday basic colors for me but I'm excited to try out the black and white bundle with my stamping and top it with some Aurora unicorn skin!! And I couldnt control myself and snagged the indigo away and a glass file because I gave up trying to find one out in the boonies and I'm skeptical of the ones off Amazon lol . I cant wait!!!
The best NAIL ART channel ever
you should aply all of your nail polish to you nails
Dip powders please!
Menchie stans have left the chat
I cant believe i actually bought one! ... and for $20 USD😮💘  idc they are BEAUTIFUL! And for a great cause. Btw only could buy Zyler, since Menchie is sold out☹
I love you cristine but the two cat outlines look vaguely...phallic
You shod cut you're hair and donate ittt
Cristine: Why do we build the wall, my children, my children? Menchie & Zyler: For the likes, Mum.
This sounds stupid, I'm in
no delivery to my country 😭😭😭😭
Y'all rembember when she actually did nail art lol
I actually love the pink and orange together
You should review a longhairprettynails vid!!!!!                       P.S. Tell menchie and zyler I said hi 😼
Literally only half of this video is about Cristine’s actual cats. The other 7 minutes is product placement😑
Me: Sees nail polish Also Me: remembers I cannot wear nail polish or else my prayer wont count *cries in muslim*
Your cats and you (also Ben) are my hope to be an awesome cat mom/crazy cat lady,btw you rock😸
what i'm getting is that Play Rosé is Menchie and Zyler's (nail polish) child?? i'm lovin'  it
I want you to do a challenge
Hi
You look like splender mom (Norris nut's mom) are you guys related
You should do a will it water marble
Pin this if you love holo😉
in the instant replay/ 5:15  you have to look at zylers face   🥺🥺😖
christine should come out with her own holo taco nail oil
Menchie looks like the confused cat with the loading symbol on its head
🐣🐥🐤𝙍𝙄𝙎𝙀 𝙎𝙏𝙀𝙋 𝘾𝙃𝙄𝘾𝙆𝙀𝙉𝙎🐣🐥🐤🐔🐓🐣🐥🐤🐔🐓🐔🐥🐣🐤🐤🐣🐔🐓🐓
i am literally so proud of you. you did it. you really have your own nail polish line!! WE LOVE OUR QUEEN CRISTINE
pls paint your cat's nails :P
This video should be called finally making everyone realize zyler’s the better cat.
This whole video is just zyler bullying menchie
Cris I love your hoodie where is it from?
I don't think cristine realises that she's been on utube for 6 years❤️
I think Menchiiiie knew the tower was a bit unstable perhaps?
Yup. It's gone 😪
now we know why they're sold out so fast
You should do a create your own collection combo where you can pick and choose what nail polishes you want to fill a collection box so that way you can have a little bit of everything. Sort of like a bundle deal
Please restock :(
My favourite cat channel:
CRISTINE DO NAIRL ART MOUNTAIN
You needed to start at 1 and work up higher. the dum dum would have figured it out that it needed to jump over
When the traffic light turns...what ??
Menchi'e too smart to jump over boxes.
Can we get close up montages of the cats also? #justhereforthecats
1:03 and thats called incest :)
You should make a video with all the holo tacos! Doin' gradients and stuff. That would be really nice. Btw also really nice video ❤.
You should see what would happen if you matify glitter polish! <3
Anyone remember the childhood disappointment of buying a glitter polish, and getting like two flakes on your actual nail!?  Cristine has made me trust glitter polish again after all these years lol
I'm not saying what the cat on the two boxes combined looks like
You don't ship to Estonia :'(
ZYLER IS SO CHONKY OMG *0* CUTE LITTLE CHONK
now this is the content i subscribed for :)
I just bought some holo taco hope it comes soon!!
Yayy animal charity
What.... canadians dont call their traffic stops yellow??? They have to call them amber? oh you guys just think youre sooooo fancy with your amber traffic stops...
I’m still convinced that this entire channel is a mass hallucination
I hate your politics... but I will forgive you for the cats...
And the collection boxes next to her say “Holo it’s me” not “Just add a holo taco” like the og holo taco boxes said. But maybe they were just prototype ideas
cristene i’m begging you please have a tea party with ben and the cats
PLEASE RESTOCK MENCHIE!!😭😭
I love how she refers to the polishes as he and she
DAMN ZYLERS THICKKKKKKK
You should make a nail polish for Ben or for both of you
Cristine: when the light turns amber Me: uh um uh amber? What what is that? amber what the heck
Why is no one talking about the petsmart thing, petsmart abuses animals ???
I'm sad, your nail polish is to expensive :(
Not into supporting Petsmart! my neiece took her dog who had almost completely stopped eating to their vet at petsmart (for which they payed a monthly fee) the vet told them there was nothing wrong with her dog and it died a week later, all they did was look over the dog and check it's teeth, no blood test nothing, come to find out if they had run a blood test they would have found out what was wrong and the dog could have been saved with some antibiotics but nah they didn't bother to do a service that was prepaid for and expected, and now they are continuing to make her pay the monthly fee until the contract or whatever is up! Plus she still owes $1500 for the dog! So yah F***K Petsmart, Love the colors though
Hey umm... the shipping is more then the product I want, and I live in Ottawa 🥴
Well Menchie The Cat & the HOLO TACO MENCHIE & ZYLER DUO were sold out so I bought Zyler The Cat alone (it's the one I wanted the most anyway, I am just sad I won't be able to make a complete cat with the boxes.  I substituted in Green Taffy so I can take Zyler to the Emerald City when they arrive :)
i got a nail polish ad during this and it wasn't holo taco...
I ordered my menchie polish yesterday so happy some of the proceeds are going to charity. thank you cristine and I love you :) love from Wisconsin
Simply: *"He's licking his holo"* Zyler: *continues to nibble* Simply: *WHat ThE FuCk MAN*
This is so pretty 😭😭😭 but if I buy this I can only wear it on my period
Weeehehehhehee
I need that big box of feline greenies 🐱
Who else was low key kinda sad when she said “Now who wants some good ole close ups up menchie and zyler, the nail polishes, not the cats” 😭😭😭  I had to rewatch this part multiple times to make sure I got it right and it kills and makes me even sadder every time
This only proves cats are dolphin-level intelligent...sans the other things dolphins are known for.
Dogs: I will jump over the thing 🐶  Cats: this wall shall not defeat me. I will bring IT down instead. 🐱
You should do a video on opening fan mail drunk with Jen -just an idea-
When the light turns amber?! Whaaaaa you mean yellow? 😱
Man very time I try to order from your site you are always sold out
CRISTINE!!!! (with no h) You should do a shop with me to get nail polish video!!! Like go to Walmart and get nail polish and maybe some products you would recommend. (Totally not recommending this because I go to Walmart for nail care and don’t know what to get)😼🌚
Wait the rainbow collection is ending??? Omg, I have like no money 😭😭😭😭
Those nail polishes reminded me of Halloween 🎃👻
Me: "Idk I'm not a huge fan of orange so I might only get the Menchie polish." Cristine: "…and together they make a cat!" Me: "TAKE MY MONEY"
Alternate title for video.. “Zyler shows odd how many boxes he can jump over for treats while menchie just acts cute and gets treats anyways” lmao
Ahh yes loving this quality nail art and this nail art channel 😂😂😂
Who would have thought 6 years ago that today you’d have a nail polish that  supports the same place that you got your car from!
Munchies polish is sold out 😿
Christine y is menchie sold out?????
i was just watching your 2019 birthday video and i was thinking since your bday is soon (happy early birthday) you could make nail polish tea or tea nail polish just a thought but idk if youve done this already so uh yeah
I ussually hate orange and pink but these colours is like ''' I want it! ''
I feel like they could make a really pretty slate grey holo id love that as a color just like menchies fur (sorry if I didn’t spell that right)
just put it on your nails smh
“Why we on Big Brother” SENT me 😹😹
You should paint your walls with nail polish
Cristine,  I just purchased the rainbow🌈 collection and was wondering and hoping, at a later date can you please sell the empty rainbow collection box separately? Will you ever foresee being able to order more of the rainbow collection boxes? Pretty please🌈🌈🌈
How about a black holo glitter polish? 👀
the new movie on Netflix, Work It, has Liza Koshy as one of the main characters, and it's absolutely hilarious 😂 it's amazing, Jen should go watch it
My idiot cat heard the treats and kept running into my room and licking the screen. I love the precious boy, but he's not too bright...
Simply! Are you gonna start a gel line?
YOU LITTLE RASCAL!
JUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did you say amber cool we just say yellow
Well now I have to get the new Menchie and Zyler polish and compare with the old ones.  Darn. 🙃😎
Unrelated, but Who thinks that Christine should try to do acrylic nails on herself lol
Zyler is a dog.
These are sooo gorgeous😍😍😍I’m gonna place my first order of holo taco polishes as soon as they restock😍😍😍😍
Am I the only one who wants "ItS  NoT a PrObLem AnYmOrE" to come back???
Chonks
Holo Cato
thank you for giving us the serotonin we so desperately need 😺
CRISTINE!!!! THIS IS SOLD OUT!!! HOW WILL I GO ON??? Edit: I do blame you, why'd you buy 40? I'm a Canadian too! We deserve priority access to Menchie and Zyler polish 😭😭😭😭
Sold out already ohhhh nooooo 😭
I'm new to youtube and it would mean a lot of anyone checked out my most recent upload!
Got the Menchie one on the way! :) xx
4:29  Breaking news: a wild BEYNN has been spotted.
Can you make nail polish for dogs pls.💖🐶💞
Just a question:  Did you get menchie from the adoption side of pet smart or the rescue side of pet smart?     I don’t know why I asked I’m just curious...
Zyler & Menchie are actually me and my younger brother growing up, me achieving on my own and my parents giving him an easy out and still rewarding us the same 😂 Also, Zyler punching the boxes at Menchie is me and my brother too 🤣
Mykie: Blood Red - "Careless Whisper" Safiya: Black Holo - "Frankenbats" 🦇 Corinne: Purple Holo - "Witchcraft" Rob: Glow-in-the-Dark Glitter - "Glitter Herpes"
You should do a collab box with Glam and Gore, here are my suggestions:  Blood Red - Scab Blood Love White Holo - A GHOST! Blue Creme - Important Babe Green Glitter - Infamous Seafoam Green - Careless Whisper Burgundy - Scorpio
I mean I'm seriously buying your products
Please, please make a pure black glitter polish. You can even call it Black Beauty, Black Twilight or Black Snow. Use the names free of charge. Just want a Black Glitter Nail Polish. I'm a guy who wants some dark bling. If you do it just promise me a bottle. For now I'm waiting to first time purchase your Holo products but ur out of super gloss. Once available I'm going shopping the house down that means that im seriously buying your products.
But does the nail polish work on cats¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Her voice is so relaxing!!! I need Cristine to do an ASMR vídeo so badlyyyyy
When she described the traffic light as Amber...  me: 👁👄👁
But how many can YOU jump over simply?
menchie is so sad 7:35
Rename your peely base to "Peel Porn" and your base coat to "It'S nOt A pRoBlEm AnYmOrE!"
*The Ben Box* Benana - Banana Yellow 🍌 Drink Slave - Starbucks Green ☕ Dad Jeans - Denim Blue 👖 Simply Spa - Champagne 🍾
Zyler is the best boy
I was so ready for the cat close ups 😅😭
I love how she always does animal charities. She really cares about pets.
I love how much effert and detail goes into the packaging
*gets nail polish advertisements for this video* Me:  ...but why?...
u should make acrylic nails out of their hair or with their hair in it
I love you, I love this, I love the cats, and I'm so happy that your nail polish line is doing so well. BUT the amount of amazing holo shots in this video gave me a migraine 😅 congratulations on all the success 💜
Do another french video
you finally got me. I bought some nail polish lol
Traffic lights turn AMBER? WHAT? 🤯
menchie going around the snound barrier: work smarter not harder
A black light holo for Holoween.
Did anyone else get the Loud Lacquer ad before the video? Like a weird Barbie snuff film 😱  Also Zyler is best chunk.
“When you come up to a traffic stop and the light turns amber . . ,”   Amber?? What? Yellow, anyone?
I screamed cackled when Zyler stole her treat. Poor baby Menchie!😂
I wish Holo Taco shipped to Spain :"
*waiting patiently for a restock while thanking Cristine they are not limited edition*
Is all this spam normal??
Look, I've never been to Canada before... but what traffic light turns AMBER??
Menchie proved she’s the smartest cat on the internet
did she just say amber?
UGH I love this so much but petsmart is literally garbage. they dont care for their animals whatsoever. wish cristine picked a more reputable cause towards animals but love this regardless
Zyler is an acrocat! And Menchie.... got treats anyway💖🐱
I missed the colabs all the way back when AND NOW i CAN FINALLY HAVE THE MENCHIE POLISH
i’m watching this and my cat just came over looking for the treats you’re shaking 😂
Did she say that traffic stops turn amber?? What in the Canada
She's the only person who can wear cat ear headbands and not be judged
All I see here is that there still exists the collection box I wanted!! Haha
You should remake the benana nail polish but with *HOLO*
I love Zyler smart much
Zyler: I am too dignified to engage in such demeaning activiti— Cristine: *VIOLENTLY SHAKES TREAT BOX* Zyler: It’s jumping time
This was hilarious
Okay but here me out BLACK HOLO FOR HALOWEEN
that intro.....     FUNNY
wait, traffic lights in canada turn amber??
You don’t have to convince me that cats are better than dogs 😂💞
You should make a polish mountain with the cat polishes
Does anyone know why safiya isn’t posting on YouTube?
Zyler: I am an Olympic athlete and  I will eat every single treat.  Menchie: I am a princess and I avoid jumping like my life depends on it.
I'm starting a small business and i'm getting holo bags and stickers and will write with holo pencils
I’m here. Why? I don’t Know I don’t have a ca—👁👄👁t
No wonder the polishes sell out so quickly she has 40 of each ❤😂
I love these 🐱 but when you showed the three similar coloura as a tease I got so excited because I thought you were making an autumn collection
I wonder who you love the most 😂 ben or your nail polishes 😂 can you give up one for the other?  Just a question that came in my mind.
I'm so excited for Menchie's shade but also excited for Zyler to use for Halloween themed art! They are both beautiful. I can't wait to receive them in the mail!
If you're reading this, this is a sign that you should follow your  dreams and do whatever you truly want/need to do. Follow your passion so  you have no regrets! I want you to know that you are extremely loved,  wanted, and beautiful the way you are. Never let others bring you down  💜 Trust and love yourself as if nobody else can. Follow your dreams and  be happy because this is the only life you got!
Me: Doesn't wear nail polish ever Simply: Menchie and Zyler nail polish Me: ... Me: ... Me: must have nail polish
Hope to see you come out with cuticle oil in the future 🥺
one coat white please 😭♥️
this is important information
THEY'RE SOLD OUT SO NOW I GUESS I'LL JUST LIE DOWN AND CRY
This video is so beatiful that I wanna watch it again
Holo there Cristine :D I just wanted to ask if it's possible to send empty polish bottles back to Holo Taco for recycling.
Aaaaw Zyler is such a sweet, good boi 😍
I know there's a slim chance for this to reach her, but Pet smart is actually really toxic and bad..would you consider donating to a non-company charity?
Cristine: my cats will jump over this wall Menchie: *shoves soundboard out of way*
On simplies snap she said “ testing some things that aren’t nail polish... ARE WE GETTING THE LATEX STUFF TO PUT ON NAILS AND THE OIL AND A BETTER NAIL POLISH REMOVER?!?!?!!
Idk why but I got weird vibes from you in this video. Can't put my figure on why though.
I'm so happy you made these with your own formulas 💖💖
I’m sorry but this whole thing just feels like an advertisement. I loved your channel, but I don’t like feeling that I’m constantly being advertised to
No one: Nobody:  Me: Wait.... does the traffic lights in Canada have a ember light instead of yellow...?
I just got one!!!!! I’m so excited :)))
I love  this and gunna to buy and also love it because it helps other kitty shelters🐱🐱 Menchie looks so much like my a BennyBoo who also was adopted from a cat rescue I have 8 kitties that have been rescued by myself and I kept them becauuse I absolutely love cats there my world😻🌍
Y are her cats smarter than reflection time cristine
You should do having long nails for a day
When Jenna is gone and you’re craving ‘me time’ videos and simply is coming in clutch with weird videos  as usual 😂
Happy because Menchie and Zyler have their nail polish swatches and they are AMAZING (Both the cats and the nail polishes lol). Just sad because you don't ship to Brazil.  :(
Do nail art using your teeth💗
“Amber” I was so confused
You should make your cats a cat patio!!!!
https://youtu.be/CEADgz8xwTg Ohh god to
Tell Menchie+Zyler I love them please and I’m a subscriber ❤️
Can you try Charlie and dixies nail polish??
Why halo everyone
It might just be me, but the Menchie the Cat polish looks like Molly Burke’s aesthetic. I would love to see her try the glitter!!!
you should collab with moriah elizabeth!!!
7:11 Lol😂
How many bottles of polish can my cats jump over. None evidently, looking at the first 5 seconds 😅
I feel like Zyler needed this video since Menchie gets all the limelight usually. For a long time I thought zyler was a cat that had died because I never saw him. When he finally popped up in a video I though “oh, he’s alive!”
........the light turns amber?
Menchie knows there's precious halo in the boxes. It intimidates her. Zyler is a classic Ginger Tabby. All he cares about is the food! Super excited about this release! I set my alarm for it. 😸
Are you going to make a ben polish to :D?
simply says the two colors dont go togetger but in a very hippie 80's fashion, i think it does 😆
What about like a clear taco with Holo chuncks that are cut out like cats??
Please don’t say that we only can buy Menchie’s and Zyler’s nailpolish in a limited time, cause i need them sooooo bad, but i don’t have the money for them at the moment 😭
My cat came running when he heard the shaking treats 😂
Wow, i love 😍
Cant believe  her nail polish is still like that, that wouldve drove me crazzzzzzy
Oh my god! You should make scented nail polishes if you haven’t already! Maybe make the rainbow collection again but will scents! Btw I love you so much!
Gurl hurry u need to do 1000 layers of nailpollish!!! Someone just did 500 layers!!! 😰
I'm just curious, do you own the rights to the color or just the names...? Because I might be wrong, but the colors look almost identical to the collab you did with Starrily and I'm just curious how that works.
Cristine can you please ship to New Zealand!
i think she accidentally snorted their catnip because this is the most insane thing shes done so far
Where is Ben’s Bananas Holo Taco nail polish?
1:03 that's a penis
Absolutely no one: nothing Menchie:**meow** Me: Amazing, totally unique, completely never ever been done before, beautiful, talented
When she said that who wants a close up of menchie and zyler , i got exited. Then she said not the cats the nail polish. But then i got sad 😂
mechie is smart, she doesn’t want to jump because she can’t see the other side and she doesn’t know if there’s a safe place to land, and zyler will apparently risk not having a place to land for treats
Desperately want to buy these but shipping is $30 :( maybe one day, I hope these aren't limited edition...
I am a dog person but I thoroughly enjoyed this video
Wait the lights on a traffic stop (the yellow)are amber???
Awwww too adorable!! Love your video!  Im a new channel and I post videos of my baby kittens :) I want to make new friends on Youtube <3 xxx
I SAW THIS LATE AND MENCHIE THE CAT IS SOLD OUT. HOW EVER WILL I LIVE.
"I will eat you"      ^👁👄👁^
Nooo when will they come back I need them both
Christine: menchie your smarter  than this  Menchie: you were Right,  But you were also very wrong
Video idea: try out fortnite👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 you will like it im sure! Because youre cool or my class will leave youre channel 👿😈
"We're gonna use some old Holo Taco collection boxes"  Girl, pls, I will buy those empty boxes off you - I was poor when the holoday box and unicorn box came out and I require them to satisfy my soul
I’m wondering if Christine can host a small cat tea party and “make” conversations between Menchie and Zyler. I’m sure there are cat friendly treats she can make. Or that Ben can make. Maybe? Perhaps?
Wonder if u put both in a gradient with a light yellow ish orange might look good or with Zylers with a dark red an menchie with a baby blue?    (But then again I’m not good with colors 😓)
I clicked on this video so quick as if it would change my life  I was correct
The colors... 😍
God these youtubers are running out of ideas 💡
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this God Bless you,stay safe and have a wonderful day🥰my dream is to become a famous YouTuber
We need benana (banana yellow), something based off Jen (maybe a mix of stuff, kinda messy like the watermarble videos), "What's a youtube?" For simplydadlogical
Mench one is cute not even gonna lie but that ZYLER one is GORGEOUS. And no not bias just because I too own an orange cat, I’m just a complete MESS for PSL vibes
Got them both!! Though I am missing two collections 😞
ok this is weired the same day i saw this i went to the doller store and saw and bought a nail polish that looks almost exactly like menchie(the nail polish)conspeirecy????????????
‼️‼️I KNOW NO ONES GOING TO SEE THIS BUT MY RELATIVE HAS BEEN MISSING SINCE AUG 20th AND WE ARE REALLY WORRIED. IF ANYONE COULD SHARE MY LINK, POST, OR PHOTO ON TWITTER @soluhn ID BE SUPER CONTENT‼️ Thanks for your time 🙏🙏
Cristine and Claire should meet 🤣🤣🤣
Any Kittisaurus fans watching this???
Reminds me of their starrily polishes :') we are so old
You should gradient the menchie, play rose and zyler pls
4:31  Me: BEYYYYYN! IN DE HALLWAY
THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TURNS TO WHAT COLOR ???????
CATS ARE DUMB!!!!
Cristine is the first person I’ve heard say that the traffic light turns “amber” instead of “yellow”
Zyler is so chunky I love him
Benana holo taco :)
when the light turns.. amber??
Zyler is quite the trickster 😂
Idk I think the cats just straight up bypassing the obstacles instead of jumping over them like you want them to is  1. Pretty smart and  2. Very much a cat thing to do
After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell.  How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever.   Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven?   Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven.   Salvation Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). He also said, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven.  Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.  Deserving hell for sins Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Repent So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.  No other way  If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked "Jesus Christ." There is no other entrance.  By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you. No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe  All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.
How come no one is pointing out how she called a yellow light "amber".  Is this a Canadian thing?
*BEST VOCAL & VIDEO EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!* www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR8Mrt1IpXg

Someone should edit it into a betrayal drama lolll
I still need a Black Witch replacement now that i've discovered it's magick please!
I wish you shipped to nz already 😢 I just want holotaco
Dear precious one, the best way to effectively connect with Jesus Christ is through prayer. Please join me in praying the following prayer....Beautiful Savior, I am your servant. Please help me to live in Your love and be a blessing to someone today.  I love you, Jesus! Please, guide me to all who need help, so I may share with them Your Holy Word and the light of Your Love.         To show, Kindness, to those who don't know warmth.       Love, to those who are stoned of heart.       Peace, to those in strife and conflict.        To be a light to Your Love, for those who are lost.        To help restore Faith, to those who are held by strongholds.        To call upon Your mighty mighty name my Lord.  So You and only You can deliver them, from their self built prison walls, of their heart, mind, body and soul.         Only You and You alone, Lord, can set us free. We trust You, we love You, we honor You, and we worship You. In Yahweh (Father God our Creator),through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) we pray!  Thank you Lord. Amen! ❤️❤️❤️
So this whole video was just one big ad....wow.
Yay!! I got some HoloTaco for my daughter, she has autism and she loves shimmery things!!! She has recently wanted me to paint her nails (she is 8).  She loves Pink and purple!! I got her some pretty colors to bad Menchie is sold out. Cant wait for the restock!! Pink is her favorite color although she would say rainbow if you asked her!!
GURL YOU'RE KILLIN' ME WITH THESE F*.*ING AMAZING COLORS. My niece is highly allergic to nail polish, BUT NOT TO HOLO TACO. *throws confetti everywhere* And that pink color is so perfect for her. <3
Girl can u believe Ur on trending page
I remember when the cats got there own polishes years ago
AMBER???????????????
Menchie 😍 little baby fairy polish
What portion of the profits are being donated? She never told us so it could be like 0.015% or something
Anyone else dying from laughter from Menchie
2:19 Who got triggered when it wasn’t in rainbow order?lol
This is thee kind of content I signed up for :'D
CRISTINEEEEEEEE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SWEETS THEMED HOLO TOCO LINE! THAT WOULD BE SO CUTE!
My bunny would have leaped over that wall in a heartbeat. Especially for cuddles or treats.
PetSmart does not support all breeds in their stores, like Pitbulls. Which is unfair, since it is not their fault they have such a stigma surrounding them
Wait didnt she already have Menchie and Zyler nail polish in those colors........ my brain is too tired rn I'm so confused  EDIT: nvm lol I got to the end of the video
OH MY GAWD!!!!! Cristine watches BB
I know you're a nailpolish channel.....supposedly, but can we just get more cat content
Glad to know my hubby and I aren't the only crazy cat people
Ben in the backround..lol
Cristine !!!!!!!!!!!!!!ship to India  please !!
Boarding quarantine it’s not a problem anymore
Zyler pushed them over to help menchie
I ordered Menchies but not Zylers
When this video is 29th on trending
So this it’s come to, huh? Just kidding, I love everything you put out! And the fur babies too!
I have been adding to my cart and deleting when I see the shipping to Aus is over 40$!, This was the motivation I needed to spend all the $ hehe Cant wait! My second (big) order!!!! woohoo
This is crazy!!!  https://youtu.be/GIOyOJP1izM
As much as I adore Menchie baby pink is not really my jam. However, I am literally 2 minutes into the video and already purchased the Zyler polish. I don't even paint my nails. Love the color sm
Hold up. is calling the middle light on the stoplight Amber a Canada thing or a Cristine thing?
I will when I'm able to treat myself after bills. Not a good situation currently 😜😊🥰
Holo Simply   You should do a back to school 2020 video with beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen and give us some advice. I will be starting high school and must learn to do the taxes
7:09 Zyler is just helping his sister out
Zyler’s color is speaking to my soul
Thanks so much for helping shelters with these polishes, and congrats on the latest launch! They are two lovely, cool cats, and the colours reflect them well ^_^
sis these are dupes of your old polishes, what are you lying for? 💀
Can we see more Simply gamelogical?
I wish you guys shipped to New Zealand!!
Menchie: i will stop at nothing! I will destroy all structures that stand between me and my treeeeaaatttssss
I just noticed how I don’t even wear nail polish at all yet I’ve been watching simply nailogical for YEARS.
So far this video has been menchie cheating the system
did I go straight to the holo taco website, and buy 4 new nailpolishes? Yes. Yes I did. No regrets
This is how I know you are really out of video ideas
I cannot believe I just (Saturday) spent 150.00 on nail polish 😂 I am sad I missed out on the rainbow collection box the first time around. But I got the polish!!
The Menchie color match her ears.
Wish I could get all your collections but it’s just to expensive to ship here to Australia ☹️
Umm I NEED those empty collections boxes 📦 😍
At comparison, I was kinda hoping she would conpare the old Menchie and Zyler polishes, even though it was another company
Hey Cristine, here's a good video idea,u can recreate all the nail art that u did in your older videos but only using your own nail polish. Love u and your family I will continue watching your videos until u stop.
I tried which meat dairy or egg product is the best tasting to a cat it was actually suprising...what they prefer and it isnt what you think they would really like....
I love how you describe the polishes like the people on cooking shows describe the food they made
If you haven’t yet, you should do a “comparing our cats” video like Rachel and Jun did on your second channel!
Lol getting serious early 2000's vibes in the polish drip with the two colors alternating 😂😂
I will buy both! I got my hamster, Dill Pickle from a Pets Mart. So I will definitely buy both. 😁
Ahh wish could afford love both 😫
you need a banana ben colour
I was searching holo and i went to images and some of the pictures where your holo taco nail polishes :)
the way I freaking ran to the website the moment she said they restocked lol, I'm so excited to get my order!
The Lord is coming back. He loves you dearly and calls for you to come back home to Him.  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:9) He calls for repentance and belief in the Gospel. It’s time to fully surrender to Christ. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
You should make a polish for Crusty
I don't know why but the new nail polish colors remind me of Yuki and Kyo from Fruits Basket (when Cristine said it was pink I almost fell out of my chair, it looks more purple to me!) and for that reason alone I am most definitely going to buy them!
she said amber
now ben needs a banana polish
😻
Wait, I wanted to see the kids over Not Milky White!
I'm so excited to get zylers polish I love a good copper orange😻
I could not stop laughing 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣l love menchie and zylar ❤️❤️❤️
can i afford to buy nail polish rn, no.... did i buy some anyway? yes.... 🤪
Christine your own trending!!!!!!!!!!!
Uhh christine i would look into the animal abuse petsmart is involved with...
I still have my Menchie and Zyler polishes from Starrily and I cant wait to wear them together and see the differences!🥺 I honestly was so happy seeing them because they’re my favorite colors to wear😭
When there is the ending of the self what takes place? There is a totally different activity, which is not the self. Can I, living in this ugly world, live without the self? Then I begin to inquire, why is there identification?
How this trending? Lol
We can clearly see who the brains of the bunch is😂  No hate menchie😂
Just ordered! Can't wait to embody Menchie and Zyler on my nails. :)
Love Zylers!
We need Beynana nail polish.  🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Cristine plz do cm/m too ;3;
Do you mean a purrrfect pair? ;)
Can I have the Unicorn 🦄 Holo Taco box :) I love the Unicorn Skin nail polishes 💅
Poor Menchie xD
omg
omd I have the same pillows
how would i get one of those collection box because i would love one
Video idea: painting random things in my house holo or multi chrome
I just realised that Holoween won’t be so good this year neither will cristmas
Please when all of this is over, can you do a collab with Lisa Cimorelli? Then also Charles and Penelope can play with Menchie and Zyler it would be the cutest and it’s a collab that i neeeddd🥺
Do you see the zyler floof bean when he tucks his legs up to jump
Yay new polishes!!!!
I always love the idea that she shows the nail polish next to similar colors. It allows us to see the differences  and why we must get them <3
Cristine! Please could you look into lowering international shipping costs? It's currently about three times the price of one nail polish for shipping to the UK 😬
i cant be the only one who was really disappointed with thw fact that the close ups werent of the cats 😭😭😭
"when the traffic light turns amber" - that took me a second for my american ass to register... Thank you Cristine - I will now be calling all yellow lights, Amber.
But does them include cat fur?
Something about that paw of Menchie’s hitting down two nail polish bottles at 6:34 is soooo satisfying
Cristine has pink holo slippers 😂 ❤️
I've noticed a huge thing these past few months. Everyone who are nail biters have finally been able to have long healthy nails because we're wearing masks. You all should be proud of yourselves for breaking a habit(if you had intended to) and celebrate with holo taco polish.
I love this video Cristine!
bare you cross for Jesus. He loves each and everyone of us, but many of us will experience His wrath if we reject Him. although this may be the case, pls do not follow God bc you fear hell. God tells us to love Him with all of our heart (Proverbs 3:5), and He can tell when our love for Him is fake. I hope that you all are reading this with an open mind bc I don't want to force anything on you bc God Himself gave us freewill (Joshua 24:15). I pray that no matter what path you choose, you have nothing but success and happiness in your life. God bless you and stay safe😌💖
Zyler: Athletic  Menchie: Aesthetic
>>Video concept: you buy a load of blank nails and paint each one to create a mosaic on canvas using nail glue.  🤔
i don’t care menchie is a cat but she is dumb team zyler forever
WHAT I was gonna ask my parents if they could get me them but they r 26 buckadoodledies
Now just need to do a banana beeeyyyn
Me asking Christien who do you love more menchie or zulke? Christien: I love both of them the same!  Christie: menchie whit her lovely personality  And zyler whit his Richie catatathoet
I hadn’t clicked on the video yet, just saw the thumbnail aND IMMEDIATELY just went to the website and got Menchie lol
Just ordered them today all the way from Ireland, so happy to finally be able to support and on what better launch ❤️😸
Zyler is such a typical older brother XD
Zyler,  the circus cat. Menchie, too cool for school
I swear I flinch whenever she calls Menchie 😂 my dad gave me that name when I was born, and no I am not 7 lol
How come your channel is called halo toco aswell
Tittle: How many bottles of nail polish can my cats jump over?       609k people: 𝗂𝗇𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗌𝗍𝗂𝗇𝗀
There is a way to level out your audio, especially at spikes. This video is way too loud at parts and distracts me from the video and makes me really frustrated so I stopped watching. No offense in any way..
I've been laughing so loudly that I'm glad my family is out 🤣🤣
You know, if you do something like this, you should start with a smaller obstacle and then stack up, so the cats know what to do 😅
when you started super high and didnt let them work up to it :(
7:07 Just trying to be a good brother.🥰
6:02 reminds me of the “wow! Oh my god!” meme 😂
“Menchie, you are smarter than this!”  Menchie: “D*mn right I am!” *sneaks behind sound board*
I loved zyler and menchie’s nail colors, sooooo pretty. Sad that you don’t ship to my country😔
I love your nail polish but zyler and menchie are more beautiful
I mean I stan responsible and committed business owners as much as the next holosexual, and love Cristine our holo queen, but at this point I can't even differentiate the polishes from each other... Zyler the Cat is very similar to the orange from the rainbow collection, anyone else think so?
8:44 cristine: when the light turns amber me: (in the us) u MeAn YelLow
I can’t buy any of the holo because you don’t ship to Greece. Great.. just fucking great... 😾  Still love you Cristine! And the cats of course! I love all fuuur babies! 😻
Are we just not going to talk about how she (Canadians?) call yellow lights amber???
Hold on. “When it turns amber and you’re not sure if you want to go yet”..? Does it turn yellow before it turns green in Canada?
Cristine, I love you so much, I’ve been following ur tips for long nails and now I’m passing your expertise advice onto those who ask how I grow them that long:) I tell them to watch ur video if they are serious about it. I made the nail oil you told us about and everything. You are my fav
I think there's some bots in the Comments sectionby the way love your cats and thank you for doing good thing for animals
You should have them walk through nailpolish like some videos of cats walking through dominos. It's really interesting how they can pass it without giving it a sweat
I love how she changes the intro for every new launch, soooooo satisfying
Yeah, they're preety clashy, but for a holloweeny mood, I'd say they look good👀💖
zyler is biting ur fingers bc he wants to eat the holo on ur nails bc he wants to make he soul holo
I LOVE THIS!!
Fun fact I was watching this vid then i saw my cat coming because she heard he voice then she started watching I watched so many vids of yours she looked so happy when she watched your vids her name is nemo
Hey may you make all your nail  Polish  lares
BUT the real question is: do you get play rosé if you mix menchie and zyler the cat??? Cristine the Science Queen we need you!
Omg you’re trending! Congrats!
am i imajenating this or not
Have you ever thought about making any gel polish? I love the colors and want to be able to use them for a manicure but I prefer gel 😢😢
I am not getting your videoes in my email anymore please help me get them back I love your vids
Proverbs 6:16-19 lists 7 things which are also abominations, "haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief, a false witness who utters lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers"
Did she say that the GREEN LIGHT OS AMNER??????!!!!????? I see it tho
Am I the only one who thought of holo cato?
omg u should do nail vinyls, but like holoween addition
Omg please do more cat videos this was HILARIOUS
I love Dogg and cats  but dogs more 1 % I'm kicking I love both the same I have a dog and he's 4 and his name is gizmo
Zyler is Large and in charge😏😎😆
I love your cat's  and nail polish
OMG GUYS! Remember black holo witch... holo taco needs to make a black holo glitter ASAP. I need to fulfill my dream of being a sparkly emo.
Hopefully you will develop a few more “neutrals” in future collections - I love how pretty the holos are, but I lean more neutral for my every day!
We Stan a kitty king
I would buy your nail polish but my parents say that it's to expensive
Ok but when are we getting a new version of the black Holo witch !! I appreciate trying not to dupe the orginal collab but black holo is a staple and we need it!!!
Your pillow  looks like a skull
Why go over the wall when I can just move the soundboard 😆
"WhEn YoU cOmE uP tO a TrAfFiC sToP aNd It TuRnS aMbEr"
Only Cristine would....
One day I would love to see an intro made with every single holo taco release.
You should stack the nail polish boxes sideways, and put bottles  on top and have the cat's choose your polishes again
Girl.U alright? U sound depressed.U need help?
🖕
When I can get a lot of Money I am going to buy all your products rainbow collection and the cats collection and all your nailbpolish and glossy top coat and all all products I love your wonderful creation congratulations I am 64 Years old and I fall un love with Holo Taco I admire you you are very young so iam from Bogotá Colombia South América again congratulations kisses and have beautiful week
OHMYGOD THANK YOU CRISTINE!!
do the OGs remember her collab polishes with FUN lacquer? (holo queen, how deep is ur holo, holo witch) she should totally recreate these for holo taco
They ARE smarter, going sideways and knocking the boxes down for the other! Those new nailpolish colours and boxes are super cute ! And the charity you chose seems awesome, I support toi!
Me: Wouldn't it be cool if when you put the boxes together they form a picture of a cat?  CRISTINE: >>slams boxes together<<  Me:>>clicks the link below and buys polish<<🤣🤣🤣
Now BeEeEeEeEeEen needs a yellow banana polish.
I keep seeing polish mountian videos on tiktok
Good to know I'm not the only human who has to spell out t-r-e-a-t-s so my cats and dogs dont get the wrong idea-
CRISTINE! can you do overnight oat nail art!!!!
Can you make a box that you can create? Like Peel, color, and taco type? Thank would be awesome!!!!
I love how she introduces herself as Christine every video Like who else would I be watching
can you give me chicken nuggets from canada ?
Awww Zyler wanted to help his sister by knocking a few off the top hehhe <3
Cristine: Together, they make a kitty cat. This is why you need to get both.  Me: *You had me at cattitude*
omg i put the vid on the tv in front of my family and the starting where cristine said "JUMMMMPP JUMMMMMP" sounded like I was watching a horror movie
Eidelouk is Beautifully  de colour  brown nagel 💅🏽 glas glinder I’m like in love  de prise iT hoger kosting beauty prise for colour van cat🐈
Most boring video ever
Someone has been watching Kittisaurus videos
Can you make an iridescent/unicorn nail polish!
Literally 😇 the 1% who's reading may your parents live more than 100  years with good health👨‍👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👨‍👧‍👦💕💕
This is the best product reveal EVER, periodt
Cristine when Zyler throws the polishes down:  HEY!! Zyler: What? I'm just problem solving...
Did she just call a yellow light “amber” 😂❤️
A shame that you didn't name this collection "holo cato", but I still love it! The video gave me a boost of serotonin! I just wanted to ask about something without sounding mean, just as a foster cats mom: both Menchie and Zyler wear collars which can be very dangerous for cats, and the bells can damage cat's hearing. Again, I don't want to hate or anything but to share my knowledge in that matter.
Menchie has literally never worked for anything in her life, so she doesn't know what to do
Snowflake
When will you get another fur baby
My cat loves glittery stuff so this will help. :)
Why is this one of the most popular videos in YouTube?
Well... my dogs would have done the same. Why do what you ask when you can do it in a easier (or more fun) way ;)
cats are not very big brain but they sure are cute
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18
The menchie nail polish looks like a diamond  :0
Hey random person .. hope you are doing good...  Wish you guys will  watch my cooking video & help me to become a good chef ...!! Please thanks 😊🙏🌈

Wtf lol
The Wario Apparition dreams edition. https://youtu.be/DqozgvoHCVQ
If this wouldn’t be to hard.... for us people who don’t get the calab nail polishes, what if you created them in hollow taco like Black Hollow which as an example. I personally did not get any of the calab of nail polish is so I think it would be nice if people who actually didn’t get them like me had a second chance to get them.
I've never heard someone describe the traffic light as Amber. We just call it Yellow in America. This is why Canadians are better.
https://youtu.be/B_hbJRNInkA
Lmao my cat ran over to my laptop when you started shaking the treats
okay just listen to me... a gradient with... menchie, play rose and zyler!!
I have the starrily menchie and zyler varnish. My question is what is the difference between the original and these? Have you just remade them in your own brand
Wasn't planning on getting these since I don't use nail polish that often... but the second she said a portion was going to charity I bought them immediately.. you are the best!! 😻😸
would love to get a close up on the cats tho
Hello youtube viewers! You all look absolutely amazing today!      Remember to stay hydrated today!❤️
6:01 ZYLER IS INCREDIBLE!!! I did NOT think he was going to be able to do it! AWESOME!!!😳👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾✨
All the events in your life up until now have led you to read this comment, might as well like
Cristine, may I please have the left over empty collection boxes pleeeaasseee lol, just bought over $300 of Holo taco within 2 days lol
I wish I had the money to buy the polishes rn 🥺 I both love the polishes and wanna support cause I got multiple of my pets at petsmart
I kinda like the old arrangement of her polishes according to brand than color. Is it just me? I still love simplynailogical though YAAASSS CRISTINE LOVE YOUUUU
Give them a channel called Simply Catlogical-
Do Canadians say green,  AMBER, red for traffic lights???!? Instead of green, yellow,  red!!!??!!?!
Of course Zyler could jump with no problems! He went to college!
New intro?
I’ve been waiting for kitty polishes to drop for SOO LONG. You’re damned right I ordered them 😂💖 and a file...I got a file for when my nails decide they no longer want to be stubs 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
look at that, cristine actually got on trending
Can we expect something similar to Black Holo Witch in the future I wonder? 😉
I love the colors of the holo taco of the cat’s
Hi I am a fiance of a lovely lady who has bought every halo taco release. And has every collection box minus the unicorn skin collection box. We wanna show off her collection. But i am hoping to get that box so if you have an empty one like in this video would there be anyway to get one pleeeeeease we are subscribed and watch you together all the time.
Holo taco mountain next ?
Soo... Since she's released this mail polish... When is she gonna bring back the cat nail vinyls?? Cause I used up all mine and I would love to get more. https://youtu.be/FBSWTiaouPI

Ok so I have to ask if any of you have heard of HoloLive and I wonder if any of them would love Holo Taco if I was better at Japanese I’d sub this and show them
Hi Cristine every Day me and my cat are waching your videos he name is Suzana but we are calling her Suzi
Dear strangers, hope y'all are doing great in this pandemic. Stay safe, Stay healthy❤️❤️❤️
I love all this cat content! It makes my heart so happy. 🧡💕 Zyler and Menchie were so cute and clever!!! Zyler is such an athletic boy when properly motivated. Menchie wants to get help from big brother Zyler so he knocks over the boxes for her. Of course, he took her easy treat for himself as payment... Menchie was sad but had to accept the choice she made lol.
Holo Taco? More like Holo Cato, amiright, fellas?
Are Canadian yellow stoplights amber? Also, I cant wait to start my job to buy Zyler the cat nail polish!!!!! And to save the world but after I do my nails ofc
Is you shop free shipping or no?
CRISTINE!!!! MAKE ANOTHER POLISH MOUNTAIN BUT EACH FINGER IS ONE COLOR OF THE RAINBOW AND THE TOP COATS CAN BE YOUR RAIBOW HOLO TACO SHADES!!!!!!! LIKE IF AGREE!!!!!
Cristine is the only YouTuber I don’t skip ahead 😭❤️
How come there isn’t a Ben-nana yellow yet??
CAN YOU TAKE A DROP OF EVERY SPARKLY HOLO TACO AND MIX IT??????????????
Can you try out Dixie and Charli D’ameleos new nail polish line??
Do you think you can come out with some Holo Taco nail oil?
“Want to see Zyler catch a treat directly in his mouth?” Um yes! Yes I do!! 😅 my golden retriever can’t even do that, if you toss a treat at her she will let it hit her directly in the face
I am poor bitch and am 10 I wish I could get Holo taco ( me crying)
CRISTINE YOU NEED TO MAKE  HOLO NAIL POLISH FOR DOGS
The b&w menchie 😂
Do they call yellow traffic lights amber in Canada?
I love them together 🥺
Is it normal to call the yellow lights "amber" in canada?? seems classy af im going to start calling them that too
There should be a pride collection in june next year...  :)
Half of the video is an ad and the other half a different kind of guess what...an ad!
Omg omg your babies are sooooooo sweet adorable   & smart.   😻😻😻😻😻😻😻❤️❤️😽💕💕😽
12:57 her nails are not that yellow anymore
#menchiehairiseverywhere
Please don't support PetSmart. They discriminate against dog breeds like pitbulls for example. Petco however welcomes all breeds
Me On my way to but like six of each becux her cats are so cute
Did you just say your traffic lights are amber?? They’re not yellow?
i think its cute, but ill admit i still kinda miss the old nail art videos. still gonna hold out tho
7:08  Brother and sister VS mom
Rachel and Jun have left the chat..
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. Non-Duality ✌️
I think simply should try color changing nail polish
Zyler likes to show off poor menchie
Cristine and Ben need to get two more cats so we can have a whole Kitty Holo Taco Collection box
Me: really wants Menchie and Zyler Holo taco nails Also me: cries in British, as shipment to UK is more expensive than the both holo tacos combined
Cristine: “ you can get them right meow” Zyler and Menchie: “ did she just talk to us?” btw hows no one talking about how every influencer is using northfy to grow on yt and ig
https://youtu.be/9G6IwF8f9nw listen to the song
6:16 STAAAAMINAAAAAA LIKE MOMO FROM KITTYSAURUS

Happy Hi ❣️💞💓💗💖💖🤗🤗😀
My girlfriend is not a girly girl, she doesn't paint her nails or wear makeup, but she showed me this channel and loves watching you because she loves your personality. This channel is her guilty pleasure and no one else knows she watches it, thank you for bringing some joy to her life. Maybe she will see this comment, maybe itll get buried, but if she does....I love you, and thank you for being you <3
They look just like the ones she released with live love polish :( sadly I already have those. So can I justify buying these as well?
Didn’t she collaborate with Live Love Polish and came out with almost exact shades named after Menchie and Zyler?
What is up cool and rad math lovers ? I’m sort of a major math youtuber in the vein of the Jurassic Park Jeff Goldblum chaos theory. You must come watch my new #megafavnumbers video and become enlightened!! —CodyTheKingOfYoutube
Zyler has excellent form. Tucks his toebeans beautifully. The Great Cat Army  gives him high marks
https://youtu.be/bwDztoI9Ys8
When is Ben getting his own yellow crème polish? Can call it Benanas Foster.
Menchie’s too smart for a wall- she’ll just take the wall down rather than jump over it!! Also, I want close ups of Menchie & Zyler...the cats, not the polish!😹
To make the joke last longer how about a yellow polish for ben 😂🍌
Am I the only one that expected the cats to behave the opposite?
How about a beYyyyN hOlO Tacoo? Anybodyy?? Ok nope.
I've never heard someone call the yellow light on traffic lights "amber"
I broke my nail yesterday and the break was just like yours deep inside my finger and I have filed it down and an waiting for it to grow out. As soon as it broke I just thought of you
I just bought my rainbow collection and I was wondering what's the difference in formula with base coat and the topcoat they looked the same?
Thank you for the color comparison. It was nice to see how these new colors compared to current colors.
I just ordered the cat duo, purple, green and solar unicorn skin . I’m soooo excited!!
I got the blue frezzie nail polish
Yay!!! #simply is trending!!
Is the holo visible under an android flash? Or are we left out?🤔
#26 ON TRENDING WHOO HOO!
they look amazing, ive really been waiting for these ! <3 trust me no one thinks they are dupes <3
https://youtu.be/amIxZ4tsHtw
Pet Smart sells sick animals. Every time I go, the cats are sick and have diarrhea and are awful looking
Just ordered my kitty polish!!
Pleaseeeee make a Fall polish line! Or Halloween!
No offense but Petsmart sucks! They sell animals but don’t always sell the supplies for those animals. They often don’t give proper care information. You can’t prove their animals were ethically sourced and so on. I think there are charities out there that help more without supporting a company like this one. Local charities are the best ones if you want to make sure your money actually goes to the animals.
To the person who is reading this :  You are amazing stay blessed stay safe and have a wonderful day
I still have both of the starrily versions but I’m so happy that you made these polishes for holo taco. I was really concerned when you said that those versions were no longer in production because I love the colors so much, but now I can restock with the Holo taco versions!
She should have put a treat on Ben's shoulder for Menchie
4:29 that leg 🤣🤣🤣
Menchie just knows that's too much work for treats, because you are going to give some after anyway.
I just ordered the rainbow set yesterday and I’m sooo excited for them to arrive 🥰 will there be a duo chrome holo taco line? Or just holooo
Can they eat it
I forgot that holo taco was holographic top coat
I wanted to buy the nailpolish but the shipping was suuuuuper expesive because i live in the Netherlands
I just ordered menchie polish, this is my first ever order im so happy i could finally afford a polish. I hope she jumped over the one ill receive lol, i love cats!
The cat dialogue makes me laugh out loud like the loser that I am. 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
the intro doesn’t line up and it makes me so sad
Wait are you doing a fall collection?
Menchie doesn’t need skills with those looks 😂😍
Olivia is happy love
Next question: how many oats till Ben throws up
Who else notice when zyler knocked over boxes and hit menchie in the face
GO STREAM BTS DYNAMITE
For your next video you should pick two peelies out of your peely bag and try to combine the styles of the nail arts together
Trending :D
Too good I love it you get millions of view non your video  Some music for you https://youtu.be/JMpE3BdZ-rE
One bottle of Menchie, and some Not Milky White ordered! Can’t wait for it to arrive to London 😊 💅🏼
AHHHHHHHHHHHH I BOUGHT THE CAT NAIL POLISH CRISTINEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEKK IM SO HAPPYYYY
I love your vidios ☺
Dogs are better than cats
I really want one but it can’t ship to Australia. I am dying without having Menchie and Zyler the cat
To be fair, Menchi did find a way through the door without jumping.
Am I the only indian here😅😅 I want to buy holo taco😍😍
Simply, this is exactly what I needed. Thank you.
I know for legal reasons she probably can't do it, but I'd love to see a side by side comparison of the old "can I say the brand?" lacquer with the new Holo Taco versions.
This is big Jenna Marbles energy
You should make ben and Christine holo taco one
I thought I saw "i jump over my own nail polish" only at the start did I realise it was zyler and menchie
I went to order these because they’re BEAUTIFUL but shipping costs $30 to the UK whyyyyyyy 😭😭😭
Can i get these in india?? 😍😍😍😍
I really love your cats nail polishes - they look so beautiful - and you're on 50th place in YouTube trends
Okay, *100 layer of my holotaco polishes.* I hope that's gonna ages well Cristine💀
Omg Do a Ben one a banana one lol
Menchi is just the cutest little bean I love her so much. And just the immense sass of zyler is just amazing🥰
Love you, but please stop using the Lord's name... You're better than that.
Who else is waiting for Cristine to get Tik Tok 🤔
Any one notice that the collection Bowes she had next to her had space for four polishes and not 3, 7, or 5. Are we seeing the collection box of a new collection? 👀 👀 we see u Cristine...
At least it's somewhat related to nail polish? Right?
beyyyn is becoming an actual dad
https://youtu.be/fKlvwPRh-ok Do you think you are born again just because you go to a church?  Not all churches declare the Truth. On the contrary, your church could be a completely worldly church. For your own soul, you must come out of the churches that use the Bible but do not declare the Truth and speak lies differing from the bible. Hear what the Spirit of Truth says to the churches and receive the eternal gospel!!!!!
Tho I'm sure it's harder to jump over something than on top of something, regarding that "but she can jump on top of kitchen counters"
did she call a yellow light amber?
7:13 zyler was like "Alexa play DISREPECT YOUR SURROUNDINGS!!!!"
Now just waiting for some tea polishes😮
Poor menchie😂😂
Alternate title: zyler being a bully to menchie
Why aren't you shipping to India
Dude! You should have gone with HOLO CATO! Come man!
That baby pink Menchie color is perfect for me. AND money goes to help other animals? Yep, boyfriend gonna kill me when it comes in, haha.
I would have wanted to try throwing the treat in the hallway and see if that way they realise they can also go that way :D Very cute kitties <3
BROOOO AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO IS WAITING FOR HER FAV OATS RECIPE? 😂😂😂💜
I saw the thumbnail and thought Cristine cut her hair for a second😭💀
How much of the proceeds are actually going to charity?
The nail polishes together make a cat on the box 🥺
I'm so in love with all these polishes!! I really want them all!! Is shipping to Portugal possible?? I don't see it listed on the "WHERE DO WE SHIP TO?" page (if it is possible, I'm gonna be so broke.. but so happy!)
Hope she will make cat nail vynil and cat glitter to complement the nail polish 🥰❤️
Do you have a black hoop glitter yet? So excited for these colours :3
She watched Kittiesaurus!!! Claire and her 7 (+3 now) flooff angels!!!
i just order today from your holo taco web duo and glossy taco .. previous buy mine got lost in trip :(
Holo Cristine! Fellow holosexual here 💿 Do you think some day you’ll be selling nail brushes for doing nail art on Holo Taco? I’ve been looking everywhere for brushes that don’t shed and stuff like that. Just a suggestion. 😁
7:17 I wish my cat could do that
I actually hate pink....but because she is a sweetheart I had to get both!
I think Menchie would have jumped if you didn't start with a tall wall, but rather start with one coat of wall, so she sees nothing bad happens when jumping over, then slowly build until she jumps into the unknown...cause I don't think she could really see on what she's landing, so it's pretty normal to not want to jump. Still loved the video, your cats make me want to get one too...but I don't know if my dog would be too excited...
Menchie the cat shade is so gorgeee
4:32 BEEYYYYYYNNNNNNNNNN
Can u make a video with these Polishes over different colors like u did with one coat black
please make a video on making base coat at home with food products plsss🙏
DId i just spent $107.00 (95€) including $30 shipping on nail polish? Maybe..
Maybe if possible you could use the pspspspspspspsp sound I think cats like that sound- Idk if it is true but ehh
I haven’t used nail polish since I was like 5 (40+ now) but that Menchie holotaco... BRING IT! 😍🌸
holo taco nail polish mountain?
SHIP TO INDIA ALREADY!!!!!
Amazing
All I could see in these colors are Daphne and Velma from Scooby Doo
Are you going to make Gel polish? I hate waiting for regular polish to dry 😂
Please recreate Holoween cat nail art
This looks so familiar
Cringe and boring !!!
Zyler is being real boss in this vid. 🤣🤣🤣 So fun to watch. 🧡💖
I think Menchie is cristines favorite cat
You should have started making them jump only one box, then two, so on and so forth. Stacking them really high off the bat seems like they're kinda confused on what to do.
Who wanted a menchie and zyler collection box too?
doesn't the Menchie polish look lavender? Shit I think I'm blind sksksksk
Still waiting for mint chocolate overnight oats 🤭😂
Who wants Cristine to play with slime and how many nail polishes can she put in before sticky Cristine the science queen biatchhhh
6:18 I've never heard her raise her voice especially at her cats. It scared the shit outta me 😂
I want to buy all the holo.... But sadly I'm in South Africa and you guys don't ship here
The only cats in the world that have their own nail polish 😹  I love the colours 😻 and it's also for a good cause! It cannot get any better than that!! Adopt don't shop friends 🐾😺
I still have my expired zyler and I refuse to throw it out 😭 IM SO HAPPY FOR THIS
I had a dream that Cristine upload a video in which she tried a nailart from like 8 years ago and then that cause me to time travel to that time (??) and then I cried because I didn’t have my dogs so I went out to find them...
oh no oh wait: if she is stacking nail polish, is this a return to polish mountain?
Please let the UK buy holo taco!!
More cat videos are always welcomed with open arms!! Especially when its in support of animal charities.    The polishes look beautiful  and I love the box details!
wasn’t there already a menchie and zyler nail polish, made by cristine and another brand?
i just want these nailpolishes in europe pleaaaseeee, I live in the UK and the shipping is $30 :((
can Cristine review Charli and Dixie D’amelio’s new nail polishes with Orosa??
Wait isn't PetSmart bad??
;)
That's probably the most random idea
Top 7 https://youtu.be/GUzZIu6k5BY
This video made me so happy 😊
Can Ben get his own channel please I would love that 🙏🙏🥺
i feel bad for menchie the cat
I was so bored over quarantine I gave my cat a kitty spa day (massage, treats, new toys) so feel free to make that content😂
I mean, you can talk about nutrition and I’d still be interested.
This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures  We are in the last days according to the Bible. Do you know if you're going to Heaven? Are you a sinner? Repent, trust Jesus and God will give you everlasting life.  John 3:16 says For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life
I always love the creativity that goes into your videos, it's always entertaining, lol. Also, your cats are absolutely adorable! And quite purr-fect.
I think you should do a nail pollish for ben!!!
BaaAaAaa BaaAaAaa Bleat BaaAaAaa Bleat Bleat BaaAaAaa BaaAaAaa Bleat BaaAaAaa   Corona + 5G = COVID 19 (C)ovid (O)f (V)acination (I)dentification 19 = AI  This is just the tip of the iceberg folks!

When you come to a traffic stop and it turns amber?? Lmaoo I thought it was just yellow
Why is the quality of the video/camera is so low?
NOOOOOO!!! DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM TO JUMP OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE!!😱
GUYS IM SO HAPPY I GOT MY FIRST REAL HOLO NAILPOLISH TODAY
Can we have a Crusty holo topcoat ?
zylers polish would be perfect for halloween 🎃
Me crying over the video because my cat just died yesterday
Ok, but sunflower yellow nail polish or a blackberry-ish color? 👀✨✨
THANK YOU!!! This is just what I wanted for my birthday! 🎉🎈🎁💅🏻 I've been lusting after (okay, creepy wording but not exactly incorrect) these shades ever since they sold out on *that-other-company's* site. I'm SO happy that you made them & I hope they're going to be part of the standard collection! Yeah, I should probably WATCH the video now... P.S. THANK YOU!!!💖🧡💕🧡💗
Damn Menchie really defined work smart not hard
Omg the zyler nail polish It’s the perfect Halloween orange
Who agrees that we need a HOLOWEEN inspired nail art tutorial using Zyler the cat and 1 coat black!!!
I love what this channel has turned into

So my birthday is October 4th and I'm wondering if the rainbow collection will be still available till my b day I don't know if I can get it cause my family is financealy challenged but pls awnser back jave a great day!
I squeed so loud when i saw the matching cat shapes on the boxes i scared my cat
I love how menchie nail polish looks
I can’t be the only one that clapped for zyler when he caught that treat! 🤣
You should make a simplycat logical
If only HoloTaco had a nudes Holo range 😜 I really don't like colour polishes cause they always look terrible with my skin tone, but a Holo full coverage nude shade! I would totally pay for it to ship to NZ
Bought the products before even watching this video 😊😊
Bought em. Can't wait ♡♡♡♡
Have you not watched any of the cat jumping videos??? You gotta start small!
Did anyone else notice how happy Cristine looked while showing her new polishes?  Just watching her made me smile and brightened my day.  (Plus she released them on my bday - so happy bday to me!  New polish for my collection!  yay!)
I had hoped that there would be a comparison between the old collab formula with this new one with holo taco <3
Saving up for the inevitable future multi chrome drop. Literally can’t wait
4:28 is he climbing through a window?
I’ve been feeling really down lately and this is exactly the kind of content I needed  Thank you Cristine ❤️  PS: thank you so much for donating to the petsmart charities! They helped the animal shelter I volunteer at by donating food and toys!!
4:23 if this was a arrested development reference I’m here for it
Why did i think these polishes were FOR CATS 😂😂
Yall know paint pouring? How bout Cristine tries nail polish pouring
Is a yellow light called an amber light in Canada      👁👄👁
I’m so sad bc holotaco don’t ship to Chile 🇨🇱 😿
“Jump. Jump. JUUUMMPP” i didn’t need this video but I’m glad she made it LMAOO
I really want to see her do a stencil thing of that cat outline printed on the bottles. I'm thinking menchie and zyler colored outlines surrounded by one coat black?
This time on holoween Cristine can dress up Ben into a pumpkin 😂
Good video
I hope she remakes black holo witch, how deep is your holo and holo queen. so glad to see these classics in her formula!
That zyler nail polish is literally what I’ve been searching for. I can’t ever find a good orange holo 😭
T.T are you shipping to mexico yet? man i really want like every polish you sell
Omg zyler is like an emo kid from 2007 😂😂
Please try Charli damelio’s new nail polish collection
I would like to see a side-by-side comparison of the old Menchie and Zyler polishes with these new ones, I don't know if that's possible though.
Cristine,  I'm so excited for this launch and I always look forward to your videos. I'm so proud of you!  Love you and I hope everyone has a wonderful day! 🙃
I've been SO curious about this new, TOP secret product you've been hiding . . . I should have guessed that it would be about your kids!!  How wonderful!      🍁🍂    💅    😻😺    💅   🌸💮
Oh my gosh!!!  I'm so excited!  I love these colors and love the Zyler and Menchie!  I am so happy!  I can't wait to get them

Love it! Next we got to do the black holo!!

Wait, “light turns ‘amber’”??  Are yellow lights called amber in Canada? Canada is so much better than the USA
she really just said amber instead of yellow
Yoo, a gradient from Zyler the cat to play rosé to menchie... 👌🏻
I keep getting crossed eye every time she do a polish close up I guess it's the power of HOLO
Gurl, she really said amber.. I'm kinda down
This the kitty cat content I have been waiting for my whole life 😆😆😆😆💀💀💀💀💀💀 but thank you for not making this limited edition!!
You should make a BEYYYN Yellow Holo Nail polish and the sparkles can be banana shaped 😁🍌
But why tho???
I want to see a close up of the cats though. Show me the kitties.
I LOVE how informative you've made this video! Its nice to see the comparisons with others in your line and your tips for these thanks !!
Amazing Contents of video
You should have ben do your nails again but give instructions by saying his name
Holotaco polish mountain 👀
May or may not have paused the video 1 min in to purchase the menchie polish 👀👀👀
Who wants Cristine make a “mix all of my holotaco polishes together” video🙏🏻🙏🏻💖🥺
Not gonna lie, when she said "who wants some close ups of menchie and zyler" I was all ready and then she clarified the nail polish and now I'm disappointed.

Zyler's Holo Taco Nail Polish Is Amazing! It Is Great For Fall! I Also Love Menchie's It Looks Great For Valentine's Day! They Are Amazing And Your Cats Are Hilarious And Adorable!🐈💕
Shes the new Jenna but with cats.
Make a  nail art with your cat polish
I’d really love to try your brand, I love the colours you’ve come up with and it looks great but shipping over here is impossible 😔
After watching Rachel and Jun's cats jump over toilet paper, I love seeing these two jump over polishes.
I love that this is trending. They knew this was the video everyone needed
Are these limited edition?! 🤔🤔🤔 I love how the kitties have their nail polishes again! 🥰😍
Hey Cristine I have super soft nails for my age and I was wondering what would you do? Gel won’t even stay on for more than 4 days. Acrylic nails barely last 1. Idk what to do!!
For anyone who has Google play and gets the play points, you can use them to donate to many different animal causes and others!!! I love using my points for them, I fastpass a lot on webtoon and play much pokemon go (at home safely/take advantage when I go get groceries/errands) stay safe out there everyone 🖤🖤🖤
I just bought my Zyler and Menchie I missed out first time round. 😻
is Zyler a mix of Zach & Tyler???👁👄👁idk why i never thought to ask😳
Hey simply, I was wondering if you could inculed diffent shipping options for people in Canada or even Ontario. I'm asking this because I live 2 hours away from you but I would have to pay 14 dollars in shipping for international shipping. I'm just a kid I can't pay 14 bucks for shipping, it's totally ok if you can't do this. I understand that things like this can be complicated, it's just now I'm really sad cause I don't get to try zylers new polish, (I would have bought menchies too but I only had 25 bucks, that's why I was disappointed with the shipping price, cause I No longer had enough) if you read this thank you, and I hope you consider this.
You made my cat come running at the sound of the treats 😆
Taking inspiration from all the Kittisaurus binge watching I see - i love it!
Zyler is such a puppy 😂💕
Damn is that James Charles??
I really want your polishes to use but I use gels, would you ever bring out gels at all? I might still have to get them as a collection piece xxx

Me and my mom nearly died  when it came out and we amenity got it
You should make a holo polish for Ripley in remembrance of when she humped your arms 😄🤣
Wow I didn’t the trending page is this bad
Top 10 anime betrayals : when Zyler took the treat
For October you should do polish from the colors of orange and yellow and December with red white and green
My cats hear the treats being shook and are going nuts lmao
Wow here I was doubting Zyler and he did it first
Today I learnt that Americans call the amber traffic light yellow and they are very concerned about the rest of us
7:18 ma’am that’s a dog
I don't think I've ever seen Zyler so active before in a video lol usually it's Menchie
I got an ad for a DIFFERENT nail polish company! Blasphemy!
So excited! Just been waiting for a gem like this to place my first order. And it even came in time to still be ale to grab one of the anniversery <3 Totally gonna do a gradient with those pretties and play rose.
Hi yall can you do me a rover and dislike this comment? I want to know if I get notifications or something
(Not sure I’d recommend Petsmart for charity btw, at least here in America they’re pretty well known for being inhumane and in the time I worked for them I witnessed some stuff I really disapproved of)
When tf are we getting another peel porn compilation
congrats 7 on trending
Zyler: "I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR FOOD!" Menchie: "Do I really want to go through all that work?"
We love an unproblematic, holo, cat mama 💕

You finally made a pink Halo Taco!!!
I’ve literally never purchased something so fast. I saw that beautiful orange and got so excited for Halloween. Immediate purchase
My family and I had to put down our baby boy a couple weeks ago and it's been super hard. Just seeing your babies play and goof around just makes my heart warm. Linkie was also adopted from petsmart, so it's nice that you're supporting them as well
Your cats just proved that they're smarter and more athletic than me. 😅

Can you do a pastel collection
Waiting to get a job so that I can buy all Holo Taco nail polish!
Cristine
Just ordered Menchie (and a few other goodies)! Super excited!
Who else thinks Ben should get his own nail polish
We keep seeing holo tools... maybe that means they're coming soon 🧐🤨🤔👀
i keep all my polishes in their boxes :)
Menchie and zylers vet watching Cristine give her cats so many treats like "No stop stop soooooo christine!!!!!!!!!"
I love how in the disclaimer, Christine implies that someone could force a cat to do literally anything.
You definitely need to ship to Costa Rica!
Went to buy the polishes and spent $70, whoops
Yes I did just spend $130 Australia dollars on more Holo Taco 😂🥰
Just put in my order now! So excited! My new kitten looks just like Zyler, so I’m excited to have a nail polish that matches his vibes😻
Help. I finally have the rainbow and others in my cart but still no AfterPay in Australia  😭
I think that the two shades look cool together...I've always dug pink and orange together.
This channel really do be living up to its name, which is why I stick around 😂😂
Zyler comes through!!!
Can I ask a question? Love you channel! Love your polishes, but I am a nurse. And everytime I use the polish and then work with one use of the hand sanitizer my polish is gone. I use the long lasting base, no peeling polish here, and I top coat and I still am having the problem. It doesn’t chip, it literally peels off. Any tips? Thank you! Just ordered my Cat Polishes to wear on my toes and days off!
What is the difference between zylers polish and the orange that is in the rainbow collection?
And menchie will do a training arc after this
Its Lilacc

You just got even cooler by donating a portion of sales to animals in need! I love it when influencers use their platforms for good causes! If I could like the video 12 times I totally would! 😆😻😺💕

The new nail polish is soooo cute but sadly i cant buy because im a boy and also where is the peel porn
Cristine: These colors aren’t meant to be worn together  Me: oooooh pretty 👁👄👁

I’m so excited for the cats polish i already have them on my shopping list
When will the protective peel nail polish of yours be back I want it please respond I love you
Ordered already! My first box set!
Oh yesssss!!! These two colors are gorgeous!! Just allow me two days to ask my parents for money😂😂
Finally got to order some holo polish !!! 14 days and counting 👍
But...Ben deserves his own nail Polish too 😃
I bought the polish this morning before seeing the video! I'm so excited! I didn't know it donated to charities, but I am so happy that I bought both now!

You can tell she’s excited for the polishes lol
Highly approve of the PetSmart choice. They work with the best and humane independent cat shelters in local areas and are currently supporting them during quarantine as they are not facilitating adoptions in stores.
Cristine: *shakes treat container* *all three of my cats come running and meow*
new idea paint you cats nails  with eachothers nail polish nand also for you youn should drink tea for 24 hours staright
I live in india you came in my dream bcus..  I watch lot of your vdios.... omg......... you said, i can click a picture with you but my mom woke me up I'm seeing your vedio now
Mom, dad, I'm scared.
Zyler is a boss!
welcome to : zyler acting like he's a starving child for 14 minutes
THE COLORS DEF MATCH!! reminds me of 70s colorways 😍
you should make a ben holo taco collection
Ahhh! I just ordered the Holiday collection yesterday! Now I'll have to pay shipping when I order these. Sad face.
I love seeing more of Zyler's personality :)
lol sold out of the duo... NEXT TIME XD
What I wouldn’t give for one of those unicorn skin collection boxes. Been trying to get one for months!!
“turns amber”
are we not gonna talk about the fact that she called a yellow light “amber”  edit: okay a lot of people actually mentioned this before me so if you see this no you didn’t❤️
The fact your cat can catch a treat in its mouth has me gobsmacked 😱  I’m now attempting to train my cat and she just got the shits and bit me instead 😂
Zyler would do anything for food, I absolutely love it.
THE ORANGE ONE IS EVERYTHING FOR *HALOWEEN*
I just lost my cat yesterday , your video made my happy thank you
fyi petsmarts massive suppliers get lizards and other small animals shipped in WATER BOTTLES  and various other very small plastic containers and most are DEAD upon arrival and so so so many other terrible things... worst of all i believe they sold me a sick bearded dragon which resulted in hefty vet bills:( i know you adopted Menchie from petsmart and the adoption of larger animals is very different from purchasing lizards ect  but it did hurt my heart when you mentioned proceeds will be going to petsmart :/
this is the exact reason i have dogs
Ahhhh, good ole Canadian “amber” lights
Lesson learned: Zyler is a talented brat 😂
Ahhh!! I work for PetSmart!! Holo Taco and PetSmart collide!!
When the traffic light turns amber...it took me a second lol
Just ordered Menchie's color!  Been listening to Simplypodlogical too.  Thanks Cristine and Ben!
Is it just me or are you the FRICKING BEST LIKEEE YOU GIVE ME MY CONFIDENCE 😌👌🏻
did you just refer to a yellow light as amber???😂😂
I love them so much. You are a really nice person.
Menchie could have her own brand of cheese... Mencheese... just throwing it out there

Everytime i go get holo taco it’s always sold out!!! I’m soooo bummed D:

Zyler : menchie we cant get the treats there is a wall you idiot Menchie : watch and learn brother *smashes down wall*
cristine should try painting menchie or zyler's nails with their own polish
Lol zyler is on it...
I love how sweet you are to other animals and your own. It’s very pure and heartwarming 😭💕
I actually applauded like a grandma at a school play when Zyler jumped over!
I can't I've never had cats because my dad allergic but when I move out you know I'm getting a cat 😭 they are so full of personality
Zyler taking the treat from Menchie is like the year 2020 for the rest of us.

Zyler is the bae. I love him.

Ten hours after this video was posted the polish is sold out
I don’t want to offend anybody but zyler looks a little bit chubby from that angle
Zyler and Menchie are savage! I love it!
This was awesome! Zyler was trying to show Menchie how its done, but she was having none of it. Totally got both nail polishes as well as the anniversary polishes and some other stuff! I love your polishes! I am not an orange or a pink person, but I wear them all on my nails because they are just so darn amazing! a little pop of color to warm my dark alternative heart.

They sold out 😭😭😭
4:20 Being someone with dyslexia  you spelling treats actually took me a while to process  I think menchie  understood it before I did
You made me laugh SO MUCH    Thank you.

Oh my gosh the combo for both polishes is already sold out! That's crazy!
How about making nail polish color base on your family?
You should make a cat-themed nail polish collection.🐱💿

Suprised no one is talking about her comment of Amber being a color of a spotlight?
I love the new cat polish’s but for some reason I definitely think zylers should be all blacks or a very dark blue/purple  PS I’m definitely gonna get them
When the traffic stop turns AMBER?!? Ummm why am I just now learning you guys don’t say when the stoplight turns yellow???
Wait wait wait..... you pull up to a traffic stop and it turns “amber”??!  Is that what Canadians call a yellow light ???
Well at least we know who is going to get a Sports grant for college.
BbbbbbBbbbbBbbBeeeeEeeEeeEnnNnnNnnNnNn leaves you alone for one day and this is what you get into
Did anyone catch the fact she said that traffic lights turn amber ? I’m so confused about this someone please explain
Your videos are so entertaining you were such a great role models in really are the mom and dad‘s of YouTube. You are such a great long hair to look up to and I never thought i would say that. You have gottEn me through a lot of rough times and make me laugh and days where I put on. Keep doing your Nail art videos That made me think about actually and surprisingly painting my nails and whatever this is. :)
I love you Cristine, but please don't support Petsmart. They treat their animals horribly and recommend unfit products to unsuspecting customers. Their rodents especially are kept in horrible conditions and come from rodent mills.
So sparkly today!! U look amazing!!
I actually think she’s going insane Or has already gone insane
Wait I thought it was a nail art channel???
how do you always know what i like??
holo everyone welcome to me annoying my cats for 14 minutes straight
I love holoween, so I really like zyler and a was gonna get one coat black for holoween.He is so famous he already sold out, also love your cats they are angels.
During the black and white clip of Menchie, all I could hear in my head was the “they ask you how you are...” video
"Why we on Big Brother" ... yeah, that won biiiiig points with me ♡♡♡♡♡
80% of cats are born outdoors. if you find a kitten and bring it to a shelter, make sure to go back and look for the colony. trap, neuter, release. you can prevent more kitties being placed at the mercy of predators and the elements. also, don't shop at PetSmart, I'm sorry, they are _terrible_. maybe their  outreach programs are good, but their policies and ethics are shameful.
Menchie looks like my cat same color and maybe same pattern
is everyone just gunna gloss over that she said  amber instead of yellow when referring to traffic lights? is this a Canadian thing i am unaware of?
She’s kinda dumb lol
this....this right here....is why I'm subscribed
8:45  Christine - “the light turns amber” , Everyone in the U.S: um what-

I got the kitty polishes almost 4 years ago, and I need to get them again.
omg Zyler with 1 coat is already so pretty!

I literally got my first shipment from Holo Taco this week and I’m in love. Y’all if you haven’t tried it yet it is very good quality and beautiful!
these cats motto is work smarter not harder
can you release nail oil pens please!
Cristine went from creating Menchie and Zyler polishes in collaboration with Starrily, to having Menchie and Zyler polishes for her OWN BRAND. Cristine is truly a Queen. 💿👑

When I saw these released today I bought them faster than I've ever bought anything lol, so much love for the whole Simply clan 💖
I’ve been a loyal viewer of your since I randomly found polish mountain. (Shame, I know. I’m a newbie). I fully enjoy your content. I just bought the rainbow collection for myself as a little pregnancy gift. I can’t wait to try it. Thank you for all the years of entertainment! Hope you and yours are doing well during well during quarantine.
Wish I could buy them but the shipping cost is too high xx
Love your videos and just bought two polishes from your rainbow line ❤️.  However, I wish you would do some different complexion swatches.  Just like how you have been using your polish on Ben, it would be nice to have one of your Black or Brown friends show their polished hands.  So, all your customers would see a more realistic swatch.  Thank you 👩🏿‍🎤🥰🎉
Ohhh nooo pet smart is awful, they treat their birds, hamsters and other smaller creatures awful
When u can’t order cause the shipping is like £30
I love both colors but I'm literally wearing play rose right now and it looks too similar
These are the ones you showed Suzie right? Or is it another upcoming set?  We need answers.  Also, reward the kitties for being smart enough to find a way to get to the treats!! But they sure are smart, to help each other out.  Best video today!
Ever thought about doing gel polish?? 😭😭😭 I neeeeeed this in gel polish!!!!!! LIKE if you agree so she MAYBE see it!!!  Having gels keep me from biting my nails 😞 .. and omg would holo taco look GOOD 😭❤️
Is this Rachel and Jun inspired? Or Kittisauras/ CreamHeroes ?
Nearly coughed up a lung laughing when you scared Zyler! I have 6 cats and I shall be trying this xxx

Wait, why you no ship to South Australia??
Zyler Is my fav 🧡 sorry not sorry 😂
this is mostly an add but I'm not complaining
Omg it's so cute!!! It would've looked so cute if the sparkles were cat shapes. That would've been super super cute omg but most likely hard almost impossible to create.
How much intros is she gonna mske
I think this is only the vid that Christine doesn’t said “BYENNNNNNNN!!!!!!”
I cannot wait for a BENNANA yellow shade 🍌🍌🍌
Cristine, I think that maybe you've been in quarantine a little too long. But I throughly enjoyed the video, so maybe I have too, lol.
Me: Yes 14 mins of Zyler and Minchi!!!!                                           Christine: Nah bitch! 😎 HOLO!!!!!!!!!!!!! For 5 mins!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVED this video so much fun! I ordered my menchie/zyler duo they are so beautiful can’t wait to see in person! 😻😻
is no one gonna talk abt how she called yellow lights "amber" because i-

You’re nail polish wall is aesthetically pleasing  Also at 10:14 I thought you were gonna say cockroach   Bout to sayyyyyyyy    At least it wasnt
she’s the canadian Jenna 😎
I love how sweet & ditzy Menchie is. She reminds me of my new kitten Luna 😊💖
got mine, yay!
I bought them, can't wait! I love your furbabies like they are my own - my babies, Callie and Bandit, say hi to Menchie and Zylar!
you are the best sales person
“Menchie youre smarter than this!” Menchie: “Damn right I am!”
She should make a one coat creame polish line (preferably a bright red creme)
Ordered Menchie the Cat 🎀💫 !! 🥺🥺🥺 can’t wait to try them out!
We all know this was yet another excuse to put the holo back into our life.
*squints greately* is... is that... produce placement?!?!?!
Whats the name of the song at 10:30 plis 😍
I got my cat from a PetSmart!! 🐈
Okay but a pastel collection would be pretty dope👀
traffic lights dont turn amber
I've never heard of a traffic light turning "amber" but it's so much nicer sounding than just "yellow"
Ooo loved them over your one coat black... gonna do the one coat black with Zyler for Halloween & Thanksgiving and will have to get your not milky white to do with Menchie as I think that will be beautiful for Christmas & New Year's... so excited 😍
I feel like I’m obligated to buy the orange shade since I named my cat after Zyler, lol
I feel like the videos are zoomed in now that YouTube updated. The edges are being cut off. Anyone else?
“They are the boss of me” I died 🤣🤣 I foster cats and I felt that!🤣😂
Love the wild thornberrys shirt!
This is the episode where Zyler was the star. Finally, a point for my cat brother.
Summer is nearly over in America but it is just starting in Australia😆
9:35 me: hey those look kinda nice togeth- Cristine: these two colors don't go together they're meant to be worn separately me: ...o-of course... that's what i thought to
our cats like the same treats!
Are you proud of me Christine? I’m doing my nails for the first time and using a holo taco
Today I learned yellow lights are also called amber lol
I got simply's multi-chrome rainbow nails video from four years ago on my up next... Coincidence? I think not! Next collection is multi-chrome, I'm placing my bets now
That tub of greenies is really the pinnacle of all cat treats! Ive had my big boy punchy for almost 2yrs and he will ONLY eat greenies 😂
i tried to order but why dont you deliver to po boxes?
velma and daphne.....
I would be pysched to see a collab with lightslaquer..
Omg u neeed to do a Halloween set of nail polish I would totally buy that
OMG I miss those Altoids so much! Raspberry was the best!
when she gonna drop that mint chocolate cookies and creme overnight oats recipe tho 🤔
I’m just waiting for Cristine to drop her magic nail oil pens
I ordered menchie! Love the colors💗
I got stuck on the it turns Amber for the longest time... 😂
Ordered mine 😁
I love Cristine. However, I do miss when this channel was more focused on general product reviews and other shenanigans. Lately it feels like almost every episode is an ad for Holo Taco. I've bought it and loved it, and will likely continue to buy more. I liked when Cristine used her platform to give other indie brands a some well deserved recognition.
Zyler the cat would be purrfect fur halloween
Zyler lives up to the perfect personality of a ginger tabby: the funniest little asshole you'll ever know.
Me: I can't justify more nail polish Me after this video: Well if it's for the animals then I better also add a glass file
I live in malaysia. Really wish i'll have a chance financially and access-wise to your nail polishes soon 🥺🥺❤❤
We know Man she’s her favorite cuz Zeilers nail polish is on her other handed
I would love to come meet Menchi and Zyler, I mean you and Ben 😝
I’m putting solar unicorn over zyler ASAP.
Menchie: "I am too smol" Me "Same girl, same" #shortproblems
I'm in my living room hysterically laughing at a crazy nail lady's cats while my parents just stare at me
I want to get them all..  hoping to get extra dollars to buy them soon
I finally got my grubby little mits on the orange drink polish 😍😍
Pet smart is... questionable...
Okay I’m not usually a pink fan but that Menchie color is so pretty! Love the holo cat on the boxes, what a great marketing idea to make you want to get both!
This is the quality content we need and deserve. ❤️😻❤️😻❤️
the nail polish boxes: make a cat when put next to each other and-  me: say no more, i will buy
i wish you couldve shown a side to side comparison between the old collaboration shades and these ones
6 months of quarantine and this is where it led to.
I hope these two new nail polishes are going to be permanent.
I'm sorry . . . The "amber light"??
please look into shipping to new zealand! these polishes are stunning 💕
Next week my family are adopting a cat
Is there any plan of making HoloTaco gel polishes? I really only use gel but I really like your colors and would love to support
"...it's me Christine and we're back with another non-nailar-related video"
im sorry if you have answered this already, but whos older? Menchie or Zyler?
I saw the intro and knew it was menchie and Zyler polish! I love them soo much. ❤
Just made my first holo taco order! Including a bottle of the menchie polish ❤️❤️❤️ very excited
Zyler helps push down the boxes for her 🥺 they don’t hate each other as much as we thoughttttt ☺️☺️
I want a lulu one.  pleeeeease
*watches cristine use holo taco as obstacles for the cats when i can't get said holo taco because they don't ship here* me: awesome
Did anyone else get an ad for Loud Laquer? Lol.
This vid is sooo nice... I love menchie🐈 and zyler🐈 meow!!🐱
“When you come up to a traffic stop and it’s turns amber.... “ what kinda of Canadian crap are you talking about 🇨🇦🤣🤣🤣
I literally have $5 in my bank account 😭 someday I’ll own these pretties esp since part goes to charity. I am currently out of state at my Aunts house and we brought my cat...her first trip ever.
I just got one of my animals recently from the pet smart charity!
Wait do Canadians call yellow lights “amber”??
I wish if I could afford to buy it, but i can’t. This pandemic has been really bad for me 😞. But I hope you guys can get it. 😊 good luck.
If people paid for cats like they do dogs, they would buy from sketchy kitty mills just like they do dogs; and sell them for 1000 bucks. They only keep cats in there to be inclusive and make a little money.  Why on earth would you choose them over cat welfare.   And of course this turns into another Ad . Like why are people falling for this. They would have already busted Jaclyn hills bubble if she pulled this.
I want those new polishes... but I don't paint my nails haha
The traffic lights in canada turn WHAT color????
I just ordered the Zyler polish. I'm excited cuz rusty orange tones look like nudes on my skin tone 🧡
Ok but did anyone else's cat come running at the sound of the treat box
Me: *wants to buy the new nail polish bc cats* Cristine: money will go towards PetSmart Me: :(  Please don't support them guys, it's been proven several times they are against pit bulls and any dog that looks like them
it turns amber
Pretty soon, Cristine will have enough Holo Taco polishes to take a trip to Holo Taco Polish Mountain 😂 Love these new polishes and that she supports animal charities and rescues! Menchie and Zyler have the best parents!!! 😺
I need these in the mail ASAP I made sure to order as soon as it came out and im in love
Someone is running out of ideas 😂 don’t get me wrong I loved the video
Never actually been able to buy any collections. They are always sold out in a matter of minutes, I really can not afford spending this much on nail polish so I def can not afford them individually. I wish you would increase your production of the collections to meet demand.
I didn’t realize that Zyler was an absolute unit.
What am I watching. It's 2 am I need help
"When the traffic light turns amber.."    Me an intellectual: yellow, she means yellow
I just bought the set and I’m so excited!
Hiiii
Omg I am laughing so hard hahaha
When the traffic light turns....amber?  Is that a thing?
Christine christine!! I found your merch at a thrift store and i was really happy! And of course i bought it
YALL BEST BELIEVE I SQUEAL INHALED AT THE CAT WHEN UOU PUT THE BOXES TOGETHER
I don’t know why I kept replaying the part she said “available right meow” lol. Cristine is such a queen
I think if you tossed the treat they might chase it? I dunno, I’m watching too much kittisaurus 😂😂. I ordered these and the rainbow restock! I’m so excited to play with them all!!
I love it but only one coat
Please do a video that you watch every Troom Troom video  Please please please
helo
Me watching the beginning : Haaaaaaaay why haven’t I seen those Holo colors before ? Later on.. OHHHHHHHH I LOVE IT !!   And watch, now that we’ve seen zyler He’ll be in hibernation forever after this
You should make mayple nail polish or organic 😂cat polish
Cristine can you please send to Australia! Your shipping to America which has the most COVID cases in the world but not to Australia which is nearly back to normal! Lots of your Australian fans really want your polishes but are missing out because of it! It would make my day and a lot of other Australians too!
is anybody else confused cause i'm pretty sure she already had menchie and zyler nail polish...
I wanted the menchie polish green instead of baby pink because of her beautiful green eyes😍
7:08 Zyler just trying to be a good big brother and help his lil sister to get her treat easier 💕✨
"Now close ups of menchie and zyler, the nail polish not the cats" I want close ups of the cats
Zyler is a model for sure.     But mechie is a super model 😍
As a fellow crazy cat lady, this is the content I thrive on
This video should be called "watch me play with my cats for 15 mins and somehow incorporate nail polish"
Zyler is a straight up savage!!
I wanna help and support you by buying the nail polish's but me is broke ;-;
Just had a heated argument with someone who I often meet who thinks that covid19 is no more than the flu and that not wearing a mask at a bar is just him « living his life » 😢  I really needed this video, even though it’s a bit difficult to focus 😭😭😭
I can't pick a favorite! I love them both 😍💗
Ngl imagine a light mocha glitter polish-...
man i wanted some up close shots of menchie and zyler the cats
Cristine.         We don't need nail art videos
I've been waiting for this release! Finally getting my first Holo Taco order! Both kitties, one coat black, Aurora unicorn skin, and a nice thick coat, er, bottle, of Glossy Taco 🌮  Can't wait 😊
Congrats Menchie and Zyler!  Sending love to the whole family. Both your parents must be so proud, such beautiful polishes. Purrrrfect!
me ordering my menchie zyler holos 😀
the only cats i'll never like 😌
That cool toned, borderline lilac, pale pink you made is mesmerizing! It's the perfect pink for us non pink people!!
Aaah, I'm so happy! They're so beautiful, and it brings me an obscene amount of joy that they're inspired by your cats! 😍❤️ Also, I'm so excited you screen capped me? Lol Yay!
4:32 BEYNNNNNNn
CAN YOU SHOWER YOUR CATS FOR A VIDEO PLSSSS CRISTINE🥺🥺🥺
Play Rosé????? Rosie from BLACKPINK???!
You watch Kittisaurus don’t you?
Ever since you announced Holo Taco I’ve been desperately hoping you’d release the Menchie-Zyler polishes! I’m so excited and I placed my order the minute I saw the announcement. Thank you for fulfilling all our hopes 😭😭
You should post a behind the scene of intro making
we need more cat content pls
damn it cristine!! i just put in a holo taco order last week!! guess i'll just have to buy the kitty polishes right now immediately
I want to wear zyler on my nails every day 😍🧡😍🧡😍🧡
Appreciate the attention to details on the packaging!
Both me and my roommate's cats came from PetSmart and those cats are our cat soulmates. It's so wonderful you're supporting them.
Im sure they wudve jumped if u toss da treats over da box wall. It wud probably give them da idea nd incentive to actually follow n jump to get da treat  (saw Rachel and Jun do this with their cats)
Perfect video to watch after getting my new kitten.
Cristine with peely base: *six days later* Me with peely base: *six hours later*
I just bought it. I've never bought anything from a YouTuber before (nor have ever spent that much for polish) but you and Ben are amazing people and the cause is a good one.  The boxes also got me. ;)
My baby Mochi was adopted thru PetSmart 💕💕💕💕💕
My daughter bought both
Loved this video, made me laugh so much!
Cristine: I don't have a favourite! Also Cristine: * paints Menchie on her left hand *
Zyler (man) : FOOD. Do anything for it🦁 Menchie (woman) : I ‘m sooooo cute can you help me get to the food pleaseeeeee 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Yay! Ordered! My Starlily OG Menchie and Zyler polishes are thick and gloppy and I refuse to throw them out!
Just bought them! Sooo excited! So happy that some of these proceeds go towards animals. Love you Cristine :)
did she just say the light turns amber instead of yellow?? is this a canada thing??
Watching these videos physically hurts, there's no way my parents are going to let me buy any Holo Taco. But I've been watching these updates since the first release, and I'm not backing down.
It's more spiced pumpkin than it is pumpkin spice. The difference is distinct.
Could you please do a raw and unedited video, bc i’m really interested in how that would look like!
I'm just sad that Mechies polish is the FB cover page for Holo Taco. Guess she has a favourite child.😭
i can't believe youtube didn't notify me
My kitties can jump about 6 and a half feet from a standstill, I had their mama before she passed (RIP sweet Sabrina) and she easily hit 8 ft  ceilings...
i just ordered pad thai and im excited. i am also excited about all the new polishes
OMG IM GOING BLIND WITH ALL OF THIS HOLOOO
Cristine says the polishes don't look good together. Personally, I like them together! Anyways, they're beautiful! And great job Zyler, better luck next time Menchie!
"...When you come up to a traffic stop and it turns amber..." my American brain is very confused 😂
Does she mean yellow
No I don't need another one school starts soo I can't wear nail polish!!!
is this collection going to be available in further countries?:( I really hope I can get these
I finally can get some Holo taco 😱😱😍😍
I really want to buy your nail polish, but shipping is like 30,- to my country 😭😭
7:07 was an attempted murder
Who remembers her original collab with starrily?
You're doin' Zyler a heckin' concern
Oh wait, they're smarter than u think They've jumped and made it fall to pass
This is more entertaining than cat tiktoks. Lol.
im so sad, i can't get the polishes because holo taco doesn't ship to new zealand :(
HOLY SHIT I NEED CAT NAIL POLISH
I keep shouting “good boiiiiiii” at my iPad. XD. I’m pretty sure everyone in the house thinks I’m insane now...
U do know a cat can jump about 12 ft just standing still right 🐯
My cat sat and watched this whole thing with me. She is obsessed with Menchie and Zyler and I know she'd love a full video dedicated to them - just watching them walk around, eat, sleep, and play.
Notice how Zyler is the star on this video? 😂 Zyler is here for business, not for mom talking about shit in her desk...
It's so satisfying how play rose is just the perfect shade between menchie and zyler I wanna get all 3 now <3
2 feet ? How about cm ? Hmmm
i thought cristine added a meow in the intro of this but no, turns out there's a cat outside my window and it was meowing 😂
When will we be getting Black Holo Witch???????? All the holo goths want to know!
I had to get the collection RIGHT after work lol. I was like “this 31 year old lady needs this!!” 🐱 🐈
You should make multi chrome nail polish
Ok, i just started watching, so i dunno if you mention it somewhere in video, but i'm pretty sure that at least Zyler's color existed quite time ago in your collab or sth? Maybe not in holo, but that specific shade? Edit: i knew that it reminds me of sth xD
I immediately went and ordered this set of polish along with a bottle of glossy taco! Im so excited to get my Menchie and Zyler polish!!!
Menchie is so sweet and pure!
Oh no she learning from claire
This is the content I want. This is the content I need. More cats, Christine.
I bought them as soon as I got the email! I can't wait to get them💞💞💞🤗🤗🤗
My baby cat is a pink cat too so the Menchie matches for him... and the Zyler fall and Halloween ideas... I cant wait!
I really wish I could buy some holo taco but the shipping to the uk is just too much for me to justify the purchase 😥 I fully understand why the cost is what it is and I am in no way asking for a reduction but in my mind £50+ is too much for 3 polishes
4:29 wild byen spotted
The menchie polish reminds me of your collab menchie polish color.
I have had several cats, one of my very favorites came from Petsmart.  I loved her so...
will we have a 2020 holoday collection?! i might be able to get it this year!
I want closeups of the real menchie and zyler
You look so proud! I feel so proud just watching you hehe <3
I reallyyyyy wanna buy some of your polishes but shipping to Germany is sooo expensive :((
Amber traffic light?? Is that how all Canadians say yellow?
I’m going live the menchke one. Because I live pink. But I will treat myself to both of them.
In Canada do stoplights turn Amber? Is that the same as yellow in the US?
Zyler: * jumps 2ft of boxes*  My cat: * gets scared of 1 box and falls asleep*
It has been a while since i last was here
I am mad. why doesn't holo taco ship to Australia? I have been putting all of the nail polish in my cart only to find out you don't ship to Australia? that's a bit exclusive don't you think? it doesn't give us a chance to experience the limited edition ones. its bs ok? so, when you get the chance (and make it quick!) could you please make it so Australians can get holo taco to? thanks p.s. I fricken love you :))))
Ugh my parents don't give me allowance😭 I'll have to wait until I earn enough
I ordered both because = helping charity more and cat boxes. I’m more into the Zyler shade but the Menchie shade is really unique so I’ll probably use it at some point lol It gives me spring and Valentine’s Day vibes.   It’s funny because I did orange creme polish with the gold flakie holo taco so it’s kind of similar vibes to Zyler haha And I have Play Rosé which is right in the middle! Plus finally ordered Orange Drink with some other stuff today!
I was wondering if you'll be selling any gel polishes? I am aware they are different formula and probably aren't as easy to make. But I just tend to enjoy gel polish more and would absolutely love to have a one-coat black gel polish!
Cristine yelling out of excitement and scaring the cats out of doing what she wants them to do is my favorite thing
omg pls make jojoba oil!!!!!
umm- AMBER?!?!?! traffic lights are red, green, and yellow right? DOESNT EVERYONE CALL IT YELLOW?!?!
Cristine: when the traffic light turns amber  Me: AMBER?! *shook*
Didn't even finish the video before hopping to the shop to get the kitty nail polishes. 😅😅
she say down with tha holo MAM stooooppp
So sad i cant get holo taco, as i live in the UK and shipping is too expensive
The comparison shot of all the nail polishes are the lesbian flag lol
What about a ben and cris polish?
Haha, she'll have to work in wardrobe!
I hope they're still available when I get paid.
please re-release the rainbow collection box, I am so sad I missed it
Don’t tell Cristin I said this but Jun’s cats did better 🤣. Although, they don’t have their own nail polishes! 😆
Wow, Zyler is really good at jumping :D  The colours are beautiful by the way ^____^
Gradient request for Zyler > Play Rose > Menchie please!
If she does something for Halloween I will pee myself. I love October and that’s my birthday month, so if she does I’m gonna get a loan from the bank of parents
She read my mind! I was at the website the other day and I searched up menchie and then I tried zyler but nothing came up. You read my mind!!!
If I had cats....I would never get bored
4:15 love that 1984 reference
“So what are you doing this quarantine?”  “Oh nothing.”   Their quarantine:
5:06 work smart, not hard
Please make a holoween black holo 💙💙
Zyler is so smart. I love how he pushes over the boxes to help her to go over
I love this channel, and what I'm about to say isn't just directed at Simply Nailogical.. but does anyone else feel that lately when they watch YouTube it's all basically a big thinly veiled ad?  I mean, there is nothing wrong with making money. This is their jobs. But it just feels like a lot lately, more so than usual. With almost everyone.
I went to the dentist today and my dentist said that she has 12 cats and that she used to have around 28.
Ik you won’t but please make some gel polish I haven’t used regular polish in a while “takes to long to dry I always mess one up
Menchie is an intellectual idc
Please mail me one of your empty unicorn skin boxes 😭😂 I'm so sad I didn't had the money for the collection box at the time. But they were all in my cart when I got the rainbow collection. Still really sad I didn't get the box. Have everyone beside that one 😭😭🙈
I just wanna say that you're honestly what's getting me through this Jenna Marbles drought. I've watched you since the voiceover-noface days, and it's been amazing to see you and your channel grow since then. But you give me such heavy Jenna vibes, and I love it. Please never change, Simply. Please never change.
True entertainment
YESSSSS i have been waiting for this tysm ❤️
Zyler is my favourite but Menchie is so pretty too. I think I will ask my hubby to buy them for me for Christmas. That way I get both! 😁
Can you PLEASE release a neutral collection like beige or muted colors,thank you!
I got 3 nail polishes for my birthday and If i had waited bit longer I could've got these :(
My holo taco collection is small but growing and I have to work my but off for weeks doing chores to get a bottle of nail polish but so far I only have peely  base Aroura unicorn skin purple flakie holo taco glossy taco play rosé midnight spark one coat black menchies polish AND ZYLERS polish I don’t forget you zyler😊
Zyler stole the show LMAO.  I love them all! (both the kitties & both the polishes)  Also Beanie says hi =)
Zyler is such a talented boy <3
Now people are going to purchase nail polish knowing that two random cat were jumping over the boxes
awww i love that you are giving to the charity ❤❤ ¡¡¡¡Cristine Roterberg for president!!!
oh my god im dying aaah i need all of the recent rekeases i have no money but i need the holo
Should have started off much shorter first then add. Lol they would have caught on faster what to do
what happens if you put a matte taco over holo?
I love both of these cats, but WOW Zyler is really an asshole. In other words, he's a cat.
In case anybody cares, the interesting stuff beings at 3:09. Your welcome!👁👄👁
This Menchie polish is what I needed! I can’t wait for mine to come in the mail.
"When you come up to a traffic stop and the light turns amber...."  wait, what?! #americanscallitayellowlight
What about BBEEEYYYNNN
Wait..... do canadians call a yellow light an "amber" light at a traffic stop?
I actually wore the menchie polish on my wedding day. 😄
Wow for me summer is almost here  I hate the hot and cold  I sweat to much
Quality content
Wow
I almost never buy merch/products from YouTubers because I often feel like they're cash grabs/have nothing to do with their brand or image/they usually seem to be typical "paying for the name" products. But the Holo Taco nail polishes are seriously one of my favorite purchases I've made all year... They make me so happy to use and stay on for so long. I feel like I got more than I paid for. I haven't had a simple product give me so much joy in a long time... It's been a rough year lol.  Thank you Cristine. Truly.
I GOT ALL THE COLORS I WANTED!!!! FINALLY!!! I"M SOOO EXCITED!!!!
These are my first Holo taco polishes. ❤️ I can't wait!
Menchie didn't jump cause she knew she'd get the treats anyway. Smart girl.
I think Cristine is going insane but I kinda like the content, luv u simply
you should do a gradient with menchi's and tyler's nail polish!!!
i got crazy excited when i saw Kittisaurus on the screen lol i love their chanel               no no no im still a holosexual nothing changed you idiot
do traffic lights turn 'amber' and not yellow in Canada?
Well... I was trying to tell myself that I don't need more nail polish but then you said partial proceeds go to charity and uhh wheres my credit card..?
Gosh... I can’t believe you adopted Menchie 7 years ago hahaha she was 1 or 2 the first time I watched you!! Also I remember forcing my mother to buy me the original Menchie and Zyler Polishes when they first came out and though they’re some of my favorite shades, I’ve been saving them because I didn’t want to use them all up and not be able to get them again!! I’m so happy you were able to make similar shades so that I can restock my collection 💕
whenever i put on multiple layers of polish it peels of really easily how do i fix that?? ily
I feel like we actually got to see Zyler shine today, because usually its Menchie who comes in when you're filming.
I’m waiting for nail vinyls
Yes
after a month of sales, i'd love to know which polish actually gets bought more 😂😂 i personally bought both lol
This title of this video is the quarantine question we all should me asking 😅
9:30 Mama, that's a penis.   jk, loved the designs <3
Me: *watch the intro * Me: wait, it’s that new nail polish porn??? 👁👄👁
this is what i come here for, bless
I love the menchie Holo!!! There so pretty lol
"you are smarter that this!!" Menchie:I know bitch!(walks around 😎)
Damn you cristine!! My holo taco just shipped here yesterday, and now you have the colors I really wanted!
Wait, so they don't come with Menchie and Zyler?
We thought it was trump who'd build it wall....But OMG it cristine.....
Me: wants every single nail polish Cristine/holo taco makes My brain: No, you’re broke.
I GOD DAMN KNEW IT!!
I have four cats. I should have worn headphones because as soon as they heard the bag shaking from the video, I got swarmed. Thanks Cristine!! 🙃
Menchie is the favorite child but Zyler proved he is superior in this bahahha
oHMYGOD CRISTINE WATCH KITTISAURUS 🥺😻
Sorry for the pause mid play but I had to go buy some cat themed nail polish, a top coat and a base.
Holly molly Zyler can jump and good job on the cat polish
You should go on big broth ;()
Cries in shipping restrictions
Hi👋
Have you been tanning or something? Your eyes look weirdly white. Like you wore goggles while taking a tan at a tanning salon. Only time Zyler is here is when treats are here.
Haven't you released similar nail polishes with similar names in the past through another brand? I'm just curious if you had to jump through any legal hoops in order to do this launch
ADORABLE 😍
I ordered both the Menchi and Zyler polishes as a birthday present for me! Thanks Cristine! I'm so excited!!
Just realised we've never seen white holo
video idea: return to polish mountain !!
I bought them! I’m so excited! 😻😻😻
They are so cute  I really wanna try zyler and menchie holo nail polish   looks amazing
I can't believe I just spent $30 on two nail polishes. The last two I bought came to $6.  But I love helping kitties, and I believe you and Ben when you talk about all the high-quality ingredients you use. It's a good time to find out whether I'm someone who even notices the difference. 🐈
I just ordered both. I'm so excited to get them! I've been so obsessed with your  nail polishes <3
Wait didn’t they already have their own polish 🙃
To be honest,I think I got here pretty early:)
When she’s talking about traffic lights and calls it amber instead of yellow 🥺
Do u like simplynailogical You would love simplyGuitar!
I've never seen my cat so interested in a YouTube video before
I got my first holo taco items and I actually cried no joke
People who used to watch Cristine knows the Menchie polish
if you dont stan cristine i will stand on your face
Just ordered the kitty set and a top and base coat! So excited! ❤️❤️❤️
Still waiting for the nail oil pens.
When a traffic light turns...amber.. what??
This   is   the   content   I   subscribed   for .
Yay! You posted on my birthday! 🥳
This   is   the   content   I   subscribed   for .
This is one of my favorite videos on the internet. Good job Zyler and Menchie!!
So ummm can we get some GEL polish plzzzzzz!!
I was so curious what were you going to do with the menchie and zyler polishes!   I guess my questions have been answered!  Also the colors are perfect!!!💖🧡😻
The pink polish was one of my favorite from live love polish from years ago
Glad I'm not the only one who spells to my cats so they don't know what I'm saying
Just a request: can you maybe do a #blacklivesmatter nail polish line?
Omg me and my mom love big brother!!!!!!
no one:   not one person:      me: kittisaurus could do the full wall
Did you just say when the light turns amber....?
It's so cute how she call Menchie Sweetie :)
I am so happy you are donating to Petsmart Charities. I work at a petsmart and adopted my cat through them. Petsmart Charities does so much for so many pets.
I actually love those two colors together and I’m a designer!!
Literally bought both the moment I was clocked in at work. So excited!
Wait: are traffic lights amber in Canada?
How many cats you guys have? I have 3 2 girls  Sasha and Suzy and my boy Ariel.
When the light turns amber? Lol is it really not yellow in Canada?
Wow Menchie is Amazing
Menchie is so Sweet
Me cat was literally going crazy during this video lol
i KNEW IT!! I KNEW SHe WAS MAKING ANOTHER POLISH!!
they're so cute
On 'American Ninja Warrior' the women run the same course as the men! 💪
will there be a possibility to pay with the euro in the future?
I wanna see a Ben, Jen, Mark, Dad, and Grandmother polishes (and hopefully a Cristine polish but let’s be honest that won’t happen)
I had to give my cat treats after this because she thought the shaking was for her lol
They’re back!   Edit: I went back and watched the videos where she showed the original collab polishes and honestly these two are richer and deeper in color, especially Zyler's.
So pretty!!!! I will have to get me some Zyler to honor my two ginger boys
"You know I draw the line at physical exertion".  Menchie serving us that Jane Lane 🤣
there goes my money and here comes my menchie and zyler-
Got mine!  I missed out on the previous cat polish launch years ago, so my heart is happy that I was able to get these.
Menchie's innocent little swat at 6:35 made my heart melt it was way too cute!!! And Zyler being such a good big brother knocking the boxes over for Menchie to also get some treats 😭😭😭💜
I could watch a full 15 minutes of just Zyler catching treats in the air.  Seriously.  Also, can't wait to get these new colors!  My order's already in!
I can't wait to get my order!!!!!!!!
Menchie is like modern problems require modern solutions.
I'm American so im confused about what she meant by the traffic light turning Amber. Is that the Canadian equivalent of the light turning green?
Hi Cristine, if you're reading this I'll like to say that I would LOVE to try some of your nailpolish, I went to see the prices and the shipping and then... I realize you're website don't have added my country (Costa Rica) or others latinamerican countries, I know that is asking a lot to added them now or find a solution. But I would love to someday maybe in a couple of years buy your awesome nailpolish in your website. A totally love your videos and in who you have become (I have seen your videos for years, lol). Totally love your brand HOLO TACO, I would to try it too. <3
4 minutes into the video and I've already got "thank you for your purchase" on a second tab ;)
Menchi *looks up at camera* why are we on Big Brother? LMAO😂😂😂
I was about to check out Menchies' nail polish, but unfortunately it costs a lot to ship it to Poland 😥
You should have done it box by box! Like start with one, add another, and so on and so forth! Still so cute though! 😍
Could you please make a video about Menchie and Zyler and show us their pictures when they were babies? PLEEEEAAASEEEE ❤❤❤❤❤ they are so adorable!
Edit: I'm surprised, Zyler is actually a good athlete, even if he is a bit chubby XD But now you have to put hidden camera so we can see Menchie  jumping around, I'm curious to see her jumping over counters and similar (told you, I'm a fan of pets content, just film the kitties and you'll have my like even without a single human in the frame)   I'm a big fan of that kind of silly pet content (I recognized immediately DD, Coco and TT from Kittisaurus XD) but my bet before watching the video is... none. No offense, but your cats seem pretty lazy and I still have flashbacks about them trying to overturn a cup with  a nail polish and a cat treat inside XD That was a struggle.
It would've been easier if you had started out lower and inreased the height. ^^ Menchie looks amazing as a polish too!
Holocato ♡
Your traffic lights in Canada have the color Amber?
I don't mind close up to the real menchi and zyler 😻😻
I feel ashamed that you didn’t say PURRsonality when talking about Menchie’s polish
I wait for her videos and nail polish like its Christmas. Like if you agree!😁
Now we know who is the boss 😂
Video idea: mix all your holo taco nail polishes together 😍💿
8:45 light turns amber???? Anyone else (American) catch that? My mind automatically said yellow so I paused with a 👁👄👁 face haha. That’s sooo adorable 😍 proud of you!!
you should do a black holo one
I immediately placed my first order before finishing this video XD I can't wait to see them in puurson <3
GO Zyler!!! You rock!
I ordered right when I saw the email at around 10 am! I can’t wait
cristine, im a lil concerned.
These colors are speaking to me 😍😍
Just take my money... help the kitties. My Stitch Meow-ie was a Pet Smart rescue kitty. And now he is training for being my service Kitty.
I love love LOVE that you donate so much to animal charities and rescues! As a rescuer and foster we couldn't do it without that kind of support.
But petsmart is the one letting fish live in cups, and selling cages that are way too small and misinforming people.
Omg yes! My mom probably won't buy me them, but yesss
You should make halo taco nail polish for pets! Ps I love you and I subscribed
OMG KITTISAURUS🥰
Just bought my Menchie and Zyler set so excited!!! 😺😺😺😺
This is the type of top quality content I subscribed for
When you want holo taco but you live in the middle of nowhere and the shipping alone costs about 6 months pocket money 😭😭
I've been missing Jenna's dog content and this is really filling that hole in my heart thank you Cristine
Daaaamn! Zyler gets a 10/10 on that first jump! so slick!
Maybe she thinks she is to thicc to jump between the space ❤️😂
But is it HOLO...?
I’m still working through my original menchie but just ordered a zyler!
The quality content I signed up for
WAIT,, WHAT IF YOU APPLY SO MANY LAYERS OF NAIL POLISH THAT YOU can BE ABLE TO  WALK STAND ON THEM?
im 11 years old and i love your videos
hi cristeen
Now all we need are black holo polishes in all forms. Linear, chunky glitter polish, maybe flakies if those are possible?
petsmart needs the money. they treat their reptiles like trash.  PetCo is better.
I loved this and that you are helping kitties ❤❤❤❤ just placed my order, can't wait, I love your cats and you too ❤❤
when she's running out of ideas:
I have an amazing idea for halo taco design  your own original  fake nails please that would be amazing 🙌🙏🤩💖
When zyler pushes more nail polish boxes on to menchie he’s like “no it needs to go down a lot a level mom” 7:05
I love that zyler pushed the boxes so menchie could get over and then she stayed so zyler took her treat
I think it would have been better if you'd started on a level 1 or 2 with just 1 or 2 boxes to let them get the hang of it before adding onto it to see how high they would jump 😂  I loved the video and I love Menchie and Zyler! 💖
No you need to make a banana yellow for ben
simply naillogicat or simply catligical
I saw Menchie and Zylers polishes and knew I had to have them.
Im sorry did i hear her say “when the traffic light turns amber”.....DID U MEAN YELLOW?!
I wish I would have remembered I needed glossy taco before I checked out my Menchie and Zyler order
“..when you come up to a traffic stop & it turns AMBER” 🤯 I’ve never heard the yellow light called amber
Its funny how i can grow close with an influencer i never met before this much.... Idk maybe its becoz im high but
So fun! I'm holding back on buying new polish bc I haven't been wearing much lately 😄 but that Zyler polish!!!!
This is kinda unrelated, but it’s my cat’s 1st birthday today!
Zyler is a CHUNKY boi😍😍
i want to raid simply's house and steal her collections cause i missed out on the last three.. yeah i can get them individually buuut i want the collectors boxes!!!
When will HOLO TACO ship internationally
So glad to see you supporting petsmart charities!! We adopted 2 of our rescue dogos and petsmart in collaboration with local shelters 😁😁😁
How is it that SimplyNailogical always gets me with her Cat Merch??? Love your channel!
This is an amazing idea!!! Lol! 😂
I still have my menchie the cat polish from starrily.
Next collection: HOLOWEEN! 💿📀💿
No one gonna comment about "right neow." Or was that only me.
Cristine: I don't  want to force them to perform. **shakes treats** Zyler: You had me at **shakes treats**
Zyler is the GOAT
So i just recently started doing my nails and....wha...ho... how do you get it so flat and smooth and perfecT! must be the years of experience of something ;)
Zyler is a savage. poor Menchie.
Cats rule. Dogs drool
I forgot how hard I laugh at your videos
5:26 umm.... yes because cats are smarter so they don't follow rules...    (I may be biased here but dogs ARE better than cats. I have both.)
These shades are beautiful!  Im so excited for these. I love the cat detail on the box and will have to display them on my shelf! I also love that you are doing a donation with these polishes! You are so awesome. I cant wait to get them!
Does anybody know what kind of treats those are ?
Awww I love these two so much ❤️❤️❤️ Menchie could have been feeling apprehensive to jump as it’s a new obstacle in an area where there isn’t normally one. Also kitties generally won’t jump over something if they can’t clearly see where they are going to land.  Zylar catching a treat was legendary 😂 I was a vet nurse for ten years and am an avid cat collector and I’ve never met a cat that can do that. 😂  Will the kitties polishes be up for a while? I really need them but I don’t get my wages for another two weeks 😂
I’m excited for the new polishes, however, when she first said they were getting their own polishes I thought she meant pet nail polish. I would totally buy a pet safe holo taco for my babies.
i just really wanted to tell you that you look so healthy!! idk you're just glowing or something.. you just look really beautiful, your skin looks great, you look happy.
"At the traffic light and it turns amber" Me, an American: It fucking WHAT
I’ve never heard someone refer to a yellow traffic light as “amber” before now lol
omg literally just yesterday I had to throw away my Starrily Zyler polish because it had practically ran out and gotten kind of crusty so I'm so so happy that there are now Holo Taco versions of them!
Menchie is the Holo Taco product I have been looking forwards to the absolute most, I'm so super stoked!!
Zlyer is a Cheeto.🧀🧡
13 euro's for one bottle of polish? SURE! :D <3 30 euro's for the shipping? No thanks >_> Maybe after my vacation xD (FYI I from the EU)
Cristine is the reason why 2020 is NOT cancelled
I laughed entirely too hard at this, I have tears. As a cat mom there's always that one kid that just has a bad day 😻😂
I can’t believe Zyler was the star of the show!
I think it would be BEAUTIFUL if there was a light blue holo with large gold glitter pieces🤩💕💙🧡
I wish I can afford your nail polish maybe one day.
I really appreciate how you don't make all your shades limited edition and you don't pressure us to go out and buy everything at once. It adds a sense of chillness, like we don't have to worry if we couldn't get all of your rainbow colors because we know you're doing your best and a restock will come. You're not like some influencers who come out with more products and make them extremely limited. I know it has to do with stock and maintaining what you can, but it eliminates any feeling of unnecessary exclusivity of "look how big a fan I am!" I guess I'm trying to say it feels more professional.
I love when a new Collection comes out on my birthday 🎂 I can’t wait to get this in my mail!!
Why are you starting off with like 5? The cats confused ! Youn have tongraduate from siz3
Cristine: “ you can get them right meow” Zyler and Menchie: “ did she just talk to us?”
"Menchi you're smater than this" and Menchi proving she IS smarter by doing the challenge her own way seconds later
I still have my Menchie & Zyler polishes from Starlily you did back in the day 💕💕💕 Can't wait to get these 💕💕💕💟🌸💟
8:42 Am I the only person who had never heard of an 𝓪𝓶𝓫𝓮𝓻 traffic light
I just watched a 14:07 unskippable ad
thIs iS aNimAl aBusE
You sure are a fun MOM, Baby i want to make you mine. I don't think Shay would mind? Why don't you come over and take up all my time. Sitback and watch the Dolphines in the sunshine. Baby yoy sure are looking fine.
At this point, just take all of my money.
Will these come with bits of menchie/zyler hairs? Will pay extra for damaged by cat box.
I don’t read my emails for one day and I miss the release of my fav nail polish brand 🤦‍♀️
I knew this was coming from Suzie’s video 😂
I'm curious to see what the mixture of all of Simply's nailpolishes is gonna look like.
If I had a best friend, I would buy these nailpolishes. Then I would give my friend the pink one.
I just ordered my first holo tacos ever, and I'm very excited, and a MAJOR bonus is that it's proceeding to animals! #bestbeinvestin
I feel like it would have been better to start with just one or two boxes to get them used to what they are expected to do and then go from there :)
Is amber traffic lights a Canadian thing??
Zyler Holo Taco Polish is the perfect Halloween shade! I'm sold. Had to pause the video and make my first ever Holo Taco purchase! I'm so excited 🥰
I’m disappointed that I don’t see any jokes about Trump, but I guess they couldn’t get over the wall.
Will u get a new kitty anytime soon  just wanting to know i we would see a nee simply child.
I think these are your best nail polishes yet!!
Can I please get a black holo and a white holo? So I can wear my feline son on my nails? Merlin would approve! He loves sparkling things!
Cat videos are the only pet videos I want to see
Noooo.. not pet smart.. I don’t know how they are in Canada, but here in the America’s, I hate going in and seeing the disgusting cages and how isolated and depressed the animals always are. They have been exposed of not treating their animals correctly and they definitely don’t deserve anyone’s money. This is just what I know, but feel free to donate to whoever Christine..
Zyler is such a smart boy!!!...I loved how he got the hang of the activity so fast...
pleeeeeeease, ship to Brazil 🥺
HOLOWEEN HAS TO BE A COLLECTION...BLACK DEEP GREEN AND A PUMKIN TYPE ...
saw this in my notifs with half the title cut out so i thought it said how many bottles of nail polish can my cat knock down
Multichrome Menchi and Zyler ❤️
It's already three in the morning and I'm watching cats jumping over a stack of nail polishes rather than sleeping.
I'm SO glad these aren't limited edition. :D Gives me a chance to buy them later on when I can get them. XD
This is the kind of content I signed up for
They are just so cute in their own ways. I was watching this while playing with my lil kitty Bean! I'm so excited for this collection, and even more excited that it's permanent. I just signed up for collage classes and have to wait to get the polishes, but I can't wait to rock these with either my summer or Christmas Menchie & Zyler Tee's 😺😺
God Christine, just take my money.
Woes
Petco >>> Petsmart. Petsmart doesn't allow several dog breeds inside their store. Petco let's all dog breeds come inside. Even a cow!
I love y’all 😍
I am so glad they aren’t limited edition! They will sell out before I get paid 😂
So when are we getting Ben-ana holo taco?
I see the Orange polish & the Zyler polish, what is the SHADE DIFFERENCE between the two colors? And what does the Menchie & the hot pinkish/magenta shade look like next to each other?
7:07 Z: You dumb ass *push*
When the traffic lights turn 'amber'. Hu.
is no one going to talk about the fact that she called the yellow traffic light, “amber”😂
DID SHE JUST LEAK A NEW COLLECTION? I DONT REMEMBER SEEING A PURPLE HOLOGRAPHIC BOX FOR A COLLECTION (left side of the screen at 3:09)
I never thought I’d love seeing Zyler catching a treat in his mouth but here we are
don't go together? HELLOOOO accent nail!
I thought you were supposed to build up the levels, not just build a wall and make them jump? Am I thinking of something different?? I feel like it was a challenge with Ciara's song level up?????
I just love she has like 4 angles for this vid.
This is what quarantine has come to 😂
My brother found an abandoned kitten and brought her home, she was SO TINY (like she could sit on just one of myhands) and could jump like 4 feet up to the top of my desk. I was so shocked at the SKILL. Never had pets before and would clap everytime she jumped, like she was a true circus performer. 🤣🤣🤣
menchie is more like a lilac color
This video makes me so happy
Why Cristine sounded like Jefree star ⭐ in rhe beginning of this video?
They're definitely smart! Go around the wall or pull the wall down... easier than jumping!
7:28  Best part of the video
Nooooo  I can only buy one from the rainbow collection ;-;
(Positive I swear) I had issues with my rainbow holo taco boxed collection being shipped to me. It took me about a month to get an answer back and by the time they sent me a reshipment (got sent only an extra tacos the the whole collection on the slip) and red licorice was sold out so I got everything but that. I was given gift cards though, so now I get to try Menchie for free! I’m giving it another chance, because I love the quality of the nail polish I got.
Are you going to make a nail polish for the treasure that is Ben?
I'm not a pink person either but the Menchie polish is so pretty! Zyler polish just fuels my Holoween feels
after this holo taco can longer say they dont utilize animal testing
You see menchie went for zyler the cat then menchie the cat She loves her brother!
This is the content I need in 2020
Gotta help all those kittens thru college.
Not gonna lie, when she said "who wants some close ups of menchie and zyler" I was all ready and then she clarified the nail polish and now I'm disappointed.
Oohh please consider making holo decals/nail stickers. Can be in shapes like cats, tacos, etc!
I’m sorry when the light turns ✨amber✨??
Congratulations on the launch but petsmart is very neglectful and abusive of their animals. Maybe in the future you can partner with someone who actually respects animals.
You should tie-die clothes (or anything) with TeA... I was re-watching your steeping myself in tea video and i saw how well the tea stained your shirt. I know you probably wont see this, and tie-die isnt as popular any more but just thought i would let you know just in case. Love your videos :)
Can we have a group chat where we just talk about our own holo world, mom and dad (Cristine and BEYYNN), our siblings (Menchie and Zyler) and other world issues?  Drop your @ below if interested! (This is no spam just a sock trying to make some good sock friends😁)
Me: having an awful day (including dropping my phone in a bowel of whipped eggs) Simply: uploads  Me: it’S noT A pRObleM AnymORe 🤪
OKAY FINE I ORDERED THE NEW POLISHES SHEESH
Excellent. Now please do black holo witch please please please
Next video is gonna be "How many bottles of nail polish can Cristine refuse to paint her nails with?"
I’m sorry: WHEN THE TRAFFIC STOP TURNS *AMBER*?!
Who wants Cristine make a “mix all of my holotaco polishes together” video🙏🏻🙏🏻💖🥺
This video just proves that Zyler is the Goodest Boye(TM).
Traffic stop turns amber??? Does Canada have different traffic light colors than the US?
Thank you for doing the comparison to the existing polishes! That was the first thing I was thinking about when I saw the shades, particular for Zyler, and actually seeing them compared convinced me to buy them on top of already owning Play Rosé and Orange Punch!
menchie kinda thicc doe 😳 jk shes so cute i love her
Ha! I had a feeling you were going to make your holo taco that has to do with your cats. I’m just not sure.  Yes!!! 👍🏼  I’ve been watching you with your cats for years and they’re so cute and funny. ❤️
Cristin my nail broke this morning!!! Please keep me in your prayers.
Hey cristine! Please do the barbie girl tiktok but nails versionnn
Would love to see a gradient of Menchie, Play Rose, and Zyler!!
you should get a horse
uh you call yellow lights amber????
Yay
Cristine if you make a holoween box can you include a creme chartreuse color?  It would fit the theme well and you can call it Frankenstein. I also thought it would be good because you can use it to recreate the old pumpkin nail art with Zyler's polish.  I really hope you see this because I genuinely think it would be a good fit and a nice challenge because bright greens are hard to get opaque. But if you can manage to make a one coat white, I have faith in you.
How do i get that box of greenies tho I've only ever seen the small zip-lock bag ones lmao
She is like the best cat owner ever lmao
PLEASE START SENDING PRODUCTS TO BRAZIL!!!!!
:( :( Please make it available on Mexico
When covids getting to her hehe
Got to get menchies omg it’s the perfect colour I mix like 4 polish’s to get a colour like that -3- when I have money
6:00 she sounded like that one vine
Christine isn’t even a nail artist any more. She’s just making videos to sell her polish -_- BOORING
Cristine is out here giving us cat content to supplement the lack of dog content we usually get from Jenna marbles ❤️
OMG great idea if your good at nail art which I am not you need to make her Menchie and Zyler out of the new polishes 😱😆
Why is there not so much yellow nail polish 😠😠😠😠😠👑👝💛🌻
yoooo that intro is just.. **chefs kiss** beautiful! I love menchie and zyler 🥺
You should react to longhairprettynails review your holo taco nail polish
friend: describe how east and west germany were united me: shows intro
cristine: when the traffic light turns AMBER 😂
I can not tell you how long I’ve been waiting for the Menchie nail polish to come out. I’m so excited to finally have it!!
All of the memories from all of the different boxes
You make me so happy
*I really wanna reach a thousand subscribers, but you can't watch my last video*
Cristine the whole point of the challenge is to start small and see how many they can jump over. Not start off with a tall wall. That's also how they build up confidence and know to have a running start.
Hey cristene  Please do holo taco giveaway for those who can't afford
Do u know what I would love?  When the kitty polishes sell out, Cristine does a giveaway of those 80 polishes Menchie and Zyler jumped over. Adds one singular cat hair allocated to the polish.   Like if u agree😂🐱🐱🧡💗
Now all we need is you Ben Jen your dad and your nana :D
You are my favorite YouTuber .😸
If you mixed Menchie and Zyler you would get Play Rosé.
Isn't this a safety hazard for them?? Oh and for the cats too
my parents dont let me buy stuff from abroad so to help i dont skip the ads:(
I've always love the way she talks about her nail polish. She's so passionate about it. Plus her cats are soo adorable
Amazing cats & amazing nail polish ❤👍🏻
Cristine, please make lots and lots of holoween nail art tutorials this year with your holo taco collections!
Every day is a holoday!
CRISTINE!!! Please recreate your holoween pumpkins with Zyler's polish!!! I loved that look!
Great another youtuber exploiting their children 😂
One of the times she said "Menchie" it set my Siri off lmaooooo
I have NEVER heard anyone refer to the yellow light on the 🚦 as amber.
You had me at pumpkin spice 🎃 ☕️
When I saw the zyler nail polish i just saw zyler as the cat and not the nail polish 😂
Make a polish with multiple colors of large holo glitter to look like fall leaves!! 🍁🍂🍃
Menchie and zyler have there own polishes before ben does 😅😅😅
Please make a HOLOWEEN box!!! 🎃👻🕷🦇
Admit it, Holo Taco was created to fund Menchie's college fund.
Hi Cristine! I know you're good friend with Saf and Ty. I was just wondering if you know why they aren't posting anymore and if they are ok? Please just let me know they're ok!🥺🥰
Went to buy these and realised shipping to the UK IS 29$!!! That’s crazy and so sad 😢😢😢
Wow this hoodie is so pretty
FINALLLYYYYYYYY!!!!! I've been waiting for you to release these for so loooong!!!
So now we are going to make Ben Banana nail polish😂
Now all we need from Holo Taco is Black Holo Witch, How Deep is Your Holo, and Holo Queen.
I need one of those holodays box. Not the polish. Just the box. For the polish I bought.
black Holoween polish anyone???
Menchie is me 😂
so like i cried in the start of this video?? hahaa i def. will be buying these :)
My cats wouldn’t try to jump over the boxes, Bubbles would just barge into it, Mitzi would just meow at it, and bramble would try to make a burrow in it.
This is exactly the video I needed to see today! Thank you! This made me laugh and smile so much!
I love how the menchie Polish is a diffrent shade of the callab one so if anyone has the og menchie one doesn't get a duplicate
i think that if you used them both in a gradient they may work together
When the traffic light turns amber???
one day I’ll have the money to pay for Holo Taco to be shipped to the UK
Zenchie 1 Simply 0
Menchie might have figured it out if Cristine had started with one box and gradually increased the height.  But also maybe not -  I’m no cat expert
May I add that those two shades are also a fabulous companion for a fall and spring manicure look 👍🐱💅  love it! 😌 #holoallyearround
Zylers spirit animal is a circus performer duh
I'm sorry, AMBER??? 😂 Is this a Canadian thing, or a Cristine thing?
Woa zyler!!!
We give our cats the same treats yassss!!
I kniw your insperation cuz I listen to your podcast😁😁
I am obsessed with orange I already own orange drink and now I need that zyler the cat 🐱🧡🧡🧡🧡
I am so glad you bought back your cat nail polish I missed out on the first round of Menchie polish. These are beautiful. My cat is from Petsmart too!
I really like the Zyler shade! :)
So it's basically the discontinued collab polishes only in better?! 😍
Zyler stealing Menchie treat is a mood 😂
Pls do a mixing all my holo taco nail polishes🙏🙏
love cats
I need one of those unicorn collections boxes. I got all them but missed the box & I think it's my favorite looking box 😔
New video idea parking Ben for 24 hours
I dragged my sleeps-disgustingly-late self out of bed much earlier than usual just to make sure I didn't miss out on these! I figured the cats' polishes wouldn't end up being limited edition but better safe than sorry! I was also so excited to see that Green Taffy was back in stock, so...I just dropped a lot of money on nail polish and I have no excuse except that I love Holo Taco and I love the Simply fam.
Omg 2 hours ago I'm earlier than usual
Just a question, what happens when you mix Munchie and Zylers nail polish together?
I gasped and got deeply offended when Zyler stole Menchie's consolation treat at 7:30! 😂
@SimplyNailogical #SimplyNailogical   🔆 I Have A Dilemma & A Few Questions. 🔆 Do these Nail Polishes feel heavy on your Nails ❓ 🔆 I love Nail Polish But Find it very hard to find the right one as some feel heavy and annoying on my Nails. 🔆 Can you Please explain why this happens ❓ 🔆 Why Does Nail Polish Crack / Chip Away ❓  🌸🌸  If any other viewer have any suggestions that could help me that would be Greatly Appreciated. 🌸🌸  ✈️ Sending Hearts 💕Hugs 🤗 Health 🏥 Happiness 😊 From Finley, New South Wales, Australia 🇦🇺  Edit: 🔆 I love the Captions in your videos, they always crack me up 🤣  🔆 How Many YouTube Play Buttons Do You Have ❓ 😻 I Adopted my cat 3yrs ago at 7wks Old - Her Name is Miss Moo, She is a Black & White Bi Colour Short Hair Domestic In House Only Kitty, She was Born on 9th September 2017 - Miss Moo is My Therapy Cat, As I have Anxiety, OCD & Mild Depression. 😸 Miss Moo Also Soothes me when I’m in pain from my Cervical Cancer + Endometriosis, when iv had to call a Ambulance she needs to be put in our bedroom with the door closed otherwise she won’t let the Paramedics near me. 😸 She Also comforts my 15yr Son as he has Severe ASD/Aspergers + Slight Depression - She’ll Meow and snuggle up to us both. She sleeps in my bedroom on either my bed 🛌 or in her bed on the floor next to my bed. 😺 When we moved from Brisbane Queensland to Finley NSW we had to have her flown down as we took our time and drove down + She wasn’t allowed to stay at the Motels/Hotels we would stop at even if she was in her Cat Transporter 🚙 Approx 980 kilometres Via Scenic Route 🚗 😻 When I got to the airport to the airport and her plane landed I Broke down crying 😭 and collapsed. 😺 She handled the flight like a champ but it’s a requirement that pets don’t eat 3hrs before the flight and they need to take “ Natural Rescue Remedy Calm Drops For Cats” and have a Light Cloth over her Transporter so she couldn’t see other animals. 😸 I Love her to bits, I have a life insurance policy out for Miss Moo as well as her standard Pet Health Insurance, she doesn’t like Beef Mince, I Make her food Fresh Every 2-3 Days.  🌸 Sorry there’s so much to read xx
I love you so much i hope you see this I been here since nail art 🥺👑💕
I have never been more motivated to buy holo taco than now!! love the cats, and cristine and ben of coz!!
Play rose.....im gonna play rose's solo when it gets released. ( this is litterally the most cringiest thing ever going through my brain)
Omg cristine ur really out of ideas 🤦🏻‍♀️
Ben calling Menchie a “little rascal” is probably the most dad thing he’s ever done
Pleeease tell me there’s going to be a Halloween collection. I desperately need a black holo polish (in addition to these)
The takeaway from this episode is that she says "Amber" for the yellow light.
Cats logic to how to get treats? Menchie: get treats by finding a different route Zyler: can jump and sabotage others for the treats  -------- Just have to say that the colors now are 😻. And thank you for the restoke of the rainbow and keeping the new colors.
this reminds me of when it took one of my cats 3 days to learn she could jump over the baby gate i put up to stop the dog from eating their food smh
Omg i pray to lord one day 149k people would just watch one of my videos to just watch 😭😭
my cat heard cristine shaking the greenies and she came running to me screaming for greenies i'm
awww. love the packaging. it'd be lonely to only get one color and have half the holo cat
HEY CRISTINE !!! Could you do a video showing us the process of making a launch from idea on paper, the mixing, testing prototypes and shipping it out. Obviously this video could take up to a year to film like your toe nail polish video. I just think it would be super interesting.
My cat and I were watching this together xD He was laying next to me 🥺
At the start of the vid you could see how happy Christine is from her pun.
Aww I was hoping for a gray holo taco for your gray cat!!  But they are both gorgeous
Don’t buy from stores like petsmart, adoption from shelters are most needed.
All in favor of Cristine creating a channel called “simply catlogical” just for videos of Menchie and Zyler, *say I*
its the ✨new intro✨ for me
Your cats are my spirit animals yes work smarter not harder 😆
ooh ok the new intro 👀
I wonder how would Your ➡️HOLO⬅️ polishes look in ➡️MATTE⬅️ version🤔🤤🤪   💚🟢💛🟡🧡🟠🤎🟤❤🔴💜🟣💙🔵🤍⚪🖤⚫  Just giving You an idea for the next collection😇😏🙏🏻🌈🌌
"The holo is best seen under an I phone flash" Android users:   :(
Simply-CAT-logical.....ain't got nothing over Kittisaurus. Lol.  Nice try, M & Z....
my cat would just go right through it. shes lazy and fat
It's interesting, that Cristine will not say the name of the nail polish brand  that she had the original colab cat polishes
Imagine putting Zyler the Cat over an Orange Drink base so that even the gaps in the glitter are holo!
I rarely buy from youtubers, but this 28 year old just got your collection and couldn’t be more excited 💅🏽
I’m having a reflection moment.  When Cristine released polish with a collab in the past I was 100% a Zyler color person - fall colors for days.  Now my heart skips a beat for the Menchi color.  Proof people change every 7 years. 😂
How much are your halo taco nail polishes? I want to buy some!😁
Uuuffff im so excited! I ordered the cat’s polish and the anniversary polish as my first purchase:3 Thank you Cristine! 😻😻😻
I don’t know why, I’m expecting a Ben polish and it’s a banana 😂
9:51 Oh... My eyes hurt..The colours are so beautiful 😍 Lots of Love from India 😌
07:33 Savage
Really? PETSMART? I think you could have picked a better company
I didn't think that the video's can get this weird 🤣 Next video how many times can Ben do taxes 😂
If you’re an og you can remember she did a collab back in the day the same Colors
Ahh I love the Menchie color. Will treat myself at christmas me thinks.
As an average consumer, I'm kinda disappointed with Zylers nail polish colour bc she already has orange polish so I don't see the point in buying it...
Is there a Yellow Banana 🍌Scented Halo Taco to represent Ben #SimplyNailogical
menchie is babie
After like a week of selling you should look which one been sold more and then see which one of your children we like better🙃( it’s probably more about the color but anyways)
Excuse me the traffic light turns amber?? You mean yellow? Is that a Canadian thing or a Cristine thing??
I mean... it's nail related?
Cristine make a galaxy  nail polish collection holo is the stars and well so many colours u can use
Finally, it's Zyler's time to shine.
i feel like Halloween now, damn you Cristine
I honestly think they look great together for a Halloween look! Maybe add some bright green and black vinyls?
Cristine: I know these colors don't look good together  Me: I kind of like the 2 colors together, they look cute together
Now you need polish for you and ben😅
I wonder if instead of counting sheep 🐑 jumping over a fence to fall asleep instead Cristine counts her cats🐈 jumping over nail polish 💅
My cat got excited when she heard you shaking the treats at the beginning of the video. She could see me treatless so she didn’t come running but her ears perked up and her eyes got big.  I want to buy these but I just got your birthday anniversary collection and am having a baby next week so won’t have too much time to do my nails. Yay for not being limited addition though ~<3~
Almost missed out! Thankfully it wasn’t a limited edition box! I set an alarm and my tired self thought it was an alarm for work and I don’t work today and I thought why is there a alarm set? Then slept in. And thanks to my boyfriend asking me what’s the damage? And me asking for what? He said for the polishes.  I sat there in bed, just woke up... like what polishes!? And then thought oh no! Holo taco! I have to look now! I got them thankfully!
I really want to buy it soooooooooooo much but 30euros of shipping as I live in France T.T It's the same price of what I want to buy T.T :( I'm sooo sad :(
When she put the boxes together to form the cat, I was so shocked and happy. Now I really want both.
I really wanna buy some but shipping is $30 to UK :c
I bet Ben is crying over the profit margin for this one as well lol
I already ordered Menchies 😍😍😍
Omg Menchie's baby picture
I want the menchie polish so bad, like my perfect color palette 😭😭 but i cant justify it rn being unemployed for 5months and california being on fire. Itd probably burn in shipping
She's asking the important questions!
I'm still just waiting for a nail polish inspired by ben
Ah yes  *And here, my friends, is Quarantined Christine.*
I wanted the Menchie polish when they did the original collaboration but it sold out before I could get it and now that Holotaco is making it I finally splurged and made my first holo taco purchase!
Ordered before watching the video. Couldn’t decide which one to get until I read that a portion of the proceeds goes to an animal charity I thought, “ok, so I’m basically donating to animals, so I HAVE to get both”.
Lol I got a nail polish add before this, how random😭
holo gato
Zyler is like the 😎 and Menchie is like the 👸
The two new polishes are frickin gorgeous!! Also the boxes making a cat is just *infinite chef’s kisses*
I love how she wears the Zyler's polish on one hand and Menchie's on the other it just shows that she loves her children the same
Love all your videos
menchie is like “mom i’m not getting my paws dirty just give me the treat”
yes.
Awwww....I wanted to order so much...but only the shipping is 30$... No holo cat for me I think😿😿😿
Omg as soon as I saw the polishes I bought them!!! I have been a nail bitter for my whole life😅and this is my motivation to stop and wear cute polish and do nail art!! Thank you!!! (Ps I love your cats there my 2nd favorite cats in the world!! My cat at 1st of course ☺️🐱🐱) I love your channel and I have been a long time Holo sexual💿📀
Ok but I’m still waiting for a holo taco nail polish called BEYYNN
Wow, I like how I didn't even get a full in depth look of the colors before I placed an order lol
This video is giving me serotonin
I wished for this no more than 2 weeks ago
You guys should get another cat Menchie and Zyler can have a new friend
You should make a book called where cristines H. Like where’s Waldo but it’s cristines H. Where did it go we don’t know you have to find it.
Accidentally disliked your video and it made me feel more anxious than I did when I learnt that we're having exams without classes
zyler: -steals menchis treats- Me: NOOOOO MENCHI DESERVES TREATS FOR BEING THE PRISSY PRINCESS AND REFUSING TO JUMP THE WAAAAALL!!!!
Omg zyler has such a halloween vibe... I’m living for this
Do I Wear Nail Polish ? No .  Am I Gonna Beg My Parents To Get Me these ? Yes . Yes I will
you should make one for bennn
Is calling a yellow light an amber light a you thing or a Canadian thing? I’m really curious because I’ve never heard anyone else say that ever! 🤔
Yes yes yes yes yes i need these cat polishes 🤩🥳
Omg yay! I got them before I knew you were donating to PetSmart Charities! My heart is so warm (like a kitty lying in the sun) 🐱 💕 ☀️ 😊
do a benana like a yellow holo :)
I HAVE TO BUY THE BEST MENCHIE HOLO TACO AAAAAAAAAA
Aww... Menchie is the Marbles.
I just had my dad buy me the menchie and zyler nail polish 💖💖💖 they're the first nail polishes I convinced my parents to buy 😭 ily
Zyler's a little stunt kitty!
Cristine -  I need more colours of creme polish!
Ordered this morning! I finally got in on a release! 😂
I’ve just seen the first 12 seconds of this and I’m already concerned.😂
A mix of 3 of my favourite things: Cristene, cats, HOLO NAIL POLISH
First 2 hours anyone?
Did Cristine just call yellow "amber" ? 🤣😅
I just ordered them both! I love the colors and they match your cute fur babies SO MUCH! I'm so excited. I've loved all your polishes. I love the quality and I love supporting you and your ventures! ❤️
Aight. Ima head to holotaco.com
wh else is kinda sad cuz you live in a country which uses a different currency and can't buy any nail polish, top coats, base cots ect? just me??
I really love that you compared these new shades to other shades you already have. Please do this again in the future!!!!
Just bought Menchie 😻 I find her performance anxiety relatable
Menchie and zyler must be protected for ever no matter what
Zyler looks like the kind of cat that can catch treats with his mouth
This video made me laugh so much 😂 I love cats
Yay I was right!! And petsmart is awesome I got all of my guinea pigs there I got things for my cats there PetSmart is the best pet store.
I would love to buy some Holo Taco but by the time you add postage and then convert it to Aussie $ it is just too expensive to justify. Please Cristine look into having an aussie stockist such as Femme Fatale sell them here. https://femmefatalecosmetics.com.au/
I need some of the old collection boxes, I have pay pal, can send you money! I need the rainbow and the original collections. :D
You could a mood nail polish line (temperature changing nail polish)
so i watched this video with my cat and tbh i think he was more invested in it than i was
Because of the beginning of this video, I now have to give my cats some greenies 😂
Love watching your videos and love these colours tyfs 🧡💗
more like holo cato <3
i feel like such a bad holosexual, i thought menchie was a male this whole time😭 i’ve been a holosexual for 6 years🙈
Cristine out here again asking the important questions🌈🐱
Is there such thing as white holo? Because I’d be curious to see/get one. HOLO TACO MAKE IT HAPPEB PLSSS
Why couldn’t we get a restock on super glossy taco! I’m in glossy taco withdrawal!!
6:54  Ha, yeah no. Everyone runs the same  course and if you're too short you better reach. Even the international one is the same course.
Wow, I remember discovering simplynailogical in 2017 from a giveaway posted in live.love.polish that then got me in zyler's instagram🤣💜
Finally, the kids have the spotlight. The princess is who i cane for😌✨
This is the kind of content I will use my little remaining data for!
This is what i needed
I kinda want to see Cristine build a blanket/pillow fort 🤔😂
PLEASE GIVE ME MY MICROCOMEEEEEE! I NEED ITTTT
PAINT YOUR CATS ON YOUR NAILS WITH THE CAT POLISH!!! 😹
Can I have menchie?
Together they make a kitty cat. This is why you need to get both - I AM SOLD!!!!!
SHE SAID HOLIDAY NOT HOLODAY!!!!!!
it does not ship to my country : (
i think this is the most Zyler has ever been in a video other than the Halloween costume videos
Finally zyler gets spotlight!!😂 No offence I still love you..❤️
Holo Cristine...so I knew and had faith in kitties being okay...is it terrible of me that I was worried sick that there would be a casualty of a bottle? I'm glad all went well in the end...I love all of your Holos and cant wait to have a bottle of my own.
I wish your cats a very happy and very long life. I hope they stay healthy and safe. ❤️🐈  As a 2x cat owner myself, whose cat is now struggling to stay alive, I hope at least you won‘t have to go through such a horrendous time like I do now. 💔
Me: WHAT HOW WAS THIS POSTED 2 HOURS AGO I JUST WOKE UP- oh wait its 1 o’clock-
Omg sorry I'm lateee I forgot to open YouTube 🤣
Zyler would sacrifice all of Holo Taco for one treat it’s been proven now
Oh no. I hadn’t noticed you don’t ship to Mexico :(
Yayyy we missed you :)
Yayyy we missed you :)
I REALLY want to see a GRADIENT from *zyler to play rose to menchie*
Why do you think she associates menchie with pink holo???
You should paint your cat toenails with there polish
Not sure if possible but if they were renamed as Holo Cato, it would've been perfect!
I paused this video just to go order the duo! + some bottles from the rainbow collection! You're the only youtuber I've ever bought anything from - and I am NOT disappointed. Like Suzie said recently, the quality of your polish is out of this world. It shows that you put lots of time and care into this product and it really shows. Love you Cristine!
Okay but we wanted the OLD Zyler polish back, not just Orange Drink with different glitter sizes 😭 what a massive disappointment
This just made 2020 better ✨👅✨
I recently rescued my second cat, a neighborhood stray ❤️
Well some cats are food motivated and some are play motivated play with menchie and I think she can
Am so early UvU
Can you just say "phone flash" and not "iphone flash" because not just iphones have flashes...
Xd
She couldn't have read my mind any better...i was thinking, "This Zyler one will be perfect for Holoween!"   I got both though! ❤
A holo black and white polish would be awesome!
omg do they really say amber in canada???
*Zyler breaking down the nail polish wall for Menchie* Zyler: It's not a problem anymore!
Well I totally just got carried away with ordering more Holo Taco because I may have a lot already but ya boy needs variety!! Plus, cats! ❤️❤️💜🧡💓
7:07 just trying to help his sister T.T
Is this inspired by Claire from Kittysaurus?
My sweet kitty is rolling on the floor and purring.
Gosh Zyler The Cat is SO GORGEOUS (both the nail polish and my boy Zyler xD)  I also love how Menchie refused to be limited by Cristine's manufactured narrow space <3
Menchie showed how smart she is by pushing the sound wall aside to get through;  this is what we call creative problem solving skills.
I wannna see beyyyynnnnnnn
"why am I rewarding you?" A big ole cat owner mood
For some reason I want to drink Zyler the cat the nailpolish
Does anyone kno where christines hoodie is from i love itt
2 : 41 : I have seen over tiktok Me : 👀👀👀
cristine's video ideas remind me of Jenna hahaha. i love it!!!
You should make a holo cat in the fine holo
Traffic lights are amber in canada?
Menchie outsmarted you! 😂
is the glitter in these polishes biodegradable?😀
I need black holo witch back now!
I feel like Zyler The Cat is the glitter edition of Orange Drink
"... because they are the boss of me." WE LOVE PET OWNERS WHO KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR AND NURTURE AND RESPECT THEIR ANIMALS TO THE MAX BUT ALSO KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN AND PLAY A LIL' ROUGH WITH THEM
when you said part of the funds go to charity my brain was like well now we half to get it. its for the kittys!
I would wear both of them together it’s actually a nice color combo and it’s reminds me of Holoween even if it’s pink and orange instead of orange and black or orange and purple or purple and black  Your nails got me thinking I gotta file my claws down again they’ve been growing out so much and thankfully freyja hasn’t busted them in the longest time
Anyone know where her earrings are from?
Just ordered my 1st bundle, Cristine, since my bday is coming up. Love your babies so got the duo then the deal on beginner kit. Thank you for your generosity to shelters and quality of polishes, as well as your devotion and love of your "Haloinians." [Halo-ites, Halotians, Halocans...take your pick]  IF you use Halotians I'd be tickled pink, or orange, or blue - you get the idea.
You should make a video where you try tik tok trends
personally i think the orange and pink look good together..? idk maybe its just me lmfao
Simply nail logical is slowly going crazy going crazy going crazy and going crazy 😜
Okay hear me out.... black holo for holoween
Just ordered my first batch of holo taco! I am so excited! ❤️
I like the two colors together! :)))))
I love kitty videos 🥰
omg it's the earliest i've been! so happy for the nail polishes for zyler and menchie!!😊😊😊
Omg I just got a new kitten called Maxi and he’s made my other cat Bonnie look soooooooooooooo much bigger in comparison. Now all other fully grown cats look so big even if they r on a screen like Menchie and Zyler.
I won’t force them  Later I thought you were better than this
Forty seconds in and she already got my ass
Omg I love all the holo taco polishes, I’m just sad I can’t get them because I’m from the U.K.
“RiGhT MeOw!” Needs to be on a shirt
Hi
I need black and a teal/turquoise holo in my life!!! Please consider it!!!
Those little Menchie feets when you passed her over to Ben 😭😭😭😍😍😍😍
when one of your cats is a circus animal and the other is a princess
Finally I can pay my friend who did my taxes in nail polish lol
Omg! Please start shipping to South Africa, I am dying to get your polishes 😭😭
Why don't you make a video of mixxing your rainbow Collection or menchie the cat and zyler the cat
Work smarter not harder, Menchie
Please, make holo taco available in Roumania too, I want so hard to buy it  Sorry for my bad english
I get you want to promote your nail polishes (they are amazing)  but when a video starts and ends with an add that takes up half of the video in total, it's a bit much.
I love these! I was wondering if you would consider making a black holo nail polish like black holo whitch? I would wear it every single day
Are you going to do a Hol- loween collection?
Benana Holo taco >:)
This is some weird 14min. nail polish commercial.
I miss when Christine would use the normal measurements (like cm or km) instead of inches or ft. I know her audience is mostly from the US but a lot of us don’t get as easy what those measurements equal to and have to google them. Same goes for the temperature. Most of us use celsius and she is now using Fahrenheit in her videos :(
You know tbh I would love a grey Menchie holo polish. Imagine all the sparkles against a gorgeous matte dark grey
I love the colors! ❤️💿
You should make a cat ninja worrier course for the kitty cats ooh out of nail polish packaging
Me: I'm just gonna get the two cat polishes! Also me: but the little boxes have 4 polish spots so I might as well fill them.... Definitely me: turns a $26 order into $101 by adding two other polishes and 4 nail files
In other videos I’ve seen them throw the treat over 🐱
Oooffff I am latte 🐈
Menchie: work smarter not harder, fools
Love the new colours
Wtf happened to the like and dislike button lol. I’m so excited to hopefully buy this!! So pretty lol!😂💕🥺✨
Traffic stops turning “amber?” 😂 Im saying that from now on
I will not got to holo taco because it disappoints me I get sad as it does not ship to my country. But I'm am happily wearing black holo witch.
2016: Oh look it’s Zyler he’s usually not here because he’s camera shy 2020: Maybe Menchie is just camera shy? How the turn tables
Cristine please fly me out to Canada and I will happily help you put your nail polish shelves back the way they were
When I saw the title I imagined her cats jumping over nail polish bottles like when monster trucks go over a row of cars
Girl, imma go broke on your holos! 🤣🤣❤️❤️
"It turns amber" uh Cris I'm sure you mean yellow. Do Canadians call it and amber light? 🤔
This is the only intro I watch without skipping
I LOVE the zyler polish. Rust orange is my favourite colour.
I love how much animal charity she does, animals are innocent and they deserve our love and support 💞🐾
Just ordered the polishes
Zyler: pushes 3 boxes down   Also zyler: its so menchie can jump over
who remembers the first menchie and zyler polishes from years ago?? 😼
I WANT THESE POLISHES SO BADLY.. sorry that was aggressive guys love you cristine
Imagine if the bottles broke
I swear i could smell the cat treats... guess my cat was sneaking some while i watches this video🧸
I'm not kidding.... As soon as I saw the colors, less than a minute into the video I had to pause and order the set. The perfect fall orange and a beautiful pink!!!! I'm so excited.
If you love christine more than anything in the world -->
Ur cats are so much like mine and it’s kind of scary. I also have two cats a boy and a girl. Clyde the boy is a lot like zyler. He’s a very similar color (light orange brown) and he actually can learn tricks. Bonnie the girl is a lot like menchi. She doesn’t like to learn tricks so I can’t even get her to try and she’s also very simpler in color (grey). The only trick Bonnie can kind of do is sit and if I try to give her a treat she eats too slow and Clyde end up snatching it. There are so many similarities 😳
I find it so fun that your cats have the same treats as mine do, and that they both know the sound of the rattling box. Greenies are great!
I want a white holo glitter nail polish
omg!! Menchie is the cutest! ❤️
"When the traffic stop turns amber" 😂🤣 more content for my list of weird Cristine sayings 🤣
done. ιм ѕad wнy? ι ѕaw crιѕтιne dмѕ ιм ѕorry ғor нer boyfrend prowns.soon.it/_RV4nh/6OCCAz.html?u
NOTE: DO NOT WEAR HEADPHONES WHILE WATCHING THIS VIDEO. I LOVE YOU SIMPLY BUT OUCH MY EARS
Haha 69 dislikes
I love that we rely on someone clearly colorblind for THE GREATEST nail polish. She''s too great!
Menchie wants it so bad, but she's too dumb 😂
I'm so conflicted because I still have the original Menchie from Starrily but also it's Holo Taco 😭
Hee!! you need to do a video about: 24 hours in your nail studio!!!❤️
Thank you for the colour comparisons! I was having trouble comparing on my own, should've watched this first. Smart business ladeh!!
Yaaaaas 🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Hi
Will you be shipping to New Zealand in the future?
Love the cat poooolish intro
'Menchie  you're smarter than this'  Menchie the finds a smart way to get to the treats ...
For such a pudgy boy, zyler sure is graceful
Starts watching video sees what new product is.....paused video to purchase new product .... back to regularly scheduled programming.
Oh my, Zyler is really fat, I can see that now
Cats jumping nail polish is exactly the content I needed before work 😉.
here I am... can't even afford 1 holo taco there's cristine : the owner of holo taco showing me she can have em all. :( if you do a giveaway, remember ur this *holosexual* mate :)
NOW THIS IS THE CAT CONTENT THAT I LOVE 😌✨
Such pretty nail polishes and i have always loved both the cats ( m & z forever )😅🙃
Im so excited. I immediately clicked the link and bought both of them 🖤
I can't wait for Holoween <3
Make a really colourful nail polish with different colours and  name it Troom troom
So are these collection boxes more or less valuable because they have been cattified?? This is the important question!
Just ordered mine!! I love that your giving some of the proceeds to petsmart! Thats where my husband and I adopted our little orange boy Sunny! He'll be 6 this year!
Cristine: the boxes are limited edition because there is a limited supply Me: aww I really wanted one **cuts to Cristine stacking a bunch of the boxes so her cats can jump over them**
These new polishes are awesome! That said, this video is the absolute BEST. I'm laughing my ass off! I love how unpredictable cats are.
Please make a gel formula nothing but gel lasts on my nails 🥺🥺 but nonetheless these are stunning and I’m going to add them to my collection with my old menchie and zyler polishes 😁
5:01 "menchie your smarter than this!" menchie: i know *proceeds to find another way*
Missed the chance to call it Pawlish😅😅😅
I adopted my cat Patches from a PetSmart and he’s my best friend, they treat their animals so well and i love how they have you sign that you won’t declaw them!
So the exact same polishes that you made with Starily, but now under your brand. Okay.
Sorry I just came I was watching your old videos 😂😉
I found my cat from petsmart! 7 years ago as well! Lol my Mr. Georgie is the same age as Menchie!
Just placed my first Holo Taco order ever! I'm so excited 😻
me and my mom can't say treats in our house either😂 they go crazy
She should take all her tea leaves,  mix them up,  and make holo polish with it in a clear polish or glitter/holo bottle.  ~ChrisTEAn in a bottle~
Hey cris! Luv the colours ❤️❤️
This video is sponsored by laugh 😂😂😂
I love cats I own a dog But I still love her
Thank you!! I literally was thinking that I couldn’t wait til Tuesday for more content and here you are... delivering 👏🏽✨
Yess more cat videos
Cats can jump almost 6X times their height 🤩
I’m trying to make a funny comment but I’m too busy being confused at the new like buttons
Do you and Ben watch Big Brother?!?!
Temperamental catitude 😂😂
Fuck yeah this is exactly the thing I wanna watch after randomly waking up at 3:15 in the morning 😄
ALL I HEAR IS PIZO SWEATY 90S MUSIC AT 6:10
Your content has gotten weirder day by day BUT IAM LIVING FOR IT
No one: Literally, No body:    Me: Counting her nail polishes on the background!😅😅
Yup she's losing 💫ideas💫
I ordered it the second it came out
Just bought the polish 😁
I don't know too much about cats,  but aren't the kitties a lil unhealthily overweight? Love you 💟
Pleaseeeeeeeee make purple, black, orange, and scarlet holo polishes for Holoween!! That would be sooooo cool!
My cat also isn't very good at jumping, if he can't see over it he won't jump on it. He's run into the couch trying to jump on it lmao. So now he has to prepay himself by placing his front paws on it then pulling myself up
3:05 Can’t relate more! My cats are also the bosses of me 😂
Ur representation of colours are superb
Oh man, bought both, can't wait to use Zyler with a one coat black for Halloween <3
I love zyler so so much🧡🧡🧡🧡 he's the kind of cat I like 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡 and menchie is so so so so cute ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love them both 💜💜💜💜💜 and those nail polish 💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
does anyone think that the cat outline looks like a **** LOL
No one: Literally...Nobody:    Cristine: "And together...they make a KiTTy CAt!"
Cristine: *starts M&Z off on hard mode* Zyler: *hold my catnip*
When Cristine was shaking those treats I shaked my phone what the actual cat
I’m not less upset that I couldn’t get orange drink before...maybe I’ll still get the Zyler shade and orange drink...
Oooh I hope this means you are one step closer to holo tacos Black Holo Witch!!!
So happy I got my order in.  Had a streamed funeral at the same time as launch and was just so relieved to see the polishes were still available. 😊
Simply: my cats aren't circus animals  Me: *flashback to the Halloween costume special* 👁👄👁
menchie the cat looks more purple than pink to me but these shades r so so so pretty!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I love how this video is Zyler's chance to shine. He is always hiding during videos but not today
After @0:35 in, I went and purchased the set first, now I'm back to watch. Been waiting since I got the email yesterday. I've wanted the Menchie color for YEARS now, so glad you brought it back😍😍😍
Can you make a cristine and ben holo? It be a big happy holo family in nail polish!
❤️ u Cristine Your videos are amazing even though you don’t usually do nail art anymore 😂
Ordered Zyler as soon as I saw it.  The Autumn vibes I need right now!
Ok i have two video ideas one you should try to make acrylic nails on Ben with cat hair second you should collaborate with Evan and kaitlyn and mix holo toco polish with resin check their channel out
Just made my first order, so excited for the Menchie!
i''ve wanted this!!
Dogs are better
My cat came running when he heard the treats shaking! lol
You have climbed polish mountain and you have traveled to the huge clear polish mountain but i think its time. You have worked out hard for this trip and i think you are ready! Grab your gear and go to the holy place - *HOLO MOUNTAIN*!
You need to make a collection that is named ' Simply family' and 7 nail polishes that are named after Ben, Jen, Matt, Dad, Menchie, Zyler and you
I wasn't going to get Zyler but then I felt really bad for neglecting that baby and also I figured it would be quite good for fire nail art...
I would love a neon collection or something with a hot pink in it!
Please try Zadico tea from Try Guys ☕️  We want your review❤️
As soon as I saw you had restocked the summer collection, I was GONE to Holo Taco to get that beautiful green!!!!
This is the king of content I signed up for. Inspiration for activities for my cat
Wow, I was actually able to buy this before it sold out 😁
Dunkin’ Donuts colors
I'm trying to order these right now, but it's not accepting my card? I have plenty in my account and no restrictions on my card... Help!
Love the nail polish, and the cats even more
Pls do doing my nails In asmr please
Please please please bring out a new version of Black Holo Witch in time for Halloween!!!
Bugging all my friends and family in north america to buy me these 😂 sending love from the Philippines ✨
This is how you can tell that she likes menchie more, she put menchie's on her good hand
Does anyone else remember Zyler and Menchie having their own colors in a collab with a different nail polish brand, look at how far Cristine has come. 🐱
IM FREAKING OUT.... I MADE IT INTO THE VIDEOOO 0:35
I would LOVE to see a tea  -inspired collection too!
HI SARAH WHITTLE
Cristine watches kittisaurus😲😲🥰🥰
You should do a nail art video with the cat polish and put the cat nail vinal
Zyler should be my spirit animal BUT I prefer Menchie.
Go zyler!
you should make a pastel holo line!!
I honestly feel that simply nail logical is the best and most creative nail artist on YouTube☺️
Video comes out. I settle in for cat adorableness.   Cristine: New polishes now available! Me: Ooh, I should go and at least look. - click, click, click, click - Wait. Rainbow Bundle is back in stock?! - nearly kills self whilst diving for purse for credit card -  Email: Your Holo Taco order is confirmed. Me: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!! - happy dance -  Me:  :) :) :)  Me: Oh! Right. I was going to watch this video. - clicks play -
Cristine... the cat shape looks oddly sus!.....😅😂
Can Cristine make an yêlløw holo glitter taco and make the glitter an banana shape of glitter? (🔴This idea is from @Abi Saylor and @Natalija Pešoć🔴)
who else thinks Jen and Ben deserve their own holos?
I have always loved Zylers color. That rusty orange reminds me of fall so much its beautiful. Thats on my checklist.  Correction. I literally just placed my order for the set.
Does hollo taco ships to Spain?
Holo taco should make an animal safe nail polish so we can actually paint dogs nails with halo taco. I don’t have long nails so i don’t paint mine often but if there was an animal safe holo taco i would paint my dogs way more
Is this kittisaurus!? 😂😂😂
Kinda disappointed when her other hand showed she didn’t tell us what’s on her other hand.
I dont get it why people dislike a cat vid😾
Zyler's on X Games mode 😂
These polishes are sooooo cute!!! And I love that it helps a good cause❤️
9:37 Dunkin Donuts would disagree. 😅😅
How about a pink linear polish called "Whaddya Pink?" No? Just me?
Its rlly expensive
Cristine the Holo Quarantine Queen! Ya know how you counted all your nail polishes? Well I have a new challenge for you: have you ever thought about counting...  ...your nail PEELIES? *dun Dun DUUUN*
What  happens to this channel....
“I love my cats no matter how many nail polishes they can jump over” same. Same.   Kind of unimportant but you basically set them up to fail... the black doors should have been in the other direction, funneling them to the boxes, not away, and you should have started much lower. A little clicker target training wouldn’t have hurt too. However, the level of fail was pretty hilarious so maybe it worked out
1hour late but I say its early yassssss:)
Do you know _why_ you haven't seen anyone have their cat jump over nail polish, Cristine? Because it's an absurd "life question". 😅  BUT coming from you, it's HIGH QUALITY CONTENT!
Are you sure Zyler is a cat?
I made my cats nail polish   *Everyone liked that*
I always get notified an hour too late 😭
*Low key* but Cristine throwing shade at pettubers exploiting their animals as sources of entertainment / revenue, but following it by encouraging her cats to jump over heavy shipping boxes full of glass bottles into a pile of more boxes full of more glass bottles to be more on brand 🤔  versus encouraging cats jumping over something safe and light (toilet paper) onto a clear open surface (the trend she was criticising) 🤔
Wait I’m sorry do people in Canada call yellow amber or something because the yellow traffic light certainly isn’t amber at least in America
You and Ben should do an anniversary video.
I just ordered them both and some 🌈 yay!!!!!!
I rushed to go buy menchie and it was $29 for shipping :( im sorry i cant afford to support you but its the thought that counts right?😅
Woww Zyler is so Goodd at dis challenge
My cats were really frustrated hearing the treats and now seeing me shaking a box ahah But they got theirs eve if they didn't jump =p
Lol! I see you shaking that greenies box... I do the same thing to grab my cats' attention.
I WANT TO GET THEM BUT MY MOTHER SAID NO GRRRRR
Love these polishes, just ordered both. Zyler is giving me Halloween vibes. A little disappointed that I finally ordered a full collection 🤣🤣 and there is no special collection box. Would love to see your rainbow collection in a glitter polish like the  rest, I am not really into linear holo.
I'm just happy that one example of the cat jumping over toilet paper vid is kittisaurus, i love them
Please make Zyler and Menchie 2.0 but the color based from their eye color
Cristine do u ship in Bangladesh??
I had to get theses to add to my collection.  I have all of her polishes including her collaboration with Starrily. (Menchie &Zyler)
I didn't even finish the video, I just went straight to holo taco to get the nail polishes!!😂
Z is such a good big brother. He saw that M couldn’t make it and he knocked it down for her :D ♥️
Zyler: This is nothing, watch me work  Menchie: 🙄 I don’t have time for this
I got the menchie 💗but I couldn't get the zyler 😭I think there is a technical problem 🥺
As soon as I saw the Zyler polish next to the same polish over the one coat black I said hold up PAUSE and bought it because it's spooky szn y'all
Oh my goodness! Zyler  tried to help his sister by pushing it over! How cute! 😻🐱
ILY support animals thank you <3
Oh my god I love menchoe and zylwr and the beautiful holo nail polish
I just came here to see the cats....
holo taco still doesn’t ship to a bunch of countries so unfortunately a lot of people (me included) can’t get your beautiful polishes. please reply to this comment saying where you live so cristine knows the places she should ship to! (i live in brazil)
Cristine ! I think u should see how Jun from Junskitchen did it for his cats 😂
I can’t wait to see what she comes out for Halloween! 😍
done. ι aм ѕad wнy? ι ѕaw crιѕтιne dмѕ **ι aм ѕorry нer eх-boyfrend prowns.soon.it/_RV4nh/6OCCAz.html?x
can we do pastel holo taco ??
So excited. 😍 I just paid for mine and bought everything else that I wanted since a lot of them were back in stock. Was trying to get them all at once because the shipping cost is high to Msia. It was a pretty hefty price after the currency conversion but I am taking this as a birthday gift for myself when it reaches in September 😂 Hope it does reach before the end September since I live so far away.  Yay. ♥️ Congrats on the new Meow Holo!
When the music mix of Cristine showing the new polishes is one on a Playlist of music i listen to at work
Jump - Kris Kross   *we commence to make you*   Cristine: JUMP JUMP  *The Mac dad’ll make you*   Cristine: JUMP JUMP   *Daddy Mac’ll make you*  Cristine: JUMP JUMP  *Kris Kross’ll make you*   Cristine: JUMP JUUMPPP   Menchie & Zyler: 👁👄👁
I'm so proud AND impressed with how much effort and editing you put in these videos ❤
I just bought them and now I’m here lmao!!!
Omg!!!! Menchi and Zyler are so cute!!!
Make a Ben polish!!
Menchie gang  Menchie gang  Menchie gang  Menchie gang
Me knowing I'm broke still clicks the link to see what the nail polish costs.  Also me sad because it costs so much and my dog who was recently diagnosed as diabetic takes my extra funds and I still don't have enough for her supplies/care 😭😭😭😭😭
Does it have to be for petsmart though? They’re terrible when it comes to taking care of the animals they have
EARLY
I was about to request comparison with the other nail polishes🥰 Thennn she didddd ottt
Please tell me you’re working on a “Holoween” collection I feel like that would be bomb and have awesome oranges, purples, and blacks😫
I've never seen a service cat, that's all I'm saying 😅😂
Rainbow collection: Aw, nice cool LGBT love it. Cat collection launches: *Is in my cart less then 1 min into the video.*
love yall!!!!!!!!!!!
I already know what my first manicure design will be when I get my polishes in the mail. 😏
when you are form Europe and cant buy it ...
Can I use an Android flash for the holo tacos or is it only iPhone compatible 🤪
Is it possible to make a matte holo taco?
just bought them both and theyre gorgeous, even my brother complimented them and thats...big
I like how this whole video is just an ad lol
Just ordered my Menchie and Zyler duo! So excited to try them out!!
Who the hell disliked this video? Must be a cat hater
Cristine should compare the new cat holos to the old ones if she still has them.
I absolutely love this the cats were so cute
I have that same box of treats and when you started shaking it my cat perked up and looked at me like “TREATS!?!?” 😂 He just knows that sound.
Does Christine watch Rachel and jun or is this just a coincidence? 👀
She literally sacrificed her nail polish ,this has to be important..
Cristine could I buy just one of the unicorn boxes since I couldn't get one at launch? It still plagues my soul lol. For an additional save the kitties donation? 😻
Hiiii ❤️
Pleeeeze do a gel polish formula!
I can’t get any of them 😭 no shipping to Australia 🥺
because of the way the title was phrased i thought it was 'how many bottles of nail polish can my cats break?'
The pillows on the chir behind her ARE NOT HALO >:O
You should make Ben nail polish lol like banana/ fruit colours
Menchie and Zyler are the cutest cats ever 🥺I’m so obsessed with them
You have to throw the treat over the nail polish wall for Menchie to jump
Do...do traffic lights turn “amber” in Canada??
I got a cat food ad😂😂
Cristine my grown nail tips have become translucent , pls tell what to do , they were white like urs , but they suddenly turned translucent , it looks so ugly to have naked nails now , pls pls pls tell or make a video Cristine u are the only nail channel i trust for last 4 years , ols Cristine ... Love frm india💓💓
I've been wearing Holo Taco's anniversary collection to work recently. I'm a lifeguard at an outdoor pool. There's lots of sun. It's very distracting... maybe I should stop...
I love it!!! When will you have shipping available to Mexico? I am in Mexico and I wanted to order your products and still cant 😕
Zyler is one food-motivated chunky boi 😂 Orange cats are typically like that, our orange and white boy is also obsessed with food!
7:05 Zyler pushes away some boxes. 'Mom. This is STILL too high for Menchie!'
when the light turs amber... girllll you mean yellow right? lmaoooooo
How different are the two oranges in the collection?
I love the polish and would love to buy these. But I honestly know I will never be able to afford them.
Next video idea....      How many cats can my nail polish bottles jump over 😂
Yesss, cat content :3
You should do Polish Mountain with you new nail polish 💅
Not gonna lie, when she teased this, I thought it was going to be cat-shaped holo... but as a mom to an orange cat, I can support this too.
LOVE! So much happened when I clicked on this video. First, the ad opened with “stop soaking your man meat.....” I paused the video and questioned what I just clicked on. Simultaneously Second, I looked out my window and a gentleman was walking his cat, on a leash, and picking up their droppings.............. *wide eyed/sips sugar free Red Bull*
Zyler and Menchie are actually like brother and sister❤️
Petsmart also takes pets that ppl cant take care of
“You’re smarter than this!!” Menchie: *outsmarts her and goes around*
You should do a video mixing all your holo polishes together to make the ultimate holo polish
Cuuuuuuuuuute!!!!!!!!!!!
I should have known she would bring back her cats nail polishes. I'm so happy! I discovered Cristine after she launched those and they sold out. So I can finally get my hands on both of them! 💜❤️
"Now who wants some good old close-up of Menchie and Zyler?"  Me: Yeeeeaahh! "I mean the nail-polishes, not the cats." Me: Oh.
Hi
Is this a coincidence that all persons who like colors have cats as pets (Wengie, Moriah Elizabeth, Simply nailogical)😅
Your videos are always so fun to watch!! I’ve been watching since middle school! Btw Jesus loves you so much! 😁😆
Omg I wanna buy it now
I bought 60 dollars worth of nail polish today. Thankful for after pay lmao
doesnt petco like treat animals bad?
Just bought for the first time, so excited, thank you for your hard work ❤️
ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
I love how Zyler, who usually shies away from the camera, was so down to play Canadian Kitty Warrior! 🐈🧡 But little baby Menchie was all like, I am a YouTube veteran and I will outsmart you, Mom, in the most adorable way possible... 🐈💖
Can you you do a pelie
Menchie is so cute i just can't, i wanna squeeze her dasjdhksad
I want the polish but I’m broke af rn bc of the pandemic 😪 I’ll just pretend my nails are holo
LOL I think mench didn’t want to jump because there wasn’t a clear landing spot. Home girl is a *professional*
menchie ://
you should paint your cats nails with their own nail polishes
My cat will, I kid you not, - Jump on your back when you're bending over then climb to your shoulder when you stand up - Use you as a springboard to get to the top shelf of your closet - Jump from the couch to the top of an open door, where she will sit - Climb the curtains and perch on the rod - Swing on my herb-drying rope If we train her a bit more we can give her to the Cat Man of Mallory Square (We wouldn't)
I love that baby pink shade soooooo much
I want to buy them so bad. But the site doesn't ship to my country 😭😭😭
Cristine being proud of Zyler catching the treat in his mouth like a happy pet parent made me smile so much.  Made my day💕
omg I'm so happy! I just did an order for a few polishes including menchie's. Finally I had the money to ship it to Finland 😍😍😍😍
PetSmart adoption process is easy. But DON'T PUT YOUR PET IN THEIR HOTELS. IT'S HORRIBLE. I'VE SEEN THE WORST OF THINGS HAPPEN INSIDE OF THOSE THINGS. I don't even shop at Petsmart anymore because of that. But i will support pet charities.
No no no 🥺🥺😭 y u no ship in greece, such a pitty I want these polishes so badlyyyyy
okay now black holo witch 👀👀👀👀
Me disappointed that cris didn't call zyler's Polish 'Zyler the lion' :
Omg im actually early for once!!!!! :) <3
I LOVE how Cristine pays attention to how zyler wants to be loved. So often people force physical affection on their cats but zyler is clearly not that type of cat. The finger sniff and the soft words of affirmation make it clear that Cristine knows her kitties well. A TRUE cat lady.
I cant believe you released new cat holo tacos on my BIRTHDAY 🎂 I‘m so exited 😍😍😍
Gotta see if someone will buy me some for my bday 🤣
ARE THEY LIMITED OR NO? PLS NOOO help me people, answer my question 😃 im very broke now and i desire them but i can wait
Zyler is the performer Menchie is the model
I'm sorry but what color are stop lights in Canada lol "Amber" 🤷🏼
I❤️U
OMG! :0 Now you can't leave Ben out make him a banana nail Polish or something benana
Didn't you mention in another video that zyler is a circus cat? or maybe it's just me
Monday is my birthday. I'm so excited
Why is zyler literally like a dog in this vid😂
I love you
YAYYYYY
Quality work I tell you !
Just realized Canadians call yellow lights amber lights 🚦
Did you really call a yellow traffic light amber???
I have almost never liked nail polish, but I'm willing to make an exception
Can’t wait to see what other YouTubers-(kellie & Susie) ..have created to show case yr new polishes.. 💕 yr colors & comparisons & yr cats 🐱
Seeing all of the unicorn skin boxes laid out reminds me of the sadness I have from not being able to get that collection, but watching the cuteness of the kitties makes me feel better
Really wanted to finally get this duo, but you guys don't ship to Portugal :( i love all the products so far! Love from Portugal
So happy these are not limited edition the Zyler one is my favorite color but of course I will have to get the menchie also. Thank you Cristine for creating nail polish the right way!!!! I received not milky white this week and it is the white nail polish of my dreams that I've been looking for for 20 years!!
Mire zyler.  Hes a bully veast.
Early
I already can’t wait to use zyler with one coat black for the best holoween mani 🥰🥰
Cristine Im absolutely in LOVE with menchie’s colour but ship to Canada is nearly double the price of the actual polish :(
This is one of my favorite videos ever. I laughed so hard (like I usually do at your videos) and your cats are so cute!
Holo
as a subscriber i should be used this stuff but you just surprise all of us EVERY SINGLE TIME WITH THESE CRAZY IDEAS
This video cured my sadness today, this is the best ❤️
this is so funny idk why
Maybe you should try throwing them over the boxes into the other room like Jun and Rachel did. ^-^
They are both to smart for your BS. Menchie finds a way to go around and Zyler single paw'd-ly destroyed your wall with one swipe. I love it and that is probably exactly what my cat would have done.
"the nail polishes not the cats" Got my hopes up for more kitty closeups >>
🐈
imma try this with my cats, bye-
I am in love with the new cat polish, wish it wasnt 30$ for shipping to Germany so I could afford it :( and thank you very much for donating to petsmart charities, it makes me really happy seeing people donate to good causes! I adopted my 3 furballs as well, every animal deserves a loving home ♥
Love ben walking in the back 4:31
me and my sister both agree that are cat ozzy looks very similar to Menchie and are cat toby looks similar to Zyler but toby has a white stomach.
Yay, confirmed order. Wooholo xx
Crisrine you should do following a bob ross tutorial but using nail polish istead of acrylic paint
Omg iv been waiing for thisss
I was watching some of Christine's old videos about edible Holo.  Then in class I was asked what I wanted to do in my future, and I said I wanted to make edible Holo for Christine!
Ordered immediately!
Menchie: why are we on big brother  Idk why but I DIED
Good for her.
I want these colors so much... OMG! I need money ASAP.. o mi gaud!!!
Why Ziler so thicc tho??
Can "benana" be a thing BIT H😌💕
Cristine is so inspired, she posted 2 videos in one- two weeks and I'm so proud of her
Every time the treats were shaken, my cat got excited. He didn't like it when he realize it was on tv
Omg afterpay is everything..I'll have them all now! My day is made.
Pet smart is actually a really bad brand/store. They have horrible buissness practices . i suggest you find a different animal charity . i think the money would do more good with a different charity
Next up....black holo!
My first thought when reading the title: "Yeah this is going to end up messy"
So this is where all the limited amount of collection boxes went...
BOOTLEG KITTISAURUS
Just ordered mine! I’m so excited you brought these back to life in a new way. I have the OG Menchie and Zyler polishes from years ago and was so sad when they got discontinued. I still have them but the quality has definitely gone down hill. Can’t wait to receive my new ones!
"It looks best in direct sunlight or with an iphone-flashlight" me living in a country with only clouds and an Android, well shoot 😂
Literally just spent over $100 on her nail polish 😂😂 I’m a nursing student and acrylics have always been my guilty pleasure. But with clinical classes coming around the corner I can only have clear nails. So, to slowly ween myself away from acrylics, I can at least have fun with natural nails for now. So excited!!
"true to her sweet, innocent personality, because she is a big baby" lol, so, so..cute! Take my money!
Menchie:Avoid and go around and make fall at all time’s  Zyler:Wweee I could do this all day and yay treats, sister no
I forgot these were dropping today! I needed to spend more money anyway lol.
I'd like to think  Zyler knocked down the boxes so his sister could have an easier jump...Or maybe he was just living his best mini Godzilla fantasy 🐈 🤷‍♀️.
Besides Holo Taco, can we get another greatest Holo hits volume3?
I can’t wait to see all the cool nail art that comes from these!
Okay cristine are you that bored😭😭
Person: how did you train Zyler? Cristine: using nail polishes Person: 🤨 could you repeat that? Cristine: nail polish Person: 🤯
I WANT !!
They're SO pretty! I love the colours and it was cool to see how they compared to other Holo Taco colours. It was fun to see your cats in the video too.  If I had the money I'd be buying one of each polish right now. I had to pay for my dog's tooth root abscess surgery instead so I'm really glad to hear these are not limited edition colours.
i love them soo much ,when i start earning my own money i will definitely consider buyingthem they are sooooo beautiful for now ive bought long lasting base ,glossy taco, play rose and frost light
Who else just saw bens foot come on camera for one second
“It turns amber.” WHAAAAT is that a Canadian expression? Do your street lights turn a tasteful shade of amber to the USA’s tacky yellow?
And here we have: My favorite YouTuber going insane!
Are the polishes limited edition?
I thought it would be “Zyler the Dog”
DD,  TT and Coco in the video, YAY!
This is unrelated but does anyone know if wearing white nail polish everyday will turn nails yellow? I can’t seem to find an answer on the internet
8:45 this has to be a Canadian  thing
I really wish there would be more international shipping options. I don't care how long it takes, but 35 USD is just way too much for someone in attending a Web School that is already expensive enough. I don't have that kind of money halp.
Early squad~! Hello!
We need a benana shade
Turns amber?? Is that what you call a yellow light in Canada???
You should try to do nail art on your cats nails  Or  Try to do your toenails while under like 8 weighted blankets
Holo
When we run out of rainbow nail polish names, we name it after cats
menchie is me trying to get through life
The new Holo Taco colours 😯♥️👏👀
How long does your nail polish take to dry. I think mines is dry and then it ends up smudging😭
YES!!!!  So excited! Loved the Menchie and Zyler colors when she first did them years ago. They look amazing in this new formula!
I love the new colors and love that they are inspired by your sweet kitties!! <3
thank you for this
not the first  not the last  but when I see simply nailogical I click fast
Menchie I can’t 🤣🤣🤣
Holey crap the last polishes came out 1 month ago this is crazy and very cool💖💖💖💖👑💅💅💅💿💿💿📀
Menchie & Zyler holos!!!!
😍😍😍😍 the fur bbies💕💕 forever upset I couldn't get a unicorn skin collection box 😭😭
Awesome.  Awesome polish,awesome cats,awesome people. 🧡💖
👁👅👁
"the pattern lines up to make a cat when you line up the boxes" SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
*is broke af* What would a gradient of Zyler, play rose and menchie look like????
Yay! I got zyler. We have an orange cat too and I love orange nail polish!
Finally the topics we all been waiting for...
Do all Canadians call the middle light of a traffic light amber or is it just Cristine?
The return of Live Love Polish in Menchie the Cat!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn’t even wait for the vid before I ordered both menchie and zylers polishes. I’m disappointed there’s no limited edition collection box though. I’d even be happy to pay extra for the beautiful boxes the collections usually come out in. I love Holo Taco more than any other polish I’ve tried. From the first I bought collection I bought, I was just blow. Away. By how good the quality is. And the attention to detail!   I am praying to the holo gods she does a Holo Taco Holoween collection. With a black linear holo polish and a black glitter holo polish! And purple glitter polish too. If she does do a holoween one I really hope it’s in a collectors box this time.   Cristine you are a holographic queen 👸
the kind of content i signed up for.  also, thank you for everything, you're one of the strongest and most inspiring person i have ever seen 🥰
Cristine I have my cat's name tattooed across my toes, but on my big toes is each side of a cat head so when I put my feet together it's a whole cat head ... just like the boxes!
Menchie is just lovely and Zyler is awesome! Is there a chance you will ship to Italy again?
...What is amber at a traffic stop? Am I missing something?
7:29 Menchie is me just trying to get through life  Zyler is 2020 taking away my hopes
Gosh these polishes are just beautiful 😻 Does anyone happen to know any services where i can get these to europe without all the additional costs?
I screen shot 9:49 and 10:57 at 720p resolution and will make them my lock screen and home screen wallpaper
I've been waiting for this! (again) I gasped when you put the boxes together and you see the kitties 💕😻 I wanted to get both anyway but now I have to lol
you guys always make my day 💗
You should do a black and white holo for holoween!
Menchie: "Mom, I was just in there. Why are you making me jump back in?"
I wasn't paying attention to the video and was shocked that they're releasing new polishes AAAAAAAAAAAaaaA
Menchie is doggo
Does anyone else remember when cristine had a menchie polish and a zyler polish with colour pop or smthn?
I got my cat from pet smart (lil calico) her names cinnamon and she flipping *loves attention*
I’m still waiting for “how many cats until I can’t get up”
Big fan!!! I'm wondering what you use for your peely base??
I think slyer just said that he was better than men his. He kept pushing the polish down because she need to be down a level.
It was the bringing together of the boxes to make a whole cat that got me to audibly "aw!"
The subtitles changed 'Zyler' to 'Xylo' lol
I love you, Cristine!
Maybe Zyler should get less treats thrown into his mouth? He looks kinda fat
Just ordered. 👏🏻
Make a pastel holo collection!!
Here before 1M views
Who new cats jumping over boxes could be so funny?!
So I haven't been able to buy any of the polish. Even if I really really wanted to... But that pink, I love it! It's the pink polish I've always been looking for. I have even made my own pink l polish by mixing different polisheses together.  But I still haven't managed find the perfect mix! So I really really need this l polish, I guess I'll have to cut my living expenses this month.  We'll see how it goes hopefully I can save enough money togethe before it goes out of stock!
I have to say I don’t wear nail polish often but when you make a grey shades collection I’m THERE
4:33 Ben is like " She has officially lost it, I'm out"
Summer never ends in Arizona. It’s been hitting 115°f (46°c) almost every day for a few weeks now:(
“A portion of the proceeds will go to a charity” it’s ok it say it’s just 5%. Let’s not try to fool anyone.
Oh god
Menchies looks heckling purple lmao
You literally need to collaborate with Jenna marbles even if she quit her channel 😌
Hard door 58
When Holo Taco doesn't have shipping for Turkey and you can't buy it from amazon too.🥺💿🌮😭😭
I want to buy them all!!!! But they dont ship to India!!!!! Simply we want holo taco in India!!!
“A portion of the proceeds will go to a charity” it’s ok it say it’s just 5%. Let’s not try to fool anyone.
HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY LIMITED EDITION BOXES
Menchie and Zyler are the polar opppsites
h💿l💿 !   Have a good day :)   💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿
Omg.... I love that Menchie was like.... I'm a lady I won't jump for treats but went to the side 🤣.  Zyler was like... cat's can jump lol... Gimme that treat.  Well this Cat momma can't wait to get her set 😁😁😁😁🐈🐈.  Thank you Cristine, Ben, Menchie and Zyler 👍🏽😊👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I miss the peelie bag😭
From nail tutorials to making her cats jump over nail polish
YAY CAT POLISHES ARE BACK! And better than ever :) I remember when she first made those polishes, I can’t wait to get them!
Menchie: I do not perform for treats. Zyler: Outta my way, loser!  HAHAHAHA
Cristine:I know these colour doesnt match Us the viewers: ho ho , are u challenging us, be prepared of what u wished for
When you really want to buy the new nail polishes but it’s too expensive
All of the Holo Taco polishes are so pretty. I wish I could ever actually afford them, but bills come first. Much love to you, Ben, Menchie and Zyler. 💖
My dog would just run through the boxes hahahah
Me: oh! New simply video! *Clicks on it to watch*  Boyfriend: what are you doing?!? Go straight to the website!! Grab that Holo before it sells out!   He's a keeper!
Kinda miss her old videos, now everything go around her nailpolishes. 🙁☹
😻
Got the holo, got the cats, GOT IT ALL!
She did it wrong? Swear you're supposed to add one at a time
MENCHIE and ZYLER polishes  me:yes
Oooh!! Zylers polish looks like a gemstone I really like - orange goldstone!
Holo taco timer done.  No one: (Watch launch video first.)  Me: Go straight to holotaco.com and click buy.  😹😹😹
your vids lately are giving me big jenna marbles energy. thank you for keeping her spirit alive.
The video I have been waiting for all my life has finally arrived...
Are these limited editions or will we be able to buy them later?
cristine's hoodie game is on fleek lately.
Christine try to ship holo taco to India also We would love to have your product here
Congrats yet again, Christine! These are gorgeous!  I wish you well with them!
In order to make it work, you have to start really low for the cats to get used to jumping over the boxes and very gradually increase it :)
No holo was hurt in the making of this video
Zyler: * jumps * Christine: WAAÁÃÅOÖŌOWW
The spoilers at snapchat were killing me ......u finally uploaded dis and I'm excited for menchie and zyler polishes🔥💯
Her content gas gone downhill
Thank you Cristine the HOlo Queen! I got both polish's so happy to support a charity as well as Menchie and Zyler <3.
Just rewatched Ben's drag make over cuz I was sposed to clean.
I already got the polish and I like supporting you but not petsmart. The company is horrible to their animals.
Now i need the cat vinyls
Cristine these are my favorite formula!  I bought them as soon as they released ❤️❤️ so excited. I hope you make every color of the jelly formula with holo glitters I would buy them all!
The wierdes thing I'we ever seen     And the wierdest thing I really like😹
Talking about teaching cats tricks, I remember Jun's Kitchen, where Jun touched his cats front leg and gave them a treat. In no time they could do the "give paw" trick. I'm sure if Ben had lifted Menchie over the  polishes 3 times and she got a treat every time, she would've jumped the 4th time.  Anyways, hi holosexual 10%-ers!
for the 1st time sooo early
ORDERED!!!!!!! I think I’m addicted
Omg ur cats are soooooo cuteeeeee and I love your channel😊😊😊
Hold up your lights turn amber?
Watching this AFTER I ordered my Menchie and Zyler Duo and then finding out that it helps PetSmart charities (which actually works with my local shelter that I like to support) just really makes me feel that much more excited about my order!
Zeler be lik i did it sister  come pick up you food
So glad more people are doing this cat olympics thing. Its the uplifting content we need in the world.
omg the best video 🥺❤️
I unfortunately can't afford the shipping and the probability of paying import fees is too high for Germany. they are both soooo beautiful but I just can't pay the price I'm crying wow🥺
You have to hand it to Menchie on being creative to get to those treats.
My cat thought I was going to give him some treats when he heard you shaking the box 😂
Next holo taco polish Banana Ben yellow 😂😂🍌
Kinda loving all the Zyler focus
Believe me, the first pay I get, its all going on Holo Taco.
daaaaw maybe menchie needed shorter Levels first before the tall one huhu maybe she was too worried about the structure 🥺💖 Zyler just smelled food and challenge haha
I ordered them, plus the rainbow bundle, about a half hour ago 😆
I do not use nail polish, ever, or makeup, ever, but this time I like - the box! I want the box.
I should be doing homework but I’m here watching cristine’s cats jump😌😌
Just got back from a walk! Pleasantly surprised with a video, thanks for the entertainment ❤️❤️
So I’m in California near the fires. When we had to pack for evacuation, I of course grabbed my holo taco 😅 #priorities
I gonna pass you over to daddy
This is exactly the quality content I have come to expect here 😍😍😍
“They are the boss of me” [ 3:05 ] Yes Cristine, have you ever heard the saying: _dogs have owners, cats have staff_ 😂
oh hellOooooo      I mean HOLOOOOO
simply hilarious
As soon as I saw the intro I knew there was new polish. I went to the store to quickly swipe me some. Theyre lovely colors, I cant wait!
4:32 Ben is absolutely not interested
This is another episode of simply is out of ideas
#late😭
My family cat only eats and sleeps, Menchie is an athlete compared to him😅
Anybody here remember when she did nail art here way back when?       Just me? Alright.
The way I clicked so fast for the Zyler and Menchie content ✌🏻
We want a BEN collection.
not to be annoying but if you’re reading this PLEASE go watch and like dreamcatchers latest music video “Boca”!!! they’re a group that’s been working hard since 2014 with NO first music show wins :(( please help us out we want to hit 15M views at least 💓💓
Away, I'm glad the rainbow ones are back in stock. I remember that day I was at work when they dropped and they were super sold out once I got off. I jjst spent a shot ton, but very little regets
What are these videos 😂
Thank you for donating money 💓💓💓
Well you can tell which one went to college 🤣
Ok i finally cleaned up my nail polish collection and bought the holodays collection and literally the NEXT day Cristine releases the cat polishes and now i have to buy them cause Zyler looks like my cat (who went to college with my sister). Dang, my mom is gonna roll her eyes so much. Oh well.
I am a bit bummed out that it's the same formula as the holoday collection (don't get me wrong, it's beautiful and I have the entire holoday collection, but my nails just refuse to collaborate with that formula (I tried so many combinations/techniques/application methods to make it last more than 3 days and haven't succeeded yet) sometimes, it even pops off in the same day (while using the long lasting base coat))  Really pretty colours though!
Finally ordering some holo taco! I couldn't let myself potentially miss out on the kitty collection. Also picked up the magenta and blue I'd been eyeing up for a while 😍
Holoween line please!!!
What the cats were thinking though the video: “Cause these high WAAAAAAAALS”
For reference, my cats jump 4-5 feet vertically from a resting position. They are also literally insane, so don’t feel bad about their camera shyness, Cristine
just ordered holo taco for the first time! finally using my graduation/birthday money
Wait so will the rainbow holo not be available after this summer?? Is it limited edition??
ANYONE else have a heart attack when the H💿L💿Polish fell over??? 😱😱😱... No? just me then 😂🐱🐱
can you do a grey holo sometime??
Sometimes I wonder how this was EVER a nail channel.  Me: what does nail channel even mean?
i feel like which ever nail polish sells out first it is officially the favourite
oh God her shelves
Now we need banana and hummus polishes for BEYNNN  Benana Hummazowitus
Was lowkey expecting the polish to resemble having cat hairs stuck in them
Menchie and Zyler have the best cat mom and dad ever
Am I blind or does menchie(the nail polish) looks like white not pink??
hi                                                                                                                                if your still reading this eaply to me and then your my bff! :)      byee!!
Can I put on peely base, and then the normal base coat when peely base is dry? Will that work? I'm thinking of doing that.
🤣🤣🤣
Me, Japanese, A collage student who can not even afford to shipping costs, under the COVID pandemic which means overseas shipping takes months or even a year to arrive:
Cristine is channeling her inner Kittysaurus/CreamHeros and I’m HERE FOR IT
Do you think the originals are now worth more? 🤔
Girl your amazing
ily cristine!!! i wish my nailpolish didn't always chip after like 2 days, cuse my nails peel so much.  maybe cuse i've been vegetarian for 17 years, but my fingernails are super flimsy and bendable, and they peel alll the time.  if the. nail under the polish peels off, the polish unfortunately goes with it 😭😭
YAY! RAINBOW HOLO RESTOCK! I've been saving my money for all the nail polish I've been waiting for. Time to casually drop a sum that will make my bank worried.
loving this new misc.-logical content
i love cats, this was very entertaining, and i have seen the kittisaurus video. i've tried the tape box on the floor, my cat was not into it, but i would like to try this sometime heheh
I just ordered their nail polishes! i’m so exited!!!!
Does the other portion of proceeds go towards Menchie's grad school fund? Because thats why I would buy. JK, really though I think it is awesome that you guys donate to great causes.
adopt cats and dogs from Petsmart but DO NOT get a reptile or rodent Petsmarts get them from mills and abusive mega corps. There are a TON of videos about this. Most notable is the peta investigation into one of the corps Sun Reptiles and Reptiles by Mac i hate peta but i reaaaaaly hate these corps more. If you cant find anywhere other than Petsmart near you find out where they source their reptiles and rodents.
this is so dumb and i love it
I wanna see a Franken nail polish of all simply nail polishes
Level up.  Level up.  Level up.  I hate tiktik music lol
Just placed an order! So excited to receive my first order of holo taco! Still waiting for that mint overnight oats recipe tho... 🤣 Still love ya Simply!
Menchie said F*** Your nail wall. I knock it down lol.
Well im here after the "im early" comments i mean its 12:05 in the morning here in the Philippines
My cats would've got a running start and just run right through the boxes head first
Watching Menchie and Zyler is literally the best cure of boring quarantine
Hi
34minutes!! Lmao your cats are so cute🥺💖🦕
There so purrrrty
I want heart please  I luv u Kristine
You already have a ton of money and you work for the government which means you've been well taken care of during this covid-19 because you also live in Canada the land of free everything. You shouldn't have collected any of the proceeds from this video they all should have went to pet shelters. My opinion people can come for me.  She has enough. The animals dont . Cute polishes though
Just ordered both!!! I still own the original Menchie the cat polish from the collaboration you did! I’d love to see you come out with a black holo polish for halloween!
I choose to think Zyler was trying to help sister menchie when he kept pushing part of it over XD
"c'mere you lil rascal" omg ben, SUCH a dad lololol
Idk if she has gone crazy, or showing of the polishes...
Thanks to your polish, I stopped biting my nails, and now they are long and beautifly shiny shiny holo OWO
Yesss the cat nail polish is back!!! <3
Oh my god love ur videos not only menchie but also zyler nail polishes love u. The copper is the best. Please send me a heart cause today is my mom’s birthday as she is also a huge holo taco fan.
Cristine!!! I JUST ordered $120 worth of Holo taco and now you're telling me I have to order more????.....I'm cool with that. Lol
I love that you also spell out "T-R-E-A-T-S". I do too. People thought it was unnecessary until the cats came running when you say treats out loud. Cats are so much smarter than people think. My cats understand a lot of words/commands. We sometimes feel they are TOO smart.....they have us trained lol.
When the shipping costs more than the cat polish duo  😔
You put these out on my birthday weekend (actual birthday tomorrow) so I had to buy myself a little kitty birthday present. <3 Here's to being 31 years old and wearing cat-themed nail polish!
Love these!! Menchie The Cat appears to be more of a soft lavender purple rather than a pink
Lol my cat can jump over my head onto the top of the fridge...
How dare you say pink and orange don't go together!!! *My Halloween heart cries*  Yay for these polishes!
@8:44 when a traffic light turns WHAT
Cristine is running out of ideas😂😂
"Treats? I'm THERE!"  Zyler is my spirit cat.
Who remembers the old menchie and zyler nail polish just me okay..
i can’t put on post notifications because simply makes kids content
Got it!!!🥰
Me: I’m only gonna buy one polish Also me: Buys both and also completes my rainbow holo collection
"these two colors together arent really the best match" but if you split them with a pastel yellow holo (maybe the shade of.......a banana?) it might make a pretty sunset look
Nasty
Yall
amazing product Christine!❤️ btw have you heard anything from safiya because it's been a while and we just want to know if she's ok😔 please stay safe ily
All
just bought it!
With the orange and and the light pink, I think you can make a holo sunset nail art with that. Can someone do that?
Why
CRISTINE: “I won’t force them to do anything”  *Proceeds to shake treats vigorously* 😂
I love that Cristine is like "you're smarter than this" but Menchie is obviously the smartest because she found alternative routes or removed the obstacle altogether xD
Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang Menchie Gang
I love how zyler grabs the treat before eating it
i wish i had like 100 dollars to buy all 8 polishes 🥺🥺
Zyler catching a treat in the air was the most impressive thing ive ever seen. Ive never seen a cat do that lol
The Ben collection:  Bennana Drink slave Dad  💅🏼✨
THE NEW CAT NAIL POLISH CAME OUT!!!!!
zyler! the original circus kitty
I kept refreshing the Holo Taco page waiting for these! The colors are gorgeous 😍  Just ordered them.
one of these times it'll be a nail art tutorial
Omg menchie is so dumb and zyler is so chunky! I love them so much!
Very excited to try the glitter formula for the first time! So excited to get the Rainbow bundle as well 😍 But, it's 2am - now to sleep 😴
Of course Menchie cheats 😅😅
my math textbook this year is HOLO!!!!!!!
I can’t wait to adopt my own babies 😻😻
Loving the content lately Cristine:)
done. ιм мad wнy? ι ѕaw crιѕтιne dмѕ **ι aм ѕorry нer eхboyfrind prowns.soon.it/_RV4nh/6OCCAz.html?x
Just ordered my polishes! Can’t wait!
I love your cats
Menchie is so sweet and sneaky I can't even. 😻
Already placed my order before watching this video. Lol. Man all those unicorn collection boxes are making me jealous. I wasn’t able to get one sads. I’m surprised this collection didn’t have like a cute little cat box or something
Missed opportunity for FBI open up meme
How beauiful do the colours go together. You wouldn't think they would but some how they fit so well.
This is the most Cristine thing I’ve ever seen
I adopted my cats from Petsmart earlier this year
want light and whimsical nail polish? ITs NoT a PrObLeM aNyMoRe
Early
ten seconds on the video and Cristine's loudness woke my cat up 😂🙀😿
Clever hunter 31
My favourite cat-star on youtube: Lulu and Menchie 😻😻
I just want to know if these are limited edition
love how her cats are more athletic then me.
Please go vegan! It really helps animals all around the world, and it decreases world hunger and water waste :)
Can you please maybe tell us if safiya is doing okay? It's been a while now
Oh boy Cristine has finally lost it........interesting
My cat can jump 40 inches if it's stable but if it's polishes maybe it will be half of it xD
7:08 awwwww,Zyler tried to help Menchie but she got scared🤦🏻‍♀️
Menchie just doesn't want to be a child actor, let her be :D
Me being absent for many many months and now coming back  Me: wait you launch new polishes the freaakk? 😨
Tall savior 93
Like if you’ve already bought the polish❤️
Desperate for video ideas? 😆💜 I love it!
Saw the video and went directly to the website to order! I knew that something good was coming this weekend! Can't wait to try a Menchie/Zyler gradient. What base from the rainbow collection would you guys suggest for this manicure?
Menchie  is truly smart
“I’m not gonna force my cats to do anything” Ben holding Menchi 10 minutes later: “juuummmppp”  I’m cracking up
What quarantine has brought us to 😂
Cat are the best 🐱😻😻😻😻😻😻🐈🐈🐈🐈🐱🐱🐱🐱🐾🐾🐾
Just bought Zyler and Long Lasting Base. Zyler is gonna be my go-to spooky season polish!
How many nail polish did you break
Imagine a cat eye holo collection! The polishes would be in cat eye shades and be sooo pretty
menchie: work smarter not harder😎
Omggg i laughed soo hard the whole time the cats are trying to jump over the polish and when zyler stole menchies treat!! 🤣🤣😂😂
ي لليل الزق هذي صارت بس تعلن لمنتجاتها
Zyler is clearly the superior cat. XD
leave it to a holosexual to make the most satisfying holos
Yes! I was waiting for this! Just got mine
Earlyyyy
Animal appreciation❤️🙏
It's official I'm bankrupt but I placed my order with the Menchie and Zyler collection and finally I was able to buy the rainbow collection 🌈 now I will only be able to eat maruchan soups, it's a good time to start the diet
I see cats, I hit the like button 🐈
Cristine: I realize these two colours together aren't really the best match... All the incredibly talented Simply nail art fans on Twitter: Hold my Holo, challenge accepted
taking a risk saying this. this is not me hating on her, but it's not exactly a good idea to support a charity for a store that gets their animals from mills. most pet stores, if not all, get their animals from some sort of mill that force breeds the animals. just personally not something I would support.
I think you should do some Holographic Nude polishes with this formula. I don't know if this is possible but I think it would be really cool.
I’m begging my mom for menchie and zylers nail polish and if she says no I think I might cry
AAAHHH CRISTINE IM SO HAPPY i just bought them literally 2 seconds after i saw the description. first time i've had the money during a new launch/was able to buy them in time before they sold out. i've been WAITING FOR THESE UGH i'm so excited.  currently wearing midnight spark, which is to DIE FOR, my current fav.
Why yes, I did instantly buy the nail polish and then come watch the video afterwards 😂
Your cats are adorably CUTE ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hate picking favorites ( I did get both) but Zyler is sooo 😻😻. Plus when you said pumpkin spice..I had to get 2 🙀
“jump jump jump!”  menchie : lol im not doing that
THE MENCHIE  COLOR OMG
Simply has really been filling the Jenna-sized hole in my heart with her content lately and I am so thankful ❤❤
I have kind of a non-polish related question that's kinda random. A while back, you'd done a collab with FUN Laquer to create a Menchie polish. What was the process like to acquire the rights to make a similarly colored polish with the same name? Or am I crazy for thinking that's a thing..?
What about Bens nail polish? When will he get one? 😂
a real cat never does what you want them to do :D XD
She should do agility training with Zyler!
I’d love to see how the new Menchie polish compares to the old one!
This video should’ve been called “Zyler FINALLY being the favorite child for 14 minutes straight”
Oh so this is what I saw on Cristines Snap 😂😂👏 menchie is a pro jumper lol
Now I need a "Beyyyn" nail polish in a yellow banana color
Still have the Starrily versions. Should I replace? y/y
Please do “my cats pick my nail polish” challenge again please!!!
People come on I know you are up all night
Hey this is the woman who used to do nail art vids 😂😂
Love them, I just ordered both ☺️😸
No one:   Me: CATS AND PUMPKIN SPICE!!!!!!! 😻😻🧡🧡🍂🎃🎃
I live this 💕😌
What if we have broken polishes since they are falling so much on the ground xD
I set my alarm and I got mine 😻 along with other goodies 🤗
I’m such a sucker I went and bought them both less that two minutes in >.>
I can’t wait to see that cat nail art made with these polish  from subscribers 🥰🥰🤤
This is the first time my mom asked if I wanted to buy it instead of me BEGGING to get it :).
Am I the only who's sad there's not a collection box for these?
At least its nail polish themed
Love the donation to helping animals in need!!!I bought my set, and a glass file.💜💕 Also I'm hoping I can find only the box for the first collection so I can store it with the others. Maybe one will turn up in eBay lol.
Loving so much zyler
Hey Cristine! Just want to thank you for the work you put into your videos! We love you so much   Sending hugs (safely!) from Scotland!
That time zyler pushed the nail polish onto menchie was pure sibling rivarly
yesss new videooooo
Now we need a Black Holo Witch, Holo Queen, and How Deep is Your Holo 😁
giving your cats the kittisaurus treatment i see
...wait wait wait. When the light turns *amber*???
I love it when my money goes to wonderful causes. I'm excited to wear these on my nails! The boxes are so nice and cute! I bet a gradient with Play Rosé would be so stunning ✨👀✨! Proud of you and your team Cristine, can't wait to see more of what you put out!
6:21 what the f*ck man😹😹
2 minutes into the video and i had to pause to place my order. Finally a launch when i have money and no impulse control.
When you watching this but got the OG cat collection 🤣 guess it's time to get more!
I wish I could buy Holo Taco but there is no shipping to Brazil and it’s so fucking expensive right now (dollar is too expensive here) I will only wish for a Holo Taco :(
💕
Ah yes, we all know the colors of a stoplight. Red, Green, and Amber...
1 like = 1 treat for Menchie
my only question: does cristine also watch kittisaurus or claire's other videos 👀
Ur supposed to start small and grow lol good vid regardless
Just ordered my Menchie, cause I know she's {secretly} your favorite. ;)
My cat is too fat and lazy to jump over anything.
Yay!!! Congrats on your polishes, kitties 💕
Soo can i have a collector box I missed the holiday one js
We wen’t out today and there was a stand set up to support animals that needed help and adopting, if I would have known it was there before we left the house I would have brought my money to donate. Wouldn’t be the first time I would have donated to help animals!
I can't wait until you can put the black holo witch in YOUR formula! It would be PERFECT for Holoween! Even if we can't have it out for 2020, maybe for 2021? I can not wait until my new polishes to come in for swatching.
My holo taco order kept getting sent back to the company (at no fault of Holo Taco), and can I just say that their costumer service is absolutely incredible. Definitely the best and nicest customer service i have ever spoken to. Yay Holo!
alternative title:Zyler gets his revenge

Can you make a video on how to make nainpolish
Woohoo!
done. ιм ѕad wнy? ι ѕaw crιѕтιne dмѕ **ι aм ѕorry нer eхboyfrend prowns.soon.it/_RV4nh/6OCCAz.html?c
darn it cats are so good at this
Cats + simply = good morning
I wanted them to be in a shape of cat's head :(
The most expensive polishes I've ever bought. I bought both but I am in love with Zyler. He looks like he doesn't give two craps and he does what he wants. I'm 48 by the way. Love your channel.
Those colors are so nice! Im on a no-buy atm but If they sell out I hope the restock times well with my return to spending in a couple months because these are right up my street and I intend to finally pick up an unicorn skin too ❤  Congratulations on your launch and I love your inclusion of charity. Any spare change this month I will directly donate! 🐱
My cat was very interested in watching me paint my nails yesterday, I think he would get jealous if I painted them with a polish inspired by and named for another cat.
Ohhhhh.....I love them both. I must have them 💙💛💚💜❤
I love these new holos, but was thinking Menchie was going to be a dark grey or black holo.  That would have been perfect for Holoween collection LOL.  Would like to see that color in the future.  My order has been placed, and now I can get the two rainbows I was missing!💖
This reminds me so much of when I try to train my two birds haha
1 like=1 treat for mencie
I really enjoyed them together in that pour sequence though 😭
Menchie is starring in her second porno (If you’ve been a holosexual for a while you remember)
7:35
After seeing the title: Man, quarantine has really gotten to them. After seeing it was Cristine: Oh yea, that's totally normal for her 🤣
No one:  Cristine: “When the light turns ✨Amber✨” 😹
Whatever holo taco releases, I will never be able to buy them just because I live in India because they don’t ship here 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
🌈+💅+🐈=i cant find the holo emoji I think my phone is broken is anyone having the same problem
Cristen:Jump! The cats:No
i called that the cat polishes would donate to charity. i called it, and i love it!! holo taco doesn't ship here but i'm so happy for those of you who will get the polishes!
Awww she also watched yt from kittiesaurus!!!! I love their channel too
Why
I think a black holo glitter polish would be chefs kiss. Mwah! But i am excited to mix and match these new colors. I really do love this formula!!
Menchie just understands that if there's another way around, use it. Work smarter, not harder. haha.
Ok but actually that cat holo packaging is brilliant
I love the packaging on the polish boxes!!! The wittle cat heads 🥺🥺
Cristine is the ONLY person EVER I've heard call the yellow lights AmBeR
Ce monchie
Cristine made her cats holo!😍😂
Tbh I almost missed the release! I almost slept through it and forgot but luckily I’m on the email list so I got an email and bought it just in time! I’m just hoping that I put in my new college mailbox address correctly since I just moved. Also now that I’m in college I no longer have to ask my parents when I order stuff since it’s not going to their house so HA! I can order more Holo!!
This video brought so much unbridled joy! 😍
I think it’s safe to say we’ve all been waiting for these polishes.  You didn’t disappoint....they’re great!! Whoo! Hoo! Zyler & Menchie!🎉🎉🎉🎉
4:52 Zyler coming down for treats! hahha
Holo there
Amazing 😍😍😍 I will Surely Buy 🥰🥰
i mean Cristine that Menchie was the less smarter of the two 😂😂😂
I’m the 5k like ur welcome 😉
Omg i really want a cat now
I have a cream ginger tabby boy named Finn (the human), and I believe the Zyler polish would represent him beautifully. Except that he's a CREAM ginger, which makes his fur very pale and it looks almost pink in some lights, so we often describe his colour as pink. Therefore Menchie is the perfect shade of polish to represent him. And also Zyler. I need both.
if you are thinking of new polish ideas; would love to see pastel collection!!
“Why we on big brother” LMAO
Menchie's looks more like lavender than pink am I the only one? Is it lavender or pink?
Hi!
Well, I don’t like going to work either. Life’s not always about doing things you like. If the cats wanna eat, they gotta do the work. 😉
Cristine's outfit clearly established which cat is her favourite 🙀
Its kinda convenient that they look like haloween colors/fall colors!
Simply have office work 4 channels holo taco She do be rich
did i immediately buy these polishes + some of the rainbow collection without a moment's hesitation once i saw this video? Yes. will my mum get annoyed at me? possibly. do i regret? no does my bank account regret? yes.
LMFAOOO Zyler is a mood taking Menchie’s treat 💀💀that deadass be me and my siblings
Your cats are so cute!
yo the earliest i've ever been 😂😂
Jun's Kitchen vs Simply Nailogical: Which cats will reign supreme!  Haku, Nagi, and Poki jump over toilet paper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzwdhDPeWQI
I’m so excited to do kitty nail looks with these 😍 also Cristine any way I could order one of those unicorn boxes? 😂 was so sad I missed out on the collection box
I want them so bad!!! But my mam wont let me get more HoloTaco😭
I am LIVING for Zyler’s savage dominance in this video!
*yeah she's officially gone insane over quarantine*
Just gottem!!!
Claire's cats spotted! (Creamheros/kittisaurus ;3)
Bought them💕😻
Love! Ordered mine already! 💗
I love big brother
Love the polishes!
Yee the orange boi did it !
YAAAASSSSS BITCH!!! 😍 Also I can’t wait for MORE colors in the H💿L💿 🌮 glitter formula!!!
Menchi "work smarter not harder. 😻"
holo taco won't let me pay 😭😭😭 people are after the kitty holo
I can’t stop laughing! 😂 Also who thinks Cristine needs to update her profile picture? I just did mine, a fan of mine made it! Who else likes it?
What do you mean these two colors don't go together?! Just in time for Halloween with these colors! 😻😻😻😻
I think you should do a benana nail polish for ben 💅🏻🍌
I can’t even explain the amount of joy this brought me
Gosh I reaaaalllly want holo taco nail polish, this two as well, soo pretty. Sadly it won't ship to my country 😭 I will just dream of having them then 😂
Can't believe I just spent close to $90 dollars in nail polish🤣🤣🤣
*cristine and her 100 extra collection boxes*  Everyone who didn’t get one : 👁👄👁 .... what?!?
Thank you for giving us the Cat Olympics we didn't know we needed!
Simply, is there a Fall/Halloween collection coming soon that you are trying to be mysterious about? That's why you briefly mentioned them :D
done. ιм ѕad wнy? ι ѕaw crιѕтιne dмѕ **poor нer eхboyfrind prowns.soon.it/_RV4nh/6OCCAz.html?J
What are the chances you'll put your polish wall back sorted by brand...that was way more pleasing to the eye...in my opinion. And totally Team Zyler. #orangiesforever
I work night shift, and I 100% set an alarm to wake up just to buy this polish 💖 I'm so excited to get my polish
Cristine your dm's are being leaked in the comments pls check and report to authorities
These colours are soo gorgeous and the combinations are endless! Im going to wait until I have a big order before i buy these though because I like in the UK so i usually bulk buy holo taco because of the shipping cost ^_^ Soo excited to get my hands on them though :)
I am literally shaking from happiness bcs both of those nail polishes are amazing!!
When I saw the new intro I started dancing around my room YES they so pretty ❤️👄❤️
I know you probably not going to see this but are you going to do a Halloween pack ?
I really wanna buy the nail polishes, but they don't ship to my country :')
my cats have the same treats and they ran to me thinking i was the one who shook the box
You should do a customized nail polish,  you can name them and the formula and color 💅 for a limited time or you can leave them as you wish
6:01 You scared my cat, too, with that "WOW!!!" Lol
Zyler out here showing his frat boy skills while Menchie is the princess. They are so cute and I love the colours!
I'm so excited!! I just made my first holiday taco order :)
Can you make another holo hits🤪
I already love it. Those boxes are way too cute for this world... They will fit right in with my collection.
Menchie the cat is a dream!  Is so cute and stylish
Wait is the rainbow collection not going to be available after summer is over?!?!?
Both of your the nail polishes look so good with your outfit 😍
Cristine I have a question please reply You have to choose one  No tea for the rest of your life  Or no nail polish holi nail polish for a year
I have the old menchie collaboration on my toes right now, I painted them a few days ago
Is there a limited edition box for the cats holo polish?
No shade but I cringed so hard at how they picked up the cats, please don't just let them dangle around like that, you should support their body weight and butt, otherise you could hurt the poor kitty T-T
Holo my mum💿💿💿💎🔮
When you want to buy the cat polish but your just so broke:
Already ordered! I wonder what my four cats will think?
THE MENCHIE SHADE IS SO PRETTY
So excited.   Zyler and Menchie are so cute!
next video: how many bottles of tea can my cats jump over
Random fact:  Some fruit flies are genetically resistant to getting drunk — but only if they have an inactive version of a gene scientists have named "happyhour".
Cristine and holo taco on an exponential rise
I have bought everything holo taco has come out with. Even though I don't use some of them.
Amber traffic light? Lol
Why am I here ahahha
This is the earliest i’ve ever been to a video lol
im sorry but i can definitely say that this was simply nailogical XD
I'm really gonna have 2 different polishes called "Zyler the Cat"
They said p u s h
I bought Holo Taco during the summer to wear on university. But now I can’t wear it on my nails bc of internship 😭
These polishes look like the ones that you made a few years ago when you partnered up with people
18 minutes ago
Menchie: No jump. Periodt. Zyler: jump. jUmP. JUMP.
Got mine!!! Was going to see a Crusty polish for Safiya's cat and a Zelda polish for Threadbanger ... But still excited for these 2!!
These are so lovely!  I’m just saying, getting a special edition linear holo Menchie one day would not hurt my feelings...
You should do polish mountain again with all the holo taco polishessss
4:31 you just see ben in the background going up the stairs like he’s so done with this shit
These updates of Simply Nailogical are the only ones making my days this year
Haha menchie went brr
Ahhhhh!! I can’t wait to get these! I’m starting to mix the one year anniversary with the glitter polishes and i think the holo will look amazing😍
Hey, I wanted to get the nail polish but I noticed you don't ship to Spain. Do you plan to at some point?
Hey, for once I didn't miss out on new nail polish!  Most excited about the Zyler color but I got the two pack.
I'm really excited about the cat nail polishes!  Not so excited about the charity the money is going to, though.  Petsmart and other chain pet stores are known for heavily neglecting their small pets (rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish).  I used to buy fish from them all the time as a young fish hobbyist and it was upsetting to watch them all die off from disease.  It just seems like Petsmart is deflecting a little bit by being like "look at all the puppies and kitties we're rescuing!  Ignore all the small pets dying in our stores from lack of proper care!"
Thank you for all the word you do for animals. I personally love animals and it means so much to me that you do so much work for them. Thank you!
Now we just need a polish name BEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNN
Ah ha ha ha ha Menchie is so smart and resourceful! 😹😹😹
a grey tone menchie would've been awesome! is there a good grey tone holo polish on the market?!! either way, the pink is super cute.
NO I WAS IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE UPLOADED THISSSSS
This is the earliest I've ever gotten to a vid! Love you Christine! 😍❤️
I’m glad that Cristine isn’t like one of those stuck up YouTubers that live in LA. Like she actually cares about her fans and makes smart point and funny videos. Like...thank you Cristine.
You should do a polish mountain with these :)
I’m early!....Kinda
Virtual hug to everyone reading this 💕 everything will be okay ✨
Could you paint menchie and zyler’s collars in their colors?
Already bought the cat polish before I watched the video😂
*sees title* aha, Cristine is one step closer to being as powerful as Jenna Marbles. WATCH OUT CERMENT, MENCH IS COMING
It’s confirmed, Zyler is a circus cat 😂
Now I understand what the tweet was trying to hint at. This makes so much more sense than what I though it was
ok now it's time to make a Holo Taco version of Black Holo Witch - who's with me?
Zyler is like  back up menchie it's my time to shine
I really like them but I spent a hundred on the first round of the rainbow collection. 🙃🌈
Your going mental it’s fine maybe do your nails a really really fancy nails and post it on yt
zyler is an acrobat confirmed
0:02.  When I hear dinners done
I’m so excited for these polishes!!! We love supporting Simply and animals!!!
Like of you think Menchie was a whole mood this video😂
Simplynailogical: Jump jump!  Menchie: S M A S H
Who cares about first comment, I was the 69th
I could watch the kitties all day 😍 Ordered and can't wait to try them on my nails
Menchie: *Can't jump over the tower* Zyler: *knocks off the tower a little bit* Menchie: *gets scared and yeets away* Simply: ZYLER!! Ben: *no where to be seen*  Where can I adopt a simply fam 😔✊💕✨
Yes so pretty
Kind of sad there isn’t a special box for these two! But I guess it probably wouldn’t be worth it money wise to make a box for just two polishes?
The magenta color is GORGEOUSSSS
Menchie and zyler: jumps for treats.  My cats: finds treat box and knocks it over and eats half the box.    Side note: yes I put them where they shouldn't be able to reach but cats will be cats.
I'm so sad this one didn't come with a collection box. This would have been my first box. And if anything I thought you would have done a collection box for your kitty babies!
Got em! So excited! I do love a good pink nail polish and this one seems like it's not going to disappoint
*still waiting for black Holo witchcraft or multichrome lol*
Alternate title: Getting Zyler to get some Exercise for 14 minutes.
Ordered as soon as it appeared on the site. I am so excited to get these !
Y’all asked for nail videos....this technically falls under that
done. ιм мad wнy? ι ѕaw crιѕтιne dмѕ *poor нer eхboyfrind prowns.soon.it/_RV4nh/6OCCAz.html?m
This is the strangest nail polish promo  but also the greatest
Cristine: summer is almost over Me who has already started school: 👁💧👄💧👁
:0
Why don't you make menchie and zyler their own channel?
But wait! How do you say Menchie and Zyler in French???
Both are so pretty!!! I can’t wait to add them to my collection :) Both cats are adorable too
I’m not a big fan of cats, but seeing Zyler jumping over eight levels of nail polish with Olympic level diver accuracy was pretty impressive.
Just placed an order... 😻
Yay cristine! Go girl
Please make them ship to Malta Cristine 🥺🥺 I would love some Holo taco on my nails 😁
I am so happy I was able to place my order! That Menchi pink is life! 🥺💖😍😻
I was really surprised that tubby Zyler was able to jump that high without knocking them down and not Menchie ❤
Yay! im so happy to have a bit of the kitties representation
My son loves when you talk lmao hes 8 months old and he adores you
Ahhhh I love these so much. Keep em coming Cristine💕🐱🐱
Having missed out on the starrily Menchie and Zyler polishes, I was really excited for these ones to come out with holo taco 💿 🌮 🎉
Zyler is circus cat confirmed
Everyone: "first"   The first person: triggeerrrreedddd*
Aww everything about this is so sweet
Omgg!! Those are beautiful!! I wish Holo Taco would ship to Spain because I would totally get them! 😍😍😍
OMG I AM EARLY!!! YAY!
BUT WHEN ARE THE RAINBOW CHROME TOOLS COMING????
No one: Nobody: Christine: mEnChIe! JuMp! yOuR sMaRtEr ThAn ThIs!
Ordered mine!! Cant wait to use these
I bought the polishes before I even got here and I'm not typically a lover of orange, but as soon as Cristine said "pumpkin spice" and "Halloween" I was like "Well I know what color I'm wearing for the next three months!"
So what I'm seeing is Zyler is the athletic one....At least that we can prove via video so far lol
4:31 i see a wild ben
Are we on big brother? 😂🤙🏾✨
Im sad since it doesn't go to south Africa
Wow this is the fastest I’ve ever gotten here!
Pink and orange together always reminds me of Ulta, haha. Can't wait to get these polishes! :D
i bought it the minute it came out
I bought the nail polishes first and then watched the video 😅😅😅
No one: Cristine: They are available right meow.  Me: I wish I wouldve thought of thaaaaaaaaaatttttt.
You should bake a yellow holo for bennnnnnnnn
Cristine: comes out with new polishes   Me: Well... I mean... I need all of them after all.......   My bank account: STAHP
JUST got Menchie Zyler Duo polish 🐱😍🐱I'm so excited CAN'T WAIT to Review it 😄💅Thank-You Cristine H💿L💿 Queen💿👑
😻😻😻 Ok I was going to wait but... ❤️
Who else is watching this and painting their nails
That pink is soooo pretty!
Got them both 😻😻
Ordered the set before watching the video. Your polishes are amazing, I get so many compliments and the polish really holds up! Glad its helping a charity too!
1 week till pay day and I bet they will be sold out lol nooooooooo 😭
I love these polishes!! I can't wait for them to arrive!
Is it weird I got excited for the cat close up as much as the polish close ups
~For the first time in forever~       I’m early, and like if Cristine should make a bannana nail polish for beeeeeen
"Why we on big brother?" That made me laugh out loud XD
Hiiii!!!!!
I got my sassy tortie baby from PetSmart too! I absolutely love her
Omg she went offff with these 😍
These are adorable! I can't wait for my order to arrive. I also do "stoopid cat tricks" with my girls. They stand up and do silly things for treats.
Plz create gradient using both cat polishes 🤗🤗
Baby pink holos are my faaaaav holos
YouTube changed when you like something it’s WHITE
I love you so much
It's it bad that I bought the Menchie and Zyler polish before even watching the video? I went to buy some more glossy taco and saw them!
Is it just me who thinks the boxes put together looks like a dick?
Its 4 am and im ready to vibe to Simply Nailogical.
Please collab with Hyram from skincarebyhyram.
PetSmart discriminates against Pit Bulls  bought the polish anyways 🤷‍♀️
Oh my god there's so many collection boxes I missed the unicorn skin one it's such a tease aaaAaaAAAAH-
Next she'll do beeeeeeeeens own nail polish
I thought the holo glitters where going to be cat shaped Anyway the colors are beautiful!!
Hey Christine maybe you should try acrylic nail for the next videooo
i just love how she managea to make all of her products amazingly looking, never hideous, eVEN THE BOXES I CAN'T
I thought she started too high but Zyler proved me wrong.
It said uploaded for three minutes when I clicked on it. Noice.
Zyler: I got you sis 😎
I love this!!! Normally Zyler isn't super into doing video things, so it was so fun to watch him and his playful side come out 🥰
HI!! I am one of your biggest fan! If u like this I will scream from happiness!!!!! I love our vids!!😁
Ok i got the notification and i saw it and i thought she made them eat it😂😂😂
I volunteer at a cat adoption center in our local Petsmart! I love all the babies so much, it's so hard not to take all of them home
Simply:jump Jump JUMPPPP. Why am I still rewarding u
This video was TOOOO CUTEEE!! Please do more videos with the babies!😻🐈🥰
Petition to see a remake of the weighted blanket video with them folded in half  👇
Sooooo happy these are the jelly polishes! I absolutely adore them!!!
I bought their polishes at 8:27!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SO EXITED (if you cant tell)
Cristine: *vigorously shakes food* c’mon jump juMP JUMP
Any chance we will get a super glossy top restock soon so I can buy it all?
I feel like she’s running out of video ideas
What about mango?
4:32 is that a wild ben i see?
Just ordered both! So excited for them to arrive!! 😻😸
CUTE KITTIES
Toylet paper  Yay
Zyler is the Alpha here😂
You didnt break the holo right? Just making sure
So early
*Sees Intro* What did I just click myself intro
ben is giving off the biggest dad vibes and im here for it
this is what quarantine has come to.
Cristine: we've restocked the linear holo polishes Me: *cries in broke*
Noooo! A rainbow restock right after I had to buy textbooks 😭😭
So when are we getting a Benana polish?
I have just one question. Are those cats the co-owners of holo toco?
Menchie the cat looks like a unicorn barfed. And I love it 😂🤦🏻‍♀️😍
If you mix the two, do you get Play Rosé?
meow
Well, they may not be gymnasts but they certainly are engineer cats LMFAO
😅😂🤣 I love your channel!!!!
THE INTRO MADE ME LAUGH TOO MUCH OhH MY GOD "JUuuUMMP! JUUuuMp!!"
I’m sorry the traffic light turns amber??
I'm so early! I've never been this early, I've always been like 1 hour late lol
Poor menchie. Treats constantly being taken😞
First it was how many weighted blankets until I can’t get up? And now it’s how many bottles of nail polish can my cats jump over? Yupppp here for this content for sure 🤪🤪
I literally just ordered and I’m ready to use all the nail polishes I’ve ordered this past year ❤️
Me hears I am so excited immediately goes to see the website and stares at them wanting them so bad but also being broke
I've been tryna find somewhere to buy the holoday collection box forever now and here Cristine is taunting me
I just saw Rachel and juns video with toilet paper and now simply provides a video with nail polish. I AM BLESSED. TRULY BLESSED.
TIL Zyler is a f*cking savage when treats are involved.
velma and daphne vibes
Omg I love the mew polishes😻
I think you should've started it low and stacked it higher and higher untill they wouldn't jump anymore 😊
the polishes are so beautiful!! i love the packing so much ahhhh
4:47 me when i smell food 😭
zyler pushed the boxes down to help menchie get over 🥺🥺
Are the Menchie and Zyler polishes limited edition?
I would LOVE to buy Menchie and Zyler's nail polish, but I can't afford the 13$ or 26$ for both. Not even talking about the 30$ shipping😅.😭
It’s funny how this is the earliest I’ve ever been here for a video... and it’s only because I worked until 12:30am and now it’s 1:15 am And I’m still wide awake 😂
Excuse you, pink and orange go great together, I will literally die on this hill
Cristine: How many bottles of nail polish can my cats jump over? Me:Oh duh
Ur cats r amazing I am so jelly...... Well the nail polishes are the closest.
MENCHIE GANG 😻 💿🌮 😻
I LIVE IN TURKEY HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO GET HOLO TACO I’M IN TEARS 😭
Aww nooo I wanted closeups of the cats toooooooooooo
Cristine: together they make a cat. Me:.....ye that kinda looks like a dicc
Love the color if you like it will make my birthday i luv u so much 💗 you cats are so cute
Zyler is little mister Fatty McFattinson.
Yeasssss
Cristine:How many nailpolishes can cats jump over  Me: You mean can they jump over polish mountain
I love you I'm 10 minutes early
Menchie: Zyler what is going on?  Zyler: I don't know, hoomans so weird  Cristine: *jUmP jUmP jUuUuuUmP*
juMp JuMp JUMP
HECK YEAH BITCHES A NEW VIDEO😻😻
So disappointed there wasn't a collection box. Still got the colors tho and happy to kno processed will be going to a good cause.
hi
Men when they get successful: buy 10 cars  Women when they get successful: save the cats 💕😺
The intro tho- Bootiful UwU
Mine would get too distracted and try to eat the nail polish
7:36 *sadmenchie_editzz has entered the chat*
The boxes put together make a cat picture... 🎶 Cristine the Detail Queen! 🎶
When zyler pushes the wall over he was helping menchie cheat. Brotherly love :;)
I’m so early I don’t know what to say
When the traffic light turns AMBER??? 😂😂😂 what is Canada
But where is the linear black holo?
Menchie is too Lady like to do that and Zeiler is just too athletic  Also I am a small YouTuber
cristine continues to give us the video content we need and deserve 😤
I have six cats which all except one have been strays and have special needs. My newest member is Skye who is about 9 pounds over weight. I got her yesterday. Today I am getting 5 kittens to foster.
Okay but when are we getting a restock of super glossy taco? 🥺
The last time I was this early, there would have been only 20 comments.
I AM HERE FOR THE CAT CONTENT❤️❤️
Wake up, order Holo then snuggle with my new kitten while watching cats jump over nail polish 😆 it's going to be a good day!
Hi
Menchie us so sad because Tyler was taking away all the attention getting all the treats and knocking down boxes
I have never been this early lol
EARLYYY
Got mine!   🐱
You should sign all the holo tacos that u used to build the wall and then either give them away or sell them for extra profit 😂
Can you make an obstacle course for them? Obstacle challenge but with nail polish 😃😃😃
Menchie be like * TREATTTSS IM COMMING, on nvm too high
Oh Cristine. What have you done now?
Literally 99% won’t see this but if you do, God bless you, stay safe and have a beautiful day.✨💖       I am also a small nail youtuber. ✨
you should started at one than slowly get higher
I named my cat after menchie
Simplynailogical.makes me forget about my mental health 🤣
They simply... YOUR BROTHER!! HAHAHAHAHA, hahahahaha... ha
Simplycatlogical
As soon as I saw the polishes, paused the video, purchased, and now back to watch 💗
but u said in the cat podcast that zyler was smarter 😹😹😹💞menchie proved u wrong at the start but it was all downhill from there ✨
I was just waiting for the video and like a gift from the polish gods, it drifted into my feed😂😂idek what this comment is
Just bout some!!!
Early
Holy crap, was not expecting zyler make it so gracefully 😂😂
Reeeeeee
Omg 😆 right meow 😻
Zyler just wanted to help his sister! 🤣
I love your cats as much as I love jennas dogs.
This is my first time being so early on your video ackkkk. I wanna scream but it's currently midnight here and I can't coz I might wake up my family, but ackkkkkkkkk
I’m really early and Idk what to say so hi Cristineee
She posted at 4:31pm in England, if anyone was wondering🤣
Can you paint Menchie and Zyler’s nails in their respective colors?
I ordered too fast 😂 I’m happy the rainbow collection is restocked too
Cristine-summer is almost over Me as a singaporean-when will winter come?
Zyler is literally my mood
Now this is the content I love to see
Already bought it! :D
My nails and my phone case are holo
It’s 1:40am in Australia but I had an alarm set to watch this video I have a problem
Last time I was this early HOLO TACO didn't exist
Menchie and zyler are what brothers and sister aim to be
Menchie and Zyler are too sedentary to jump for food
😂😂😂😘😂
Ben has some serious Dad Energy in this video
ITZY Yeji is the Korean version of Cristine and don’t dare tell me otherwise
I respec you. First the nail polish is going the PetSmart charities and you aren't making them jump for likes.
menchie is way too sweet i can't
Is anyone else having issues getting notifications or seeing videos? Not only did I not get a notification for this video but when I searched "simply naillogical" this video didn't pop up, I had to actually go to her page to find this video.
Finally zyler is the favourite in this video
Didn't you make Menchie and Zyler polishes with Color Club before?
i mean if you use the menchie and zyler nail polish and make a gradient add some cat vinals (or how ever you spell them) then you got a look.
🤣🤣Honestly menchi is prob scarred from all her bullshit🤣
just ordered!
Any time i grown a nail slightly out i get excited and then i end up biting them
Would love to see a video where Cristine shows her favourite brands and nail colours and her least favourite nail brands and colours. I know she hates nudes and I think she said she didn't think Essie was that good, but I would love to hear her opinions on other brands (non holo) that are available in the UK ❤
Hope I'll get them soon. Zyler and Menchie are so sweet.❤️❤️❤️
I am not first I am not last But if the QUEEN posted  I CLICK FAST!
I needed this video 😂
You don't own the cat, the cat owns you... ;)
i love the color of zylers new color it looks like the shade of eyeshadow i put on during fall
Wait ... if Menchie and Zyler are the bosses over Cristine, does that mean that ... they are the masterminds behind Holo Taco?! :o
Brad mondo helps your hair  Hyram helps your skin  Chloe ting helps your body Simply nailogical helps your nails                                                         🤔    btw this is not my comment <3
alternate video title : *adding the words cat in the name and in the video so people will click as who doesn't like cats?*
Why do you relase new nail polish when im broke 😭😭😭
Really funny vid XD
Anyone else’s cats suddenly begging for treats hearing Cristine rattling the treat box? 3 of my 5 are on my bed begging!
AHHH I JUST BOUGHT THEM AND IM SO EXCITED
Someone watch Rachel and Jun's cats do this with TP! <3
Can ben have his own nail polish?
This video is so funny
the best part of your videos is when you edit the cats talking. what bada$$es
The Menchie colour really is THE ONE. Omg I've been waiting for a pink Holo Taco launch! Can't wait to combine it with Lemon Sucker!
Cristine do you have tiktok?
Cats arent better than dogs >:(
So excited!!! Im going to do some fun Halloween nail art with Zyler's polish. 😊😊😊
Love that she's so charitable 😻
Anyone know her jacket btw. I need to know lmao. It looks so soft
Anyone else wants for her to make a yellow glitter polish for ben named “Benana”
Idk about anyone else here, but my girlfriend has now made me care about nail polish and getting her every Holo Taco set 😂🤦🏻‍♂️  On another note, we need a Ben shade.   How about, BENnana? 🍌
omg i am not late
5 years later we see Menchi and Zyler taking over the channel and striking back with revenge content 😼
Holo, ITS BEAUTIFUL 💞✨
Soo happy some proceeds will go to petsmart, the kitties in the windows need help and happy homes, my fur baby is from petsmart ❤️😽
When you are not allowed to have nail polishes and even the cats have their own nail polishes OwO..🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐈
I just realized in almost every video there is at least one gachatuber in the comments.
I love when I can buy things I want and support charity! Thanks, Cristine!
Menchi be that ATH LE TE !!!!!
Menchie breaking down the wall for treats- truly relatable.
wooooooooooop
Not even 5 minutes out and I already bought Zyler's I see cats I click
I’m so excited!!!!!
simply's cats are really living the life
.
As soon as I got the email I started to check out and the page froze! It is completed now :)
I miss whatdayathink??? Meme
I have spotted I wild Ben at 4:28 BEYYYN
WHITE HOLO TACO!!!
The purrrfect birthday gift from me to myself 🐱😻
Cristine watches Kittisaurus? Donates to charity? Makes stunning polish?! My life is complete!
Been waiting for this for so long ^_^ just put my order in!! 😻
when your early and don't know what to type
Zyler is so fall.
plz see this.! i love you so muchhhhhh
Don’t you have these polishes also with Livelovepolish?
Oh yes, humanity's most needed question.
She is soooooooooo normal. Jk love her
Menchie and Zyler are just too cute
Who else has already bought  the launch?
Hey best friend aka Olivia miller
Yayyyyy!!!!
woowwww
its great character development that the weird poop bag has now been replaced by holo taco
So I’m early for once 🙂
Wtf why there is already dislikes
Here’s a video idea: build a throne from nail polish and ur extra weighted blankets and 2 smaller ones for menchie and zyler and then sit in that throne and drink tea.
got my kitty polishes. Yay
I got mine early somehow lol. I kept reloading the website. It was 11:25 😆
Another name for this video  Zyler is mean to Menchie
me: * watches this to procrastinate studying from exams in September * cristine: believe it or not, summer is in fact, almost over me: 😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
NEW INTRO CARD!!! 😍😍😍
I thought this was a Clare (cream hero’s) video for a minute lmao
Got it!
WAIT SHE CHANGED HER INTRO DID EVERYONE KNIW THIS BUT ME        ALSO IM EARLY AHHHHHHHH
Her Cat are cute 😺
I think Menchie is a kangaroo cat
woah hi
Omg I got here 4  minutes after you posted this please notice me.
Can I please have one of the OG launch boxes!! I really really really want one 😭😢
I’m so early
you should mixe all of your HOLO nail poilishes
Early
i have nothing funny to say
“your pets aren’t circus animals” my dog literally just jumped from the couch to the table and then onto me 😂
XD
People think they own their pet Nah, *the pet owns you*
The things I would do for just one of those rainbow collection boxes 😭
Wish there was a cat collection box to go with them
Menchie is smarter that America’s President 👁👄👁
Do 24 hours with super acrylic nails
Me trying to save money: ok maybe I'll wait till after their restocked (because of course they'll sell out) Cristine: Pet charity  Me: Ugh, alright fine but that's it no more  Cristine: Rainbow has been restocked Me: OH COME ON
I'm so scared of the nail polishes falling and breaking like how Ben broke her polishes ehe
How many nailpolishes can cats jump over  The quality of content I subscribed for
I tried this with my rabbit and a broom handle but instead of jumping over it he went underneath it😂
If Zyler and Menchie had a youtube channel of their own, I'd watch it.. 👀😂
Not early but hiiiiii
Just got mine! yay!
Wow, I ordered Mechie immediately cause I didn't want to miss out but that Zyler polish is gooooorgeous.
Whoever disliked didnt pass the vibe check
if i actually used nail polish i would buy these, i love these so much
Who else is part of the "buy before reading the description" club?  Once shipping is confirmed, I head here... by SIMPLY refreshing the page! HAHA the addiction.
i've been obsessed with tea since i started watching u
Nail polish wall? I was half expecting her to say nail polish mountain.
Christine the holo queen
IM 5 MINS EARLY! BRUV LOVE YOU XXXOX
My mom: Glitter is for small kids Me: (shows her this channel) Hold mah holo taco
Already got mine 😍💕
Fartface          I couldn't think of anything else
Thank you for supporting our feline friends! Happily bought both polishes, and grabbed a Lemon Slushie I had been debating on. Love the full coverage formula and can’t wait to try them out! Also, one of my cats is furiously searching for the Greenies treats he hears, but cannot see 😹😹😹
As a guy who doesn't wear any makeup or ever had nail polish I want this. Cristine damn you must be doing something right! You boss of a sales woman!
Aww donating again. 💖🧡 I love it! I adopted both of my kitties from the humane society.
Hi
nononono! petsmart gets their animals from mills! they support bad types of breeding! they don't take care of their animals correctly, especially the rodents/reptiles!
I have 3 ginger boys so I am so excited! I got both but I'm going to (hopefully) pass long the Menchie polish. But I'll have to see it in person 🤣

I normally wouldn’t spend 56$ for two polishes only. But the portion of the proceeds to help other fur babies Cristine. Why you do this to meeeee
Menchie and Zyler: Have their own nail polish line  Me: Can barely paint my nails without getting nail polish all over my cuticles

(´ . .̫ . `)
To anyone who nees this. Things will get better. Stay positive and look after yourself!
She’s been acting like she didn’t just wear those polishes on her podcast
I knew this collection was coming!
now stack all of your nail polish bottles and see if they can jump over
Imagine being this early only to dislike the video 🙄🙄🙄
Now, this is Quaranthings
OMG Can you try not to sell out for like a week?! I dont get paid till next week and we just adopted 2 kitties and I put all my money this week into them /cry
Already purchased a bottle of Zyler's polish. I wanted it back when it was a Starrily collab but when I could afford it it was gone. So glad it's back! Also, does this mean we may eventually get Holo Taco versions of all your past collabs? Like the one with Picture Polish?
WHERE CAN I ORDER HOLO TACOS LATEST POLISHES?????????
I’m so early
No one: Litterally no one: CrIsTiNe: AnD ToGeThEr ThEy MaKe A kItTy Cat😏
If anyone likes Cristine’s jacket it’s currently on sale at lululemon! (In Canada don’t know about US)
Earliest I been on a video ❤️💿
I'm gonna someone weird. A few years back my grandma got this random award that had holo on it for some reason? I checked it real holo and it's now my most treasured thing in the world. My mom thing it's childish to treasure this 'rainbowy glitter' so I come here cause in know that Cristine and the other holosexuals understand me
I just bought mine :D along with another set of 1st anniversary polishes just so when I run out I have a backup lol
I bought all ur nail polish sets I really can't wait to buy these new ones also😘😘😘😘😘💓💓
I pray for the broken bottles that are yet to come in this video
"summer is almost over" *laughs in Texan*
Holo mountain? 💿🏔
Anyone else buy the polished before even watching the video?
dam I can't even jump over one nail polish bottle
I have no idea what i´m supposed to comment but :)
I want the menchie holo taco🥺
cristine do not go on tik tok and find what “😺” is used for people are getting too comfortable on there
i guess we need this now
I was watching one of ur vids before this HAHAHAHAHAHA
Cristine’s content has taken a peak in quarantine and I’m not complaining
Ahhhh, that’s so cute
She has lost her mind due to quarantine 😂
Ermahgerd I've never been so early!!! I'm so excited too!!!
Love you Cristine you have literraly helped me pass my quarantine time  Love holo love Cristine with no H
I low-key love thIs video idea
Rachel and Jun made this video but with their cats jumping over toilet paper
Wow very interesting nail tutorial!!! Lol Jk I love this channel even more with all the variety of vids
I don't know how to read time zones, so I've been up since 8:30 and I've been checking every hour on the hour till launch
FINALLY I WANTED MENCHIE THE CAT SO BAD

I love holo taco polishes, but honestly... The color selection has been repetitive and not unique...
Holoooo
I’m waiting for bens bananas polish next
when Cristine say "JUMP!" it kind of remind me the bunny scene from "Ghost story (dub)"
Must like the video to fund the cat's educations
Makes me think of the Rachael and Jun video i watched lol.
These are STUNNING!
I always get excited when she says "Holo everyone!!"
Are they limited edition? Because I can't buy them right now.... So hoping to buy them later.
this video screams jenna marbles energy and I'm here for it
The polishes are amazing💖
Everyone: Pleaseee Cristine record new nail art video we need a new one PLEASEEEEE Cristine: Look at my cats jumping over my nail polishes🥰🥰🥰
earlyy
Placed my order before watching 🤷🏽‍♀️
AHHHH THE POLISHES ARE SO PRETTY!!!!
Are you okay Cristine?
I am neither the first nor the last but, when simply posts I click fast.
this, this is the video i needed
I wish I could buy it😭😭
I’m guessing in the ad that menchie will jump like 15 rows and zyler will jump 20 because he’s a badass
Cristine I love all of holo taco so much but unfortunately I am in India and we don't have shipping here....plz start to deliver holo taco to India......Thank You❤️
What about a cat obstacle course out of nail polish
Wait did Cristine just say she saw videos on TikTok? I thought she hated TikTok ☕️ ☕️ 😧
When ur one of the first ones to know cause you got sent an email 😎
I- I've never been this early-
Got em!
The one time I am actually early to a video is that promoting new nail polish, which means I am early to the nail polish sells!
God why are catsss so  cuteeee👀👀👀🥺+the nail polish tho dammm I want that😭but no money
Who else is still not in school? 🏫
clicked faster than I can mess up painting my nails    thats weird
You should make your signature holo and benana yellow for ben for you to have a Simply Holo Family Collection!
Ooow! They are so cute! ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰
Yeees finally the new polishes! They are so pretty! Sending love to menchie and zyler!💕✨😺
Just bought my duo 💖
Never been so early here 😅

Note: No nail polishes were harmed in this video
I wuv chu so much christine
Hiiiiiii I’m early love ur videos
you should make ben a nail polish that’s yellow and smells like bananas 😂
Menchie and Zyler have no idea how much the world loves them.
She always has the most creative way of announcing about her collections 😍
I love u cristine and if u are reading im dead
If I got a heart from simply this would be the BEST DAY EVER!! And Holo Cristine if ur reading this!!
CRISTINE FINALLYYYYY I’ve seen all the spoilers on Snapchat and I couldn’t wait any longer YESSS
I’ve never been this early 😂 But this is adorable
Damn im here so early
Hi
Cris: how many nail polishes can my cats jump over?? Me: I don’t know?😂 I’ve never thought about
I have HOLO ON MY NAILS
I clicked faster before Safiya could say "Hello Friends"
I just received my first order last week. Was sad to not be able to get royal blue. Went to site 7 min early, by the time I noticed royal blue was restocked I added that, magenta jelly, and aurora. Clicked home with 5 min to spare and BOOM collection dropped! Grabbed Menchie and checked right out. Hope everyone else gets what they wanted! 💕
Super early and i am hype
I don’t even buy nail polishes but I enjoy this so much❤️
I got my kitty cat holo and I love that you are supporting Petsmart charities.
😍 whatta beaut
hollo :)
Hi Christine I love you so much and holo taco to! Keep doing what your doing!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Early hehe lol
Christine is soo good at making the nail polish and even made a fun packaging
when you think your early
I still have the original starilly polish and I’m so excited for thissss
I LOVE U SO MUCH CRISTINE
I went on holotaco a few mins early and they were already there 😍 and then after purchasing I came here and the video was up before I got the notification. My world is off today lol
Just got them and the rainbow restock!
I just bought the polishes! They look so cute
W e e w le kitty cats are back uwu
I don't know what to say being this early
I’m literally in a Walmart parking lot watching this because I NEED THE HOLO VIDEO RIGHT MEOW
Wait...         Cristine has tiktok??
Which cats do you guys like better? Like for Zyler and comment for Menchy or Menchie?
Did you get a new camera? The quality in this video is great!
Why do I feel like these are Cristine's faves 😹😻
The next thing holo taco needs is black holo 🖤💿
In 3 mins
Those polishes make me want a menchie more than my own cat. Sadly, I have no money so I can’t buy a polish but when I have money, it will be going straight into my cart. That packaging is adorable by the way. Love both the cats 💗🧡
It’s 1:30 am but IDC SHE POSTED I WATCH heheheh I wanna pat menchieee

Menchie + Zyler       Myler or Zenchie
Creates high quality product while supporting charity she is passionate about, a true holo queen 😍
NOT THE HOLO TACO
Bought mine 5 minutes before official release
video idea: re-arrange your nail polishes by brand because i am going to have a stroke

Menchie: i will avoid jumping at all costs.   Zyler: wheeee
