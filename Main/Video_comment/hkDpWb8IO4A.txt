Nachricht an Jannik I met you at the show in Hamburg. We laughed and even held hands (because FAH asked the audience to) and I had a lot of fun with you. The good bye was awkward. I thought you would ask for my number. I was planning on asking about yours. But in the end you didn't ask and I didn't have the courage to do it either. We both left and I've been angry about it ever since.  So maybe you'll read this and I'll get a second chance. Lea
How many people remember before any personal feedback had to be given to parents so BOTH sides had to take the kids seriously?
As a teacher, I completely disagree with the “not recognizing your student”. But everything else is spot on lol
Throughout primary, every single teacher I had got *bored* of writing and telling my parents  "She can and should do more". I didn't.  😅  I'm sorry ladies, you were great teachers tho!
Had to click off at :30. Please, if you clean up the language, this would be hilarious and I could share the content.
Latin and literature teacher here: SO accurate😂😂😂😂!
I wish we were allowed to talk to the parents like this. Some of the parents really need to realise, that not everyone loves your kids, and this is them at school.
The gal teacher is brutal from the get-go. 😂  The guys are progressively brutal.
0:15 honestly, if a child isn't memorable....its usually a good thing. School year just started this past week. Day 2 I readily recalled some students names.....kept having to correct them. And even from the year before last I remember some kids, mostly the troublemakers.
Teacher's is the South part of the United States, basically say things like this.
Year years yeary back I attended my baby sisters graduation party (she`s quite a bit younger then me) and on my train ride home I happened to sit next to one of her teachers. And so I asked "So who`s more draining the kids or the parents?" Without a SECOND to think about it the teacher said "Oh the parents! SO much the parents! Not even close!" 😅  That was the first time I understood.
'Stop_Sc_Trollogy pls?'

This was good, but have you done one showing the asinine things parents say and expect at these conferences?
All of this is assuming the parent even shows up. Absentee parents for the worst kids makes it clear why the child behaves as they do. The worst school I attended was the one for my senior year and I'm struggling to remember if there was ever any parent-teacher meeting days. I'm not sure if there were...
If teachers treated parents the way they treat students
Southern phrase, he’s got a good heart.
When the kid constanly corrects the teacher, and the does well in the class To me the teacher should respond by being wrong less often.
1:32 Grinds? What's that?
Not that funny. I usually like these guys.
I do really love ALL Foil Arms and Hog videos!!!! ❤
As a parent went to parent teacher interview in Australia talking to my sons teacher announced straight faced that my son he had adhd I sat there very calmly I tried so hard not to burst out laughing walked out of the room walked down the corridor looked both ways and just laughed for 10 minutes
Was a HS teacher in the US for 2 years. I totally love this video and agree too!!!
I work in a elementary school- and I like my kids, they’re good kids and even the naughty ones have their moments where they crack me up like nothing else… but it’s a hard job- I’ve called kids See You Next Tuesdays in my head before and there are days when the only thing getting me through is the fact my boss has a chocolate drawer she lets us raid on hard days.   I’m fulfilled by my work… but it’s a pretty huge trial
Documentary and training video.
Well. This seems like a stand up school! Not a single male teacher referred to a female student as "Oh you mean hot Hanna/Stacy/Kelly etc" 😂🤣🤮
"Your child is not that special." The problem is, people feel so special these days or make their offspring feel special. "Because I'm worth it." Ridiculous.
Tbh, I was expecting something along/similar to these lines: “To tell you the truth, your daughter is not that good academically, but she’s….. Very ‘persuasive’ - you know what, forget I ever said that, your daughter’s great.”  Sorry for the inappropriate content 😅😂
Thank you. I retired from teaching Critical Thinking at the College Level. Well, TRYING to Teach, by throwing out chum and hoping that the students digest the lessons and learn...
“Your child is just not that special”
You wouldn't have to interview many teachers to get this material. btw I had a teacher who wrote a report on a girl who had left the school two years earlier. Classes of 32 will do that.
The problem is of course that these teachers are paid to do what these guys do resent.  If they don't like it, they can leave for the private sector.  Then they can speak truth to their corporate management.  Love to know how that works for them.
As a kid, I constantly got "She's a joy to have in class!"
You're actually quiet good looking so I'm going to take my time with this. Something I'll never be at risk of, as I'm unburdened by the possession of any desirable traits.
I am forever grateful to Mr Bush, My CDT teacher.. Told me I would amount too nothing in life.. At the school reunion he was there, I was in My Number 2s(British army second best uniform)  with 9 medals(not including service medals), Youngest to hold my rank since WW2    I was proud to stand in from of him and thank him,  As this all was achieved in part due to his harsh comment too me.. I wanted too prove him wrong...  I wish more teachers today was like those of the past.. Just may be things would be different in Western culture..
😂😂😂😂
Some of the meanest and absolute worst people I've ever known were teachers. I've heard a lot of stories about a favorite teacher. The kindest thing a teacher ever said to me was in 4th grade when Mrs. Schweppie told me, "I'm not going to pay you by the hour to shovel my driveway and sidewalk because you're so fat. I'll pay you by the job" I went to a Lutheran school and my teachers were horrendous. When they talked about the 7 deadly sins and got to gluttony they'd stare at me. When they talked about how our bodies were a temple for the glory of God, again they would stare at me.  They all assumed they knew the reason I was fat and not one of them ever considered the idea I was fat because I'd been sexually abused since I was 5.   My mother wasn't married which was a terrible back in 1960s small town America so of course whenever there was a bible class about harlots the teacher would stare at me along with any time they mentioned bastards and unwed mothers. All my teachers knew I didn't have a father in my life but every Father's day they'd ask me to write a story about my father. I told my 3rd grade teacher I didn't have a father and she informed me that everyone had a father. This was 1967 they didn't teach sex ed to 3rd graders I had no clue what she was talking about but she stood at the corner of my desk towering over me scolding me as if I were making it all up and it was my fault I didn't have a father. Teachers are horrible people. I never had 1 go out of their way to help me with anything but I did have many who made fun of me especially gym teachers who expected me to know how to throw a baseball and a football even though I didn't have anyone to teach me and the "teacher" sure didn't give me any instructions but he sure did make some bold jokes so the whole class laughed at me.
My physics teacher didn‘t remember me at all. He also said that‘s not a bad thing because it means that I don‘t make problems or have bad grades. Weirdly enough I had bad grades
Not Bad.  But They Kept a Lot of Reality out of this. Perhaps the Most Important Reality is that All the Teachers and All the Parents were Once Children. Plus Children are Children, Not Adults.
I've come to collect. 😸
Another win for homeschooling. The teacher actually *likes* the student : )
Lol how bad I've wanted to say these things
It's apparent that someone wrote a book on all my teachers in grade school.😜
"I only remember the ones who act up in class."
Honestly and I don't mean this at all in a mean way, but if all parents would just realise their kid is not that special and just took themselves down a peg or two, schools and society in general would be such a better place. So many think their kids are the literal re-incarnation of Jesus Christ and it just ruins them.
"Mr Smith? You're actually quite good looking, so I'm going to take my time with this!"
'Having your child in my class is depriving a village of its idiot'; my favourite, and genuine, teacher comment to parents.
I work as a teacher and let me just tell you they absolutely cooked when they made this, they really hit the nail on the head
When you grow up and realize you were that kid
😂😂 Love it 😂😂
If Keira Knightley and Julianne Moore had a child, it would be her.
I've a strong sense that this may have been the sketch that first got me into FAH.  As a former teacher, it's so relatable! I think I must have had to find very tactful ways of saying most of those things to parents. I've had just one mistaken identity embarrassment, when one parent actually went away happily with the notes that should have been given to another pupil's (same forename and, very fortunately, similar standard). Rarely have I been reduced to staring at a particularly attractive parent, but there was one...those eyes, those incredible blue eyes...drowning in them...Lucky I never had Arms in front of me, I suspect. The Zoom lesson sketch was exactly like every miserable online contact I had with pupils during lockdown. As I was teaching a language it was impossible to engage; older students refused to talk and the really little primary ones were very starved of friend contact and would come on wanting to talk about their hamster or their new ballet shoes. Not the most stimulating time in my life!
As a retired teacher, I love this.
The music in the background has to be every classical music piece rolled into one that teachers listen to
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
More Emma Please!! That was great.
I will always remember my daughters form tutor, the first thing he said as we sat down was 'Lets be honest XYZ isn't the brightest spark in the fire... As a teacher myself I had wanted to say somethig like that to so many parents but had always been more diplomatic, and then to have it said to me - my lost for words wife just looked at me, it took me a good ten minutes to be able to stop from bursting into laughter.
The redhead is hot.
Brilliant.
Why does the title of this video imply that Teachers are not honest? They may not be any more honest than average but they’re probably not any less honest either.
Why does the title of this video imply that Teachers are not honest? They may not be any more honest than average but they’re probably not any less honest either.
This video kinda makes me wish that the teachers who didn’t care about kids would just stay away.  I’ve straight up met a teacher that just said “I’m sick of children!”  Being a teacher ain’t for everybody.   Students need adults that care deeply and are in their corner.   I’m graduating next year with a 4.0. I do appreciate that teaching is tough so I’m starting off with the youngest grade for now.   (I think one day I’ll graduate to being a homeschool teacher cuz I’d love to work with students in a non stressful environment and give them the time of day they deserve).
Can confirm a significant fraction of those.
Love This! Retired HS teacher here.
as a teacher… these are 100% accurate
“Your child is… 📋 ‘Emily’. I don’t know who that is.” “Neither do I.”
Yay more Emma
I'm an American teacher and I agree with this! 😂
I left teaching A-levels after nine months. I had a weird manager. M
Overheard in the staff room:  “The only way she’ll make a living is on her back.”
This is so true, my daughter is very quiet and i honestly think half the teachers at her pt meeting hadnt a clue who she was.... they never spoke about her on a personal level, it was very much just about the 5th yr curriculum..a speech they could use for every parent! ... i left thinking " why the f did i rush outta work for that crap"!!!!
We know and dont forget the students names for a least 3 months after not being their teacher anymore, max of 6 months
so so accurate
If parents were honest!.... should be the next clip.
Public school  is daycare, private school is a grift.
Very funny ❤
In America, it’s more like teachers have to be polite and give passing grades to students who don’t even show up to class or who violently attack us.
Doo daaaaaah!
My son was a penis artist. He had a little penis artist group at school. WOW what a proud Mommy moment to be called to school to discuss that one. At least I met the other parents. . .we commiserated and ditched the idea of disappearing them. Love your stuff
Yep. EVERY parent should have this as a mandatory tattoo on their arm for hourly reference: YOUR CHILD IS NOT SPECIAL!
This is why I am now so glad my parents' evenings are done online and the system ends the meeting after 5 minutes. So much better than that parent (ok half of them) thinking they can keep going for 20 minutes or longer and those who turn up over an hour late and think they can then jump the queue.
As a retired teacher, this is, what we think but don't say.
Emma IS wonderful!
As a parent. We detested parent teacher nights...listening to the arrogance and prejudice of some spiteful, heartless poor excuse of an educator  sum up in 10min their conceited idea of a child based on their experience of some short time. These were the jaded kind that needed their contracts cancelled. As parents we see through the false and insincere render some teachers mask....just so you know. Feelings mutual.
These are the exact replications of the teachers at our local private religious independant school. Casual christianity college its dubbed!  Calling for a complete clear out of administration.
I once told a parent that her son was a pain in the arse. Perfectly true, and she'd just wondered, herself, why he never brought a pen to school when "We have loads of pens in the house." And YES, he was expecting to enter the family business! That got me (another) little chat with the headteacher, who did agree about him, but suggested that I didn't say it in so many words.
WTF is a forename ?
One of the best report card comments I have ever heard was from an honest Irish teacher: "With a great deal of hard work, your son may one day become a halfwit."
How about, "Your child is irritating as heck...but somehow just charming enough that I don't hate them for it."
In highschool this was literally most of my teachers. At least parent teacher conferences were never dull.🤣🤣
Your the teacher, if the kid can correct you, you are the problem!
He asks a lot of questions, a lot...  That got me kicked out of catechism classes.
I have actually told a parent I had no idea who their child was. I'd been at the school for 4 weeks and had a lot classes only once a week.
That's brilliant, thank you for saying all of that out loud) Written by a teacher
I love the subtlety of changing the parent's shirts
😂😂😂😂😂
Teachers "I really don't care, I just show up from 8am to 2:30pm make 100K plus a year and complain that I work to hard and don't make enough money!"
Yep 😅🙈
I retired from teaching for 20 years. How did you know what was going on inside my head?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 SPOT ON!!!
This isnt honest one, this is real Indian versin of PTM here
parent teachers conference several years ago...parent:  you don't sound like you like my son....lady teacher: what's to like?
"ahhh not you again.... Last year you kept me for 20 mins" I dunno why I laughed so loud.
As a father of an 11 year old. All. Teachers. Suck. All of them. Private or public. You don’t need to be paid more. You get paid more than you’re worth already. Glorified babysitters who don’t want to be there.
This is an inside job - so accurate.
What teacher has "200 kids"??
The one thing wrong with this sketch is it is far too short and the kids described are far too normal. I once had a kid try to headbutt me because I set him homework, I had to phone up a parent and apologise because the kid had sworn at me (it was obviously my fault as I had wound him up so much he told me to fuck off and called me a dirty cnut) and a deputy head once frogmarched a kid into my class and told me I had to have him because the lad was too thick to study gcse level PE. I was teaching computer science.
What accent is that that the lady has?  I had to reply half of her bits to make out what she was saying
If they were honest they would say that school is not an appropriate environment for children.
Is this a homeschool commercial?
I am an honest teacher. I like all my students, and I believe parents are doing their best. That said, sometimes you need to be blunt in expressing a child's needs to the parent or in asking the parent to collaborate with you to support the student. This video is accurate only of those teachers who have a chip on their should because of their own inability to build relationships with students and provide effective instruction. If you are a teacher and found yourself agreeing with any of this, you might want to reconsider your profession.
“Your child is Emily. I have no idea who that is…” this is every college professor
Where is Anne Flanigan!? D:
This is 100% accurate
I'm LE and married to a teacher. So yes, many teacher friends.  So helping out on a field trip once I mentioned during a quiet aside to a teacher "that ten year old kid is an a**hole, he's going to become an adult a**hole someday and there's nothing you can do about it. He's your problem now, he'll be my problem later."  Of course that offended little Miss Sensitive.  However, every time I thought or said that, every damn time, I was right.   Sad thing is, kids are who they're going to be by the time they're teenagers, good or bad.
Your child is really good at kissing.  What?   What?
The school my children went to it was parent, teacher, and student meetings, and you only had a 5 minute time slot with each teacher.  I much rather have honest teachers than ones that tell you what they think you want to hear.  Otherwise it's just a waste of everyone's time.
And from the parents perspective….gawd I wish I didn’t have to be here, feigns interest 😂 looks like we both don’t care much for these conferences, let’s cancel them!!
This is too accurate for the profession’s own good.
As a teacher, I must say... That is ABSOLUTLY spot-on! Free anecdote: my best teacher-parents meeting was in 2018, Paris suburbs, I had 2 kids with the same forename in the same class. They were cool together and quickly became friends (kinda lazy pupils, but the good kind, trying to improve). Same age, pratically the same skin color, lot of similarities. But not the same family. And the same forename. During the meeting, we met the first kid with his maried parents. The second one with his single mother... But the parents had to wait in the corridor. You guessed it: they had the exact same father. He had one son with his spouse, another with his mistress, the same year, and this complete asshole gave them both the same name, so he wouldn't do the mistake of talking about his hidden child to his wife. He got away with it for 15 years, the two kids were not in the same elementary school, and somehow they weren't even in the same middle school. But in 2018, here comes highschool, and there is so much fewer of them on the map... The two kids were reunited at random, in the same class.  We were there with the english teacher, the economy teacher and the science teacher... Lots of fun! EDIT: they were still very good friends after this and pretty thrilled to learn they were brothers, they even helped each other in class quite often, good kids!
98 days until what?
We homeschool, so we know exactly how much our kids can be little arse-holes. Unlike teachers today, we're allowed to discipline them for it  :)
I work in a school an can tell you that this would be 100% accuarte in an onnest world.
When I taught kindergarten the hardest part was talking to parents about their child’s problems. Some of the parents didn’t handle the truth well and attacked me with their words instead of facing the facts and figuring out the solutions
I don't know. I kind of like when teachers are like that. At least they're honest...
Gotta say, as a teacher of about 34 years, none of this lands for me. I never feel like this during a parent-teacher conference. How do people who carry this baggage teach long-term?
I love this
I never particularly liked teachers and this video didn't help.
Loved this
Is it me or does Hog look different. . .
From about 7th grade n my teachers all hated me. I was a pretty bad student. I wouldn’t be surprised to hear teachers talk like this. But then again, these days teachers are creating the problem.
I looked it up. A "Grind" is an Irish term for "tutor."
Teachers have got to be relating to this, biting their tongues on parents day 😊
Teacher here. Some of these are spot on 😂😂😂😂 Thank goodness for pictures! When you have 10 kids with the same name and teach just under 300... 😅😂
I took over a class from an outgoing teacher and when I asked how they were, he quoted Con Air and said, "Rough crew . . . spitters and shitters."  I laughed my arse off . . . then found out it was no joke.
I was usually labeled a "deep thinker" which I think meant "asked weird questions"
Jacks only hope was perfect
🤣👏🤣 In Denmark the kids come along to these meetings...😬
The female’s introduction of inappropriate language has taken away from the quality of the sketch. Vulgarity is seldom funny. I would advise against it.
First segment: Right, if the teacher doesn't know your child by name, congratulations, your child isn't a dickhead that the teacher hates.  Second segment: This is a joke but parents really should sometimes be told that their child is an asshole, just have a bouncer around because we all know what asshole parents that raise asshole children can do...  Third segment: I feel like a lot of parents also don't even want to be there. In my country's schools these meetings aren't mandatory, and I think it's silly that they are, if there's nothing to discuss, it shouldn't happen.
When i was teaching, a colleague write on a students report," This boy sets himself ridiculously low standards and then fails to acheive them" 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I want honesty from my kids teachers. If I don't know something is wrong I can't fix it. If my kid is shit at math or acting like an ass I need to know that.
If parents dread it, students are terrified of it, & teachers hate it, then why do we have PTAs???
Shows how much teachers deal with. Still under valued in UK
I'm a teacher from India. No big difference in teachers' mindset even though separated geographically. 😂 Especially that divorced parents part.. very accurate.. 😂 u guys r awesome
Mine have been alright. Always get the same report
I once won a bet for telling a parent that their child was a Talker Whilst i'm Actively Teaching. The teacher next ro me sprayed the coffee she was drinking all over the parents!
"I'm afraid I'll have to wrap it up." "But, you spent 10 minutes with the last parent." "Well, he's not annoying." BRILLIANT!!!
I simply adore you!
Wait...so the teacher appreciated when the ex and I came in together and were out in less than 10 mins?
Depressing video! I hope not all teachers are like this!
Taught for 33 years.  Loved my students most of the time.  The parents were usually a hot mess and dealing with their neuroses typically took more work that dealing with their children.  They were frequently in denial of how awful their child was, or dismissive of how amazing their child was.  And most of the people who rose to the level of administrator had no business overseeing the work of education and were far more frequently a hindrance to being able to get the job done than a help.  Most new admins had a bug up their bottom, a pet project, a mission that they forced down everyone's throat, to the detriment of the process.  The best admins to me were the ones who recognized that I knew what I was doing and left me alone to do it.  I left the year after Covid hit because of how badly education in that time was bungled and it has only gotten worse since then.  I hear horror stories from the colleagues I left behind and people are heading for the exits as rapidly as they can.  I loved my job, was damned good at it and you could could not pay me enough to get me to come back under the conditions that exist today.
Anyone else find the background music to overpower the dialogue in this one? It's very loud.
I was INCREDIBLY lucky to have nearly no contact with parents despite several years as an educator.   It's my job to have patience with children to help them become great adults.   The parents, however, are already adults and thus their issues are quite cemented and thus well above my pay grade.
The reality that teachers know and won't tell _you:_ Your child(ren)'s academic success, in the US, depends on _your_ socioeconomic status and the _verbal_ intelligence of their teachers more than anything else.
😂😂😂😂
All teachers have wanted to say at least one of these lines from time to time, in one form or another
Best line is have you ever considered grind because I’m not a very good teacher 😂
Vodafone is rubbish
my mom is a teacher and this is veryyy much the truth
"You spent ten minutes with the last parent" strikes a chord with me because teachers always expect to talk about both of my twins in the five minutes allocated for one parent-teacher conference slot. The teachers usually rush me through in seven minutes because the other parents are shooting fire at the teacher from out of their eye sockets. It's not like the twins are conjoined or anything, and even if they were... 😂
Poor Jack no family business to back him up and apparently no future 😂😂
Is it just my eyes or Emma was slightly out of focus in most of the shots?
My cousin teaches at a private upscale school and she flirts with the dad's, gets free vacations on yachts and takes bribes to give the kids A's.  School teachers have become the dregs of society.
So funny!
What's "grinds"? Is thst an Irish reference I'm not getting?
I wish I could have been one of the "I don't remember them" kids, I feel like that would have resulted in a lot less therapy later in life
0:14 OMG 😳 You three DO know a woman! Who’d have guessed? 😂
I remembered all of my students but as an English language teacher I used to have just half-size classes 😇
Brilliant 😂
As a teacher, I endorse this sketch.
What was the bit about "grinds"?
Parent here. Am forever grateful to my son's math teacher for being brutally honest with me. He said "I'm going to be frank: J. is not a maths genius but - I could bring him up a grade or two, enough to pass, IF you let him attend my free after-school tuition."  I agreed because (a) I wanted my son to do better and (b) respected the teacher for not simply dismissing a struggling student, rather, offering to help! My son went from a "5" (lowest mark) to a " 1" in the space of a school term. He graduated top of his class and then started offering maths classes to others. Today he's a doctor. Thank you Mr. Goldsby, and thank you to all teachers who endeavour to bring out the best in their pupils.
You've got two choices as a teacher, because you can't remember some kid's names and forget others. They get very offended. You can memorize every kid's name, or you can pretend like you don't remember any of them. The second one works because they think you're joking.
I wasn’t a teacher but worked with young people in the Scouts and Army Cadets so some of this surprisingly is very relatable.  Of all the youngsters I worked with over the years there are only about 6 that stand out, the rest made pretty much zero impact on me but I’m sure they’re not doing badly for themselves.  One or two parents stood out to me as well, and not for good reasons.  Fortunately they are a minority.
Emma should join the troupe for good
This is all assuming that a parent shows up to the conference (I hear that it’s becoming a rare occurrence 😮.)
The make up and prosthetics for the female teacher were incredible!
Emma was lovely but I miss the dum-dah.
My father once got a school report where one teachers comment consisted only of the words "do s not suffer fools gladly."
I wonder what your teachers said about you three!😊
A family business...might have been the kid's only hope, lol
No wonder why teachers are leaving the profession in droves!
As a teacher I must say that this video really missed the mark on some of these, but others were spot on:  1) You know the child. If you are the teacher at the parent teacher meeting, you have that child for a substantial amount of time. The only pupils I don't know well are the ones I teach only one lecture a week.  2) Not liking some kids are true, but grading them on how much you like them isn't, unless you are a really bad and unprofessional teacher.  3) Some parents being annoying is true.  4) You are definitely NOT going to take extra time with the good looking ones. You want this done as quickly as possible, because it is taxing on you, so no extra time for you.  5) Counting down to holidays can be true.
Are those the new 5.11 tactical gloves ??😂😂 said noone ever.
I think it'd be *SO* easy for the teachers to be honest at the conferences!  _(just use the same security glass that bank tellers use)_ 🤣🤣
This is not the first i heard this line 'I only have him for a year, you have him for life'
From first year to third year I was invisible and then from fifth year to six year I was just plain unlikeable!

I like this lady.
lol Buffy the vampire slayer did that when the teacher couldn’t remember her
I was that child that was always correcting the maths teacher. Pleased to be recognised! 😂 (In all seriousness I ended up marking the other students maths work and a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently in the top 500 of people searching for the largest prime numbers ever discovered)
Teachers already say these things you know. They just don't dare when the parents can get them into trouble. ;)
Hog looks beautiful today❤😂😂😂😂
"You've got her for life" 😂
Where's Hog? ❤
No doomdah? Impossible.
Where is Hog? Miss Hog. Need Hog!!
There's something different about one of these guys that I can't quite put my finger on....
Brilliant LOL So true
Why dont they just put em all together in the class room and make it a meeting for everyone? Could save some effort and time
Very accurate ... almost like a doco :P
Did you have to sack Hog and take this woman because of feminists?
Kind of want a kid's verision critiquing the parents and teachers now.  A+ on the "you're actually quite good looking, I'm going to take my time."
Very clever and funny!  It's always nice to see Emma with FAH again; she's great and fits in beautifully in their sketches.  The references to annoying students made me think of the recent sketch about "becoming annoying;" and the outtake at the end reminded me of Gerald learning to be a Lad, and also of the old sketch about the school-bully-turned-painter. 😁
I suppose Mr. O'Rourke was never quite the same after that online maths class during the pandemic lockdown, but it's interesting to see he's still teaching.  Oh, and is this the same school where Mr. Lawless was the guidance counsellor?
Each line more brilliant than the other.... Great accurate stuff as always ... 😂 And thanks for bringing Emma again, she should be there more often...
If only we could really be so honest….. This video helps though, it really does. 😂🩷
Emma Doran is great... we need her in more skits.    Ahhhh., those poor teachers.... don't get paid enough to deal with the kids...let alone their parents.
My latin teacher told my parents at the first conference, just two months after i joined his class, that he did not want to go to work in the morning anymore ever since i became his student. Proud and supportive as my parents were they absolutely believed him and they took my computer. Still not over that one
As an art teacher, yes to ALL of this...and then some!
What happened to Flanagan?
Oh shite did you over hear the faculty staff at happy hour?😊
Wow. Hog's outfit here is spectacular.
Honestly, the kid not being memorable is probably a good thing, it means they shut up and get on with their work.
As a teacher, I'm more of the attitude "Thank-you so much for coming.  The fact that you care enough about your child's education to meet with their teacher probably means your child is going to do just fine."
Emma is a very good actress, isn’t she!? 💙
Lose the woman. We only want FA&H! Besides they play women very well!
Loved this. I remember when I was a teacher trying to remember who some of the kids were when trying to give feedback. Knew the name but literally nothing, nothing popping into your head when the parent is asking questions, and can't find a single note on them. Just have to talk sh*te and hope it's right!!
I went to one where the teacher said :he interupts, acts out: i said  are you sure that’s MY Alex? Ruffles papers. Oh! Wrong Alex! Then my 10 minutes was ended. Outrageous since only once a year.
If you can’t do, teach
A freind of mine had to have a parent teacher meeting  with ..   the minister of education.
This is so feckin accurate 😂😂😂😂
I did a teaching course for six months and even that short space of time was enough to relate to every single one of those teacher comments. Bravo lads. Your research is spot on.
I have way to many teachers as friends, and i will link this to every single one of them! :D
I just sent this to my sister who's was training to be a teacher...only for my dad to tell me she failed her assessment.  Clearly this video is cursed.  I hope you're happy!
Surely one of the funniest skits I've sewn from you guys!! Keep it up.
I love Emma Doran, yay! 😂❤
"I don't know who your kid is" or in one my kid's teacher's words "He talks too much in class", which no teacher or coach ever, ever, ever, said or will ever say. 😂
How about try an "Even More Brutally Honest" version?? Really go for it, open up your obvious comedic skills?😃😇😈
Hilarious 😅😅😅
I've worked as a teacher in different countries and I don't remember any teacher ever forgetting a student, could be happening at public schools.  I do confirm everything else :D
The drawing in class!! 🤣🤣
Hog became a woman? 🤯
That lady landed the lines really well.
Oisin 🥺
Where is HOG?? ❤❤
1:45 what was that?
Can somone please tell me what the last word the woman said was?
Absolutely accurate! I'm an English teacher and the parents are worse than the kids sometimes.
My parents were both teachers. Apparently there are only so many ways you can politely say 'I'm afraid the problem is that your child is really thick'.
I didn't catch the phrase at 1:42 ... it's 98 days... until the summer holidays?
I was a teacher for 25 years.......This is all so TRUE!! Well done, as usual.....
Really funny. 😂 Love it. Please, please, please, please, etc... etc... do one on parents.  😊
I'm a high school teacher. I approve.
I experienced a vicarious exhilaration that unblocked all seven of my chakras. Thank you! 🧘
I have long petitioned for teachers to have a day like the Purge, where they get to say what they really think to kids and parents with zero consequences...
This lady gives me Julianne Moore vibes <3
Not so much as one dud line. Absolutely cracking sketch folks.
This could be a series.   Maybe do one with clueless administration.
Perfection ! 😂😂😂😂 A perfectly accurate retelling and reliving 😂😂😂😂 Emma is a perfect addition 👌🏻 😺
Perfection ! 😂😂😂😂 A perfectly accurate retelling and reliving 😂😂😂😂
When she said she "Gavin's father's wife last year", I had to pause for a moment and pray she meant as a parent to meet...and not as a _student..._ 😅
"Your child is not that special" And then again, you know, they *are* pretty _special_ , if you catch my drift.
Happy it's pretty much the opposite with my daughter... she's kind and friendly, needs to mark more often when she actually knows the answer.  Very relevant, as the meeting was Tuesday.  It's comfortable when all I need to say is "hands up!"
Hahahahaha, as a teacher, this has me cackling!
I see Arms took that acting with a pen class very seriously:-D
As a teacher, I have to say...  ... It's too polite! 😂
"That might have been Jack's only hope." It's not even a certainty, just a possibility. You guys are brutal.
So much to look forward to... 🤣
But what do the teachers have to say about Barry and Oisín?
<3 Love this!
So teachers don't like questions?.... 😭
Great to see Emma! And loved the "oh yeah the one with the snot..." good stuff
If is in the title but my old scool was exactly like that
Is it me or hog changed a bit?
Oooooh, love the Emma Doran add. She's great!!! Always look forward to Thursdays, because of you brilliant lot...thank you as always for the laughs. xoxoxo
I sat in a staff room a few years ago with one teacher asking another how to say' mrs, he is just thick' nicely
As a teacher… I felt this in my core
As s teacher I can relate so much. Some days I can't even say who is more annoying: a noisy kid or his mum
"I'm a teacher and I approve this message... I mean video." 😂😂
The guest comedian (Emma, is it?) fit perfectly! She's hilarious!! Would love to see her in more sketches. <3
As a teacher: - Not knowing the kid: Depends on how often I have them. I'm bad with faces, I have the same class in physics this year I had last year and I still struggle with some of them as I only see them once a week. Classes I have more than that it isn't a problem, unless they look similar and sit close to each other. - Kids being dickheads: yup - talk going long and wanting to be out of there: oh god yes - asking questions/correcting: Nah, I'd love it if the kids were attentive or engaged enough to do so most of the time. - counting days to next holidays: absolutely
Never told my parents about such meetings and they never asked. Perfect (... and apparently I went to the same school as one of you gentlemen!)
My daughter was one of a little posse of good girls who got good results. Teachers mixed them up constantly, 3 or 4 mouse brown haired, blue eyed children, who can tell the difference? It was a running joke that she needed to kick off and be naughty so they knew who was.
Excellent!
Nachricht an Jannik I met you at the show in Hamburg. We laughed and even held hands (because FAH asked the audience to) and I had a lot of fun with you. The good bye was awkward. I thought you would ask for my number. I was planning on asking about yours. But in the end you didn't ask and I didn't have the courage to do it either. We both left and I've been angry about it ever since.  So maybe you'll read this and I'll get a second chance. Lea
Great job as always, folks, and want to share with my teaching colleagues. They MIGHT get a bit offended that it says THRUSDAY at the end... but then maybe that was spelled by one of the children you teachers were discussing?  ;)
Anyone notices that they're holding RED pen as that what teachers always have 😀
😂,  I had my child's consultation today, now I know why the teacher had those far away gaze in her eyes.
Right! Best teacher is the one least caring! The more caring you are the worse are your teaching.
Loved seeing Emma Doran there!
Is it me or is Emma out of focus? I'm mean in the video, not in real life. I'm not suggested that Emma has any focus problems of her own...the poor child.
Hilarious! Arms' line, 'That little whine, so annoying' cracked me up! Every line was really funny, though. Great sketch, lads!🤣
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I giggled madly over this one.
I'm a teacher in my country and i legit told a parent when she asked how is he behaving? Well, ma'am let me just say that i feel sorry that you can't send him home at noon. Woman was a total trooper and just said "yeah...that bad uh?"
a worringly true insight. ROFLMAO
VERY ACCURATE! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I know all my students, but it’s the parents who stop me in the grocery aisle at the store that make it hard:   Oh, you want a conference right here, next to the turnips?  Aaaaand you haven’t told me your child’s name.  You seem to be under the impression that I will remember you after meeting you once, for 10 min, at that conference five months ago.  Oh, your kid is Johnny? Which Johnny, I have four. You’re upset about his grade on the last test. I haven’t given a test in a while… why is this just now being brought up? Oh… you’re confusing me with his history teacher. Yup, checks out.
Is it just me or I thought Emma was the parent at first?
She's great!!
Too funny!!
I was a substitute teacher for my local middle school for three years. This is incredibly therapeutic.
I teach 220 13-year-olds history every day. I definitely can relate to many of these! 😂
Loved seeing Emma!! Would love to see more collabs!
God I love her accent
That's what I would have liked to have said when I taught High School.
Apparently my parents could literally see my PE teachers' faces drop when they found out whose parents they were talking to 😂
The best are the divorced parents who not only show up separately but also both miss their appointments so you have to stay longer at the end of the day (because we're required to talk to everyone). Oh and you also have to be careful that you say the exact same things to both of them because mom has her lawyer on speed dial
Well. If someone thinks that teachers shouldn't think things like that about students, probably you don't know how it is, especially these days when there are less ways to discipline kids and parents in most of cases take their side, no matter what happened.
❤❤❤😊
Had to turn on captions to figure out she was saying "till the summer holidays"
Ur child is going to nasa , His planes are very accurate !
😂💓😎Awesome thank you
When are your UK tour dates coming out? Planning a trip, and I want to see you handsome and funny guys in person.
...my husband, math teacher, would throw a party for some children if they asked questions and at least listened to him for 5 minutes.
Doomdaaaaaaa
The grinds one is so funny hahahaha
"Lots of questions! ... kinda p***es me off."  Ahhh, the line where Teacher ('Molder of the future' ) meets Teacher ('Employee just trying to get through the day.')
I think the teachers at my school must have loved me because my parents rarely went to those evenings 😂🙏  Probably a wise decision… 😅
When I was (emphasis on "was") a teacher, the worst were some parents and spoiled kids. I heard things like "My das is getting you fired", "Fucking nazi" (I have a German name). Oh and the principals were awful, except one. I was once asked "Are you an antisemite?" (I have a German name) and I'm actually very much not an antisemite. Then I had kids who were stranded, forgotten by the system, even crushed by it. I had a boy from Tunisia in my class. He had some ADHD but was otherwise as sweet as pie. The principal asked me to forget his existence and put him in the back of the class. I put him in the first row to keep an eye on him and he was delightful. I graded essays from another school and I found one to be suicidal. I reported it and had to strongarm the principal into calling the parents. Let's just say the school board doesn't love me. I did always remember my students but turns out I was supposed to forget some.
My father (retired) and my sister are teachers and yes they are talking like this about their students. Even worse, they are treating me (still) like a student (i am 43 years old).  Your video is too close to reality.😜
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware you guys were reading my thoughts during the last parent teacher meeting!
10 minutes?! My meetings are at least 20-40 minutes each! Maybe I‘m doing something wrong 🫠
Did Hog just fully transition?
Oh, do bring Emma on more often! <3
God this is so accurate. Well except for the questions part cause I love it when the kids ask the most random questions about history. Some of my best lessons have come from kids asking a weird question and us going through it in depth
just finished my teacher's ed and had my first parent teacher evening the other week. Told them all upfront that I won't be accepting phonecalls after 9pm and on Sundays (I've seen more than enough colleagues sacrificing their time off for this stuff) - all of the parents now hate me haha. But I don't care; I'm not looking for suffering from a burn-out before I'm 35. Nobody prepares you for this type of thing at university - parents are, in my opinion, one of the worst things about this job.
As a primary school teacher in Bavaria I love this one but have to say it's just the tip of the iceberg 😅 there is so much more I'd love to tell some parents honestly but I can't. Btw, another teacher based sketch idea: meeting your pupils literally EVERYWHERE😮 - in a café during breakfast on holidays (happened today)  - at the local swimming pool  - at the swimming pool in the next town where you went because you didn't want to meet them  - in the hotel during vacations (!!) - at the end of the world...
I have her for a year, you for the rest of your life.  Damn guys did you really have to do me so cruel?
Finally! They replaced Hog. We all knew it was coming.
The red pen of doom!
As someone who while a student got to hang out with my science professor in the staff area this is pretty accurate
Brilliant.
I only remember one parent-teacher meeting event that stuck with me for the rest of my life. Friday afternoon; My teacher: Publicly sung praises about me in front of all the parents for a long time. My dad when we got home: Was proud of me. Didn't care what was on the report card. We had a good time, that was that. Monday morning; My teacher: Publicly humiliated me in front of the whole class because as it turned out - my grades were shit! Me now: LMAO!
Emma Doran FTW!
I’ve been a teacher for 8 years. How do you know us so well?
@laviniaburke3160 0 seconds ago Omg! I work in a school. Judging from this, Dutch kids can't be that different from Irish kids...🤣
I don't want this girl, where is third guy?
Who is the lady???
Wow
Absolutely love this one. One of your best !
Who is she?   Loving the new addition ❤😊
Now do the other side, parents being brutally honest to teachers
Acting with pen
I had a teacher and he'd look at the list of his students. If he didn't know who you were he'd phone their parents and say he must be doing fine because I don't know him. There's no need to see me. For the parents he did see he used to use an egg timer and when the sand ran out he'd such stop talking. He was proper old school
Thank you so much for this. Last parents-teachers meeting, I checked the students' ID pictures just before it started. Some of them didn't provide any 😨😨 Thankfully they came along with their parents... 😅
Yay! More emma doran!
You'd think primary school kids are dramatic. Wait until you meet their parents! 🤣🤣Very spot on with this one, lads. And happy to see Emma again
The last piece from Emma and the face to go with the delivery 😂😂😂
I once saw a parent-teacher meeting where they had to spend the first few minutes establishing if the student was in fact in the teachers class. True story.
Lived with a teacher for 4 years, let me tell you, this is Hella accurate 🤣
Working as a teacher, this skit hit straight home 🤣
One of my teachers in primary school straight up said "I don't like boys" to my parents.
"I only have her for the year, you have her for life..." The line that is voiced regularly in the staff room... A teacher's mantra to help live through the school year.
Imagine them as teachers get nothing done with hog 😂😂😂
A teacher once told my mother "I don't know how his face looks like, I only know his profile" 😅
You also forgot  the "How on earth did your child become such a nice person with you as his/her parents?!"-line 😀
Good grief, this is so spot on. We all loathed parents' evenings for having to come up with a 'sh*t sandwich' for each kid: say a nice thing, then their actual problems, then another nice thing about them. Trying to think of TWO nice things about every single one of the little hooligans was a herculean task!
😂 The dream of every teacher!
Love the fact teacher is counting to the summer holidays. We rarely think about that.
Would have loved to have said those things, though they were in my head
She is doing so great!!! She nailed her part! I has such a good laugh!! Thank you to make my day!
Beautiful! Thanks for this. I'm a teacher and that was a good way to procrastinate on grading tasks 😅
Ooh I must say these are mostly mild mild mild thoughts we usually have at such meetings. We have worse ones for very special parents and kids! Euphemisms are the way to go for some of the conversations!
Coincidentally just had ours yesterday 😅
Your female actor is fantastic! 😂
My mentor gave me this tip because students are fellow humans, and it’s helped me far more often than not. Dude, don’t laugh; I’ve heard teachers in my own building who would treat students like uncomprehending animals. (And when I tried to share this successful tip with another teacher who also had that student, she started ranting about how she’s not their friend and students are to obey teachers period. 😒)  Situation: Student has shown behavior that does NOT contribute to them, or anyone else, doing whatever their best is that day. While other students do pair/individual work, I take the student to the side to talk.   Me: I need to know something. Have I been disrespecting you? Student: No.  Me: Then why have you been disrespecting me? Me: *reword how each rule I have is made to respect everyone by helping them do their best in one way or another, e.g. “keeping your bags on the floor instead of under your desk disrespects your classmates because they could fall and get hurt on this super-hard floor.”)  One time I did have a student say I was disrespecting them. And I wasn’t going to keep that up by gaslighting them, so the conversation would turn to “What did I do, and what do you think I should’ve done instead?”  Whether a student said I was or wasn’t disrespecting them, after that? Unless they were having a harsh day, they started following directions more, communicating with me when they thought I was asking something impossible of them, even treating their classmates like I treated them!  Students are humans, too, and teachers are some of the many NPCs they encounter in life. Imagine an NPC that kept giving you very limited dialogue options, most of them requiring you to say something you don’t want to, or something very mean. Would you say that time encountering the NPC was time well spent? An indicator of a great game? Or would you just want to get the fuck away from the aggravation?  TL; DR The video is funny af, but abusive teachers aren’t, so I wanted to share something that helped me in my career and may help others. ❤
CGP Grey once said that if the teacher doesn't really remember your child, it's probably  a good thing.
At my secondary school we had to go with our parents to the teacher meetings, it was always the same stock standard feedback with every teacher and always right on dinner time so I would be so hungry and tired by the end but my mum would press all the teachers for more information (so embarrassing) literally could have been an email the whole 6 years of it 😂
Sending this to my mother, who is a teacher, without a moments delay.
PE report card: Tries hard. Which being interpreted means: I have no idea who this kid is.
More efficient when they’re honest!
As a child of two teachers this seems very accurate according to what they told me about their students 😂 Emma was so great in this too!!
My teacher was brutally honest with me always.   Also Nice to see Emma Doran featuring in your video.
As an ex-teacher, I must admit, you are spot on!
I was holding it together for this one. Then the perfectly casual 'well I'm not a very good teacher,' aaannd I lost it.
Not sure if it is a blessing or a curse that the teachers instantly know my children at these things…
My parents were teachers - trust me, this doesn't even scrape the surface hahaha. The level of stress teachers face is awful. The main thing my parents found difficult about parent teacher evenings was the parents themselves. Most were fine, with fine children, but the parents of difficult students were often very difficult themselves, and not in a fun way. I learned one thing from my parents: never become a teacher!
Gave my first lecture at the university few weeks back and am glad that in University we wouldn't probably have to deal with this.  But my mother being a teacher at school, that too class teacher and recently head of department have to deal with such characters of people (specimens - namuune) 😂, the particular Saturday for parents teachers meeting is so gossiped afterwards  By the way, Arms and Emma has that perfect teacher look and personality right down to the tip 😅😂
That brought back so many memories of parent teacher consultations and all the things I wish I had said to some parents. Very cathartic. Thanks lads!
I thought she did a wonderful job. ☮
The thumbnail looks like old college humor
Tag urself im the ‘not really memorable’ xD
”Your child have difficulties to concentrate” = ”He is a f-ing idiot” 😂😂
That was unbelievably accurate
As a teacher I can confirm that this is exactly what's going through my head whenever I have these darned talks :-D
😂😂😂😂😂
Amazing 😂 Unfortunately, my mother being a teacher has deal with some parents who are literally so annoying, they sometimes feel that they are children, instead of actual students.  Coming to home, we hear all sorts of stories, from which parent was the calmest and which parent shouts, to what the teachers and parents are wearing at the meeting, the gossip and banter😂  But unfortunately, they can't be that honest😅  Just discovered your Annie and Oisin videos and down to rabbit hole of your sketches, live performances. Amazing work, lads ❤
"your child's not that special"  Hear hear
Teachers, who is teaching who ?
New video every Thrusday now?
Pretty sure this is what my teachers were like to my Mum
Hog is turning a new look!
Lovely to see Emma Duran in your vid.  Yeah, there is always one child in the class that thinks they know more than the teacher.
Ha! My son was known to all his teachers. He made sure of that 😂😂😂
Just love this 😂
Brilliant. You should invite Emma into your sketches again as she complemented you guys very well.
As a student i think this is fairly correct
"I only have her for the year, you've got her for life" 😂 but then, you've got a new set to look forward to in the next year...  1:32 could someone please help me with what Foil says here? I've tried and tried but I just cant catch it 🥺
The constant snots! How come every class everywhere has one of those kids!!
You look so handsome in this video. The light is great.
Hog looks a bit different in this one, or is it just me?
My teachers were always honest especially my favourite subject teacher with added sarcasm.  We always had meetings before parents evening with each teacher that was awkward.
Foil here seems like the teacher who will write down review for all his lessons in the last two weeks of school while actually putting on Lord of the rings and writing his own movie script to get out of there, while the kids are watching the films. 😅
makes me glad I don’t have kids! ❤
Yup, you got us! 🤗
Freckles and dark curly hair? Are you sure thats Kevin and not a certain Seán?
It's even better when the parents bring the child with them!
Thanks Arms for being in the comments today. Not to be even more dramatic but I've had to pick up some extra work and stuff and I've missed ya a bit. Hope you're not getting too many weird looks in the coffee shop atm 😂 Have a great day, cause you made mine better! Erm, and Foil and Emma too... hehehe.... and Hog, just... because he exists 😆 I might be rambling, lemme know if I'm rambling
I was such a pain in the hole in school. God love my teachers. I've bumped into a few of them over the years, and every time, I've profusely apologised.
Yep
I'm glad the set staging behind the "parent" didn't go to waste eventually! What a lovely and well-thought "tea and coffee" sign!
Aaand another research after Irish slang words initiated, great! 🤓 I particularly liked this bit on Wikipedia: "In 2012, the Revenue Commissioners launched an investigation into a perceived failure of some teachers to declare extra income from giving grinds for tax purposes. The Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland denied that this is a widespread problem." 😏😂
Boy, did I feel soooo portrayed. Congratulations, it works even for this side of the planet...
Class video
People have too much admiration for Teachers
Wonderful!!! ❤ Greetings from NYC.
As someone who used to be a teaching assistant and quit because children, this sketch was an amazing birthday present. Thank you!
I couldn't have asked for a better video to start off my day
You guys just hate children, dont you. Also, actuall woman, not guys in wigs!
Do a reaction video to this with Oisin's mother.
Finding a good way to say "You should medicate your kids' ADHD to not ruin the class for all the other children" in a polite way is a challenge
1:55 Freud has arisen from the grave after hearing this
Arms exorcising some of those teaching demons from his past 😅
Emma is brilliant! So fierce as the sassy teacher 🔥
0:32 I hated it as a first come first serve basis. Why can’t just people appear at a particular time based on their roll number as it was mentioned to us?
I’ve got parent teacher meetings next week. I think I’ll need to have a makeover first . Or The Child will.
This is so true!! Except the latest trend for pupils to attend with their parents has really cramped our style!!!
Laughed at loud at "the family business was his only hope"! Love the new thumbnail style, the music and the feel of this one. Going from strength to strength lads, cheers to your great work!!🎉🎉
I wonder if you questioned your parents for this one or if it's just Arms' painful memory.😅
0:22 My Art Teacher in school:
“I really want to say something about your child who is hard to read but I’ll stick to saying he has potential.”
Ok, but coming from the other side... how about the audacity of telling parents they need to attend an event called a Parents' Evening and then making the hours 3pm to 5pm!
“New video every Thrusday”?? A deliberate ‘teacher’ mis-spelling to see who noticed? 🤔
'Which is your child? Nellie. Oh, yes, Smelly Nellie. You should take her to a doctor, a normal child should NOT give off that kind of a stench.'
“I don’t know who that is” said no one ever about me in primary school because my aunt taught in the classroom next door and if I put a toe out of line my family knew before I was home  🥴
I always imagine a Parent-Teacher meeting for university students: “So, how is Jake doing?”, “Madam, I have never seen your son before… No clue who Jake is.”
This did make me realise, you guys might be the only online video creators I follow who, as far as I know, were not at any point teachers 😂
Oh, counting days until holidays, that brings back memories. 😅
Hog’s make up and prosthetics as the female teacher were incredible!
Lovely to see Emma. And maybe now you can have guests again we might see Parents When You Bring Your Girlfriend Home which you said a couple of years ago was written abs just waiting for covid to allow you to have guests again 😉
Arms is quite the convincing teacher. Hadn't been fully awake when I started watching the sketch, heard my name and immediately went "Oh no, what did I do wrong? I'm a good student, I'm a good student" 😂  I'm so going to share this with my fellow teaching degree students. We've only seen glimpses of the real teaching world, but this is so accurate. Have a wonderful day.
Still, 13 weeks holiday every year isn't bad. 👍
To whoever is answering the comments, what have you done with Hog?
Never had any complaints - as good as gold! Just an evening of being told how great I was 🤓😇😎
This is giving me Nam flashbacks to my ten years of tutoring
I am a teacher and I will sell liver and kidneys to be able to do this 😂
Arms, I watched your Patreon editing video again yesterday, and was thinking if you'd consider doing another one sometime when you have a time ☺️ It's a treat to watch you working your craft ❤️🔥 Maybe a party sketch one or something where there's a lot of characters and the setup and the flow is different to the car rental one? I'm sure it'll be interesting to watch ☺️😍
It was in a school report not a parents' evening, but I was once praised for my work on [project] in Art.  I didn't do that project, that was a different class. Rather makes you wonder what the point was reading the report, was any of it about me?
I am finding these new thumbnail backgrounds very impressive. 🤩 So fancy and professional. Kudos to Foil 👏👏
It's like the movie Liar Liar happened in a parent-teacher meeting!  Funny stuff.
Parent/Teacher interviews are the absolute worst! Former teacher - ‘kill me now’ and ‘I don’t get paid enough’ (or anything extra actually) were constant thoughts.
Brilliant job everyone, Emma fit in *so* well and made the whole thing perfect! Also very realistic. In all my previous jobs I've loved the safe spaces where colleagues could do some psychological hygiene re: students, their parents, etc...
Please tell me this isn't an accurate representation of what your German (learning) students had to deal with Arms 😂😂😂
Not a big fan of the new font on the thumbnail. Old one was better.
Hog is looking good in this sketch!
When did you get a girl?
What you need next is brutally honest parents who get their kids confused with each other!  Cause that was my Mum!  She once told my Maths teacher that I hated Maths - I didn't but my sister did!  I laugh now but at 14 I was mortified!
Painfully hilarious!😂As an American with children in a school in Munich with mostly British and Irish teachers, this is heartbreakingly accurate. My children (now graduated) had learning disabilities, and I actually heard many of these come out of teachers’ mouths. American teachers are, on average, so much more caring!
Arms, was haben deine Lehrer früher so über dich gesagt beim Elternabend? 😁
So, guys, how did your parents get on at parent/teacher evenings when you were at school? School swots or ....not? 😅 Love the outake at the end
Line that parents don't like to hear, but should.. "your child is not that special" 😂😂
Having worked as a teacher’s aid in the classroom, this is so accurate. But apparently saying these things out loud is frowned upon. 😂 Fantastic and hilarious sketch.
I'll be honest too, knowing what I was like as a child, I'd be glad to know they didn't remember me 😂  "you've got her for life" - What was probably on repeat in my mother's head every meeting 😆
Great sketch, lads! 😂 Emma fits perfectly to the sketch, as if she is part of the group! 🙂
The main thing I remember from parent teacher evenings is that you get exceptionally good at thinking of creative ways to say “your child drives me up the wall on nearly a daily basis”
Oh my that whine! 😂😂 another Arms sound to add to my nightmare cart after that terrifying laugh 😂😂
At times I wished teachers were *a bit* more like this instead of the relentless positivity I've encountered this far. I am very aware of how annoying my kid can be 🤣
Arms, bist du wirklich im Urlaub, oder hat Foil dich in den Schrank gesperrt, damit er endlich  alleine einen Patreon Livestream machen kann? 🤔 Es war cool mit Foil zu quatschen, aber ich vermiss dich ja schon immer ein bisschen, wenn du nicht da bist!  Hab eine gute Zeit! ☀️💛
As an ex-teacher, I concur absolutely with every one of these. But, you know, keep smiling through. Love this one. So beautifully observed.
From the reverse angle used in the outro, does that mean you intended originally to cut back to the parents? I think it was a good call not to, it works well just on the teacher, think it might have otherwise been too jumpy.
I love Emma! So great to see her again!❤
Sketch Idea: Gerald & Stephen on a stag do
Thanks for the subtitles.  It’s great that they’re already included.   (Other channels take forever to upload subtitles after the initial video upload).
It's always weird without the all lads, but it's comforting to know Foil is probably still wearing shorts. 😉
I don't have kids, so I've escaped this particular circle of Hell 😄  I was probably the annoying little shite who was always asking questions, though!
OMG, the end is such a hommage to how I found you guys in the first place ("oh, body parts? three men...oh, it's gonna have a p*nis joke, won't it? OK, CLICK!" *loses it* xD)   I actually wanted to be a teacher yeah, geography and history. But then I failed my first exam on one of the subjects and was like "Perhaps not." My brother is actually an English teacher but never taught...when I asked him why, he said "Kids are just a pain in the...."
Yay Emma🎉😂 can we have more of Emma pretty please ?
It's like House MD at school. Is there a place in this world where honesty actually overrides politeness?
I...don't... like...your child. Love this bit, so well done!
Try being twins in different classes - parents had to get round two sets of teachers! And when we did share classes they couldn’t tell us apart 😂
Pretty sure my kid is the one the teachers can't remember but I'm taking it as a positive that he's not a troublemaker!!
„I only have her for the year, you have her for life!“😂What a line!
I was the one correcting the teacher 🫢
I knew I was gonna love this one, and somehow it was even better than I expected. No longer a teacher, but this sketch is giving me flashbacks 😂You must have a long suffering teacher in your life, it's just so spot on 💯
I guess teachers' mental health could benefit greatly from this approach...😂😂  not sure if they could still find a job afterwards though. Unfair.
Im a teacher and this is spot on! It’s just how it is.
“He’s not annoying” 😂😂
Oh PLEASE tell me this is a new theme for your sketch collection! Can’t wait to see your take with other professions! 😂😂😂
I... Don't... Like... Your child😂  must have hurt the parent, but yeah, truth definitely hurts😁
The child drawing must have been young Steve (from Gerald and Steve). 😂
Yes, that's us. As if our inner voice was recorded and shared.
Also, I have a nutrition exam coming up in one hour. I'm watching this and then nutrition labels party, if the food in the fridge could talk and ofc fruit/veg party... I'm feeling so prepared 😂
Hog is looking pretty good this video 😂😂😂
That last drawing bit got me :-D
So glad I've never had to do this 😂
'Ehhh Teacher' hahahha Ehh Doomdah❤
Hog looks a little different today
Graduates from the course acting with pen showing everything they've learned.
I think these teachers failed their qualification in understatement. They’re supposed to speak in code such as: It’s a step in the right direction. Translation: it’s still pretty rubbish but it’s slightly better than the nightmare that came before
Your career advisor LIED to you!
Everyone! Subscribe to their channel! They are brilliant 😊
Finding it hard to believe Arms isn't actually a teacher. It's so accurate! 😂
I was the child who asked lots of questions. Dad told them that he had always told me that if I had a question I should ask them
She's soon going to be on the other side. Lol
I only have her for the year, you have her for life 😂
THRUSDAY? 😂😂 peace✌️
Haha what pure honesty would do to society! So refreshing!
Brilliant, as always!
Arms, ich hoffe, du hast einen schönen Urlaub! Bist du in der Sonne?Falls du das hier gar nicht liest, gut für dich! :) Genieße deine Auszeit!
I’ve never clicked so fast on a yt notification before
I'm so glad I'm out of that phase😂 one of my teachers always wanted me to come with my parents to the meeting and it was so awkward
Watched the video when it came out: Fun :) It's because I'm home sick: Less fun :(
First
If anyone is answering comments today it better not be Arms as I've heard from a reliable source that he's on holiday.
First!
