After at 2022-An Prime Minster "Shinzo Abe" was during a "Speech" In Japanese city neighbours "Nara" and "Tokyo". After he was talking in the thingy he was standing on,the Japanese 18-y.o "Shot him behind his elbow thingy closer for 1-time in the row. Shinzo Abe collasped and didn't ever woke up again. Japanese persons checked on him and his white cloth was bleeding. The American-President "Donald Trump" reacted to it with Joe Biden. They both got mad at a 18-y.o for killing there best friend's leader. And they visited Japan at 2023. And they saw Shinzo Abe's funeral and hospital beginned but Shinzo didn't make it. He died of the monitor. And Trump and Joe sad and cried. They feel like they lost there best friend forever. Shinzo Abe's murderer was so young at the age of 18-y.o,to be an serial or killer. After 2 weeks 18-y.o was finally arrested in Tokyo for killing Shinzo Abe with a shot-gun with two ammo's. And He was senteced to life in jail. Japan's cell was kinda good. It only had an bed,mirror,and a sink. Trump and Joe finally turned happy that there best friends killer is senteced life in prison on Tokyo or Nara on Japanese jail prison. Japan prime minster and President was only left in Japan without there best friend leader "Shinzo Abe". Shinzo Abe,is now an angel in heaven. He's with God and Jesus and Mary "Jesus Family". Jesus Christ took care of rappers and people and anyone who's famous and singer.  He was an Ex-Best-Prime Minster on Japan but after he was 20-30 or 40 y.o he was killed in 2022 in Tokyo,Nara,Japan. By an 18 y.o.
日本人として言えるのは、トランプ大統領も暗殺される可能性が高いということだ。トランプ大統領も同じ勢力に狙われている。それはロシアではない。私の予想では民主党の背後にいて、ロシアの孤立を画策するCIAかイギリスか中国かNATOの勢力のいずれかが関与している。 今は中国・ロシアチームと米国・NATOチームが戦争しているように見えるが、国益をかけた見えない戦いでは中国・NATO(ドイツと東欧)と米国・ロシアの戦いになりつつある 地理的にはNATO⚔️ロシア⚔️中国⚔️米国であり、米国とロシアは協力しあえる位置にある。
最高の首相でした。警備が手薄だったのが本当に残念。
I can't believe it's been 2 years since he passed away. RIP.
67 year old.
This is an evil cult they stole everything from me and my children now I’m 77 years old the church shows no remorse or accountability for the pain and suffering it has caused to me and my children I hope that justice will be done one day and thanks to the japanese governament for investigating and taking the necessary steps to stop their illegal activities
RIP I'm not Japanese but I know he was a very good leader who did a lot for the country
🇯🇵🤝🇹🇼
安倍晋三は米国を追従する犬である。 日本は米国への追従をやめ、日露関係を回復し日露同盟を締結するべきである。

Rest in p1ss bozo! This POS minister was a fervent negationist of Japan's WW2 history and the many atrocities they had commited.   I'm glad karma has finally reached him. You reap what you sow!
L bozo
So sad. May he rest in peace. My deepest condolences to Mr. Abe's family and the Japanese people.😢
Everyone of Shinzo's bodyguards thinking the same thought this day:  *"I am SO FIRED."*
Thailand
Rip bozo
Pink vs light blue? 🙀
As for me, I have nothing but anger toward the Yamagami suspects.  Within a few years, the world will learn the horror of Abenomics. They will realize the horror of a policy based on perpetual motion.  But the person most responsible no longer exists. It is the fault of the Yamagami suspects.
No, the reason Japan is so safe is not because of the gun control laws, even though that may help a little bit, indeed.
😮😢
Gun control lol
Big difference between being shot dead and MURDERED BY THE CCP
didn't the first shot miss? what's wrong with the body guard? I think Japanese body guard is very lame and weak.
hahahahahaha
“Queen and Shinzo abe”   Rip
Abe treasured massive Japanese investments in China and in Russia he made huge investments in Russian oil and gas...  In particular one of Abe's leading missions in his long tenure as PM was to resolve the territorial conflict with Russia. Which over the contested northern islands which Russia had seized after WW2 and by solving that they could finally reach a peace agreement they were still officially at war because they never had a peace agreement and that would facilitate rapid expansion of trade and Japanese investment in the in the Russian far east one of the last new frontiers in the world huge development. ...Putin and Abe met 27 times during Abe's administration Abe went to Russia 11 times ...at several points negotiations seemed to be absolutely certain to close to be a slam dunk the agreement. The first problem was 2014 the Maidan coup in Ukraine the elected gov was overthrown by U.S. and British sponsorship with the Nazis and soon after that during the year of 2014 Obama and his national security adviser Susan Rice went to Japan met with Abe and railed at Abe and threatened him that he must join the sanctions against Russia ....people close to Abe confirmed that Abe since that time had visceral hatred for Susan Rice ....he did agree to impose sanctions they were sort of symbolic they didn't have any particular economic impact....but he was forced to stop the negotiations with Putin. Susan Rice is now Biden's director of domestic policy council leading advisor to the Biden Administration...and she's a killer she was proud of the fact that she was one of the leading forces that disbanded a full scale military assault on Libya for no reason no threat to us . .. Gaddafi was not threatening anybody but she led that proud fight a genocidal war and the assassination...she's a killer keep that in mind.
🇰🇷🇨🇳🇰🇵 happy🎉🎉🎉
The world will build a shrine for Tetsuya Yamagami, he kill an ugly devil Shinzo Abe

y nosotros aca en argentina fingiendo atentados, no conozo a Shinzo pero por los comentarios parece que era bueno, porque no le pegaban un tiro a Kristina que se lo merece
I am Japanese. I swear to God and talk about the truth. Japan is a crazy country. Never step into Japan. Do you want to be killed?
stupendaaaa,Super ! You are so striking!☀
He was very close to people in Japan, so friendly, had warm heart, knew what was good and bad, was so pure. It’s so rare to find this kind of politician in our country, like a once in a lifetime politician.  We will miss you, our dad. You were always nice.
日本人はアメリカのおかげで良い生活を送っています。 The Japanese are living a good life thanks to America. Are Japanese people grateful to America? 日本人はアメリカに感謝していますか？ Can you ask Japanese people?

God has had enough of joe biden and this stolen election.  Not even a shell of a man  left. God has been watching and  it has begun!!!
Bottom Line:  If you are a figurehead, there is a great chance of being attacked if you are dealing with the public.   Lots of crazy people.  It's a shame.
For Foreigners.彼は日本の総理大臣を長く務めながら、韓国のカルト宗教と繋がっていた人間です。あなた方の国ならどうでしょう？あなた方の国の政治に韓国の宗教が取り入り癒着していたらどう感じますか。韓国という国は宗教だけでなく、暴力団、賭博場、芸能、様々な角度から人の国を侵略する国です。これが日本の事実です。海外の多くの皆様に真実を知ってもらいたい。
※Please look at the custom rifle of the video assassin jackal. I delicately adjust the aim with a screw on seeing a place and a gap of aim + that were successful after I shoot a bullet. One's own gun on the mountain does not have even the aim. Therefore it is impossible to put only on heart of Abe or the ascending artery without injuring a person around Abe. The sniper shot it from a backward expensive building of Abe. Bones are blocked by the hard organization and become the cul-de-sac gunshot wound whether the bullet of the rifle penetrates. A humerus, a clavicle and shoulder blade of Abe become the shield by the snipe from the mountain top and do not become the fatal injury. By all odds the bleeding of the right chest of Abe is not genuine blood. It is dye. It is strike Lee who this has a lot of bleeding, and died. Because Shigeharu Aoyama is Mason, you must not believe it. I said that announcement of the professor of the Nara medical college was the impression operation that the shot on the mountain gave a fatal injury, and an incident wound was small. It is Freemason, and the wirepuller of the assassination of the Abe former Prime Minister is anti-Japan composition. It is a person concerned who fed the information of the campaign speech of Abe with LDP, the police which I did not guard around Abe, the false hospital which interviewed, a victim dummy and Tetsuya Yamagami, a scenario of all Mason that it was. The police are absurds of the conspiracy, too. I let the police overlooked the sarin subway attacks in Tokyo of the ohm truth religion with the work and perform a crime. An amateur cannot prepare sarin and Agent VX. The criminal whom I shot cannot open a handle in the Japanese police if I escape into the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan either. Cold cases such as Setagaya family murder case or the president of king at dumpling shooting to death case are crimes of the Korean residing in Japan, too.  URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB4tY4BzjCI  ※The true criminal who shot the Abe former Prime Minister became clear  The gunshot wound is the penetration trace done to a throat and a neck and the left shoulder on the 5cm away right clavicle from the interview of the doctor. Abe stood with Tetsuya Yamagami who was considered to be a criminal right before I was shot as a back. It is an explosion saying that two gunshots were emitted from the remodeling gun on the mountain, and they are the smoke that the evidence is white. A bullet is reflected in another video before the gunshot. It is three, too. Of the diameter silent-style as for this gun is small. It is the commissioner-general of the National Police Agency Takaji Kunimatsu shooting case that Aum Shinrikyo performed to think here. The criminal was a North Korean sniper. The batch was left in the spot. Such a professional sniper performed the Abe former Prime Minister shooting case, and Tetsuya Yamagami of the amateur cannot give a fatal injury at the point-blank range either. The muzzle can bend into the top in the reaction of the explosion of the gunpowder even if I shoot it with a handgun. Minister of Defense Nobuo Kishi is a true younger brother of Shinzo Abe. I kill the older brother, and is it not a purpose to sneer at the Japanese police and Self-Defense Forces? Is a thing thought to be it not a purpose to threat Prime Minister Kishi using this case? Anti-Japan power and Freemason affect this case. This is because I prepare Tetsuya Yamagami who is the criminal of the victim and am skillful.  When Mason enumerates cases concerned with Japan There are JAL123 service shooting down case, bubble burst, the Aum Shinrikyo sarin subway attacks in Tokyo, Kakuei Tanaka Lockheed scandal, descent from a mountain case, 300 million yen seizure case, emperor silver case, Wakayama poison curry case, Akihabara slasher case, glycoMorinaga case, Fukuchiyama Line derailment, Chinese food plane crash case, Kyoto animation arson case, Kanbe continuation child killing case.  ※Argument When Abe is surprised at a gunshot, and only a neck turned around toward Suspect Yamagami, I am shot. The video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DE6nc3Pww&t=207s   Then it is difficult that the head is big, and the target is fired, and to expose a bullet when I shoot it from Sanwa city Building. Because the target becomes the half of the body, it is more and more difficult. Abe who fell it has a trace of the bleeding to the left shoulder region. The announcement to say that there was a small wound (gunshot wound) of the right supraclavicular part in the interview of the doctor is clearly strange. The bullet of the rifle was fired into a building of 100m ahead from the forward campaign vehicle and spot of Abe. Therefore it is the snipe from a backward building of Abe. Y neckband of Abe goes by a bullet and drifts to the left from the right. This proves a snipe from the rear of Abe, too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N51LxxffOxs   Crime motive of a crime organization, an anti-Japan organization and the Freemason  I assassinate Abe and cut off the flow of the constitutional amendment and let preventing a preemptive attack for self-defense (group self-defense) of the Self-Defense Forces from being possible. It bombs the base if I guess that a missile base shoots and prepares if it is the United States. When it is not made, I am exposed to nuclear attack continually. A Japanese strictly defensive only national security policy to be able to make nothing into. The world assumes a nuclear war and constructs a bomb shelter to 100m below ground. Even if former Prime Minister is assassinated in Japan, peace-at-any-price mind-set is not cured. Notice randomly. Prime Minister Kishi has it on the pretext of this case and I am threated and am at the mercy of the Freemason and go ahead through the way to destroying a country rushingly. In Japan, economic growth is stopped and is the bankruptcy of debt heaven. If receive a weak yen attack, and oil and food are cut off; It's all over.   The specialized fool of the doctor does not understand the common sense of the sniper. It is waste of energy even if I inspect it in the virtual space of the computer. There was space in the circumference of Abe, and the police, the SP, the person concerned with LDP stayed away from Abe.

This is not an uncommon occurrence with VIPs in Japan. If the security had been more vigilant, he might have been saved...
This is heartbreaking.. RIP Shinzo Abe ❤🇯🇵 deepest condolence to his families and the people of Japan
The shooting of Shinzo Abe was so brutal  , sadistic and barbaric at that moment of shooting I felt the authority should deal with him in same manner that he bestowed on Arbe with no mercy
Bolsonaro é o pior presidente que esse nosso país teve......... Bolsonaro é príncipe da fome e da falta de sentimento com o povo passando fome.......fora Bolsonaro........
Abe seems to have gotten along with the religious cult. Without it, none of this would have happened.

RIP Bozo
Most Japanese people glad to be killed Shinzo Abe because he was not our leader, he was a dictator.

Abe  killde by   American  CIA  buld  up  yudaya  FRB   who is made  of   27  JUY
To friends of the world I want to thank everyone who has given me condolences and encouragement to Japan.
According to his wife, he had been eager to become a film producer after retiring. His dream was destroyed by tragedy. I can’t believe it as a Japanese person. R.I.P Mr.Abe.
RIP,  the leader of Japanese Neo-Militarism （日本新軍國主義） supported and admired by the western world. Abe, smartly turned the islands dispute with Russia and China's Diaoyutai into the issue of invasion and threat, to scare the people of Japan, resulting in the proposal QUAD, a NATO of Asia. Abe, only apologized to Hawaii bombing, never to Nanjing massacre, victims of Unit-731 or Korean victims, coz he needs to be sympathized by the American and the western world, so that he can get trusted support & approval from the west to empower military power in Japan, to make Japan a powerful neo-militarism nation. Abe, also purposely visited the shrine of the WW2 criminals to make Japan's neighboring countries upset, he arrogantly ignored the protest, sending signals to it's neighboring nations that do not challenge the superiority of Japanese neo-militarism. In fact, Japan is not a true democracy, it's a Shinto-based (religious spiritual) monarchy system which is not a true democratic nation by people, for people and of people. It's dangerously preparing to be a Shinto-based neo-militarism.
Did you know that Shinzo Abe was actually killed by NATO, all related to the war in Ukraine, they wanted Japan to be neutral, so they hired people to kill Abe. America and NATO are two-faced and double-standard like a demons, they are real terrorists and destroyers of world stability.
It was reported the killer used to work in the Navy that does not allow him to get off lightly At this moment in time he is a Criminal for shooting Abe and as such he should be treated as a Criminal
Victory In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.[48:29] Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers wiith (the sight of) them. Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward.   [33:45] O Prophet! Lo! We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner.  [33:46] And as a summoner unto Allah by His permission, and as a lamp that giveth light.  [33:47] And announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great bounty from Allah.  [33:48] And incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their noxious talk, and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.  [4:69] Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they!  [4:70] That is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower.   [7:155] And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when the trembling came on them, he said: My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did ? It is but Thy trial (of us). Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness.   [7:156] And ordain for us in this world that which is good, and in the Hereafter (that which is good), Lo! We have turned unto Thee. He said: I smite with My punishment whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things, therefore I shall ordain it for those who ward off (evil) and pay the poor- due, and those who believe Our revelations;   [7:157] Those who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with them. He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong. He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul; and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear. Then those who believe in him, and honour him, and help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him: they are the successful.   [7:158] Say (O Muhammad): O mankind! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah to you all - (the messenger of) Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and He giveth death. So believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believeth in Allah and in His Words, and follow him that haply ye may be led aright.   [33:56] Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.   [66:8] O ye who believe! Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands; they will say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! Lo! Thou art Able to do all things.   [21:107] We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples.     ,

A remodeling gun on the mountain is a thing only for explosions of just the gunpowder. Therefore there was space in the circumference of Abe, and the police, the SP, the person concerned with LDP stayed away from Abe.  You were deceived, too. I receive revelation of God and am the world's best genius. You of the ordinary man cannot understand correctness of my logic. When you die, I can understand me if an article is right. When the fool does not die, it is not cured.  You stupid. (brainwashed by Mason). I can know the truth by the revelation of the soul of God.  A gentile is an owner of the ability of the slave. That's why the Freemason brainwashs it by education by learning and control as an adviser from the infancy.  I know that these experts, experience of the history, lie and gentile of current events of the politics neglect observation based on the history.  As for all the knowledge that is a scientific order (theory) to say that it is important, the thing which we blew into by a lie plays a serious role. The intellectual of the gentile shows off the knowledge as a pride by the scientific knowledge that I stencild in the media such as newspapers. However, the thing called knowledge is a lie of our agent in this way. You must find out the lie by a theory of Nietzsche whom Darwin, Marx, we devised. These theories work destructive in the psychology of the gentile.  In other words, it is Mason that rules over the society and science is a wrong theory to deny existence of God. I know the true truth by revelation of God.

I often find comments in English that explain Japan like imagination and delusions ...  There are only people from a certain country who are not English-speaking nationalities.  Not only does this throw prejudice and bad feelings towards Japan, but it must also be said to be a very rude folly to people in English-speaking countries.  If you don't lie or lie, please use your own French (^ ^)  YouTube has a translation function, so you don't have to use English.  Right now I'm writing this in English, which is used to inform English-speaking people of "stupid acts by spoofing"  .Please note that such people have been infested when it comes to Japanese topics and news for quite some time! It is dangerous
In EU, UK, USA, Canada, and Australia, the Domestic Violence Laws are used to confiscate the assets of husbands, to break families, to steal their children and convert them to prostitutes... The Lord gave you Mr. Putin to make pay 100,000 times for what you stole from the poor hard working husbands.  You deserve what Mr.Putin is doing to you.
The dignity and background of each person also appears firmly in each word given by that person.  I can't even think of the words you use that represent the country ...  Something lacking reason or intellect, isn't it?  No matter how much you change the language and pretend to be someone else, it's no use.  That's because there are only a few in the world ... (^ ^)
At this place, people from two non-English-speaking Asian countries who are repeatedly accusating using English ...  I am very dissatisfied with the current situation ... Is it a "thing" like a so-called mass of frustration?  It ’s like “another thing” that does n’t look like a person.

About the motive that led to the crime  In the past, the criminal's mother was absorbed in a religious group that originated in South Korea and went bankrupt due to a large donation.  It is reported at this stage that the crime was due to a false belief due to a connection with former Prime Minister Abe's grandfather due to the unfavorable family environment.  The gun, which is considered to be a weapon, is handmade by the criminal ... It was said that firearms could not be obtained by any means, and materials were procured via the Internet etc.   The religious group is also treated as a heretic in South Korea, and even in Japan it became a problem if it used a method called the fortune telling fraud to deceive a large amount of money from believers, and it was caught in the past.  .Until now, the victim defense team has also held a press conference that the victims are not endless.  It seems that he is sending money deceived from Japanese believers to his home country.  Even if the criminal has such a dark past, the sins he has committed cannot be affirmed.    The number of gun crimes in Japan is about 10 per year, and even in the case of death, is there one person?  Looking at the annual crime statistics that occur in Japan, the number of crimes committed by multinational people is more than half of the number of crimes committed by Japanese people.  The statistics are shown every year by nationality, heavy and light, and crime, so if you want to know, please check it out.  .In recent years, Japan's security has become worse than before, and serious crimes are increasing.  True Japanese feel anxious and anxious about them    Here, I see a lot of heartless words and comments with incorrect information ...  I feel sorry for the stupidity of those who talk about them  Even the BBC seems biased How can we know the truth only from the information that has been cut out?  I'm no wonder
As a Japanese, I am very grateful to those who have expressed their condolences to the deceased.    However, although the terrible words written here are written in English, it is clear that most of them are not English-speaking people.  You can see many people who are writing without knowing Japan in detail.  Most of them are delusions, imaginations, and prejudices.  Not correct  From the perspective of Japanese people, all of them are so low that they go through anger and laugh.  If you have time to despise another country, shouldn't you try to improve your own country? .
Japan is an Enigma.  Japan is also a Phoenix.  She rose from the ashes of defeat and destruction. Judging by the increasing number of Japanese  Nobel laureate scientist ,  there is hope Japan will reemerge as the leader in revolutionary new technology.
Japan is an Enigma.  Murder  of Japanese former prime minister Shinzo Abe by a lone unemployed youth was totally unexpected. Read any news media reports, and the reporters do not fail to mention that gun violence in Japanese society is really rare. Assassination in Japan! It sounds unbelievable, like girls wearing bikini in Afghanistan!  It really is unexpected.  In a harmonious nation of gentle nerds who never mind waiting in mile long queue every day, murdering a high profile politician in public view is extraordinary. Astonishingly, the homemade gun recovered from the assailant, is said to be manufactured using Japanese invention of 3D printing. This is truly extraordinary. This is possibly the first murder in the world by using 3D printed gun. Terrorists all over the world, from Jihadists demanding decapitation of Nupur Sharma in India, to Neo Nazis demanding decapitation of all non-Aryans- they are taking a keen interest in this incident.  Japan. What comes to our mind when somebody mentions Japan? Mt. Fuji, ramen noodles, robots, bullet trains, manga, sushi, kimono, Sony, Toyota? All these are gentle reminders that Japan is a peaceful and progressive nation. Japan is often referred to as an economic miracle. An industrial power and inventor of many delightful inventions like Walkman, LED, karaoke, etc. Many Japanese company brand names are world famous. But, wait a minute- what about Samurai, hara-kiri, suicidal kamikaze, yakuza mafia and pre-emptive attack on America in world war 2? All these are also reminders that Japan has a dark side too. A dark side which is rarely reported by western media or Japanese broadcaster NHK. A dark side which is slowly consuming this ancient Shinto society like a black hole consuming a dying star.   Japan has one of the highest suicide rate in the OECD. There are millions of lonely and loveless youths who are neglected by the conformist society. In Japan those men are known as Hikikomori. Those lonely youths are mostly unemployed untrained and half-educated. They survive on welfare benefits handed out by the generous government. They live a single life in a Spartan apartment. They do not socialize much. Once a Hikikomori starved himself till death inside his empty apartment. The neighbours found his dead skeleton lying on the floor after many months. I heard that the local governments often organize recreation events like horse riding for these Hikikomori youths who rarely come outside their homes. Hikikomori youths have a grudge and hatred for their society. They see Japanese society has failed their expectations. In some ways these individuals are the victims of high expectations. Much like the much hyped ‘Paris syndrome’. They expect too much from life and world. And once when they begin to realize that their life will never be so special or extraordinary, they become socially withdrawn. They become Hikikomori.  Possibility that the assailant who killed Shinzo Abe is a Hikikomori is beyond doubt. Sometimes a Hikikomori can become extremely destructive for no reason. Maybe they just wish to be noticed.  On the surface, Japan appears like a perfect fusion of ultra-modernity and traditionalism. Age old traditions of Shinto rituals coexist with western consumerism. But beneath the surface, there are fault lines in Japanese society. Like those infamous volcanoes and earthquakes which are unexpected and unpredictable, so are the Japanese people. Behind their famous hospitality and polite manners, Japan is a very lonely and unhappy nation.
yakuza operate in japan inpune transfering corporate money into pedofilic pornography. nothing is done about it. 2 busy sanctioning the russians that DONT want lgbtq in they country. vote for ukraine who want nato in ukraine to force lgbtq on russia.   boycott japan now until yakuza is no longer institution.

Rest in peace. Any chinese people talking bad about Shinzo Abe, they are afraid of japan becoming a more stronger military power in the region and challenge their hard power.  Communist China, your authoritarian regime will not rule the world... the Freedom is coming to you Baby 👶.  Long live the republic and liberty 🗽 !!!  Long live to the free world 🌎!!!
Oh well...NEXT!!!
The remnants of war criminals in World War II are the most heinous crimes, and they have not repented to this day, provoking the war.  Trying to overthrow Japan's pacifist constitution, this man is as sinful as his fathers, go to hell
Peaceful my ass....maybe the monks...

[Faith content of the Christian cult "Unification Church", which is Abe's supporter]  "Koreans are the dominant races that rule the world, and Japan claims to be subordinate to South Korea." "Repression of the rights of homosexuals and women in the United States" "Church instructors say that things have a subject and an object. When it comes to cars and drivers, the driver is the subject, and when it comes to men and women, the man is the subject and the woman is the object." "Attacking Marriage Equality in Taiwan" "Some of the children of Japanese believers were made to participate in a ritual to exorcise evil spirits who were beaten for eight hours." "The cost of a joint wedding is 140,000 yen for Koreans, but 1.4 million yen for Japanese." "Japanese women are obliged to compensate for the comfort women, so even if they are married to a Korean beggar, they should be grateful and contraception is not allowed." "All sexual procedures are designated by the church" "Sell to believers for 30 million yen" "If someone in the family neglects their faith, they will not let the children of the believers escape under the rule that the whole family will go to hell under the collective responsibility."
[The truth of Shinzo Abe] ・ He is not Japanese ・ Shinzo Abe is a “descendant of the Lee family who destroyed Korea by corruption politics” ・ Shinzo Abe hijacked Japanese politics in collusion with the Unification Church, a cult religion that imitated Christianity. ・ The Guru of the Unification Church is a “North Korean” and has sent funds collected in Japan and the United States to North Korea. ・ The Unification Association collaborates with the Japanese Mafia and is involved in sex crimes, human trafficking, brainwashing, and drug distribution against believer women. ・ The purpose of Shinzo Abe and the Unification Church is to "eradicate the Japanese people. ・ They are a collection of psychopaths  【Warn people around the world Don't be fooled】
安倍晋三を殺害した山上容疑者は、逮捕されました。だけど山上容疑者の親族に5000万の支給がされました。日本人は、皆理由を知っています。その日本の権力者がいかに悪事をしていたのかも皆知っています。日本政府はその説明責任を国民に知らせることはしません。
The true criminal who shot the Abe former Prime Minister became clear  The gunshot wound is the penetration trace done to a throat and a neck and the left shoulder on the 5cm away right clavicle from the interview of the doctor. Abe stood with Tetsuya Yamagami who was considered to be a criminal right before I was shot as a back. Therefore I do not stop by to the bullet which Tetsuya Yamagami fired. The remodeling gun which they made on the mountain is a shotgun, and it is an explosion saying that two gunshots were emitted from the remodeling gun on the mountain, and they are the smoke that the evidence is white. The bullet of the next video picture is reflected before the gunshot. URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5sQl-gD69Y   When Abe looked back toward the criminal with another video, I seemed to be shot, but it is accidental, and the silent-type bullet not to play of the gunshot flies before a gunshot. It is three, too. These three attacked Abe. I shot it from a backward building of Abe. The hit rate is low at the point-blank range with the remodeling gun which I made on the mountain. If a hit rate is high, I should be killed with one. It is said that the motive of the crime is because I was robbed of property by the United Church of Christ. Then you should aim at a founder of the United Church of Christ. There are too many doubt points.  It is the commissioner-general of the National Police Agency Takaji Kunimatsu shooting case that Aum Shinrikyo performed to think here. The criminal was a North Korean sniper. The batch was left in the spot.  Such a professional sniper performed the Abe former Prime Minister shooting case, and Tetsuya Yamagami of the amateur cannot give a fatal injury at the point-blank range either.  The political purpose is thought about by having got up before the Upper House election in this backdrop, but is unlikely.  Minister of Defense Nobuo Kishi is a true younger brother of Shinzo Abe. I kill the older brother, and is it not a purpose to sneer at the Japanese police and Self-Defense Forces? Is a thing thought to be it not a purpose to threat Prime Minister Kishi using this case? Anti-Japan power and Freemason affect this case. This is because I prepare Tetsuya Yamagami who is the criminal of the victim and am skillful.  When Mason enumerates cases concerned with Japan  There are JAL123 service shooting down case, bubble burst, the Aum Shinrikyo sarin subway attacks in Tokyo, Kakuei Tanaka Lockheed scandal, descent from a mountain case, 300 million yen seizure case, emperor silver case, Wakayama poison curry case, Akihabara slasher case, glycoMorinaga case, Fukuchiyama Line derailment, Chinese food plane crash case, Kyoto animation arson case, Kanbe continuation child killing case.
😭😭😭
first they bomb pearl harbour, and then they copy the Ronald Reagan event?
I dont want to hear how he was killed. I want to know who killed him and why??
Abe's constitutional amendment proposal. 0.The family is respected as the natural and fundamental unit of society. Families Must Help Each Other. 1.Human rights are always recognized only within the scope of "public interest and public order." 2.The Army can be mobilized for security maintenance separately from the purpose of national defense.(like Hongkong) 3.Even in times other than war, civil strife, and disaster, the Cabinet can declare a "state of emergency" at its discretion and restrict human rights. It can be approved and extended after the fact by a vote of the House of Representatives alone. Moreover, the term of office of the House of Representatives can be extended indefinitely.
Abe  was trying to change the Bill of Rights in line with the doctrine of the Unification Church in its constitutional amendment proposal. The word ”individual” has been erased.

The amount of damage caused by the Unification Church（Moonies.  Abe's ally）between 1987 and 2017 was 1.2 billion dollar, which was clarified by the damage consultation. This is a single digit percentage of the total damage. In other words, damage of at least over 10 billion has occurred!

There is no big money just for regulating masses
Almost all news actors, movies  actors, sports are made from robot bodies with attached different heads. All for showing goverment power and entertaiment
I'm not Japanese but when I first saw the thumbnail that shows him and his year of birth until 2022, I was shocked and hope that he was just injured so he can still recover. I had to go on Facebook to check the comments and I saw a recent comment that he just died from his injuries. I was saddened by the news and can't believe it especially from Japan.
Agnes Chen 話佢結緍 wow
awwwwwwwwwwwww lol.     now he can get enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine along with the ww2 rapists and war criminals
I'm a Japanese and still can't believe he isn't here , what happened brutally in Japan. It was really shocking news for all people,he was an  amazing prime minister.I can't forgive the criminal.We are in sorrow.What I can do is only praying for our leader.
I'm shock & speechless. Japan is a very safe country in the World. How can this happen cruel  Assassin to a former Premier. My sincere condolences to his wife, families & the people of Japan. 🙏🙏May his soul RIP. 🧚👼 Mr Abe San you will be missed & remembered in our Heart. 💞💚

So sad.
Have the USA and Japan offer a deal to Ferdinand "BongBong" Marcos Jr. , that he can't refuse and find the consecrated AU!
I cannot be more proud of Mr. Shinzo Abe, as the student who graduated from the same elementary, junior high, and high school. He was not only the representative of Japan, but also our school. It is still hard to believe that we lost such a strong leader, but I just want to say that I am so thankful for what he had achieved for all of us. Rest In Peace, my great Senpai, and please watch over our future.
So sad

- Most terrible incompetent bodyguards ever - Most brain dead crowd ever, only watch, do not help  In short. This was totally a preventable tragedy. Bodyguards have the sole purpose of protecting their client and preventing the worst, so they prepare for the worst.   Every single one of these bodyguards should be put to court and trialed for negligence and incompetence. Such a disgrace.   Abe will be best known for his smart economic development plans which saved Japan from economic collapse and actually led to a growth (Abenomics). But he also increased military spending and capacity by a lot which is very controversial. But he is very popular and beloved most Japanese and that's why he is longest serving PM of all time.   However we can all agree that Abe is by far the most handsome and charismatic Japanese leader in a very verh long time.  Rest in peace. This was quite the shocking crime. But Japan's society has long been sick and twisted so its unsurprisingly some people have gone insane for them to do this to a retired old man...  This is a huge impact on Japanese society and I think from now on Japan will never be the same, both preventing these frenzy events by improving mental health and mental support and also greatly increasing   awareness of self-protection and bodyguard work. Japan will never be the same. This is a wake up call to the sleeping sick man of Asia....
A resident of japan, no one has the right to take someones life! But former PM Abe has done a lot of nasty things under his time! He was a very corrupt politician! But no law in japan could sue him, someone took the law in his own hand! Disastrously sad but dirty politicians knows no country and race.
The worst prime minister of Japan. Japanese Trump.
Everywhere the r good & bet people , the is a God , the is a devil , we are here for moment
So, no AR-15 used?
I also invite you too Islam, which is the pathway too heaven what the Lord likes for his creation In order too enter the fold of Islam,or be a Muslim, you must say;  Their only one Lord worthy of worship that's the almighty unresembled god. In order too success you must obey the teaching of his servant Mohammed  The human creation just like us
Come too Islam for life after death
So Sorry For Hear That... R. I.P.
Beloved by many people, genuine, warm humble man who dedicated his life for Japan’s sovereignty / independence so that each countries can be equal, diverse and co exist, co thrive on this earth. There is a force does not allow that. We Japanese people will continue Abe’s wish. Evil will not touch our heart, will not connect humanity. We will protect 2,600 years old continuing  country. Rest In Peace our prime minister. We will not forget you🙏
Pay attention to reporter from singapore's word... He was an influential figure and have massive influence in the current administration inspite of stepping down in 2020. Current PM echoing same sentiments as him after the former take a stand seem to me as the current pm do not hold much power.  Ok am I the only one finding this shaddy. There in lies the reason behind his assassination.  Strength to his family.
There must be some politicians who helped the gunman. There is no way average joes to know all that information, so who is the politician that helped him, or China is behind his killing.
I’m Japanese. I’m really appalled and saddened. Cuz such a terrible thing happened in Japan. I can’t believe it..
RIP Remotes of true GOD of Abraham,Isaak and Jacob......Nice prime minister
RIP - Former PM Shinzo Abe 💐  You’ll be always be remembered for your kind support for the Philippines.  As a Filipino I will never forget you Sir you’re always in our hearts and minds.  My deepest sympathy and condolence to the family and to the Japanese people in Japan.  🇵🇭 🇯🇵

Who should be assassinated  is in question mark, African fascistic and racist barbarian  leaders  are  massacred a lot of innocent civilians   by their tribe like Ethiopian Amharas . The genocider is still  killing for the last four years and still killing and people  are giving a chance if he could change his evil and cruel mind but he more aggravating his cruelty
Democracy is not supposed to be this way
From the UK I express my deepest condolences to Shinzo Abe's family and the Japanese  people.He was truly a remarkable human being.RIP
Are you ready? The kingdom of Heaven is at hand, repent and receive and confess Jesus Christ as your personal saviour and Lord and you shall be saved! Time is short. This is the time to wake up and get born of God. Tomorrow is not guaranteed. Jesus is coming! You may check out of this world at a time. Jesus is King! Shalom

Everybody WAKE UP !!!    Its 100% China masterminded for Abe's assassination using a local Japanese to do the dirty job.  Poisoning local people minds and believes through brainwashing perfected by China in every country in the world through the internet and local media.   Do you know that people in China are celebrating with Champaign for Abe's assassination!!!
Prayers,for the wonderful Japanese people. May he RIP.❤
Who shot and why
Sorry for your loss from United States 🇺🇸
Extremely difficult to get a gun in Japan? Confirmation of his speaking in Nana wasn't public 'til Thursday? He must have crossed/offended some powerful people somewhere as this has all the earmarks of a professional political hit.
He was far right wing and grand son of WW2 class A war criminal who refused to make a full apology to victims.  He screwed up Japanese economy with his foolish policies and stole money from tax payers.  For example, Abe won Tokyo Olympics then contracted paper box bed to his brother's company for $2200 each, gave used school property for almost nothing to his friend and used government fund to treat his supporters.  He used sudden sickness as excuse twice to quit as prime minister when he was in hot seat for embezzlement and not able to handle COVID.  Abe gave prayers every year to Japanese class A war criminals and changed school textbooks that Japan was victim of the West and nuclear bombs by the US.  Let's not sugar coat this and look at him for facts that he was no angel.
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗨𝗸𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗜𝘀 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner. The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil. The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism. Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word. We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs. We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves. The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize. Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves. Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded. Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

My condolence to the breaved family and the people of Japan
Preocupa mucho la crisis política por el asesinato del exprimer ministro Japones, condolencias a su familia, son actos que no habían ocurrido en una cultura tan conservadora como la Japonesa, esto debilita al Gobierno Japones, a la UE y el Gran Apoyo que da Japon a Ucrania. Está muy raro esto, cuidado que no estén las manos negras de los progresistas Izquierdosos Japoneses, detrás de todo está gran conspiración contra el gobierno conservador y democrático Japones. Dios proteja, cuide y guíe a la gran nación de Japón
Shinzo Abe always alive in a heart's of every Indians. RIP
j‘ai ete encore plus choque  de voir danser  de jeunes chinois sous le portrait  deM.Abe avec feux d’artifices!!!?  pour celebrer  ce grand jour!

Le Japon c'est l’exacte contre-valeur  de la Chine  de Chi！

Who writes the headlines? Not shot at. SHOT/Murdered!  Morons.
Former Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Sir was a great leader and also remembered for his efforts to establish the QUAD ( The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue ). 🙏
Shooting a present former even ancient MP. Especially PM. Is nvr a one off. Always got purpose. Immediate. Trial. Showcase. All above. One madman equals chineese bat soup lover.
Prayer for him and Japan Rest in peace sir mr.shinzo Abe From Indonesian
Soooo sad 😢😢😢😢😢😢
here you go another trick from the libs , libs are implicated in murdering for century , now they doing it in Japan to push gun ban . BBC another Libs outlet
I'm deeply sorry for your loss. My prayers go out to Japan and his family.
Luke: No, No, it’s not true, that’s impossible!
I am Korean I am conservative in Korea. it's patriotic dismissing Abe Shinzō's death as a death of justice, a sacrifice for the good, There are dangerous forces that do the packaging, never do that. Japan's Prime Minister Abe Shinzō is nothing more than an imperialist with the ambition to dominate the world and threaten world peace, like China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Abe is trying to resurrect Japan as an imperialist country. It is trying to make foreign countries into a nation capable of pre-emptive aggression warfare first. And Japan is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Above all, Abe is trying to hide the war crimes of the Japanese Empire during World War II, when it colonized India, Southeast Asia, and Australia and committed various war crimes.
Wow. It's been a longtime since there's been a political assassination in the news.
it is very sad to hear him being shot. what has happened to our society
He seemed a lovely man such a sad day.
Deep respect to him, his family and what he did for his country. You can’t stop people like him you made him immortal and many others will come. Giving up is not an option.
Shinzo Abe san does not deserve to die like that 😭😭😭   He was a good man, a good leader and a respectable man. 😢
My deepest condolences 🙏 to Mr Abe family @the country who lost A great leader...May he Rip 🙏
The former Japanese PM Abe was  likeable to the common world citizens. His shooting is a cowardly act. If unborn babies can be killed, surely no person is safe today.
😃😃😃😃
Liberal f’ing parasites. The hell with ALL of you delusional degenerates. 💩 🙏 RIP Shinzo 🙌
Most times it amazes me greatly the way I moved from an average lifestyle to earning over 63k per month, utter shock is the word. I have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities abound in the financial markets, The only thing is to know where to focus.
WE ALL KNOW HE WAS SENT BY THE U.S. of A . . . MOST LIKELY , THE U.S. of A FOUND DIRT UNDER HIS NAME . MOST LIKELY ANTI-U.S. of A. DIRT , SO THEY HAD TO HANDLE IT . SEND IN THE SOUL ASSASSINS . . .
My deepest condolence to his families and the people of Japan. May he rest in peace 
Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau next please.

I am mourning the death of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his families who are mourning his death as well as the supporters of Prime Minister Shinzos Abe there in Japan
色々な批判はあった。欠点もあった。けれども多くの日本国民にとって偉大なリーダーだったし、彼の功績はここ数十年の内閣の中で最も大きい。本当に悲しいよ。安倍さん、まだ若すぎるよ。。。
According to the statement of Yamagami who killed Abe, the motive for assassinating Abe was the relationship between the Unification Church and Abe. Yamagami resented the Unification Church for bankrupting her mother. Yamagami initially planned to kill the leaders of the Unification Church, but killed Abe because he believed he had spread the Unification Church in Japan. The Unification Church is a cult founded in South Korea that caused various social problems in Japan. They have brainwashed Japanese believers and bankrupted many Japanese families by selling expensive ceramic pots and making huge donations under the pretext of breaking their curse. The Unification Church advocates anti-communism and strongly supports conservative politicians in Japan and the United States. And those politicians like Abe send a message of thanks to the Unification Church. Yamagami killed Abe because he believed he was the mastermind behind the Unification Church.
Very nice
Terrorist exist everywhere it has no religion
삼가 고인의 명복을 빕니다. 慎んで故人のご冥福をお祈り致します.

😢🇯🇵
i cant believe this, the only one who wanted to change for the better, i loved this man, thank god be blessed us with young teens!
There are so many madmen in this world, egocentric sociopaths,  who force their opinions on people by brutality and lies instead of logical discussion and explanation. My condolences to the Abe family, may he rest in peace, he was one of the good ones.
😢😢😢😢 an great man
The uncontrolled, ungoverned use of thought and feeling has brought about all kinds of discord, sickness and distress. Few, however, believe this, and keep going on and on continually creating by their ungoverned thought and desire, chaos in their worlds; when they could as easily as a breath face about, using their thought constructively with the motive power of divine love, and build for themselves a perfect paradise within the period of two years.
True definition 'act of terrorism'.
I'm Japanese 、 Japanese security police is shit
The killer's mother made a large donation to the Unification Church, which resulted in bankruptcy and the family's collapse. Therefore, it seems that the murderer has a grudge against the Unification Church and targeted Shinzo Abe, who has a close relationship with the Unification Church. Note that the Japanese media has not disclosed the name of the Unification Church at all.
The motive for the crime is apparently due to a grudge against the Unification Church, a religious group close to Shinzo Abe. The Japanese media has not disclosed the name of that religious group at all. What does this mean?

It is very sad day for Japan 🇯🇵  This act is against Free, democracy, law and order.
My deepest condolence to Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s whole family and to all Japanese people. I was hoping that he will survived but when I heard the news that he passed away it really shocked me. He was a great leader of Japan. Rest In Peace Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
I think you have to give pause to the fact the Chinese are probably behind it
My hart is sadden I’m so praying for his family friends and co worker all that he has touch .  Regardless of his political stand no human deserves what happened to him. RIP MR. Shinzo Abe
Japan is turning more into America and it'll get worse as the U.S. is forcing Japan to accept more expats and immigrants.
Condolescences  to.his family...what horror year
Act of brutality but not an act of terrorism...only because the shooter is not a muslim... If the shooter would be a muslim then ofcourse the act was termed to be an act of terrorism....
RIP shinzo  🙏
Incident????!!!!
The cover up brings!! My condolences to his family
this is crazy
RIP sir

My deepest condolences to Mr Shinzo, and Family 🌹
God BLESS HIM
His BACK HOME where he BELONGS
He defiantly had inside information that we will never learn about.
I know next to nothing about Japanese politics, but it seems that this guy was somewhat controversial, despite his long-running terms. Still doesn't sound like he deserved to be gunned down in the streets though.
Rest in  peace  ✌️ ✌️✌️✌️ GOD BLESS him
Mr. Abe take the killer's soul to heaven court for justice.

Damn, lets say this. Make double coffin or two stairs coffin. Put the killer in the floor and Abe on the second floor. Barry the killer alive under Mr. Abe.
So, how do we get rid of Biden?  Maybe a nuclear snow cone that would surgically strike a basement?  The piece of shit he really is.  Go Putin!
The Japanese media is mostly made up of anti-Japanese and they had been criticizing former PM Abe all along. President Trump says his death is a great loss to the world, anti-globalist Putin is saddened by his death, and from the opinions of those who actually met and talked with Abe, it is clear that he was great and was trying to lead Japan in the right direction. He was a necessary figure in a Japanese political world now dominated by the anti-Japanese left. But he was assassinated. Moreover, he was good friends with Putin. In other words, the person who was a bridge of friendship between Russia and Japan was killed.  They are the only ones who will benefit from this. What will happen to Japan? It may hit rock bottom once.  Memo: Anti-Japanese brainwashed Chinese and Koreans are rejoicing over the death of former PM Abe. Koreans are brainwashed by the 1lluminati and Chinese are by the Chinese Communist Party. In other words, the CCP and the 1lluminati are happy about his death. But is Xi Jinping different? Has he turned from the dark side?
If it happens in a peaceful country, it can happen in any country. I prayers to the family that left in pain.
My heart goes to the Abe Family.   May he Rest in Peace.  Shocking!

More insanity.I am so done with people arguing about politics all the time.All this arguing isn’t get us anywhere but more angry with each other.
The shot heard around the world.
By person to person Pray for him. But for history, he deserve for this. I'm a philippiniana, But this im on the chinese side. I never forgot the Manila massacre. I can not forgive His ancestor did in Manila
This is sad, My greatest condolences for Abe's family and to all of my Japanese  RIP Shinzo Abe 🇮🇩❤️🇯🇵
Shocking the whole world, my condolence to late Abe's family and the Japanese citizen during this shocking incident.
what a nice
The media reports a lot, but to be honest, this news is not much talked about among Japanese citizens. The same is true around me.
I wouldn't comment on anything though;  there is no way... If there is no security for the Prime Minister of Japan, what will he say about other countries, especially those in the Americas?  Private Security Note Zero from the authorities of Japan.  If it were for the Pope even the airspace would be monitored, what a disappointment Japan!
Feel so upset. He is a amazing leader
This is so very sad and I pray that his family is standing strong and holding on to each other while they go through this horrific time.  To me it is a coward who did this for money or any other reason, murder is murder and assignation is only a fancy way of ordering a murder to me and this is my opinion. The man who killed  Mr. Shinzo Abe did it because of anger, hate, or maybe paid. This is my opinion and now a family is hurting and grieving because someone hated Mr. Abe.  How sad of a coward.
I'm not very smart but isn't "being shot" a better descriptor than "being shot at"???
These days....are days of followers. (Sadly) All other leaders...please be safe. Specific ones that is.
Xi Jin Ping mourns Shinzo Abe in his personal name! We remind Xi Jin Ping do not to stand on the opposite side of the Chinese people!
So sad they killed Shinzo Abe.  Such a senseless act on a very good person.  He did not deserve this at all!! RIP
Mr. Abe is a respectable person who has worked for Japan for many years, regardless of the pros and cons. I sincerely hope that such a tragedy will not happen in the world in the future.  P.S. Thank you all for your kind words and concern. From🇯🇵
lots of people saying rip to a literal war crime denying piece of shit
illuminati 👹🔺🔻
Yes! There were security lapses... but how can we really prepare for what a man with a sick mind and soul would do? :(
You have to ask yourself we’re the hell was his body man where are his cover team and why wasn’t he spirited away from the scene when the first shot was fired only to just get shot with a delayed second shot and he jumped down from the stand?!? Bush league wake up Japanese Secret Service! Left on scene I guess they did have a car to rush him to hospital and STAYED THERE UNTIL FIRE//Rescue showed up????? Trolls🖕🏿❄️
REST IN PEACE SIR**** GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY****.  HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROTECTED BETTER!!!
😈
So sad, his secret service, protection details, was sadly useless. Prayers.  God bless.
RIP BOZO
It is a tragedy this happened to Shinzo Abe... He was a very prominent figure in Japan's leadership and I was fond of seeing him in the news... And right after the death of Kazuki Takahashi...  Deeply heartbreaking for this to happen in such a peaceful country... One painful death after another in Japan... 😢
A terrible tragedy, but I hate to disabuse the BBC fellow. Firearms are not the only implements of violence. Violence is not as "rare" in Japan as Westerners think; it is simply carried out there via other ways and means.
Yakuza killed him.

Hot weather makes people do hot things
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates-🟥
His security detail reacted terribly to this and is probably why he ended up dead. If you watch the actual video the first shot failed. The second shot is what killed him.  Rather than immediately rush to guard him as the first shot rang out, everyone around him ducked and looked around confused. Had this been on the US secret service would have tackled the president or whoever was being shot at immediately to get them out of harms way. Not to mention the fact that the guy would have probably not even have been able to get the first shot off. Poor training is to blame for this death. They were given the perfect opportunity to save Abe’s life with that first misfire and they squandered it due to having no clue how to respond in the face of a situation like this. He is dead because of their inability to react to a dire situation quickly. There is no sugarcoating it. There was nearly 3 seconds between the misfire and the shot that killed him. That’s plenty of time for his guards to have reacted and tackle him out of the way had they actually been trained properly. And if they were trained properly then they should be immediately fired.
I can't even like this video, so so sad.😢 Rest in Power Shinzo🙏🏾 they better not show him getting harmed....poor Shinzo. Praying for his soul to be at rest, his family, and his supporters🐺💓.😢😢😢 THEY BETTER FIND who collaborated those handmade hand guns on his set up, praying for #japaneseobama
😂😂😂
An organised assasination
RIP Shinzo Abe. IBD warrior and an inspiration for many
This has China written all over it.
The assassin is open about his motives, and it is not uncommon for politicians to have another dark side secret, as the media has revealed.
See this shows if some one wants to kill does not matter how many gun laws you pass some is going to find away to kill
I want to see the video
In Japan shootings... Shocking 🤔🤔🤔
My Condolences To The Families And My Prayers Are With You Rest In Peace Mr Shinzo Abe 🌹🌹🌼🌼🌺🌺💐💐🌸🌸🌷🌷🦋🌈🦋
The assassin didn't get hold of a gun, he made it.
Japan is worse then Chicago
Everyone's killing Everyone, apparently assassinations are the norm now. Political nutts everywhere just look at January 6th in USA 😒
what happened to this woman nose???
😭😭😭😭

That was no gun... that was a cannon. Rest in Peace Shinzo Abe
Man, he got shot with a handmade gun!
Those county that ignore their veterans needs will be attended by this type of trend...for sure. !!!
MORE ? YES MORE MORE MORE DO YOU PEOPLE GET IT YET Knife attack in Kawasaki  In late May, a man wielding knives in both hands approached a bus station and began stabbing children and other passengers waiting for their morning bus.  Eighteen people were injured, and two died, including a child.  The suspect, a man in his 50s, was detained at the scene but later died from self-inflicted wounds.
Tokyo bus stabbings  In December 2010, Yuta Saito, a 27-year-old man, boarded a crowded bus outside the Toride Station in Tokyo’s Ibaraki prefecture and began stabbing passengers. He continued the attack on a second bus.  Fourteen people, 11 of whom were students at nearby schools were injured in the attack. Stabbing at a care facility  In July 2016, a 26-year-old man named Satoshi Uematsu entered a disabled care center in Sagamihara, south of Tokyo, carrying a bag of knives and sharp tools and began attacking patients.  Nineteen people were killed, ranging in age from 18 to 70 years old.  The man was a former employee of the facility. He had been “involuntarily committed” to a hospital a few months prior to the attack for saying he wanted to kill disabled people, according to the Guardian.
The Akihabara ‘random attacker incident’  In June 2008, 25-year-old Tomohiro Kato drove a rented truck into a pedestrian area in Akihabara, a shopping district known for electronics and video games in Tokyo, before he jumped out of the vehicle and began stabbing onlookers, some of whom were helping other victims. He killed seven people and wounded 10.
little gun violence i japan HE MEANT TO SAY The Osaka school massacre  Unemployed former janitor Mamoru Takuma, 37, entered an elementary school in Ikeda, Osaka prefecture on June 8, 2001 and began stabbing teachers and students. Eight children were killed, including seven girls in second grade and a boy in first grade. Thirteen other kids and two teachers were seriously injured. The attacker was subdued by a teacher and arrested.
Rest in Peace Shinzo abe 🇯🇵
This is all part of the plan for the globalists to take over.
they should ban guns
God ask him to come to his mansion istead to stay in ashe that already burn many year ago
God will bless Abe in heaven.
Sayonara sucka
And even with the world's strictest gun laws somebody was still able to kill somebody with a homemade gun that was not 3D printed but made by hand which proves my point if a criminal or a person wants to kill another person even with the world's strictest gun laws a person can still kill a person but thank God for people that have degrees you know a degree in education
The Philippines mourns with Japan! Rest in Peace Mr. Shinzo Abe!
Western media will blame Putin.
Wow. Countries should stop emulating the most sh!+hole country in the world, America.
For those people who think that this is a heartbreaking accident, listen to me. Japanese people are nice and friendly. However, this country has an unforgivable past just like German has.  At least Germans admitted their sins, apologized and teach their kids not to repeat those evil acts during WW2.  But Japan is the opposite. Young generations don’t know their grandparents' generation killed a lot of innocent people including the fetus.  This guy, Abe, is at the core of those historical distortions, blinding their people and trying to bring their military power back. He is the center man of all these dirty plans. No mercy for him.
I always liked the guy, had an air of dignity and trust about him, a sad loss for the world. My thoughts to his family. 🇬🇧
RIP Shenzo.
CIA acting like they were never involved
善有善报恶有恶报不是不报时辰未到做人还是行善积德多行不义必自毙
He was a good man and in America there is so many politicians there destroying the country and they are still running around
😢
Why can’t we have laws like Japan ???
Japan should really consider banning guns out right. Only the government should have them.
Japanese national living in UK.  I left my homeland in 92 but this news still saddened me. I really feel for his wife, to have lost her husband, this way.  Abe san,  I'm so sorry your life was cut short like this. You'll be remembered.
Greatest minister of Japan 😭
So...assassinated?
I m gonna till my last breath for my family
安倍晉三是個智者有遠見領導人。
HE IS A FRIEND OF THE WORLD. R.I.P.
Not only Abe has destroyed Japan economically for pursuing his personal gains….  ……but also promoted WWII Class A criminals (his grandfather) as national heroes and denied their War Crimes based on lies.    He also controls school history books in government level in order to conceal the Truth of WWII where his grandfather was actively involved.    Devine Retribution!

Condolences to Mr. Abe’s family and the Japanese people.
Very sad news 😭
White people reporting it like they don’t give a shit

Mes condoléances et paix à son ÂME
Intelligences and security lapses. Shameful!!! How could they be so blind folded.
WHO CARES  .
😭😭😭😭🇪🇹🇪🇹
Still can't believe this happening in Japan to mr Abe. The security guards are not  professional and incompetent. we can see from the scene replay.  Imagine 2 free shots crashing.  After the first shot ,Mr Abe can be protected.. like there was a deliberately action neglect of security. sorry this is just my opinion. This is a ring one warning with security like this could be dangerous for the palace family and VIP too.
🇫🇷🇪🇺Absolutely shocking and horrifying to hear of such an attack against a former prime minister especially in a country as peaceful as Japan.✌🏼
Sad!😢 Japan has loss a monumental man, you can’t please everyone in this old world. Sending thoughts and prayers for his family.🙏🤲❤️ Thank you, Sir Shinzo Abe R.I.P😭
JAPANESE SECURITY IS SHIIT
Jesus Christ ehhhhhhhhhhh
I couldn't believe such an accident could happen in such country very badly let people mentain peace in continent
I have watched the video that when he was shot. I really doubt the security.
Kudos to Japan for its continuing very strict gun control. But its very morbidly ironic that the one time someone gets killed by one, it happens to be the ex PM, and by a nasty, dirty, stinky ugly evil homemade contraption! A silent bow to you, Shinzo Abe-sama. RIP.
Maybe this will happen to turdy.
rip shinzo
Nato leaders should have met this fate… not a peaceful statesman like Shizo Abe
The same thing they tried to do with president bolsonaro in brazil by the extreme left. He was stabbed by an extremist during the 2018 election campaign. The crime is unpunished so far and the criminal will have the possibility of getting out of jail.
Abe was sinner, the world is better without him. What would people think of if Hilter right hand man, class A war criminal was release and become leader of Germany, then he never apologise, worst, he denial all the war crimes Nazi committee and rewrite history book in favour of Nazi, then his grand son under his teaching, carry on his legacy, consistently tried to rearm its army, still denial all the war crimes, still teaching fake history, still pay tribute to Hilter every years. This Abe the Asian version.
Essence of Shock.
Ahhh he does not like military spending..?????
Their secret service sucks and he should had wear bullet proof vest in public
Rip and hope his family and friends r ok
Omg 😱😱😱
Japan Stay strong.
good job
Abe! ABE!
Whaaaaaaaat no! I don't want to life any longer in this world🥺😱😭😭😭😭
Rest In Peace my man
From behind, too😭
IS HE NOW THE EX EX LEADER?
Good riddance. More politicians need executing! If the authorities won’t take action and put them in prison then don’t be surprised when the public take matters into their own hands. This is why Tony Blair in the UK lives with armed guards stood on his doorstep. He’d also be dead by now if he was dumb enough to walk the streets.
I sill can’t believe it :,u this is truly shocking! he was the best prime minister, I will always remember him as one of the best and kind leaders in the world. Rip Abe-San ;-;
Japan has lost a patriot. And there nation lost a very sincere person. My condolences from an opressed slave country known to world as Pakistan. Mr. Abe will be dearly missed. So sorry.
Heartbreaking....... R.I.P.
Greed is also rampant, example; even this video on YouTube is showing the greed by displaying advertising on the bottom left and now on the top task bar, YouTube is advertising more and more to us and their commercials are getting longer and more frequent as well as More of them on each commercial break, money is their God.
~@!$$~@!~@!~@!@@#$~@#The Japanese have yet to apologize for the serious crimes committed against China in WW2, the Japanese refused to recognize the Nanjing Massacre, Abe is the representative of Japanese militarism

There are some mistake. It is not indicated that “Suspect has disagreements with Mr Abe’s policy”
My deepest condolences
Ig the question is why
His policies produced many "invincibility man (dispossessed generation)" in Japanese society. It's like he pulled the trigger himself.
This is a amer…
this a the world has a thing is bulletproof, why don't wear bulletproof ?
Thank God he could only be assonated one time...

So sad.... RIP....
*Shinzo Abe* remained unrepentant towards the atrocities committed by the Japanese army during the Second World War especially the massacre at Nanking. He was unapologetic to China, and also angered all his ASEAN neighbours by persistently insisting on honouring the Japanese war criminals enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine.   *Nobusuke Kishi* (13 November 1896 - 7 August 1987), a Class A war criminal in the war of aggression against China, a Japanese right wing known for his exploitative rule of the Japanese puppet state of Manchokuo in Northeast China in the 1930s and was nicknamed the "Monster of the Shōwa era" (昭和の妖怪; Shōwa no yōkai).   Kishi was notorious of his brutality when he served as Manchukuo's Deputy Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi felt the Chinese were more akin to dogs than human beings and would only understand brute force, that Chinese were merely _'mechanical instruments of the Imperial Army, non-human automatons that should absolutely be obedient'_ to their Japanese masters.   With the US support he became the Prime Minister of Japan (1957-1960). As prime minister, Kishi's mishandling of the 1960 revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty _(the treaty that allows the United States to maintain military bases on Japanese soil),_ led to the massive 1960 Anpo protests which were the largest protests in Japan's modern history and which forced him to resign in disgrace.   On 14 July 1960, Kishi was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant as he was leaving the prime minister's residence to host a garden party celebrating Hayato Ikeda's impending ascension to the premiership. For the rest of his life, Kishi remained devoted to the cause of revising the Japanese Constitution to get rid of *_Article 9_* and remilitarizing Japan.  On 7 August 1987, Nobusuke Kishi died after months of illness. Shinzo Abe is his grandson, who is also an extreme right wing antagonist against China.  Just like his belligerent grandfather, Shinzo Abe sought to eliminate *_Article 9_* which states: *_'Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.'_*
Yeah extremely peaceful country!, all of us are... c'mon that's so stupid to say do we know anything about our shadow work as societies? I think we still dont
要为枪手发声，要让枪手说话，不能让枪手不明不白的消失才是当务之急，日本作为第一世界国家，要坚持民主自由，呼吁公开透明的处理，更要呼吁爱与和平，要原谅枪手，枪手一定有不得不这么做的苦衷，希望关注枪手的心理健康问题。
You hear about this type of stuff in America or even other places. But you NEVER hear about this in Japan! My thoughts are with Japan and her people. Blessings from Canada! 🇨🇦 🇯🇵
It seems that Chinese people love Japanese assassin heroes! maybe We need more such heroes! Against dictators!
Apparently assassinated by U.S. agents, as Shinzo Abe has proof that the coronavirus was made in the United States
America president Lincoln by a gunman assassination long time ago, it's history repeat again   who is planners for assassination action ? 🤔? 🤔? 🤔
when someone wants to kill you, no laws, no matter how tough, can save you. yes, a gun is a means, but in the end, it is still people who kill people.
This is so sad, how would somebody confuse him for Trump?
I am also sad about the early passing of Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. I cried today because I always see him with two Presidents that I like, namely Former President Duterte and  US President Donald J. Trump.  Mr. Abe visited the hometown of Duterte and Trump, where he played golf with former President Trump in his hometown Florida. Rest in Peace Sir Prim Abe. and my sympathy to his family and Japan. 🥰
😔
Sad
I am really sorry😢😢😢
Assassinate in japan: no religion is to blame  Assassinate in US or europe: just blame the religion of peace....lol
Sorry 💔💔💔
But the news lacks the fact why he was killed....
These are certainly unprecedented times. May God comfort the family and people of Japan who mourn the lost of Shinzo Abe, in Jesus name, amen. Amidst all that is transpiring on the earth, there is hope. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16

So Sad
Look  im sorry but i think the only option to stop this is to shut down all the gun shops. Including the one in the Market in plymouth city centre.  Or stop the action films or video games , it all needs to stop otherwise i think we all might as well get killed. I mean what is actually the attraction in films like terminater or Robocop , etc. Other than it encourages  real life violence.  ?  Do these gun shop owners want more innocent people to get shot & killed do they. ? This   has to stop Now. Why dont the  governments,  All of them all around the world  just get off their backsides & put a stop to all of it.  Stop lies , stop making promises & then not keep them.  I'M SERIOUS  IT STOPS NOW. NO MORE OF IT. IN AMERICA, AFRICA,  EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING BRITAIN.
In China many businesses are celebrating his death and offering discounts and buy one get one free
Globalist take over. People can hardly get guns in Japan. Gotta kill off any leader who doesnt wanna follow the scripts and agendas
Let's not go overboard.. While it's definitely sad and a crime what has happened, Shinzo Abe was a rightwing nationalist, not some hero.
I'm a university student in Japan. This incident is very shocking and I'm worried about the future of Japan, which has lost a great leader.
He was a great politician and person. He was the face of Japan and he’ll still remain the same. His legacy is here to stay and he’ll be remembered forever. Rest In Peace Abe-san.
If the person who is most pleased with Abe's death → Prime Minister Kishida → Taro Aso is removed, he will become a substantial Japanese general. It is worth seeing where Japanese politicians will line up in the future.www
Murdered by globalists
The atmosphere here is filled with fear and uncertainty since the mode and motives of the attack remain very unclear. The suspect manufactured some highly developed guns without catching the eyes of the authorities, which indicates that anybody with a certain skill can create lethal weapons in this country. If he had ties with some criminal organisations, he could have possessed conventional firearms. As for the motives, according to the police, he states that he held grudge against Mr. Abe's "attitude, but not against the former PM's political beliefs". But at the same time, the man revealed that he "attacked Mr. Abe because of his ties with a religious group", according to the suspect. The police has denied to disclose the name of that group. Mr. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party relies on The New Komei Party to maintain a majority coalition in the Parliament, the latter of which has a very controversial, almost taboo-like religious background. All parties, including the LDP and NKP, have resumed the campaign ahead of tomorrow's election.
No one can appoint on the seat of pm or president.. until Jews nd America gv permission..
heard about the tragic news yesterday and it's heartbreaking to hear how he died brutally in the hands of his killer. I hope that even after his death he remains somewhat influential towards Japan. rest well Shinzo Abe.
skill issue
Very sad 😭
I am Japanese. We lost a great politician. It is very painful. And in the comments, someone who seems to be from China is spreading misinformation about Mr. Abe. He at least tried to make the world a better place. I have to tell this.
OMG
So sad and painful not only for the people of Japan but for the whole world to lose a great leader.
Why aren't you covering the Dutch farmer protest .I know it doesn't fit in with the Global agenda  21 narrative. You are an utter disgrace.
condolences goes to his family, peace from Italy 🇮🇹🇯🇵
One down, who's next?
As a Korean it's very difficult to pay condolence to his death. Western people do not understand why the sentiment of Korean and Chinese as well as some other South Eastern Asian countries who were invaded by Japan is different from that of Japanese people and western countries... which arises from the historical background. Shinzo Abe has always denied atrocities and war crimes committed against people of Korea, China and the other countries which were colonized before and his grandfather, Kishi Nobuseuke was at the forefront of committing war crimes during world war 2. And Mr. Abe has several times attended commemoration at Ysukuni Shrine which honors A-Class war criminals who were convicted of having been involved in the planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of the war.
you know this man was a great human being just look at all the amazing comments below such a sad way to go 😢 rip
Don't wait to see Satan physically......Some human beings are just a reflection and existence of SATAN Himself.....Y kill Some one like an animal???Extremely heartbreaking!!!!!!!!!!
Listening to news makes me want to vomit 🤮 !! Very clear the world has no idea what Japan is actually all about and how oppressed and depressed the people are here!!!  And by the way there has been no mourning or demonstrations!! What does that tell you??  The people are fed up of the selfishness of the political elites in this country!!!
zoti epast cu ne gjenet lavdi  i poharushem ffd
I'm guessing that the shooter didn't actually care about the PM's policies or whatnot. He just wanted to kill someone important and be remembered for doing it. He got what he wanted, along with life in prison, or possibly the death penalty.
Why aren't they saying "he was murdered?"
So sad. This is just heart wrenching.
Dont kill good leaders kill Putin Xi Un or Trump
He was a great Japanese leader
Excellent reporter.
The era of peace for Japan has ended.
Friends with putin, he was a freak.
He effort to make world peaceful
This hit me hard! 💔 God bless his soul 🙏
He was true friend of India 🇮🇳❤️🇯🇵 We will always remember you sir.
1 shot in Japan in a year compared to over 14,000 in America. America a third world country that the rest of the world use as the butt of it's jokes.
another hoax. Shameless.
So sad💔 https://youtu.be/qTE4uQAA5m0
https://youtu.be/qTE4uQAA5m0
So heart breaking. Abe is such a lovely man. RIP Abe
Abe wants Japan to strike a balance between China and the United States for maximum benefit, which makes the United States very dissatisfied. The United States has always wanted Japan to become cannon fodder against China. Abe has always been against the payment of military contributions to the U.S. military in Japan. Now Abe stepped down and the United States kill Abe as a deterrent to the current Japanese government and the South Korean governments. After all, the former president of South Korea also hoped to balance between China and the United States to obtain benefits, and then he was dismissed. The current South Korean politicians are full of all. The American microphone is extremely anti-China and anti-Russia, and also opposes women's rights. In short, the United States assassinated Abe to tell the governments of Japan and South Korea that you should not think of maintaining a good relationship with China and the United States at the same time like your predecessor. You'd better be a bridgehead for the United States to contain China honestly, otherwise Abe will be your end. Regardless of the cheers of some Chinese netizens, they are keyboard warriors and fools who know nothing. Smart people can see at a glance that Abe is dead, and the United States is the biggest beneficiary. The most pitiful is the people of Japan and South Korea. It is lucky to meet leaders such as Moon Jae-in and Abe who are willing to balance between China and the United States. Now that the extremely pro-American politicians of the two countries come to power will inevitably lead to the damage of economic, trade and cultural exchanges with China. Although Asia has some historical contradictions, the current connection is Very close, it is impossible for the United States to give high-end technology to Japan and South Korea. If wise leaders do not come to power, the Japanese and Korean people will eventually become slaves of the United States. Wish forever peace of world.
So sadness news for Japanese people and Om manay padmay huu and ཨོཾ་མ་ནི་པད་མེ་ཧཱུཾ་
REPENT AND TRUST IN JESUS CHRIST OR HELL AWAITS YOU
I wanna Shinzo Abe Will Rule more years R.I.P PM Abe
I'm not a politico, I don't keep up with them from any nation. However I am distressed by knowing someone assassinated  Mr Abe. I don't know much about his politics, but the fact someone would shoot him AFTER he'd stepped down as Prime Minister is pretty low. I hope they find this person, and he/she get all the punishment he/she deserves.
I’m Japanese citizen. He is one of the best leader in Japanese history. We are respect not only for national defensive policy and economy and helping disaster victims, but also cute reaction for citizen. It’s heartbreaking and shocking…
这件事的发生能表明当今世界存在大疯子、大恶人。
Big brother did this learn this
He was a great leader, the event was totally unexpected, and it was wrong choice of place for a rally. Security officials should have shot back at the culprits arms or legs when the first shot was fired. This is a tragic event for japan. R.I.P Mr Abe.

Evil people.. cruel world. Condolences to the family and people of Japan
I am ashamed that Koreans are celabrating this. Deep anger and patience for me to bear and shocking sadness and peace for one of clear politician abe. 삼가 고인의 명복을 빕니다.
😭😭😭😭😭🇧🇩
😭😭😭😭😭😥😓😥😭😭😭
Too much Sorry! !!!! His life is much more than anything. The whole world is choked. Abe rest in peace. South Sudan Aweil boy
Why Abe shinzo take care of security guard 😔
I feel like the Japan's spine has been broken. I can't think of anything.  Mr. Abe's greatness is too huge for someone like me to speak. I can't honestly pray for his soul easily now. I want him to come back to life.
As a Japanese, this was really shocking and heartbreaking. Even though he had some few affair, he dedicated himself to this public and Japan. And this makes me really sad… Rest in peace🍀お悔やみ申し上げます
*Don't know the actual reason behind his assassination, but that obnoxious assassin should have not took his life. Whatever the reason may be there are ways and means to solve the differences/issues. But taking someone's life is an act of cowardice. Befitting punishment should be awarded to culprit for this heinous crime. One selfish man bringing down so much of a prestigious nation like Japan. Bodyguards were also too far apart from him, very poor security compared to other trained securities. It greatly lowers the Japanese security system. So mournful.😰😰😪 Asian have lost a tall leader. My deepest condolences to the bereaved family members and the people of Japan who are in trying time. RIP💐 From Nagaland INDIA* 🙏🏻
実際に撃たれた瞬間を遠くからですが、見ていました。 あの時の銃声の音を忘れることはないです。 ご冥福をお祈りします。
Bet big brother did it. Just like John and MLK & Bobby
Globalist elite vs this good nationalist. Wake up. Stay free.

Only the good die young
WE ARE VERY VERY SAD & DISTURBED SEEING THIS. . . . . . . .  DEAR MR. ABE, U R CLOSE OUR HEARTS OF ALL INDIANS. . . . . . .U WILL ALWAYS CLOSE TO OUT HEARTS . . . . FOREVER. . . .  LOVE YOU, SIR 🙏😥  INDIA❤JAPAN
Unfortunately, we live in a world where 99.9999999% of the population will never know what exactly happened, but a very few who orchestrated it will know in secret. Yes, sometimes these acts are random fanatics, but I believe the vast majority of things that appear random or unexplained on the news, all have real intent and real orchestration behind them. We'll never know. It's just the state of information and news in the modern age.
Sad for the good people, great lost for international stages !
Shame it wasn't Biden
I can't believe this thing happened in Japan.
This is so shocking, I just couldn't believe it even though I'm seeing it. He always looked so peaceful, RIP PM🙏🏾
Shinzo Abe was corrupt. Maybe didn't deserve this, but I would not have liked to see him back in Parliament.
Condolences 🌹our great friend Leader of Japan Former PM  Legant Pathma Bhushan Mr Shinzo Abe 🙏 Big loss of Japan people this moments. 🌹
Japan 😫😫😫😫💔💔💔
The security assigned to protect him will all but disappear socially. The Japanese do not take such a breach lightly. To let their guard down and let some random stranger get that close to him is so un-Japanese. Every one responsible for his safety, even at the highest level will pay a price, for this,  even their families. It's not unfathomable that some will even commit sepuku, because this, in their eyes, is so dishonorable, and you'll never hear about it.
It’s pity not many people knew about this evil minded ex PM who supports a militarism n WW2 Japanese war crimes n criminals
Ever heard of Samurai?...idiots...LOL
this was a jaw drop! 🤯
安倍元首相が“元首相”という肩書きであることから警備が首相時代よりも手薄だった。日本が銃社会でないことも影響して、SPの動きが鈍かったのも確かです。日本のSPは銃撃ではなく、刃物への備えをしているケースが多いです。安倍元首相の死は日本国内でも大きな衝撃として広がっています。7月10日に参議院選挙を控えていることから、7月8日に安倍元首相が銃撃された翌日には、各候補者や政党が日本各地で演説を行っています。 なぜ演説を中止にしないかというと、暴力に屈しない民主主義国家としての誉をすべての候補者が持っているからです。  暗殺の影響で、安倍元首相が所属していた政権与党である自民党への票が増加する懸念があります。今の日本は少子高齢化が加速し、若者がいくら投票を行っても、老人の数には敵いません。そして多くの老人は未だに自民党を応援しています。  日本が先進国の時代は過去のものになりました。物価が上がり、賃金が増えないスタグフレーションが起こりかけています。また中国、韓国、朝鮮、アメリカ、ロシアとの関わりから、特に中国からの静かな侵攻が進んでいます。ゴルフ場という名目で中国系企業に土地を買い上げられ、その施設は中国人専用。つまり日本の土地なのに日本人が入れないエリアがあります。水道事業の民営化が進み、外資に国のライフラインが奪われつつあります。安倍元首相は国のために戦いました。しかしずっとではありません。首相として活躍している間に、人が変わりました。それを魔界転生と呼んでいます。  安倍元首相に追討の意を表す。しかし、自民党には投票したくありません。
Well that dont look good for his security team does it....
It's party time China it is celebrating his death.
REPENT! GOD'S JUDGEMENT IS COMING
I just can believe this happened in Japan
no one is inmune of violence. RIP
RIP💐💐
The man with dignity die with dignity, you will be miss not only from Japan but from around the world too RIP MR ABE🙏
This is so sad.
persiden dan perdamentri di jaga sangat ketat untuk meng hidari dari hal2 yg tidak di inginkan....seperti penembakan oleh orang2 yg tidak bertanggung jawab..
read my name
Shooting Politicians like this is FIRST in Japan. Politicians doe not need securities because this Japan is basically peaceful country.
When America is deeply saddened by the death of a Politician, you know he must’ve been a very good man
Such a painful sad tragedy. Even if you really dislike and disagree with someone or people- that doesn’t mean to go beyond that by committing an act of hate and violence. I am praying for the people of Japan and Ukraine 🇯🇵❤️🇺🇦
America's deadly influence of gun-cowards and psychos just keeps growing.... RIP, Mr. Abe, you were a good man and leader.
Tragic. Heartbreaking. Shattering.
Sorry for Japan. Mr. shinzo Abe was a good leader.
People in China are celebrating this!
I suspect...rogue Intel agents of the deepstate
Death note
Why not dan andrews
Abraham Lincoln faced the same fate R.I.P PM Abe😔
In the PH those who are assasinated were public officials who have illegal activities. I do not understand why Abe a very good man was assasinated?
Uff it's like Kennedy.
China did it or Russia either want to take over Japan
Nowhere is safe from evil. I am American and lived in Japan and that's one of my favorite places I've been. Genuinely nice people as a whole. Prayers to Japan.
Chinese people called Japanese assassins it's heroes! Maybe he is really a hero! Dare to rebel against politicians with practical actions!
Rip
Sadly, this adds oppositional context to gun reforms in both Canada and the United States, proving that no amount of restrictions will solve the problem. Shinzo Abe was shot, but not by a gun, rather an "electronic improvised cannon". In the absence of a gun, the invention of lethality persists all the same, so instead, we should re-invent the gun as the invention of survivability.   Much like the automobile, a gas can on wheels was certifiably deadly to crash into at any speed, but its utility became a societal necessity. So to improve upon it, was added seat belts, air bags, crumple zones, speed limits, electric batteries, self-driving software, that now it's almost impossible to crash in it nor receive any harm by it!  The gun as it is today, is gunpowder on a hair trigger, but by adding a fingerprint scanner has upgraded its safety as a societal utility, that the invention of rubber bullets, taser rounds, WiFi reception, passwords, not only is pure improvement, but can limit what a gun can and cannot do in any place for any reason, if we will it to be improved?  Otherwise, society would still be a flaming crash, no matter how carefully we tried to drive it forward. Shinzo Abe proved that invention is the necessity, but we must embrace it for its survivability.

He was a good leader to the Japanese people, however the statement is true that we cannot please everyone.  Justice may prevail. RIP PM Abe

Genuinely broken by this. Such a nice man who dedicated his existence to public service. Absolutely didn’t deserve this.
This is politics, in this people are ready to kill their father
Dammmm. China gangsta as hell
A guy in his position was eliminated by movers and shakers behind the scenes. I’m wondering who. I don’t know enough about Far East politics to know.
*dw2h*  Disaster waiting to happen
Job well done，china is happy，look at weibo，everyone is happy
very sad ,....
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                                                               /,., .,  ,/  ., /,.  ,/. /.,  /,.
How much hatred do you have in your heart to go make a glock and then proceed to shoot someone with it
Praying 🙏 for him & family
Қаза қайырлы болсын, сене алар емеспін😢
Woulda been better if it was his Russian friend
LOL
It's just so sad.my prayers are with his family.
Shinzo Abe was the most shameless biggest PUPPET STOOGE LAP DOG 🐕🦮🐩 of the fascist neo-imperialist U.S 👿.
I believe China SNUFFED HIM OUT!!  They Paid someone to kill him, Because He Spoke The Truth!! and China Is Evil, Cruel, and Nasty, Cold and Cunning Like A Snake... THE UNITED NATION AND EUOPEAN UNION SHOULD FIND OUT WHO PAID THIS MAN TO KILL Shinzo Abe, LOOK AT CHINA FIRST
Wouldn’t be surprised if it was FSB Russian version of FBI.
Hopefully the Japanes Justice System will have some Ancient Japanese Capital Punishment to use for this particular assassin and not just the typical long rope hanging like used for their death row prisoners. Something Like The Shogunate: Boiling To Death. Sawing Off Various Parts. Cutting The Person In Half.
I truly cannot believe in my eyes or my ears that such a tragedy which matches that of Lincoln's and JFK's assassination could repeat again somewhere in the world in some way, even in a country that has abstained from any form of violence against foreigners or to its own people such as Japan. As a representative of the Vietnamese people as a whole, I send to the citizens of Japan both local and abroad, particularly to Shinzō Abe's family and relatives, my most heartfelt mourning over the passing away of such a great national icon like him.   This day is one that must be remembered in the minds of humanity, for although the world lost a man of utmost importance because of conflict, it means an incentive for us people to begin a race to ultimately eradicate deleterious hostility, whether in everyday affairs or cultural conflicts or in international dissension. No altercation should finish with the injury or death of any party involved, we've had enough problems managing internal felonies and nonphysical crimes (intellectual, oral,...etc) in recent times already, we do not deserve to live through an assassination attempt and cope with it too.  P.S.: Unfortunately can't please everyone in the world, notably the occidentals down in this video's comment section who still, after all those years of the recent decades, grouse over past events that are altogether none of their businesses to speak out loud about; as if they enjoy thinking of living antiquatedly so much so that their thought progress downright beclouds their present welfare and rationality. Plus, it is probable that these complainers have some form of judgmental complex that makes them persevere in their efforts to exploit flaw after flaw in someone, even after the person's death they would not stop in their accusations and pay respectful condolences. Either through unmitigated will, or jealousy for not being more esteemed and successful, or ignoble behavior of wanting to see leaders and former leaders getting murdered to assuage their rebellious nature that this unneeded backbiting is happening. Stereotypical of hyperactive people whose overflown outpouring of opinionated detractions leaves them always quarrelsome with an insufficiency of logic and empathy.
This is America doing !
Karma is a you know what. Hey, bury him next to all the war criminals he worships in Yakusuni shrine.
A warmonger, rest in shit!
This world is dangerous  place for innocent people  protect your self  don't depend on security
I woke up to this news and i honestly gasped. Such a great leader killed in a peaceful country. RIP Abe. From Texas
THIS IS INSANE
So so sad PM Abe was so respected globally and seemed a kind, polite gentleman.  My thoughts with Mr Abe’s family and to all Japanese people. 🇯🇵
This is horrible. I’ve live in Japan  for over 8 yrs of life and recently left there in June ‘22. You never this type of violence in such a peaceful country. #RIPAbe-San
Behind this assassination , no doubt,  there is foreign powers. China is suspected.
Rip PM ABE-san.❤️  I respect how Japan is not giving the shooter any fame. US take notes!
We lost a critical person for Japan. I feel Japan's equilibrium will collapse...RIP Abe san
It was a sad day for me and all the other people who are Japanese like me
Please accept deepest condolences to his family & Japan from sri lanka . Japan is being a very good friend to Sri Lanka on every difficult times. This is a very big lost to all world!
Very shocking to hear such from such a peaceful country like Japan . May God strengthen his family and the Japanese people. RIP Mr Abe
all the intel in him died also, fukushima sabotage secrets. John 5:28 Daniel 12:2  Jesus will call him out of sleep of death in the future so he can hear the glad tidings Luke 2:10 that eventually all people shall hear
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️Nooo🙏🏾🥲♥️♥️♥️♥️I hope someone catch the killer🙏🏾.
安倍元首相が極右だと言ってる人がいるけど、その基準を世界の大統領や首相に当てはめたらほとんどが極右になると思う。 彼は中国やロシアとの関係改善にも努めてたから極右なんかじゃない。世界は中国共産党のプロパガンダにいつまで騙され続けるのか。
B nice if they get the turd.
Rest In Peace, sir.
Peaceful country compared to what? If Japan was that peaceful why do people in Japan killed themself at an alarming rate?
this is so shocking, heartfelt condolences may his soul rip
Joe wanted a regian change!?
Act of Brutality… Not Act of Terror🤔
It was a hit by the puppet! Shady! Think about it he was a treat to the bad guys! So sad! Laptop connection? The Ukraine leadership!
Deepest Condolence to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe... what has happened in Japan... Shinzo Abe is a nice guy... the security in-charge very weak... a lot of bad guys in Japan
Or you are a complete American and British puppet or watch your back.
Sayonara Most Honorable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe...Bushido Hinode Tanaka...yours very truly Alfonso Cantu USMC
Why did the man shoot him, what was his reason for it.  R.I.P SHINZO ABE YOU WILL BE MISSED
RIP Shinzo Abe 😩
He was never getting up from that seen some videos taken from a distance and i'd say that was a shotgun from the sound and the smoke
Thanks for showing this, so sad, unreal.  He was a good man!
For all Japanese security, don't take for granted that situation is good, threats are still there. So sad to hear the tragic demise of Mr. Shinzo Abe, my sympathy and condolences to the family. Rest in peace, former Japan Prime Minister.
He did somthing wrong he died then what to do with that😏
After all this futility in life, I decided to focus on my Christian obligation to God... A reading from Eclesiastes  “The greatest futility!” says the congregator, The greatest futility! Everything is futile!    What does a person gain from all his hard work At which he toils under the sun? The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole obligation of man" Eclesiastes 1:2 , 12:13,14
pity it didn't happen to putin
Shenzo Abe sobiq Yapon bosh vaziriga nima qilishibdi BBS Uzbek hizmati Uzbek tilida yoyinlamayapti chiqarmaydi
Why God is so unfair the one should die Putin is still alive?
SO SAD! I DON'T KNOW WHY THE PRIME MINISTER DID NOT HAVE SECURITY!
Heartbreaking! My condolences to his family & to the people of Japan!
Awful news, especially in such a safe country. Abe was a strong leader and a friend of the West.
So sad!!  My heartfelt condolences to The People of Japan and to  Mr. Abe's Family
Heartbreaking news !
Most countries and people around the world are shocked and mourning, only some Chinese people are celebrating, even happier than when they got married. What kind of country can brainwash such people? (Check out the Translation Campaign.)
samurai
Rest easy Sir! Sad to hear of so much hate and evil. 🙏
I have a bad feeling that something worse is gonna happen to Japan
Some would say this type of violence is a very rare occurrence in Japan.
So sad
Handmade shotgun dayum...
Japanese are also celebrating, western media once again trying to fool innocent people lmao.
R.I.P
...all the while thought he retired quietly in remote areas away fr the hustle & bustle of politics... R.I.P. Sir we dearly love you 🌼...
El mundo está muy violento  por eso ocurren en cualquier país acontecimientos lamentables como este descanse en paz Shinzo Abe
Two things here: despite having what are probably the most extensive gun control measures in place in Japan, a former head of state was killed with a homemade shotgun. This tells me that no amount of gun control or even an all-out ban of all guns in the United States would prevent gun violence.
What happens if world war 3 happens? Well, you have to fight your own country and have to execute your traitor people where you came from. The mess up part is... lawless law. they don't care about law. Just look at Georgia Guidestone. world war 3 is scary.
So sad!!
RIP
Meanwhile in China, everyone are celebrating. Tons of restaurants in China are offering "buy one get one free to celebrate Abe's death." What a disgusting country and people.
Imagine WORLD WAR 3 started.... just like treaty of versailles and Franz Ferdinand assassination.
Just like Zelensky happy to destroy Ukraine (he's actually Jewish originally) and the Ukrainian people's lives, rather than engage in Peace Talks with Putin....all the  ministers who have put themselves forward hoping to be Next  British Prime Minister  ALL. OF THESE CHARACTERS also couldn't care less about us British people or the UK  including Liz Truss. All of these personalities who are  now seeking this new power are all happy to see Britain bite the dust.So I ask us British citizens  to keep More than a watchful eye on who comes up next. None of these people are Good  nor do they have OUR People's best interests at heart. Far from it. .So watch out.
What a GREAT PM he was, so well respected. R.I.P. Sir.
This is an eye opener to the world we are living in
Memo to current American Lawmakers:Please ENHANCE  your SECURITY... and watch your BACKS!!!.. These are TROUBLING TIMES!!! May God help us all.
Yakuza?!
Shinzo Abe was much respected and loved in  Bangladesh. We knew him as the country's true friend. Today Bangladesh is observing a one-day state mourning for him. You will be missed a lot by us Abe...
I think Shinzo Abe's body is now in a Police Morgue's metal freezer awaiting autopsy.
who wrote this stupid ass title. he was assassinated, he had no vital signs on scene. even if he did die in the hospital, it would still be considered an assassination BBC
The Samurai learned how to use guns from the West.
RIP,hope no violence anymore.love and respect from China.
Biden is probably next 💀 People here in America really fine Biden and Kamala absolutely abhorrent! This administration isn’t Trumps administration. It has been taken from Trump. And now the consequences that the Americans are paying are massive!
海外では公正に安倍さんのことを評価してくれていた。日本のメディアが悪く煽った責任は大きい。
Your legacy will never be forgotten 🙂
No one did anything to defend him after the first shot no one.
本当にこのニュースを知った時ショックでした。安倍晋三元総理は国内外でとても上手く政治を行い、誰からも愛されていました。本当に悲しい。 銃撃事件は許せない
Abe was the only politician I liked. Make jokes in parliament and play the piano on his own YouTube channel.I'm proud as a Japanese🕊
IT's kicking off !
China is celebrating it
Rest In Peace🌷
So sad sorry in peace rest. Condolences him family's sad.
Truly sad... I pray for Abe, his family and the people of Japan
*_Why are you tainting his image with Trump? Shinzo Abe-san deserves more respect. America's last president encouraged violence which may have contributed to the present tragedy._*
First I've heard about this. If it was some precious Black with a rap sheet a mile long getting shot by Police after 7,000 times being told to resist, it would be on the U.S media every day for the next 10 years..
We heard about Chinese and Russian war ships near the Japanese islands. And now this assassination of a great leader of Japan. 🇯🇵🗾
وحسب قانون ربنا العظيم من قتل مؤمن متعمد فهو في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا وأطالب من الأصدقاء اليابانيين حكومه بانزال أشد العقوبات عليه كما أشار إليه الراحل العظيم السيد شينزو ابي
🥲
It happened in Yamato-Saidaiji, a suburb of Nara City.  I lived in Saidaiji for 12 years.  You can even see the first apartment building I lived in in some of the shots.  My kids were born a block from there and the first school I taught in was across the street.  It was right in front of the Kintetsu Railways station that was my home station.  The Starbucks you see in the background of many of the pictures was one of the places my friends and I would often meet and whenever I walked by (several times a day) I'd always look to see which of my friends was there.  Seeing something this infamous happen in what used to be home to me is mind blowing.  My heart goes out to my friends and former neighbors because this must be truly shattering for them.  Japanese culture is collectivist rather than individualistic like many western societies, so it can be difficult for westerners to fathom the sense of collective guilt a Japanese community feels when one of it's members commits an atrocity of this magnitude, even if it seems unwarranted.  Most Japanese nationals feel a sense of pride, and rightly so, for having one of the safest societies on the planet.    This happening in Nara is a tragic irony.  Abe Shinzo was the first stable prime minister after a period of instability at the top level of the national government.  Nara was the first permanent capitol of Japan.  You can actually see one of the reconstructed buildings from the Heijokyo palace site at the end of the street where Mr. Abe was shot.  One of the reasons the capitol moved around in antiquity was before the arrival of Buddhism, people felt that a place was spiritually tainted if someone died there, and the more influential the person was, the darker the shadow.  Nara was the first place Buddhism really took off in Japan and when the capitol finally did move to Heiankyo (Kyoto) it was more for separating religion and government.  They wanted to move the imperial court farther away from the influence of some of the larger religious institutions in Nara like Todaiji temple.    I'm sorry for writing a book in the comments.  I guess I'm still trying to get my head around it and this is one of the ways I'm dealing with it.  My kids grew up mostly during his tenure and his face is what pops into their minds when they hear the phrase 'prime minister.'  I still have to go there semi-regularly so my kids can visit their family there.  I know when I inevitably pass that spot, I'll feel a hollow icy chill followed by a sense of reverence for Abe-san and wonder why fate so often takes away the best among us prematurely.
Left-Marxist  are  very happy right now. Boris Johnson stepped down and Trump has basically been  in a Which Trail for 6 years. And now this.
Japan is lost a great hope man by evil  man.
why was he shot,did they get the person.?😵
Why is this not an assassination ?
This is actually very extremely heartbreaking for the people of Japan, a great person and a great leader. My condolences, my prayers, and my respect for the Japanese. 🇯🇵🗾🤕🤔🇯🇵🎎✝️🇺🇲🇯🇵🙏🇯🇵
Watch gun nuts use this as an example of why gun restrictions don’t work.
With his death, the only bridge between Japan and Russia was gone. What this means.
this bitch's news is rejoiced all over the world
What a weak security team. The guy shoot twice!!!
I will never forget the day he came to our fundraisings on Tokyo streets. We talked, shook hands, etc. RIP Abe san, and condolences to your family🙏
That assassin will be a hero in prison.
I never dreamed that it would happen to Abe, who served as prime minister for the longest time in a peaceful country with little gun violence.sad
Watching the news here in Tokyo - the apartment building the shooter lived in was just evacuated as investigators found a number of large explosives in his apartment.
Japan should ban all materials to make pistols.
I'm still in disbelief. I was in tears over his brutal death. Such a reasonable man who not only empowered his country but also inspired and helped the world. Arigato Abe San.
Imagine having some of the strictest firearms laws in the world and still getting murdered in public with a pistol ...
Rest in peace 😥😥
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!  Have a blessed day, everyone!! ❤
It’s disgusting to see BBC can’t stop with it’s negative china propaganda in this sad and unfortunate event
Very sad news 😭
So sad.  A man who dedicated his life to peace and cosmopolitanism as an integral part of the Military Industrial Complex.
Devastating. Such a good man, willing to put a finger on the nose/in the eye of the NWO!!! This was/is a great man and knew the game plan. With Trump it was a dynamic connection. Powerful for the USA and Japan, along with India. This is a TRAVESTY! No accident of course, clearly an assassination. Too bad they don't do this to Biden and his Chinese buddies!
This is becoming an international phenomena. In a place where getting a firearm is so difficult, how did he die? A gun. But the gun on it’s own can’t commit a crime, it’s user can. People are the problem in these gun control arguments, not an inanimate object.
How does a piece of dog crap like Donald trump or Vladimir putin survive and a geat man like shinzo Abe gets taken from us?
There must be some reasons the man committed this tragedy, but no good reason to kill someone. I am not a big fan of Abe san, but the fact is there: he served the position the longest in all Japanese history. I as a Japanese, I am full of respect and appreciation to all his contribution to every one of us. RIP Mr. Prime Minister.
Very sad for his family & the Japanese people
friends dont let their friends presidents son smoke crack......
It's heartbreaking incident.
Great lost, deepest condolence, God bless Japan ❤️
Probably planned by the world leaders   honestly
Pure evil !!!! Evil does not obey laws !!!!
Here in Japan, there is usually zero danger from the people walking around these politicians making speeches. Security is based upon expectations. In the USA, you would expect a lot of people to have weapons and violent intentions. Not so, here. The political extremists number far less than 1%, compared to ~40% of the USA's adults being willing to use violence to solve political issues.
Its a sad rainy day for japan 😔
He wasn’t shot AT during a speech, he was shot during a speech……
Very sad
Sucks to suck, right-wing war crimes deniers!!!
How long till BBC blacks comment #3HongKong
RIP SHINZO ABE 🕊🕊
it really heartbreak,he is really a good leader in this world ,he did grate job and live simple life comparing to many dictators,he should not get this treated,my deepest condolences goes to the family and friends of Mr shinzo Abe
So Destroying your Country's Finances is NOT a good idea?
Prayers 🙏🇯🇵🇬🇧
This mimics the 90s movie: In the line of fire. A homemade plastic gun was used to assassinate the head of state.
God Bless Shinzo Abe and his family. God bless Japan during this time. Shinzo Abe was Japan’s longest serving Leader, a great leader and wonderful man. May he forever Rest In Peace.
Boris Johnson gone abe gone in a 24 hr period .! What something is afoot? I guess we will know soon.
HOPE  IN Love 🙏🇯🇵 🙏 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.  Saved from the punishment of sin.  I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!  No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc...  offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ.  We must be willing to turn from sin and to believe the Gospel, Mark 1:15 to receive Jesus forgiveness.  He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube. Matthew, Acts, Luke, John    💜👑✝️📖nkjv 🧎‍♂️ 🙏🙂🇺🇸
Rest In Peace.
Abe didn't deserve to go out like this.
He was truly a good man, he didn't deserve that. So senseless
တော်တဲ့သူတိုင်း --- လုပ်ကျံ သတ်ဖြတ်ခံရတယ်နော်" သူ့သဘာ၀,တစ်ခုလိုပေါ့။ ဒါကြောင့် --- မတော်စေနဲ့ , တော်ယုံသင့်ယုံဆိုရပြီး "
Should be cautious , beware all the time .  His security doesn’t have check points , good protection
This is not Kawaii :'3
I bet my balls that US Gov. is involved on it.
The whole world is still in shock about the  untimely passing of former Prime minister Shinzo Abe. My  heartfelt condolences goes to the family and people of Japan.  RIP Hon Shinzo Abe.
Very sad that he succumbed to violence maybe because of his ties with Putin.  Keeping the violence down by making policies that country is gun free is amazing.  iThe rest of the world could learn from Japan.  I agree in strengthening your army, but they and the police are the only ones that require a gun and this country really reflects how important these policies are, sad he died in that way
2:39 - "yeah"... the host is so desensitized
故郷である日本でこんなことが起こるなんて、信じられないです。 政策だけでなく、人柄が素晴らしく、多くの方から愛された方でした。 ご冥福をお祈りいたします。  We must not allow the violence not only in Japan but around the world. We need to fight for the democracy with verbal tools.  And I appreciate many people from out side of Japan are sorry for his death and this devastating situation. He was a humorous guy and cherished the Japanese nation so much.  My deepest condolences to him and his family. Rest in peace, our hero.
Can I get a full description of the news?
https://youtu.be/qgDeE8PlYy8 ❤
Shocking, the least county I expect to do something like this. Normally I would see such problem happen in household but this is shocking, to think a common Japanese folk would do that.
The dishonest Abe. Honest Abe freed the slaves. Dishonest Abe denied war crimes. Both shot though. One will go down in history as a great man. The other not so much.
💔
In China, they say that the murderer who killed the former Japanese Prime Minister is a hero! We hope that more heroes can stand up and stop Putin!
😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤ richtig so Politiker 🎉
The world leaders of the democratic-fascist bloc were quick to respond with ardent indignation due to...for whom the bell tolls...
Lmao crazy liberal insurrectionist
Weeb did it
I don't still believe he is dead
好似，开香槟喽
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
Actually,to a Chinese,he is complicated,in one hand,he disagreed with the crime of Japanese army,in other hand,he tried to repair the relation with China.There’s no doubt that he was a good prime minister, but with the results of killing by an assassin,I should be pitiful.
2:20  This is wrong information.  The correspondent said that the suspect had disagreements with Mr. Abe's policy, but here in Japan it is reported the suspect saying that he did not commit the crime out of resentment towards Mr. Abe's political beliefs.   Added:  It's been clarified that the suspect committed the crime because he thought Mr. Abe supported a certain religious group which destroyed the life of the suspect.
Lots of Chinese netizens were celebrating his death, that makes me sick 🤬
No doubt Japan’s dictatorship neighbor is behind this
RIP 🌻Very sad news indeed
I'm a Japanese high school student.It was during the school festival that I learned of this disastrous news.When everyone heard this news, it hurt my heart.This news has become a major event in history.
Mental illness knows no race, assasin obviously a psycho case, probably with some help or knowledge how to assemble a gun
nato likely killed him lol
Killed by USA 🇺🇸 💩
Sure that wasn't political.
私は、このニュースを耳にした時、とてもショックを受け、とても悲しかったです  When I heard the news, I was very shocked and very sad.
we lost truly globalized leader
Omg 😱 that is terrible 😢
Government by assassination was once a thing in Japan in the 1920's and 30's but this is certainly different.
Gun control at its finest.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Don’t Care     Japan has huge inflation, economy is not good & nuclear issue   This guy was an idiot
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
world is evil.. rest in peace
Luke 12:19-21  Then I will say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be merry!” ’  But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will own what you have accumulated?’ This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”  No one knows the hour of their death, I am sure Mr. Abe didn't expect or want to die. Please Please, repent, trust God's plan in salvation through the death, burial, and resurrection of his only begotten son,  the Lord Jesus, the Christ, "the lamb of God, the one who takes away the sins of the world".  Repent, turn from sin, get baptized, and believe in Jesus's finished work on the cross that atoned for all your sins and mine, my regret and sorrow for his family and I hope he was a believer, otherwise it's too late for Mr. Abe, and his soul is now suffering in hell.
News of assassination from  an Asian country considered to be one of the most peaceful politically, is really shocking. RIP PM Abe.
NICE.  MAN.  SO. SORRY  FROM. MINNESOTA
Deepest condolences to the Abe family and the Government and Citizens of Japan!  May his soul rest in peace!   Wondering if former prime ministers are protected by the equivalent secret service as in the US?  Why security forces?  Where were these forces?  Why was  the attacker allowed to go behind him?  Where was the Japanese equivalent of the secret service?  So sad😢😢😢
why someone wanted to kill him? what's the motive?
Wait. I thought guns were illegal in Japan? BTW, don't quote me on this, but I believe the largest mass killing in Japan's history didn't involve a gun a t all. Please feel to look it up yourself.
I’m Japanese and I thought he died because Japan is such a safe country.  I watched there was a few seconds between the first shot and the second shot which hurt him fatally in the moment of shootings.  No one moved quickly just after the first shooting heard.  His followers and security guards should have be more cautious…it’s indescribably sad.
Sad day…
It just goes to show that a person who is intending to kill will use anything to make a device! Steel, duct  tape, wood, Gun powder, lead, and skill a gun can be made to kill! Gun free countries, gun free zones do not apply to criminals! Take away all the guns and still some criminal gets his job to kill done!
An extreme nationalist gone.  Xi, Kim and Putin left.
We must strive to eliminate the evil in this our most precious world and start acting like God's children. Violence of any kind is unacceptable. Peace and love is the world we will create moving forward
I don't know Japanese politics but I remember he was always calm and seemed like a good leader. Peace to him and his family.
So how was a man even allowed to get close enough to shoot him? Where was his security team? This makes no sense especially if it could have been prevented.

😱Unusual this girl was found having sex in church with pastorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHlnjLXCZXc
So a few American pussie’s are now in Japan!RIP you poor soul ~ maybe in the next life you will recognize EVIL AS EVIL !
Money is nice. But power is way more fun. Don’t worry. Be happy.
Why? Why ? why? Rip shinzo Abe
Buh bye
W
Man, if only it was Xi.
Great leader he will be missed
American lost two puppets this week bad month for them🤡🤡🤡
This was the very first thumbnail I see upon browsing youtube and I still can't get over the title. Shocked.
The assassination was politically motivated. Dude built his own homemade gun, shot at the former Prim Minister then stood there until the security and police arrested him.
별로 가슴은 안아프네요
❤😢
😱Unusual this girl was found having sex in church with pastorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHlnjLXCZXc
I never really knew about this man can somebody tell me why he was so important to Japan?
Damn i thought this was fake news when i first saw it. Rip shinzo. Always loved his name
Terrible headline. He didn't die cause he was shot at; he died cause he was shot.
Finding out it was the Serbians WW3: ah shit, here we go again.
The world has always been good. There's just less in it
This is so sad. God help help his family.
All these fakes saying their shocked and can't believe it , let's be honest you're only jumping on the hype train cos everyone is talking about it. Tomorrow you are not bothered again.
are you sure this AINT the work of some COVERT OPERATION led by. usa and C-  I+ A and  even  James Bond SECRET majesty service,,, THE  Japanese Prime minister wanted to REARM JAPAN and that's a BIG NO NO NO for the USA since they CONQUER JAPAN  and blew 2 ATOMIC BOMBS.  and a CONDITION OF JAPAN SURRENDEER JAPAN would not be able to REARM and USA would not like that.. just saying..
My condolences goes out to Mr. Abe's family and the Japanese people.
Wow was the shooter Vaccinated?
My condolences to the Shinzo family. What a horrifying shock for this family and the nation to suffer through. Lifting up prayers for family and nation. Very sad.
He was murdered
Rest in peace my friend.
Politics... 🙃
I thought Japan has gun control??? Oopse!
bbc anchor should take a nap zzz
#Flint #MI thooooooooooo
It's like John Lennon all over again  who shot him
NANI???!!!
This is heartbreaking. He was a good man always did what he thought was best for his people.
May he rest in peace; and, may his family, friends, and countrymen find comfort in their sorrow and loss. What a horrible thing to happen for Japan. The assassination of a leader - even a former one, even those who are unpopular - is overwhelmingly shocking for their nation. From the other side of the Pacific Rim, we are thinking of you, grieving with you, and praying for you.
Americas gun violence has visited beautiful Japan.Only 10 gun deaths last year in Japan.So sorry for you beautiful people.Rest in peace Abe.
What a sad time. This poor man in his Seventies, murdered In cold blood. What he was doing was putting himself forward to represent his county in a election. Most people would be retired long before this age. It saddens me this senseless taking of life. His poor family are devastat at this barrric act. Everything about this smells, and not of roses. If he had came to power had he lived what would this have been ment for Russia. Just courious.✌️ ☘️
We are so sorry.😔😔 He was such a good person. Great loss for Japan.🇹🇷🇯🇵 Turkey is always on the side of Japan🇯🇵🇹🇷
As an earlier native Japanese said as a politician  he wasn’t perfect as none are but as a leader he surely was exemplary. So few great leaders, so few people willing to dedicate their lives to public service, understand duty to their country fellow man and citizens.  The prime minister of New Zealand said when she first came into office Mr Abe had asked how her family pet was doing. That he was so kind to do so.  After all the butchery in these times, this has really hit me hard.
So sad his passing 😌😢
ayyy the phantom thief stealing hearts with the shotgun... too soon?
安倍晋三元総理暗殺されましたが 警備体制が明らかに、おかしい。 犯人にどうぞ、撃って下さいと言ってる様な もの。
This is extremely shocking, how could this happen in a country like Japan? Killed in such a rare method...and Japanese people are not even radically political like we are here in the west, this doesn't feel real...
It would be really awful if this happened in the UK..
I thought they didn't have guns allowed. The US wants to ban them but look how useless banning them is.
Blessings to your family of Japan and all our brothers and sisters 🙏
Bruh moment 🙏
:(  Aww man this is bad. Japan. O_o;
BBC doesn't explain the  possible motives  for  murder .
i was broken when i heard the news, may he rest in peace
Shinzo Abe extended an invitation to the UK to join the CPTPP.  He treated the UK with respect and visited the UK to discuss the future of the UK after Brexit.
Hey IDIOTS at the Title is Wrong… He was assassinated and was KILLED by a gun shot …. Nobody DIED Somebody was KILLED and it was assassination. Get the story correct …
Inside Job
Don’t fuck with me…..why?????
My heart broke for him
If I was the leader of Japan now, I will tie the Killer is the back of the Tank with Robe and drag him in all the Tokyo until his last organs shredded
How far down the list is Putin?
He didn't deserve this, there are way more brutal leaders who are living peacefully
Unbelievable that security wasn't applied there
Shame on the shooter: he brings supreme dishonor to japan.
Has anyone seen the video? did he get shot by a musket? no, I'm not joking. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. This is the strangest gun I have ever seen used and Shinzo after the first shot calmly turns towards the shooter and not a single security guy moved. I gotta say this is the oddest political assassination recorded on video I have ever seen. You will understand if you watch the video.
Why couldn't this be Putin?
R.I.P TO Ex-PM Japan Shinzo Abe😣🙏
Devastated!!!!!! 😥😢☹️😖😞😪😫 My condolences to the Japanese nation , I don't know what words of comfort to offer , but know that even though I am South African I am deeply sorry for your loss. . .😞😢😥☹️😪😫😥😚🇯🇵
Breaking News:  Huge difference between being shot, and shot AT.
Condolences to the family but this dose seem a bit of a targeted hit rather then just some random
ASASSINATED Stop spinning it ffs.
Such a shocking sad news,  my condolences to the family / Japan people 🙏🙏
I'm so sorry that this has happened ... no person should be murdered because of their political standing ...he is a human being
He bankrupted Japan.....
RIP, Shinzo Abe. 😢
I can't believe it, I'm in denial! Not so much as to deny the slavery of comfort women by the Imperial Army but still, shocking none the less
People are acting like murder never happens in Japan…no where is “peaceful”.
RIP Abe it’s my birthday today and now I feel like it’s all bad luck this year and i know he was a good man for Japan so sorry for Japan the whole world knows about this and Japan will remember you for eternity and for history as well
🙏✝Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe😢We all love you and will miss you forever

the world is going to hell in a hand basket. act accordingly.  dont go randomly shooting people because life is too hard.
I have never been to Japan but I have a Japanese friend and I cannot imagine the pain of him and the rest of the Japanese people.
Will you be ready when Jesus Christ returns? If not confess your sins and ask Jesus to come to you. Praise the Most High for his son acting as a sacrificial lamb, so that your sins can be forgiven (KJV Romans 5:6-11). Confess your sins to the Most High (KJV1 John 1:9) and Repent (KJV Acts 3:19) now while you have time before it's too late, Many people in this world will not see tomorrow(KJV Proverbs 27:1).   To repent means you will not do any of the sins you've done in the past. You will be a renewed person. What is sin? Sin is a transgression of the laws of the Most High (KJV 1 John 3:4). Learning the Ten Commandments is a good start (KJV Exodus 20:1-17).
I'm very glad to hear his grandfather miss him. His grandfather is a.WW II Criminal， And he even want to Rebuilt the sprint of world war II. He even sent flowers To the world war II criminal， Has no respect to the Chinese and Korea who suffer a lot. So this news makes me very Exciting！！！ Finally The hell is open The door to him！！！He and his family should. Pardon The man who gave the shot， As their logic.
The catastrophe of the assassination of the Prime Minister in Japan like this is the first event after World War II. Even for us, this event is unacceptable, and the criminal is absolutely unacceptable.
A gun is ultimate test how powerless you are
LORD HAVE MERCY 🥺 🙏 😫.
What do you mean shot at? Shouldn't you be calling it an assassination??
将軍安倍晋三は、日本の軍事力への復帰を予測した真の武士でした。 Shōgun abe shinzō wa, Nihon no gunji-ryoku e no fukki o yosoku shita shin no bushideshita. hk
My respects and condolences to everyone who knew him, he didn't need to go like that and please make sure they other guy who murdered him wasn't a Chinese agent.  Japan, my heart feels sad knowing you lost a statesman you loved.  From Great Britain
Very very heartbreaking  seems corruption  lives  and good is cut down . God needs to punish these ppl
Look at what is happening in the Netherlands with their crazed government. With that type of thing and what tyrant Trudeau was doing etc we have petty tyrants exercising ridiculous levels of micro management, and at the same time our economies are collapsing. It is not hard to see that more "bad things" might be on the cards.
なんでシンガポールやねん！
He was a very good man then immediately after that  she says he  was  supporting  Russia's invasion of Ukraine, so was he good or not
Can you actually believe they think the UK public are that thick ???? Rishi Sunak sat on the bench all the time with Boris & all his perverted mates & he laugh at everything Boris said & agreed with everything he said. He is involved 100% & fully associated with Boris & the term '' Guilt by Association  '' comes to mind. Rishi is a little lying weasle & all them should be prosecuted for bankrupting our beautiful country by giving million pound contracts to their mates & starving & bankrupting every business in the UK while they made millions & partied while everyone was dying & even the Queen sat at her own husbands funeral by herself while Rishi knew very well what they all were up to. The Corruption, lies, fraud & sexual assaults by this man & his friends is unbelievable & very very hard to believe it can happen in 2022 & not one single arrest or prison sentence. There are Police 24hrs on Downing Street & yet they let the parties happen so why didnt they disperse the parties just like they did around the country & give massive fines out ???????? The cheek Rishi Sunak must have shows the ignorance millionaire MP's have to the poor & basically think 65 million people of the uk are totally thick & stupid. Absolutely disgusting at the highest level in the history of politics
This clown equates violets to guns and guns alone. Japan has a huge violet problem. They just use different weapons. This clown doesn’t recognize any type of violets accept gun violets. #WalkingMilgramExperiment (YT Newspeak intentional)
Shinzo Abe supported the  Japanese brutality and genocide on Asian nations during world war two. A truely evil man, got what he deserved.
The Chinese are scared to death of the Japanese! This could possibly be an attack from an outside source!
Nothing lost here......NEXT!🥱
He deserved his day, a War Mongering.
Corrupt politicians in the Philippines deserve it more than Abe
HE WAS SO GOOD.
The Assassin used a DIY shotgun.
HIs grandfather was a Class A war criminal who was not prosecuted because the was useful to the Americans. Had he been responsible for the deaths of Jews in Europe instead of Chinese in Manchuria he would have been likely executed or imprisoned. Instead he was awarded the prime ministership.
Totally upsetting!!! The world is outrageous at the moment.
if only they banned guns.    RIP Shinzo abe, gone way too soon.
You should be using the word assassinated
It's putin..Japan just had a meeting with putin last week..boring then steps down..then pictures of bidens son have circulated..it's all connected..who's gonna be next?..German chancellor?..polish prime minister?..it's putin..
*Public Security Section 9 is gonna be BUSY*
Heartbreaking that we lost an honorable man. bless you Master Shinzo Abe and sending love to your family.
Not know that much of japanese politics. Though always thought of him as the face of Japan. very sad R.I.P. And condolences to his family and Japan
Rest in Peace
唉，备战吧！
Because he was an honest and popular  man the Globalists had to eliminate him…this is an atrocity….something must be done with these outrageous ONE WORLD ORDER lunatics…we can’t lose good people
ahahashahahahahaha
Shameful nobody will live forever
Condolences 🙏
1:20 - ridiculous naive understanding of politics. The current PM of Japan isn't increasing spending because the former PM says so. This report doesn't understand cause and effect.  Much respect to the former PM.
Jay custora from the Philippines a  psychic,predict this to happen a famous president was killed shot while speeches..its happen
Incredibly sad.
Shocking & Devastating
The manipulative white media somehow knew that it would've been nearly an impossible task for it to spin another false anti-black narrative with headlines resembling: 'Blackman Fly's To Japan, Assassinates Former P.M. Shinzo With Violent Act Of Black Anti-Asian Hate'
Steps down to enjoy his latter days and gets shot 😢, RIP.
Probably a school shooter who got lost.
Sad
Is China being pinpointed for this?
Political motivated  RIP 🙏🏿
We all react emotionnally but not questionning why just suddenly. Why at a campaign ? Why did Hé confirm late his arrival? Because Hé was nationalist! Hé wants to change constitution. His position in ukrainien conflit. Dont you see similarity with Kennedys' deaths
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
I am shocked n saddest by the terrific news.Japan is a peaceful country no dout.I deeply condemn this sort of violence. Rest in Peace.  Sending love from🇧🇩
I remember PM Shinzo Abe taking President Obama for a sushi  & Obama saying he just had the best sushi in the world 🍣🍱🍥
I was shocked after when i  heard the news. That should not be happened in Japan. RIP sir.
Shocking. This seldom happens in Japan.  RIP former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
This is one thing that the US should learn from Japan, not the death of former PM Shinzo Abe but what the news anchor said. That this type of violence is very rare and the fact that they used a gun even more so. Japan is the only country that i have the utmost respect for. I might not be into the world of politics but it really saddens me to know that something like this happened. Yes there are crime no matter where you are in the world, however Japan is one of the countries that anyone really can feel safe majority of the time.   Find peace in the afterlife Mr Shinzo Abe.
The Elite are trying to tear all who oppose them down. Its honestly time to take a stand.
BBC are so bought. They really avoided the word 'assassinate' didn't they?!!!
It is memory day we've never forget and also its shame thing japan is only coutry i think to come as join education but when i've heard i sad.
Japan lost a great leader.. one of few Japanese that will protect his homeland from China and Russia.
You mean assassinated?
very sad for Shinzo Abe.. prayers to his family!!!!
I still in shocked after the news... Sincerest condolences...
Where the fuck is the video???? Who cares about what you have to say, show death or shut up
British media report seeing off Boris shaggy without much pity. Many believe that Boris Johnson was hiding behind the problems of Ukraine and hiding the internal problems of the once great Britain.  However, today among the favorites for the post of the new prime minister is Defense Minister Ben Wallace, who is known for his excessive Russophobia. That's just not a problem.  There has never been such a king or other ruler in England who aspired to be friends with Russia. And in general, each of them in fact was not much different from the fascists. Unless they did not have such bloody aspirations as Hitler.  I will give an example on the famous Churchill, whose written works will not be difficult to find.  There was always a huge dislike for other nations in his thoughts. To the Germans, the French, the Spaniards and of course to the Russians. Churchill believed that the British were a kind of superior race that had come into this world to rule others.  Even the Irish and Scots were perceived similarly. In Ireland, Churchill's personality is still very controversial. And it is not accepted to talk about it. Bandera used to be someone like that in Ukraine.  Today, such bold and radical publications as Churchill had are unimaginable, but this does not mean that there is no place for the same beliefs. The British consider themselves Aryans, but have not yet distinguished themselves by acts like the Holocaust. But that's for now. Although, most likely, history is simply silent about this.  © Alexey Gumilev
Banish the murderer to Afghanistan forever so that he can appreciate democracy
何もする気になれない 朝起きても安倍総理のことを考えてしまう 本当に悲しい
Good
The world is changing very quickly, be prepared for the worst.
Russia is responsible we need to destroy  puton
*** My deepest condolences  to the Japanese People and to the Family of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ….Prayers and love from US & Vietnam.
China did it I bet
So very sad. My condolences and deepest sympathy. May he R.I.P. Thoughts and prayers
A deranged communist killed him.
He wasn’t “shot at” like the title says, he was shot multiple times. Poor dude, he seemed like he was a great man and he def didn’t deserve this! The man shot him with some type of home made firearm that was held together by duct tape.
Such an influential leader. Wondering what exactly he did wrong to deserve this😥😥😥...The killer should tell us what Mr Abe did. Rest in peace sir🙏🙏🙏🙏
I so sorry
This hit was most likely a hidden agenda, wont be surprised what happens next.
Oh wow. Political views aside, my condolences to his family and anyone affected.
Murdered by his own party for gaining emotional votes in upcoming elections.
From here in America I can only think (sadly): Monkey see, monkey do, monkey pee all over you.  In other words, i fear our wide-ranging violence on display is spreading through the world
Shot in the back COWARD !! Karma will not miss and GOD will finish
Why can’t Americans do this to our elected officials.
I just have one question, was it the job by someone from Arasaka corporation?
アベ、、、 早すぎるよ。
If I was a politician I wouldn't walk the streets with the people. Because there's too many crazy people out there. This is a really sad story.
I'm crying for Mr. Shinzo Abe. I like him very much. I think he was one of the best P.M. in the Japan. God bless his departed soul. Amen. Salek. Dhaka. Bangladesh.
I can disagree with your ideas, politics without wanting to kill you, RIP, sir...😔🕊
It's a shame that shooter learned it from Americans. This is truly a sad story and not a joke. Our religions are different, but God please be with his family during this time
He was donating 300 crores for northeast at the time of CAA,,, Indian mainland. We are lucky that the mainland got exposed in 2019. We grieve his death 🙏
The history teach us just one thing,that everybody can be killed.. it's a very strange time we are living right now my friends...
So sad 😞 RIP 🙏🏻💝
We would have happily traded him  places with trump. RIP
😡😥
Shocking, shocking, shocking, truly terrible for such a country……is this like a neo-Mishima abhorrence ?
there is nowhere peace anymore
Shocking RIP
I am sad for his  family   That’s terrible to  take the life a any human. He seemed like a decent honourable man
Guess ties with Yakuza isn’t always beneficial
No westerner knows what kind of political family Abe was from. His grandparents and family members of politicians are deeply responsible for WW2. You know see the cover of Japan, but saying don't judge by the cover of book goes to this man and family. I am not sorry.
Very sad news.. Where were the security and intelligence security? Any one is target. No is safe.
Bro, can everybody chill out?! Goddamn!
Facts about ex-PM Shinzo Abe : his father (ex-Japan FM) passed away at 67 y/o too, his grandfather (ex-Japan PM too) was stabbed in 1960.
good riddance......next pitin.
🙏🙏🙏
I mean why can’t y’all do this to trump? 🤣
Shocking news about Mr Abe. May God bless him.
Oh my God... what's happening in Japan???
So very sad. RIP Mr. Shinzo
Russian paid assasin
This means that the peaceful nation was pushed to the breaking point. Politicians should really think about the policy going forward.
World politics*
Never expected something like this happening in Japan.  2022 is looking even worst than the last couple of years...
Imagine that extremely low crime and almost no guns in a country that has the largest city in the world Tokyo.  Guns are no good for a civilized society
This was an organized action, someone is hidden behind that assassination
Still shows Japan is dangerous
This is really sad and crazy that it happened where gun laws are so strict. Just goes to show you laws don't matter to bad people, i don't understand why people don't understand stricter gun laws don't work. CRIMINALS DONT FOLLOW LAWS.
I'm deeply sorry and saddened
Damn Malcom X style
R.I.P.  we need a button that helps out the algorithm, that's not called a 'like' button.   i want to help this news spread, but i don't want to like that someone died.
Nooo, not the politician with the coolest name I've ever heard. Dang.
He's was the Nicest Japanese man ever.A good Dad.A Leader.And he was a great Husband to his wife and children to.Our Prayers.
This is shocking and heartbreaking. Evil is running rampant in the world. He seemed to be a good, kind man.  It's a blow to Japan and the world.
Hopefully biden is next
Wrong country, wrong president.
He was assassinated. Be clear.
😢😢😢
Condolences from Bangladesh 🇧🇩. He was a good person & great ally to Bangladesh..You will be missed Sir!!  🇯🇵 🤝🇧🇩 R. I. P.
Just like JFK, go against the financial plan, end up dead.  China, Russia and India would be very wise to weapon up to protect themselves. USD wants total domination over every continent.
The world lost a great figure and we Tibetans lost a great supporter. May his soul Rest In Peace. Om Mani Padme Hum. ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པ་དྨེ་ཧཱུྃ། ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པ་དྨེ་ཧཱུྃ། ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པ་དྨེ་ཧཱུྃ།
Much respect to japan at this time. A very warm leader who shared wonderful relations with the world.
Rip
It does not matter whether he/she use a gun or not.  If someone wants to kill someone it is do-able no matter how hard it is.  Saving one's life is hard, taking someone's life is easy.
Sick behaviour against a thoroughly decent Man who worked for all in Japan over many Years.  Wrong. Punish the Guilty.
Violence is a sign society has lost human values and respect for each other. Violence is every where in this world. This is not shock whileit is sad we live in this kind of world. We humans are destroying our selves . God help us. Prayers for family
100 bucks the CCP was responsible
How sad.
How sad and shocking.  He certainly didn't deserve such.  Condolences to his family and to Japan - from an American.
We send our true Condolences to his family and friends and to all the people of Japan. Lots of love from INDIA.
Rip in piss
Sad!😢 Japan has loss a monumental man, you can’t please everyone in this old world. Sending thoughts and prayers for his family.🙏🤲❤️ Thank you, Sir Shinzo Abe R.I.P😭
The Chinese are exploding in hysteric cheering over this news. Something to keep in mind in future.
For a country that is so peaceful, this assassination was shocking!
G-d Bless
Yeah, we can guess who the true calprits are behind all this.
Terrible this 😢 RIP
😢
Wow, it was unfortunate the Security failed to protect him. Does the Yakuza have a finger on that or not?
I have a feeling with everything going on that ww3 is extremely close
It's so sad.
It’s a sad thing to hear that Shinzo Abe was assassinated, my heart and condolences to the Japanese people and their country, he wanted to make Japan a more respectful, reliable, and strong moving country for the next generations struggling. In honesty, I would’ve prefer that potato Joe took his place than this incredible man. Rest In Peace Mr. Abe
Chess moves
As you can see, the American influence is strong
He has not died. BBC should learn english. He is murdered.
How can someone celebrate someone being murdered?
The man who neglected or outright glorified the horrendous deeds of militarist-and militarized-Japan of the Second World War, the man who successfully enacted history revisionism policies to the extent that worriedly many Japanese have become genuinely ignorant if not maliciously misinformed of their own past (and thus continues to vote for politicians whose actions are not beneficial to avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past), the man who unnecessarily antagonized and strained relations with the second-most important military power crucial for defense of his country against the communist China, has finally found eternal rest.  I do not condone terrorism, but knowing how many millions of lives-both of his country and others-he has placed at ever-increasing risks of military tensions and wars for his own political and even personal gains, I simply cannot offer any condolences to this infamous man who bolstered the ‘anti-Koreanism’ (basically anti-semitism but against those of Korean ethnicity) movement in his country. I can only hope that the average Japanese people will heed the emperor’s will and continue to choose the path of peace, for remilitarization of Japan with all the history denial and revisionism in addition to one-sided territorial ‘disputes’ will most definitely be the last straw.  East Asia is the ‘nuclear powder keg’ of the world; we do not need another tick toward midnight of human civilization, especially when we have already ticked a few seconds closer to our destruction with the ongoing war.
This is almost unbelievable to have happened in Japan. I'll be interested in finding out if the shooter was acting alone.
He was known for his denial of Japanese WWII crimes, for his ultra nationalistic views, for his constant visits to Yasukuni shrine where he bowed to the ashes of convicted grade A war criminals, his grandfather was a bureaucrat in the japanese colony of Korea. His Abenomics were just another facet of neoliberalism, which sent a lot of people to poverty, he didn't fix the japanese economy, he simply made it easier for the rich to become richer on a sick economy like it is Japan's. the guy didn't deserve to die but I ain't gonna shred a tear for a person who worked for turning back the clock into imperial Japan.
sure the west and europe have to do with it, japan is a key country the west needs for their advanced technology to continue exploit the world with high tech technology..
earth is healing
"He called for Japan to increase military spending" ...... that shows how F-ing stupid he really was !!  More military waste is the last thing the Japanese economy needs ! (better off dead)
God bless his soul
God rest your soul. Shin. Oz.
😢
Easy targets
Britain needs to take notes
Western Japan ??? Do you know your compass readings ??? Journalists 😂
Terrible news…..he was a good man and a decent politician….such sad news… my condolences to his family.
this is terrible. i think he was a kind man... very much strength and condolences to all japanese people.
It’s a shocking news. More shocking is it happened in Japan. Why would people do this to another people. It’s so cruel
Western Japan??? Really??? Don’t you know how to read a map
Abe was a great leader, he will be missed.
The "gun" used was a cobbled, home-made weapon made with duct-tape, pipe, and household chemicals.  We must ban duct-tape, pipes, and chemicals.
evil chyna commies don't like him....uhmm
surprised it doesn't happen more often tbh
Now the one who pays his respects to war criminals will be transformed into a martyr.  Oh, what irony!
It was the Chinese
Russians did it!
RIP  Sir .    What a despicable thing to happen.
I’m in SHOCK!!! Guns are illegal in Japan! We don’t get this lind of violence! Where did the shooter get the gun?! Yakuza?!?!
Possibly a sign from God as things to come 😑 Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe ❤
so sad, the current PM looks devastated.
Great leader he will be missed...R.I.P.
How is tis possible? Its extremely difficult to buy a gun, unless the Yakuza is behind tis or they supplied the gun to the gunman. RIP Abe! This is definitely unheard of in Japan.
Questions remain regardless of outcome
Shinzo Abe was a great leader who stood with Trump.  RIP
he was more than shot at, he was shot
Very bad
Whoever did this Bad Action should be held accountable for his Actions and the full weight of Punishment my condolences To The Family And The Nation of Japan and to all who were his friends
Names will call 📞 just now
OMG!  I thought it was fake news. WTF! The global chess moves. Amazing.
Where was his security
Name will call just now
Maybe Yakuza assassination. Japan Police still investigating.
I thought only Americans had blasters? 🤔
Peaceful my ass. The way they abuse animals is NOT peaceful
This is the most shocking news report I have ever heard. This just does not happen in Japan.
Why always the wrong persons get shot?
They must have lax gun laws in Japan.  How did the criminal obtain a firearm if firearms were illegal?  I don't get it...
Thug gonna thug , criminals can’t always get a gun, idiot.
China did it.
Sad day 😞
China is behind this
I wonder, a former high level personality was not that good protected... i don´t see e g Obama or May speak out loud on a street corner without efficient security...
ccp inspired this hit. Rest in peace. Lost to the world.
If japan is doing this- I hate to say it but Is the world about to be doomed
Very Sad, I liked him as a person and a politician. RIM Mr Abe.
Japan is said to be a very peaceful country.. Now think of the corrupt people and organisations that operate in the uk… Makes you think Doesn’t it??
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
Most saddest news i heard today.... Shinzo Abe's Contribution to world is Great
I'm not political by any stretch but Shinzo Abe was a good guy
2012年 安倍曾經來過香港 就在 金鐘 萬豪酒店 宴會廳 由瑞銀主辦 前英國首相 馬卓安 任司儀 安倍當然講日本 經濟前景 投資機遇等 小弟當時是 日/英 翻譯 不知不覺已10年了
Shot while serving a peacful cause:RIP Mr Abe.😭😭😭😭😭😭
??WHAT??
Globalist pigs kill Abe. The godless CCP must be happy today.   Abe loved his country, and wanted whats best for the people.  That doesn't fit in with the globalist agenda. Freedom lost today.
Who does this help  who did this hurt...?
Rest in peace
He must have been one of the good guys.  The bad ones never get shot, because only bad guys shoot their competition.
What they have no gun controls in Japan?
condolence to Japan💔🙏 he's one of the best leaders I know..
O M  G
Noo.... 😭😭😭😭😭
信じられない。UNBELIEVABLE 😞
Rest in Peace Mr.Shinzo Abe. God  will give us the actual clue for the  cause of death. It will take little time but the truth will come out soon.
VERY SAD DAY IN THE WORLD ,HE WAS GREAT RESPECTFUL LEADER IN THE WORLD.THIS CRIME WAS OUT SIDE JOB.
Investiguen a fondo porque esto me huele mal.
BBC's word "Nationalistic' in reference to Abe's politics sounds very negative and biased.  Abe was a patriotic Japanese statesman who believed freedom and democratic values as universal human ideals and that Communist China is a serious menace to freedom and democracy.
May he rest in peace
R.I.P 🙏
It could have happened to almost any other world leader and I would have cheered
“But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.” ‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭3:1-5‬   When you see how the entire world is becoming lawless and people are just doing everything that is against GOD by following their own desires and ignoring their creator, you can be sure that JESUS is coming back soon.. Repent and live for righteousness that you may escape the coming Judgment of GOD against sin and rebellion
The killer should be sentence to death by frying alive.
The angel of death always on time baby
"dies after being shot at during speech", I'm pretty sure that's called an assassination.
Se me hace raro esto,me huele Mal.
I lived in this incredible country for 6 years and it was the most peaceful place. I know there is no 'safe' place in this world, but the only concern I had, was an earthquake.  Of course, like a true coward, he shot him in the back. My deep concern when I read this horrible news was, 'oh God, I hope they're not copying our new American 'norm.' My heart hurts for the Nihon-Koku and it's people. Moshiwakearimasen!
This is not heartbreaking at all. Look up the grass eating men of Japan. They’re  the lost generation  of the economic collapse of the 90s. Japans ugly side.  Wouldn’t be surprised iif he’s a grass eating man. Lots of resentful grass eating men in Japan. My prediction is this will happen again. Trust me , “elites”, this must and will happen again.   Don’t hate the messenger, I’m just a messenger
😥😥😥
I bet Russica and China we’re behind this.
Are we sure this isn’t Chinas doing?
RIP sir. Condolences to his family and friends.  ☺🙏🏻
I guess they should take all guns away from citizens! oh wait they already did that
Wtf Mr.Abe. (((
see it's a sad day. just wanted to say that it doesn't matter how much of gun laws you have. if someone wants to kill you they will find a way too.
Jesus
What the hell is happening all across the world man.
Who shit/hit list was he on?
How sad.
This isn't the way democracies work. Fortunately, Japan has and routinely uses the gallows.
USA Democratic value in Japan..welcome 😁
China or North Korea is 100% involved
Who was allowed to have a gun in Japan? They have crazy strict gun laws. This is CRAZY
What’s shocking is that this happened like a day after a ton of the UKs government leaders like boris resigned. It’s super close.
sad and horrible news.
OMg. I did not expect to hear this happening in Japan.  _"Violence is rare in japan"_ - that's true. I did not expect this. He was a good PM. One of the most influential and memorable politicians.
My condolences. This is a tragedy.
Seriously how come this happened in japan 🇯🇵, it’s such a peaceful place with really nice people i mean they bow down to meet people how ?
He was a Good man.
Well someone dropped the ball, hopefully they're also held responsible for his death.
Sincerest condolences to Mr Abes' family, friends, colleagues and the Japanese nation.
still cant believe it. Anyway, thank you for the Contribution to the improvement and development of China-Japanese relations. RIP Mr.Abe
How many people die and live in poverty cause of these greedy government hypocrits and you lot saying rip so called world leaders are the cause if all the bad shit thst happens in the world
Terrible......
That is a good example of cause and effect. Justice was made.
Was he japan’s honest abe? Or the opposite
That's what they do when too much wasabi hits you all at once
Wasn’t he running for re-election?
China starting to move in the shadows
Fuck this whole planet. Gross. That poor man. May he be embraced by the ancestors and his family comforted.
FACTS: Japan is not a safe and happy country.
His assassination is an American missions and Israel Agenda.
He was Great Man and a Great Leader. Very upsetting, he will be dearly missed
The Chinese planted the assailant
And the left will say guns with 100clip magazines that can blow your lung out of your body are to blame
shot at??? you mean shot?? wtf
Rest in peace Mr Shinzo Abe so deeply sorry for his own family ❤
I'll bet New World Order had something to do with this.
It's crazy because I was only laughing at him  yesterday when he pulled that face when trump wouldn't let go of his hand
These years even in Japan or Switzerland horrible attacks are happens more and more often. Looks like these days no peacful country on Earth at all.
4:54
My deepest condolences to the family! May God  give them strength and  peace!
First off this is tragic and shocking. But it does go to show even when guns are banned bad guys still get them and find ways to use them. It's not the guns to blame its the crazy A hole who uses them.
R.I.P venerable Sir...... psalms 23rd to your family and to Japanese people...
Press F for an icon. Rest In Peace.
Heartbreaking 😭
IT'S AMAZING HOW GUNS PLAY SUCH A DOMINENT  ROLL IN TODAYS MODERN "CIVILIZED NATIONS" BANG YOU'RE DEAD !
wow this is insane
I thought shootings only happened in the United States?  Good grief, that Trump is evil.
你们今天应该感到高兴 因为安倍晋三终于可以开心的加入靖国神厕了😄  希望安倍晋三的家人们能原谅这个枪手
He was great leader with exceptional leadership skill. May his soul rest in peace.  We will miss you your HH
Homemade shotgun
The world has gone crazy. This is really sad and my condolences to the people of Japan and his family.
This is so sad, People are always forgetful and ungrateful. what an idiod gurd he had. RIP
Isn't that assassination ? Has died sounds like he was dead due to old age
Let's hope this time Japan would spend more resources on investigation* rather than interrogation*.
Standard afternoon for most US towns lol
my heart is broken! a great  friendly leader!😭
THE WORLD UNDER A FULL CRISIS, HOW HORRIBLE THAT IS  , EVEN IN JAPAN THIS HAPPENS
I am sorry. Praying for the family and friends.
India an japan both are brotherly lived and peace loving countries and India lossed its close friend
Hmm weird how was the deed done when guns are not allowed out there...hmmm did the law take a smoke break?
Another leader opposed to the great reset is assassinated.
The shooter made the weapon himself.
love you shinzo ji 🙏 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Eternal rest grant unto him O Lord,  let your perpetual light shine upon him, may the Divine Assistance remain always with us and may the souls of the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen. VIVA CHRISTO REY!!! ✝️ 🙏 ♥️ 🕯️ 🔥 🕊️ ⚓ 📿 🇬🇧
Our generar has fallen, this is a brack day.. Shamefur Disprayy..
This is awful and unbelievable. May he RIP.
HEAVENLY RIP
Indians lossed on of his great friend
Hoping this is a new trend around the world
Has died... or has he been murdered?
This is bizarre, but first thing I thought when I woke up this morning is that Abe is probably my favorite politician next to Merkel.
Abe was a strong supporter of the US, Taiwan, Hong kong and western nations.  Evil china disliked him.  Did Evil china sent an assissian after him?  Where did the assissian get the gun?  I have lived in Japan for one year,  they don't have guns, no one is allowed to have any guns.  Where did the assissian obtain the gun?  There are many evil chinese agents in YOUR country, in all western countries.  Who called for the hit of Abe??  Evil China, I think!!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
everything is going smooth and suddenly some lunatic comes in and ruins it all.... RIP PM Abe
we love Japanese and very sad day for Indians
Chinese Conspiracy
What the fuck is going around here, it's like an assembly line of bad news,
Damn in Japan? It's no hope for anyone
American. Kill ex Japanese minister
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Just terrible. I'm shaken to think this is becoming likely to occur in America soon the way things are going =\ RIP Shinzo Abe
He pissed off somebody aware and awake.
So sorry for your loss and unexpected violence, Japan. RIP Shinzo-san
Shame  .  why no shame . . .
So you are saying he died of a heart attack, since he was only "shot at"?🙄
Sorry for your loss. 😱
0:36 nods 10 times before she speaks?!?
Violence is not rare in Japan. Gun violence is.
Finally got the treatment he deserved!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏 #RIPNippon #JapanIsCursed #RIPAbenoMask #SayonaraAbeShinjo
Sad sad sad. Shocking this happened in Japan of all places. Condolences to his family and the people of Japan. R.I.P Mr Abe.
He was NOT "shot at"!  He was "shot"!!!
I think, USA is behind this assassination. Mr Abe was making great contributions to his country. He had a dream to make Japan great again. USA is always there to destroy great leaders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJhhea51G6A  👈👍
You can hardly turn on the news anymore.  Tragedy and terrible event around the world after another.  Here is hoping for world peace and sensibility.  We as a species need to evolve out of this barbaric treatment of one another.  Life is hard enough for people nowadays.
My Best wishes for your work Love and Peace to your family !
Obviously he got killed. He influences the government whilst outside the government 🙄. Who said he's a good politician?
SAYONARA .. 😭
Truly this incident was unexpected. Especially in the case of a country like Japan, such an event is really shocking!
My Best wishes for your work Love and Peace to your family !
They couldn't do it to Donald Trump so this was the next best thing! Conservatives under attack.
Breaking news: Biden has blamed Putin along with inflation,supply shortage,high gas prices,border crisis,price of a barrel of oil etc etc...kamala was asked for a few words and she started giggling...back to the studio..
https://youtu.be/Ecg1bZbbNHA
He looks very kind. I'm very painful considering he's no longer in this world. Rest In Peace
Lets blame Putin here again.
"Died after being shot ", he was killed.
RIP from Taiwan.
"Dies after being shot" you mean assassinated?
Abe-San I'm sorry that ignorant evil entities took you out, I pray that you and your family and friends will heal from this horrofying tragedy. I pray that you your family and friends will always represent the spirit of Japan and stay strong with prayer. My condolences from the Americas. -Jeweles aka Mother Durga.
🙏🏿rest in paradise
When he says 'shot' should he not say 'assassinated' ?
So sorry to hear.  Support and condolences for family.
This smells like a China project..!
Handful of RIP for honorable Ex, JAPAN Prime Minister Shinzo Abe..May whoever did this cowardly attack is truly,fully sent to hell immediately  from """"JAPAN"""" & remains there only forever....
This is a tragic loss. Very sad news. Condolences to the family and people of Japan.
Shinzo Abe was dedicated to supporting democracy globally, he had a positive influence on Chinese leaders and encouraging human rights, and that individual freedoms strengthen a country, not destabilize it.   He was very good at listening and honoring other countries politicians and hearing their views, while remaining committed the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the pillars of democracy.
OH NO SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT THIS WORLD HAS GOT TO STOP BEING SO EVIL!!!!!!
He was killed because he was a conservative and a nationalist! EVERYTHING the Liberal World Order Hates! There is a war going on around you and you better wake up to it before you becomes SLAVES to the Elites!
This has chinese all over it
China is involved
so so horrible , so sad
BBC is fake news.  Although this report is sadly true, generally it is understood that BBC is by and large a propagandist operation disguised as mainstream “news” not unlike all of the cable news networks in America.
Gun violence in a Country without legalized guns. After mass shootings people still think guns are legally acquired?
Omg 😳
Rest in peace Mr Abe. Although as Chinese, I don't really like him, but his job is not make other country's people like him, he did good for Japan, that is enough. Assassination is act of coward, killer will get punishment he deserved. I hope Japan remain stable and this kind of thing don't happen anywhere in this world.
That's the kind of violence you see in third world countries. I am shocked to see this happening in Japan
And I thought Whites, Blacks, Mexicans, Russians, were more shooters.
I don't believe.
Wow, shocked. Like the article said, its very rare and unusual to hear such a case from Japan.
I think china or Russia are the ones who did this I believe Russia and china are the ones who did it
🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭
Could not believe that anyone could assassinate such a great man. He reinvigorated the Japanese economy . He was the last person that I could think of to be assassinated.
I have 3 things to say  1.I thought Japan was a peaceful country  2. Did they get the person who shot him  3 rip 🫡
This is so heartbreaking, may he rest in peace.
He was a real friend for Bangladesh.  Rest him in peace 😢❤️
I'm english and I am extremely upset by this news. Why, because I always thought he seemed to be a decent human being; even though I cannot understand any japanese this has always been the message about him that for years has come through very clearly and definitely to me. Japan and the rest of this world has lost something really good. Brent Collins.
😱
Much love to the people of Japan x
Inside job? Screams inside job really. Like how a former prime minister, essentially equivalent to a USA president, not have security around him at all times? Especially for a public speaking event. And also how did the shooter get a gun and find out the spot where he could easily stand and fire multiple rounds into Abe, without any security taking him down? Yeah... Fishy
China did it!
The Liberal World Order is failing around the world and they are fighting back!
Why is it always the decent politicians that get killed and not the bad ones?
He was Prime Minister the three years I lived there. Even though I disagreed with some of his policies, it’s incredibly traumatic for the citizens. All I can think is thank goodness it wasn’t the current PM. Assassinations bring such unease and fright to any society. When they catch him, I won’t be surprised if he’s beheaded by sword.
Why Singapore?  There’s no correspondent In Tokyo?
It’s such a fallacy this narrative coming from the media that Japan is so safe because of strict gun laws. That’s not it at all. The gun laws are just as strict in Chicago or New York, if not more, and, yet, gun violence is an epidemic in those cities. The culture is why Japan is so safe. Most Japanese people think of what’s best for society before they think about what’s best for themselves, and this mindset is connected to almost every aspect of their lives. Every nation in the world could learn a lot from them.
Very sad moment
Shocked and saddened at this inhuman horrific happening! My condolences are with you. In my love and prayers. Thank God for the justice of God with His Almighty Justice and Power especially through the/our/one's "Soul". Your death saddened me! A true loss to the world! God Bless and Love you eternally. May God even now, enfold you in His Loving arms. May you all find comfort , ironically, in the wonderful Love of God, especially through His Presence. Amen 💖😘💖
He must be a good one because they only shoot the good ones .
Shot twice in the back at close range. Damn!
Really unprecedented violence in Japan, a peace loving country.
Even after being ill his self he stepped down and after getting better he came back to help his people and the world bless him 🙏 ❤️ ♥️ CCP EVIL DOGS BEHIND THIS
Condolences from Canada.
But the democrats keep telling us horrific shootings like this only happen in America. RIP Abe.
What gun did I the guy use? Was it homemade or was it a real gun?
BBC is lying . . . . . . . . . . Shinzo didnt DIE. . . . . . . . . . . . .BBC must say , " Shinzo was ASSASSINATED " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Media INTENTIONALLY using WRONG words to KILL TRUE HISTORY  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
Gun violence in Japan.
If the Elite Media the Opposition, Social Media and Liberal World Order can't suppress your message they'll kill you.
ahhh seems like Kor should be responsible for this bloody matter
fake news.  Guns are banned in Japan.';';
This crime is questionable you would have to hide a handgun in someone elses house.   This shooting is too high profile and strange
He wasn’t just shot at. He was shot. Period.
A GREAT LEADER CCP EVIL DOGS BEHIND THIS GOD BLESS HIM AND HIS FAMILY 👪 🙏 ❤️
The world leaders that are shocked by this only give a damn when it's one of them.  Political corruption leads to bad karma
He made modern Japan.RIP!
Sounds to me like it was an inside job. The fact they knew where he'd be. Very sad.
Rip Bozo
with abe out of the way , I would not be  surprised to see a more nationalistic uprising in japan , also wouldnt be surprised if Vlad is involved
I fear the CCP was involved. The shooters motives must be determined
why aren't they calling it an assassination?
But  they banned guns, guess that doesnt work.
#RIPAbe
What goes around, comes around
He’s now going to be a martyr for the LDP. He was a huge force in Japan changing their constitution to build up the military against China and North Korea. There’s nothing stopping that now.
Condolences to all his family, friends and the people of Japan!  Rest In Peace Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Today is one of the happiest days for the world 🌎 😊
My deepest and sincere condolences to his family and the Japanese people from Mexico City.
Rest In Peace 🙏🙏🙏
It is quite odd around the world for people to take up arms against political leaders.  However, as people realize that politicians of today do NOT have the best interest of the individuals at hand they are more likely to take up arms and use this as the most rapid tool to get corruption out of office.
I blame Trump 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Horrible, thoughts and prayers for Japan xo
Damn Russians spies!
Oh my... RIP 🪦
God speed 🙌🏽
Er Ruhe in Frieden 🇩🇪🇯🇵
The Chinese are cheering. This is disgusting
As bad it is to murder someone, people need to know that abe was not the person that most people see him as...
May your soul rest in eternal peace  Mr Abe 🙏🌹😥😢
Perpetrator was a terrorist. Refer to him as that!
Deepest condolences to the people of Japan and may god give strength to the family of PM Shinzo Abe in these terrible times. PM Abe's death news was very shocking to the people around the world and certainly it was here in India. This just goes to show the legacy that he has left behind in this world that people around the world are mourning the death of this great statesman.
Very sad news.  From the U.S., we send our condolences and pray for the healing of your country.
"Leader?" Prime minister is the correct term.
but having some political difference with someone does not mean you should kill that person, this dude should be thoroughly investigated. he may not be alone specially during this election time.
Incredible sad news!! Nobody is safe anymore I. This world 😢
Love from India 🇮🇳 rip this is soo sad
Friends of Trump are being taken off the chessboard.
Breaks my heart like the  killing of  JFK. Praying for his family.
A great leader, a great friend of my country.
He would have lived forever to do the same thing that he used to be. What a loss.
China...
shot in the back---wheres the honer in that? i hope this person dies in jail a long life before he rots in hell for eternity... rest in peace Abe san, you will be missed
So sad  Rip SA
The same unannounced public shooting style of assassination happened in Turkey to a high ranking russian diplomat - he was shot while speaking in an art gallery. These are very strange crimes.  These shootings are bizarre. I think it is basically a mafia thing. Could well be the KGB. Some people are members of various clandestine organisations.
Violence is so rare in Japan, that's why Yakuza and violent manga are a myth.
Shocking news ! Never expected this to happen in Japan .Rest in peace Shinzo Abe 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
🙏🏾 for his family! BBC the title makes no sense! Say he was shot dead! BBC is so liberal they can't even admit that the man was SHOT AND DIED without beating around the bush! Smh!
Kojima how could you!
These are extremely strange times we live in.
He didn’t get hold of a gun. He made one from two pieces of pipe and a wooden plank. He also made his own gun powder and bullets. He then claimed after the shooting that he wasn’t shooting at Abe, but a different person who wasn’t even at the event. He is insane. This goes to show you that you can’t legislate against crazy. It’s literally impossible to own a firearm in Japan. Yet if you’re crazy, and determined, you will find a way. There are sick people in this world. The assassin should be put to death. Instead, he’ll sit in prison. Or maybe in a few years he will be a free man like John Hinckley? Hinckley shot Reagan, paralyzed Jim Brady for life, and here he is free and doing TV interviews. Sick people like sick animals need to be dealt with, not coddled
Deep state
rest in peace, good sir
We morn with our Japanese friends because of this senseless act of violence against a wonderful advocate for the Japanese People.  This is a sad day and we need to watch China at this moment.
Bangladesh mourns😭
I am speechless. I remember a few years ago I thought that prime minister of Japan is a person with strong energy.  I sympathize not only with his family, but also with the whole country. It's difficult when you loose a feeling of safeties... I will pray 🙏 for all good things for people. I think we should not be egoistic. All world around us have some disasters, problems and challenges. I hope peace, love, health and safety will be around us in all world. I feel big respect to Japan and Japanese people. I just have no good and supportive enough words...
🇱🇧Sorry for your loss💐💐💐💐I am very shocked this happened.
Attacke is disgusting trash
govs deserves everything, they are the cause of ppl struggling
Was he not liked?
Wow Japans gun laws really showing their strength here...........
The Chinese are celebrating Abe's assassination and that is incredibly egregious.  Whether Chinese agreed with Shinzo's political dealing with China or not, whenever someone is assassinated, in modern & civil times we set politics aside.   Allow his family to grieve in peace without knowing your country of China is celebrating.  Wow China, you outdid yourselves this time.  And I am not a supporter of Shinzo Abe's politics either, however, there is a time and place for everything.
I love the spin of BBC fake news. 'Dies after being shot at'. That's murdered in any other walk of life.
The narrative that violence is so rare in Japan is so misinformed. They literally come from a warrior culture, do the Yakuza make their money through peaceful diplomatic means? Just because it’s unreported doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. Same way Japan has a 99% conviction rate, even if you’re innocent you’re still going to prison if your case makes it to court. It’s not the liberal paradise media makes it out to be, they are a highly traditional and conservative nation.
Is China playing a role? Why Chinese has to celebrate someone's assassination according to the reports
私は家族や友人に哀悼の意を表します My condolences to his family and friends
Was He silenced? A good Men! May He ⚘R.I.P.⚘ Condolences to his Dear Fam.! 💘
😯😲 his poor family.
Why would you go to a reporter in Singapore?  Don't you have a bureau in Japan?  Seems odd?
Why the hell would this happen? This is extremely shocking.
Sending his family my condolences.. He understands what this about so someone from Russia n North Korea also China want to take over.. keep Alert.. Stay safe warm and healthy. Be kind and HELP OTHERS. All we are saying “Give A Peace A Chance”
Mr. Shinzo Abe will forever be the man, the myth and the legend. Gone but will never be forgotten. R.I.P. Sir
He was a very nice man.he was so respectable man for Iranian people.  A smart man and peaceful person. Rest in peace and we wish patience for his family. Me,as a person from Iran I am so sorry and I want to say "condolence "to Japanese people
A man once said heroes will be remembered but legends never die
.
Rip
මහින්ද රාජපක්ෂ උඹටත් මේක තමයි වෙන්න ඕන
Oh no! They should try banning guns! Criminals are people that are way more likely to follow gun laws!
Security was not alert enough. A lesson for next leaders. They should have stop him immediatly after hearing the gunssound at first. Prayers for the family of Abe. Praying for justice and righteouness for murdering Abe. Condoleance to the people of Japan.
DEATH PENALTY for the murderer!
If only we could rid the world of Tony Blair the same way
Islamic and Russia is bh this
Who gives a shit ! I don't,  if lying politics behaved then they wouldn't get a bullet.
Thank you very much !
It is shocking especially it happened in a gun restricted country. They got to do a full investigation. I have a feeling that it is not just a simple shooting case.
R.I.P Abe san
Thats the big lesson of the other higher leader to be patient today especially the crazy people. Be careful each in every one sad too see mr. Abe he is a humble man. Condolence for his family. 😂😂😂 Watching from Europe 🇪🇺🇨🇭🇮🇹🇫🇷🇩🇪🇬🇧❤️
Dude 👀
People go to the greatest limits just cuz of politics… I could understand if the politician in question was gonna be the next Hitler or something….but damn
This is horrible. RIP ❤
Condolences to people of Japan 🇯🇵 from India 🇮🇳
What could have led to this cold-blooded attack is beyond anyone's guess. I know thoughts and prayers are not enough anyone but I do want to share my condolences to his family and friends for losing a person they know and loved. I hope the person responsible for his murder receives justice
Sad world that we live in.
Mmm suspicious
Guns are banned there ya?
Rip Mr Shinzo .... no one deserve this . Condolences to his family so very sad , have we not evolved since the Kennedy brothers . 🇦🇺
Nooooooo!!! 😭😭😭 Why! He was always trying to help Japan! He was a good man....rip Shinzo 😔
Quite a shock to hear this May his soul RIP 😔
Sayonara Abe San 😪. He was one of my favorite politicians in the world. I had never ever thought in my wildest dreams that he would die this way . he was a great friend of our country India and we Indians loved him for his dedication and love towards our culture and development. I hope once the bullet train becomes a reality in India, a platform or a line gets named after him as a token of respect. tomorrow,India has declared a national mourning of our dear friend. RIP Abe San,you will be greatly missed . you coming out of pipe wearing a Mario Costume during the closing ceremony of Rio Olympics will be one of my most memorable moments of yours 😭😢
RIP🙏🏻💐
💔😭 🇮🇳 ❤️ 🇯🇵 Stay strong. RIP sir
rip
God bless Shinzo Abe. May he rest in peace.
Omg. Condolence
🙏
RIP, condolence from the free country of Taiwan and it’s people.
Chef of Netanyahu served Shinzo Abe & his wife food in boots upon their visit of Palestine. Perhaps Israel has a hand in his murder. Japanese people should be vigilant. Just saying.
IN JAPANN?? That is crazy and extremely sad
Your every work is commendable sir, whatever you worked with India you will always be immortal in our hearts, It's very shocking news to India as during his leadership the relationship between India and Japan had been strengthened...! 🇮🇳 🤝🇯🇵
Heartbreaking 💔💔
Someone needed him to be silent.... Yakuza?
Wrong person what about Mr Put In?
R.I.p Abe.
Oh my God not shinzo Abe what happen I can't believe this this news , Shinzo Abe shot to death why he is such a nice humam
Boris next
What a loss. I hope his loved ones heal and sorry for their and japans loss
This was an japanese ant who came out of control! Very rare event in Nipon! Normaly the ants there takes only honey!? Very strange?
It’s like 2022 becomes worse every single month.  RIP Mr Shinzo Abe and condolences to the bereaved family🙏
is tghe huitman crazy too like oswald ruby surhan surhan
That shooter went and lost his head,... RIP Abe
I will not grieve the loss of Shinzo "trump before trump" Abe, senior member of the ultra-nationalist, homophobic, misogynistic, racist and historical negationist group Nippon Kaigi. He had a better reputation than he deserved, the walking pile of horse excrement.
Thank You . !
This is sad news.😔
Why couldn’t they do this to Putin instead?
Now remember japan has very very strict gun laws. If somebody wants a  gun he will get one.
China, North Korea...I wonder...
gun violence in the US A, Denmark and Japan this week.
This call Karma. He always being waving wars and provocation with USA behind supporting with ideas.
This is awful news, my sympathies to his family and friends. I really liked and respected Abe, he seemed to be a good, solid leader who appeared to love his country. No reason for this violence.
Putin
He was an example for all people . I love his patience , and dedication to bring peace and harmony among us.Japan is one of the most peaceful countries in the world . The history will never forget Abe.
why are you silent when Ukraine is killing children in Donetsk!? https://youtu.be/dqmL4mmE7bA https://youtu.be/tewuCR4Nv9M https://youtu.be/7Dlc1RP9Xkk https://youtu.be/69nQicoHx9Y
They didnt shoot at him. They shot him
Is mental and jealous people in the world
Unforgivable..
Why are you here? Why are you alive? https://youtu.be/uZdv-TtiMkg
"He SHINed with light of a thousand Sons.. thZO he was fully ABE-l to do otherwise". Follow now, 1 good footstep: And EMANATE!!! BOTH The LIGHT from your Souls.. & that of your Countries 🙏 UNITY also for Every ASIAN people that remains. And may this soul joyously R.I.P. as we strive to continue in a Good Work..
Interested to know the motivation of the assassin and how he knew about Abe's arrival there in advance. Looks like an insider to the politics there.
He can finally join those war criminals that he honors in the Yasukuni shrine.
Sending my condolences to shinzo abe family sorry for your lost
Damn gave him the Abraham Lincoln haircut
Lol , I'm SO sad and I'm not a japonese . I Hear Good things about ex Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and I even watch a lot of News where he was with ex usa president Donald Trump. My condolences to his family and friends and may his soul rest in peace 🏳️🕊️   🇯🇵🕊️
You'll never keep guns out of the hands of criminals..gun laws are useless..
Our prayers are always with him ,he will be reborn in world
Sorry to this pain you suffered god bless you prime minister of japan have a good journey home to our lord Jesus Christ amen🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Say it. He was ASSASSINATED!!
The weopon he used looked like he created the gun himself it wasn't a gun that anyone would see for purchase. Like a makeshift shotgun was wrapped in black tape.
Japan is being targeted. Not the ex-leader. What about Japan needs to come to light? Do you think terror has anything to do with it?
Death is everywhere nowadays and he been busy prior this year. 💀
Question is; will WWIII start once it's known that China was behind this assassination?
Even with maximum gun control in place, people can still make a double barreled shotgun at home with 20$ worth of hardware and electrical tape.
Japan is very strict on gun laws…… more than likely it was politically set up.  Reminder of Abraham Lincoln was shot from behind as well.  My condolences for the ex prime minister and his family.
Why though?
Wasn’t there one Japanese guy who killed another with a sword during a speech and yet another who crashed a plane into a Lockheed Martin CEOs home? I’m not saying Japan is known for political violence I’m just saying it isn’t as unusual as it’s being made out to be
why bbc still finds the need to slander chinese and widen the rift between china and japan at every possible moment? why mention “chinese nationalists are celebrating” ?????
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 no way in a country with strictest gun laws? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can't believe that...🤣🤣🤣🤣 criminals are able still get them? No way. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dam. Beyond words. Abe was one of those people that brought a sense of stability amid the all the madness on the planet. Unbelievable. 💐🇯🇵
And our ultra idiot president over here used this to talk about gun control...just a massive jerk...
Your headline is so poorly written
... sorry for the loss of the japanese people ... did you know that the u.s. ranks highest in a country wherein its country's leaders were assasinated which is the wrong-side of freedom !!!
He shot the wrong leader... He could've been our hero if he got the right guy...
Condolences to the family and people of Japan 🇯🇵
Macron defeated, Boris gone, Abe dead. Do I smell something afoul here? Who's next in line?
RIP shinzo Abe 😢😢  he was our greatest friend. 🇧🇩❤️🇯🇵  deepest condolences ...
Japan's political "openness in public" will sadly now be changed.  How sad.
Where is the Documentary over the destruction  of  '' Georgia  Guidstones ''  ?
Mainland Chinese people are brainwashed by the CCP and its disgusting.  To be celebrating a passing of another human being like that... just disgusting.
From the comment it is amazing no one suggested  his death related to involvement from Russia.
Isn't this the same clown that denies Japan war crimes, promoted history revisionism textbooks to schools of Japan war crimes, whose grandfather is a notorious war criminal, and constantly visited Yasukuni Shrine so he didn't actually give a shit about the crap that was done to both Chinese and Koreans with his halfassed apologies to both countries aswell?  Now you have all the white weebs who see Japan as a utopia on Twitter and stuff attacking China because Weibo is celeberating Abe death. Even calling the Shooter, a hero. Its ironic that Americans and rest of the westerners can talk considering America still have statues glorifying slavers and traitors to their own nation.  Shinzo abe was a fascist and a bona-fide war criminal. he actively denied war crimes and was overall just an awful human being. The american government spent a lot of time giving him good pr to cover that particular bit of information up with their approval. it didn't matter.  He's also the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, the former governor of Japanese occupied Manchuria, and was personally responsible for lots of atrocities against the Chinese. Americans even arrested him after the war as a class A war criminal. But he was released bc he was useful to US  Abe was a member of fascist group Nippon Kaigi.   They claim Imperial Japan’s war crimes were exaggerated or fabricated, and praise Japanese colonialism for “liberating” Asia from the West. In 2014, 15/18 of Abe's cabinet were Nippon Kaigi members.  The Religious Cult Secretly Running Japan Nippon Kaigi, a small cult with some of the country’s most powerful people, aims to return Japan to pre-WWII imperial ‘glory.’ Sunday’s elections may further its goal.  Abe praised his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who played a leadership role for Imperial Japan.   At the end of WWII, Kishi was imprisoned as a suspected Class A war criminal, but the US govt never charged him. Instead, he became Japan’s prime minister.
The assassin used a handgun. Handguns are illegal in Japan. But the bad boy got one anyway. Another "gun control" failure!!!!!!
Heavily shocked by the news. RIP Abe. Hope his murderers get punishment. He'll still be there in Japanese people's souls.
Rest well papa
Are you battling anxiety, depression, addiction ect? ... Do desire peace safety and joy. Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the answer ,he loves you so much that he died for you. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth for the remission of sin and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and everlasting life. Consider your life today
Oh my. This is really shocking.
R.I.P Shinzo Abe😭🙏
OMG such a sad day.
Security detail overlooked?
Why is there no one looking out for his security and safety during speech? This is heart breaking.
Crazy Japan is one of the least likely places you’d expect something like this to happen in
Wow who would assassinate this guy!?
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
China did it.. it's an open secret..
Regardless of any political views , May he RIP , no one in any country in any office deserves to be killed by the people who elected you … Very sad and may god bless Japan … Prayers from California USA and The Americas  🇺🇸 🇲🇽 🇨🇦
yes , Many Thanks
Now the west just has to find a way to blame it on China or Russia....all the fake news stories are coming soon!
Rip
He didn't deserve this at all. I hope the perpetrator of the crime explains why exactly he did such heinous crime.
Respect and RIP from a Chinese.  Abe is a man, a brave man that dare to still stand there after the 1st failed shot, calmly. Imagine how many people can do that, whether youself can do that, I can't, I will run and hide and take cover. He was a great politician that tried his best to balance the country in between superpowers, and brought in the max benefits to its citizens. Hope the current prime minister can keep his path and strategy, and not to bring the whole world into a dangerous cliff.
usa  canada hint hint
My deepest condolences to this great man.
America did it.... we all knoww it...
CCP did that shit
So much for gun control.
I wonder if putin has anything to do with this?🤔🤔🤔
Yakuza don touch am
Sad news. He may rest in peace😔😔
🙏sad from Germany 😢🙏
Best Day Ever!!!!
Very sad
that's why dictators nowadays are impossible kill, people are so brainwashed that they prefer to kill a non-dictator politician which haven't kill his own citizens at all or destroyed an economy, but they will never try to kill a dictator that has killed his own citizens and destroyed an economy completely, like NICOLAS MADURO or LOS CASTRO.
Who mastermind his assassination, what were his intl platforms that caused this
Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.   Is a lamp bought to be put under a basket or under a bed is it not to be set on a lamp stand for there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.  And he said he who has ears to hear let him hear.
Very sad 😞🕊🕯
So shocking
😢😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
So terrible 🙏🏻😓
What? This is terrible news. Prayers from UK for all of Japan. 🇬🇧 🇯🇵
Ex Leader??? He was the Prime Minister BBC He was more than Just a Leader...
This assassination may be  the 1914 Franz Ferdinand moment of This Time.
Asassinated
How is it possible that there is no clear video?
The YAMAGUCHI-GUMI YAKUZA ordered the hit.
#RIP. May the criminals associated with this incident, get the most appropriate punishment.
Such a fine gentleman!  God, why?
He had "disagreements" with him, so he decided to shoot him? 🤦‍♂
*Gangnam style intensifies*
My greatest condolences for abe's family and to all of my japanese brothers and sisters. RIP Shinzo Abe 🇮🇩❤️🇯🇵
China.
Can anyone tell something about the "disagreement" between the leader and its assassin?
Where's homelander when you need him
That’s awful! I’m so sorry to the people if Japan and to his loved ones
So so sad to see this
Utter and complete bullshit for real where was his body guards they dropped the ball they should all be fired for real!!!!!!!
WW3 BEGINS
Nobody deserves to die this way
rip Mr shinzo abe thank you for helping our country philippines
That is crazy, i did not expect this to happen at all. R.I.P Shinzo. It reminds me of the assassination of Pim Fortuyn here in Holland. High profile assassinations are very rare here as well, but it seems that the political killings were done by rogue Leftists.
Further proof that bad guys will always have guns. Even if they have to make them themselves.
Awww, this is so sad, why do these things still happening in the World? !!
RIP☹️
Brexit at it again.
Any news on the fruitcake who shot him?  Rest in peace, unknown Japanese political dude....
That was very rare in Japan to shoot someone like that . Sorry to see the good man & good ex PM die the way he did . no one should decide to take someone ' s life  away like that .
What could be the actual reason?
It seems naive, but Russia, North Korea, and the CCP can be easily ruled out. They kill their own, without being brazen enough to target a former world leader.
My condolences to the people of Japan, from the U.S. (Alaska).
This is sad to hear, God rest his soul. RIP Shinzon Abe
Assassinated by the ghost of the pearl harbour…
This will also be something that the president will not let go very easily Such a tragic I wonder what will say president .....
To his family my condolences. I really loved him, he was making a difference.
Rest in peace Mr. Shinzo Abe. Condolences to the citizens of Japan from America 🙏🙏🙏
A great loss to Japan and others, Shinzo Abe Sun will be fondly remembered
Rip
AL QAEDA OR ISIL
Ukrainian military helicopters purposely burn crops on the fields in Kherson territory.
Who ever the suspect was, find him and get him killed next
Although many Chinese and Koreans may be happy to hear of his death, I personally have respected Prime Minister Abe for his efforts to not only rebuild his country Japan but also to strengthen the overall East Asian region. He was a key player in making East Asia stronger and helped shape the existing connections East Asia has with other parts of the world. Yes, I didn't really like him but I respected him. 🙏
My sincere condolences to the family people and friends of Japan.R.i.p 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
To think this could happen in Japan in 2022, is unthinkable RIP Abe san.... So much for AI, sensors and robots....
:(
when they die like this,you know they were true patriot and a good leader...
It was probably China. It usually is.
I'm not a Japanese but from sri Lanka.. I really appreciate his services to Japanese government and country .. REST IN PEACE SIR...
He was my favorite world leader, he was so honorable and most respectful prime minister, My condolences to the family and japanese people... this is a huge loss for the world... RIP...
I wonder what was the reasoning on the killers part?
strange facts seems another  jfk, kennedy location and mway of todays date of as much follo twitter and youtube videos  about,as much wife she should understand tooo  i do thing orrible about  do not understand the reason of  as much his age pm abe shinzo former japan minister 67 years old  ,  be safe out there
My prayers go to PM Shinzo Abe’s family, friends and the Japanese nation. PM Abe loved his country. May God have mercy on the soul of PM Abe.
It is not surprise.  Some Chinese people are quick to celebrate other people's misfortune.  They did that when India had lots of covid deaths.  They have the biggest smile when they take your business money though.
rip
This is unexpected, first I think it's a fake all a false news but this is unbelievable, Mr Abe always look healthy and likely have no enemy but...
One of the most loved world leaders is leaving us for a nonsensical mind..... My heart is bleeding learning his death.   My most respected salutation to his service to human race. He is now in a better place, surround with all who love him dearly. My condolences to Japan and his family. 🙏  🥀 😢
This situation reeks of China.
They are tired of being treated poorly in all Asian countries and they're going to turn on their leadership because the leadership is not doing their job or the ex leadership didn't do their job and that's a fact for Japan as well as red China as well as many other countries in the world where the leadership things they can do whatever they want the people just have to suffer more of this will continue to happen until the wrong people are taken out of office and the right people go in
💥His grandfather is a A-level of world war criminal and he always dreamed of Japan's world domination! He has visited a shrine in honor of war criminals every year! Why mourn him?!?!!!!😩
mfs MLK and JFK that dude wow…
A russian sleeping agent.  . .this is Russia, a real PLAQUE,  a Disease on human kind
驚くほど呆気なく亡くなってしまった。日本にとって失うにはあまりにも惜しい存在だ。ご冥福をお祈りします。
Surprise, surprise. Another leader who couldn't bear to put his own people through unneccesary lockdown measures meets an untimely death. Are there any others left?? RIP!!
No this guy was a legend he’ll forever live in our hearts
Hell is good for him!
Honestly, I am a chinese... i feel sick and extremely sad to see all these celebrating commends on the chinese social media...Oh yeah I get it... So many people got killed in Nanjing Massacre. But this guy got nothing to do with it... Why are they so many haters??? I just wanna apologize for China.. i know i cannot represent china but I am sure they are many chinese people feel the same way that i do.
Today is shinzo Abe  Tomorrow is narenda modi👍
I think the right term for this would be assassination.
rip im sure he was a good man.
If the guy shot without a convinced motivation then conspiracy take place.
Assassinated
So who was the shooter? What were the motives?
._.
Don't belive the news!
WOAH. shocking for sure. its soo peaceful in Japan. I went right before lockdown.
RIP 💔
This is so sad 😞 all because someone didn’t agree with him . This is not the answer and I hope he stays in jail for life . Prayers to his family
He was is the key point. Obviously bezos and the obama boyz did not want him around so they did an Oprah you get a bullet and you get a bullet.
Heard the news when I reached home. Very tragic!! He seemed to be quite a likeable political figure
With such tough gun laws, how could there be a shooting? Surely it would have been illegal?
Sad rip prime minister. I wonder what the illuminati are going to do next?
Un deserving way to die for a peaceful intelligent Man! RIP  🙏
Why can't this happen in Africa?so sad to hear about this innocent man dies from gun shots
Never thought something like this will happen in Japan 🇯🇵
Being a leader of any country has risks ,,,you can't please everybody. If a leader is clearly self serving and is clearly wrecking his/her country and people, he/she should be deposed. From my point of view this man didn't fall into this category .Sad day.
This is devastating.
What????????????
Rip Mr. PM. Prayers from Nepal.  People who killed him and people like him.. They are pure evil
A dark day for Japan
He was vert influential  prime minister  in world policy  cheers  so i condolence  his family fir his shock death . From somalia
My Hero Shinzo Abe....Me and The people from Cambodia wish you go to hell..
Poor security shocking from japan
Death sentence to the killer
Another opportunity for Biden to make an ass of himself.
Lol biden is next
Isn't this likely to strengthen the right in Japan?
And you thought that Boris Johnson was having a bad day.
this screams cia left right and center
"has died", no, he didn't die, he was murdered, just "dying" would be more associated with natural causes.
What kind of Security is that?  How can a man with a gun got close to him in the middle of the road?
This surprises me. Especially coming from Japan. 🙏
Well deserved

They should quantitatively ease him back to life.
Sooooo sorry that some individual can do this to another human
My deepest condolences and regrets to the family of Abe and whole Japan. He was not only for Japan but also one the most wise and visionary Prime Ministers of the World in this era. 🙏 From Bangladesh 🇧🇩🧡🇯🇵
This is Putin's war against NATO....going deeper....
Why he killed him inn the first place.
I'm not a fan of politics but no - one deserves to die in such a brutal, painful and horrible.  My condolences go out to his family 💯🙏
Soon copy cat 🐈 coming
Short correction **not *has died* *but  "been killed"
I am more shock the gunman can be so near .
Rest In Peace…
I am saddened to hear what has happened to this good man.  Reading the comments, tells me about him. He was for the people and for the country. In America, we not so long ago had a President like that. Because of the corrupt media many people here fell for their propaganda...twice they tried to have him impeached on bogus charges. Next year on the Chinese Zodiac is the year of the dragon. I believe leaders of countries that  have their heart in the right place will be taken down, to pave the way for the New World Order. Japan, being a tiger nation, China will dominate. The U.S. will not defend you, do not rely upon this..Our President has just sold 1 million barrels of oil from our stratigic reserve to feed China's war machine. Our President is compromised  by many nations in so many ways. I am sorry to have to tell you these things. Our President is doing all that he can to bring America to complete ruin. We are in the end days, and great tribulation is coming..He who will live righteously will make themselves a prey...To the family and to all Japanese people everywhere, I wish you my best...I have never met a Japanese person that I didn't like...
I'm beyond shocked....
Rip Mr Abe 🙏 😢 💔
Guy made a gun and shot him.
Divine retribution! His father is a WW2 war criminal.
Sad to hear, may his soul rest in peace
We are denouncing this
Very strange. It is probably also the work of globalist megalomaniacs who want to introduce one government in the world.
weird that does not normally happen in japan
I will carry you to paradise. <3
It is heartbroken News and unexpected from Japani nation. Love and respect from Bangladesh for this leader.
Holy shit Trisha Takanawa is real!
Sad!!!!
This is very sad news RIP 🙏Condolences  to Family!
Yet another Abe assassinated. Welcome to the real world, Japan. As the communists of the world celebrate, we, on the correct side of the fence, mourn. Arm up, Nihon. Wolves are at the door.
So goes strict gun laws. I pray for this man’s family and for healing.
Is this a plot or power play from outside Japan????
The politic of Abe during this campaign , against Donbass and critics of the  Russian president Mr.Putin, made Russia took over  the Sakhalin project 2 without Japan.
Peace and rest he was good men
Awful! Bussiness! RIP!
Rest in peace shinzo abe see you again in paradise
Work of fascist Korea and they know it......
Rest  in  as  peace as  his grandpa
Hopefully they catch the guy and find out exactly why he did it.
Rest in peace....Sir. So sad and shocking to hear this.
Not even japanese (british), but this genuinely comes as a shock. I'm quite young so I tend to think of assassinations as something for the history books, so to see this happen today was... surprising, even if rationally it is not at all surprising.  RIP Shinzo Abe
⭐️He is the member of a war criminal family and always dreamed of Japan's world domination! Why mourn him? Are you all idiots?😩
As a korean, though I do not respect him much for his attitudes toward the comfort women, I do pay my respects for his work in Japan
here's a country where 99 % is normal gun control! you idiots paying attention to this? or still sucking joe?
What the hell brought that on? What is going on Japan? Why is that even happening there?
Rest in peace sir, 😔 Philippines loves you very much🇵🇭🇯🇵
Sickening…
Not shot at but shot, c'mon seriously.
assassinated*
He is a martyr now, he's legacy will be much stronger
He  took a wrong side in the conflict between Ukraine and Donbass. If Boris Johnson lost his Prime Minister seat, Abe lost his life...
Whatever
It is a heinous crime. He was a great leader.I have never thought this would happen in Japan.
Karmic law..nobody can escape it.
💔
CIA written all over this
Shinzo Abe, a trusted great friend of Bangladesh. Last goodbye friend. We shall never forget you.
Good day, dear friends! Please pay attention to my letter for a moment. In this difficult time, when humanity is trying to defeat the pandemic, the division of the world we are used to has begun! Many people are fleeing from countries where there is war or genocide. It is our duty to be able to help such people.                                  Igors Davidovs                                  LT37 3250 0337 3148 2459                                  REVOLT21 even a small amount, but from the heart!
I never heard of crimes that goes viral from Japan, but when it happens it goes big. My condolence to his family and friends.
Dude is legendary... he will be missed...
This took place for a reason, just as he suddenly retired for a reason. Japan is being made to feel vulnerable.  To feel threatened. The commies want Japan to obey them, especially now that China and NK are making friends with Putin. A hard time is coming for Japan.
Yakuza making a comeback
Must of been the Republicans, right libs?
Sad 😭🙏🏾
I do not personally know Mr Abe Shinzo that well but he looked like a very smart man for his country. - From Afghanistan
Stay strong Japanese people! From Italy with 😍
It's happening much sooner then I thought
Human beings insist on doing terrible things to each other. It’s a sickness.
I have the impression this kind of killing in the future will also occur in Europe ...
I wouldn’t doubt if Ukraine or USA is in on this. Part of NWO
North Korea is probably planning a parade
Not shock at all
One of the best leader in the world, RIP.
I am so sorry!!  I am shock, gone too soon a well like politician that cared for Japan. May you Rest in Peace Mr. Shinxo Abe. My condolences to his family and the people of Japan.
RIP Salute to you sir
Our prayers will go to the bereaved family. RIP, Mr.Abe. This is a great loss to Japan.
....and Japan has some of the strictest gun laws on the planet!
This is not right. A good Japan leader as  PM Abe was assassinated. Bunches looser and sicko world leader as: USA,  Russia,  China,  Vietnam,  Cambodia, Iran ... are still living. Not Right , should be in reverse
He was devisive figure!!!? Which world u guys live in?!?!
Shocking! Rip Shinzo Abe. May God give courage to the family to cope with this loss. Condolences to all Japanese. 🙏🏻
シンガポールからかよ
Shame it wasn't putin
I was shocked 😲 and its very sad news 😢
🇺🇦❤️🇯🇵
Let's blame the gun laws
GEE, I WONDER WHY?...
If it was in africa the current government could have been sanctioned.
One of the great statesmen of our time
She said. Abe's "grandfather was a Prime Minister", indeed he was, however she forgot to mention that he was also a convicted war criminal who escaped the hangman's noose because Radhabinod Pal, an Indian judge at the Tokyo War Tribunal, didn't agree with the decision taken by ten British and American judges on the panel who recommended the death penalty.
Very sad
Tell me how well that gun control worked, Libs!  All responses to the contrary are WORTHLESS, just so you know.
So sad.
I've never been to Japan and don't know a lot about the politics there, but from what I understand, wasn't his father involved in some pretty bad stuff during World War 2?  Was there not summer some anger because of him going to the war shrine, etc?
Fake news
Deep condolences to Shinzo Abe’s family and to the people of Japan. 💐
Rest in peace my friend Abe 👈😎 I thought Putin got shot
Probably assassinated by CIA and going to be blamed on China.
Her speech is like bullet train. Never ever thought such incident would happen in JP. RIP ..Om Shanti
He is the six’t politician assassinated in Japan history.not that rear, but I think that guy was acting not alone. Search his contacts, i think it will go to International influence
Rest in Peace thanks for your achievements and make this world better !!!
Something stirring 🤔
Mr Abe is a best friend of my country, Viet Nam. As a small nation, we are hugely grateful for his support and love. Im deeply sad and shocked by his death.He delicated his lifetime for japan,and now being killed by a japanese. So heartbroken. My sincere condolences to Mr. Abe and his loved ones and the people of Japan. His refined talent and warm heart are alive forever♥️
I hate to say this to a dead man, but he was a lousy prime minister in my opinion as a Japanese. In case you didn't know, he promoted all kinds of worthless policies and caused a major decline in Japan's economy. He was also a traitor in many of his foreign policy initiatives, which amounted to slavery. However, many ignorant Japanese have agreed with his empty words and allowed him to dictate for a long period of time. In my opinion, he could have been killed at any time.
My sincerest condolences to the family and countrymen of the deceased. Japan is really a very peaceful country so that's how I'm really shocked and embarrassed to hear about such unfortunate incident in Japan. I wish it never happens in Japan anymore. Being a Pakistani, I understand the value of peace, human degnity and rights, and most importantly Rule of Law, as we lack in all such things here in my native land, unfortunately. May peace prevail in Japan as it's known for !!
Last country you would expect a former politician to be assassinated- what happened???
I have a theory that it was most likely china
Being a political figure is dangerous no matter where you are.
Why was he shot
By democrats
Very sad to see this , RIP he was a good person
Was the shooter a Chinese agent?
Rest in peace Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and express condolences to the Japanese people 🙇‍♂️🇯🇵
and guns being out lawed in Japan except for hunting rifles you cant keep at home,  its almost like gun control doesn't work!????
I warned about this gun violent. People think is a small stuff. No, it is worse for humanity and this is the result of careless
a gun free country will not stop the crazies and criminals, from getting a gun.  and american gun owners know this , it is exactly why we have the 2nd amendment . i am sorry for JAPANs loss.
He was one of the finest peace loving leader loves by everyone it’s so shocking to hear his assassin I pray for his soul rest in peace 🙏🙏
Extremely sad. Abe was a great leader that cares for his people, for Japan, and was a sting advocate for the protection of sovereign states
Gunman in custody, he reportedly lay his strange weapon down on the ground after a now lethal second shot fell Abe. Identity not yet revealed so far, deadly aspirations from certain Authoritarian powers cannot be ruled out. Respect to a stability focused over eight years leader of a democratic global powerhouse.
Crazy times
O-o shit.
This is so sad.  Political violence anywhere is unacceptable but  in a democracy, it's shocking
He must have scared many around the world with the thought of Japan as military power...RIP Mr.Abe 💔
Thank you very much !
As one of Japanese citizens, I can’t believe it.  As far as the gun control of Japan, it was safest and n the world, no more
So you can die from being shot at now?
you still owe an apology to those millions of civilians japan had killed in WW2 , he even still denied the history, so i do not have pity on him
Russia and china. Eheeemmm
Violence is rare in Japan are you kidding me, Japans culture is full of violence.
Sad news. Goes to show that shootings can happen in any country of the world, even peaceful ones such as Japan.
Это явно дело рук российских спецслужб. Также они причастны к обнародованию скандалов команды Бориса Джонсона
RIP,,,,,,HIS FATHER AND HIS GRAND FATHER WERE PREMIER MINISTER OF JAPAN MEANS WHAT ? 1 HIS GRAND FATHER WAS A FRIEND OF HITLER,,,2 POLITICS ARE SO KINGS DOENT MATTER WHAT THEY ARE HERE AND WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VOTE ITS A BIG LIE,,,LIKE USA IS A DEMOCRACY WHERE THEY HAVE ONLY 2 CHOICES DEMOCRATES OR REPUBLICANS > CAN WE HAVE OTHER WAY ? CAN USA PAY THEIR OWN PRESIDENT NOT A PRIVATE AND RICH PEOPLE ? CAN BE NATIONAL BANK A PEOPLE BANK NOT A PRIVAT THX PUTIN YOU SHOWING US THE WAY AND AGAIN RIP I HAVE NOTHING ABOUT ABE BUT ABOUT THE PRESS AND THE LIES
I'm sure he knew something.he shouldn't have.Rip
The world is getting ugly so much violence, corruption, hate, war, I live in the US and this entirety of what is going on globally does not surprise me. In the US alone there is definitely political division here and mass shootings happening right now, but for Japan to have this kind of situation happen, sort of shocks me, as I always viewed it as a peaceful nation, but with everything going on violence is happening all over, no nation will go unturned or unavoided.  Everyone please stay vigilant and stay safe. These are crazy times indeed.
They will not let me get on a flight airplane flight they won't even let me book airplane flight out of United States
Oh look, the high-profile political figure who advocated for Zelensky to step down from joining NATO in direct class with USA's interests, suddenly got assassinated in one of the countries with the lowest crime rates and strict gun-control laws... this is an entirely *unexpected* and _shocking_ development
All the NATO members they are trying to do this to they are trying to cover up Joe Biden and the vice president also he was sitting right beside Joe Biden a couple years ago and a couple months ago before this even happened
"Japan's ex-leader Shinzo Abe dies after being shot "at" during speech."  NO, Mr. Abe was decidedly not shot "AT" (which implies the shooter missed, absent any further clarification).  Mr. Abe was SHOT and killed!    Cheese, how hard can it be to write correctly?
RIP Abe-San.
What's the reason?
This is a big loss, Abe was a good leader and a good guy.
Was the KGB behind this?
Condolences to Japan 🇯🇵 Abe was a great leader. Such shocking news.  Peace and love 🇬🇧 to you mighty people 🇯🇵
RIP Shinzo Abe San.Long live Indo Japan friendship.
Japan is done Son  !
Great leader!!!
Can you all do me a favor can Japan do me a favor can you put put roses around him because he really was a good influence on people and he really was a positive person
Ok, so who did it? And what is their reason ...
I didn’t know much about him, but he seemed like a good leader who shouldn’t have been gunned down/murdered like that. Condolences, Japan. 😭
Why can't this happen to Putin. Cmon Russian sheeps, do your part.
Good news for Asia one less trouble maker & US puppy. Now he can rest in hell.
I am not a Japanese, but I have always admired and appreciated the works that he served for his country people and some other countries including my homeland. I prayed for him although he had no vital signs after he got shot. I am saddened to find out that he didn't make it.
The fact the suspect knew where he’ll be within 24 hours tells me its an inside job within the politicians.
No they came from United States of America that really did in several other businesses was paying at me and also I got to Intel that that was going to happen and that if that is to me and they tackle he was over it you know he was over in the United States at the White House and at the Pentagon in Washington DC and at the white at the FBI headquarters he even Blended in with the US Marshals also
Glad no name was given for the murderer.  THEY should never be named.  No acclaim to murderers.  USA should have same policy.
What is the word coming to so sad
RIP
Damn
This assassination will not be unrelated to the conflict in Ukraine, the upcoming war in Taiwan and the great Middle East war.The resignation of Boris Johnson and the upcoming election of Donald Trump are the next dominoes to be affected by this tragedy
What was his security detail doing?  CRAZY and the killer is standing right there with a GUN hanging from his neck?
Well lesson learned like JFK open-top limousine.
Condolence to the family of Abe and Japan , think he was a great leader ,hope your in country does not become another USA
2:18 every other news source I've seen said that he is at least 47. after all if he's only 41, it would've been odd that his 3 yrs of military service ended in 2002 as reported by most news outlets as of this morning
We can't but look back for the Man's value. RIP Abe.
usa empire will need another japan vassal puppet
WOW.....Japanese people can use a gun ????....anyway Im suprised...RIP Shinzo.....bet nobody thought that would happen in Japan.
Because of this unbelievable incident especially was happened in peaceful town ‘Nara’, it made me realize that how much Japan has changed and my aspect about the safety in japan not the same as the past anymore
It was from United States it was from the White House and a lot of other businesses in several other states in the United States I got the Intel that that was going to happen ahead of time several years ahead of time I even got the Intel it was going to happen at 7-Eleven in Baltimore Maryland and in Martinsburg West Virginia at room details apartment complex several days ago I even tried to get in touch with your pants security I tried to get in touch with Japan to let them know something was up even he knew something was up years ahead of time and I tried my best to protect him and everyone else all my life I have tried to protect even the movie stars and singers I want them banned from Japan even the Rich and Famous even the President and Vice President of the United States of America he wasn't the only person that they was trying to do this till they raped us and tortured Us in the United States they even waterboarded us several years back to back they're even trying to do that tornado members also and a several other movies Stars will several singers also and they are trying to do that to me also just be careful
Wtf?!! Awful!  :(
That’s an interesting way of saying “assassinated”
🙏🙏🙏💔😇
Yet pro chinese ccp people are mocking and praising this great prime minister's shocking death. There are theories that the Chinese government are behind this assiantian
So sad. I love Japan and their people. I hate to see this.
F in the chat
I can’t believe that in such a nice, peaceful country, someone would do such a thing 😔
This is sad. My heartfelt condolences.May his soul rest in perfect peace. And may God comfort his family and loved ones.
My deeply condolences to his family. Rest in peace Mr. Shinzo Abe.
One of the greatest leaders of the world! The good people all over the world will keep you in their mind! Thank you for all you’ve done for the world! It’s a lose to Japan and the world as well!
Utter shock! This is extremely extremely rare event in Japan. My deepest condolence for the entire Japanese people. 🙏🏽🇯🇵RIP Abe.
Can't be USA Japan don't have oil
Lord have mercy
God bless Shinzō Abe, fighting on the front lines of government till his last moments, May he rest in peace.
Is there a video ?
it may be a hit. someone or a group of ppl probably hired a hitman.
Such a shocking and heartbreaking news, my deepest condolences goes to the family and friends of Mr shinzo Abe, especially the people of Japan, world will remember this tragedy, he served as a great leader, he was a friend of our country... 🇵🇰🌺🇯🇵
Senseless crime my deepest condolences
This is very unlikely coming from Japan 🇯🇵. Extremely shocking.
This is so sad to have happened while he was helping someone prayers for Japan
Why couldn't this of happened to Biden or Putin?
A very sad day for everyone across the globe. RIP Shinzo Abe, from the United States.
wow... that's insane?
I wouldn't be surprised if China had something to do with it....
BBC does it again. Worst "reporting" in the world, next to Jazzera. "Shot at"? No, he was shot twice from behind and died as a result of his wounds. "Guns are so hard to get hold of" and "violence is so uncommon" are absurd comments grounded in fantasy.
🥲🥲
Please band everything from United States from even coming to Japan please win flights from United States to Japan and please block the cargo ships coming from United States also headed to Japan I really am sorry I really try to protect my godfather and I really try to protect my godmother and all of my family he was one of the people when I got when I got when I got baptized he was one of the many of men he used to take care of me when I was a kid there was several other world leaders when I was a kid all of Japan's people it is in Congress and everything else I really am sorry I'm not going to be able to be there for my godfather and godmother and all of my family I am sorry I'm not going to be able to be there for Japan also
What the "Fears" is who is next? Is that's going to be someone looney who is China's puppet like all other countries minus India or someone better then him? This is not SAD but a DANGEROUS news. Not sure but this act endangers many other nation's PMs and Presidents. World is at a peak of TRUE UNREST. Question is Why? Why was this done? What's there to gain? I can see this will be attempted in many other nations.
He was died ? fool bbc it was murderd by a leftiest  😡
De mortuis nihil nisi bonum
Clapped
I hope the man who shot him gets shot up the ass in prison.
Probably a gift from China.
Sad news. Yet the very worst remain.
Sound like somebody didn’t like who he was supporting.
That is what happen when u go against China.
If it wasn't for him Japan would have fallen way back in the world economy. Rarely a politician has the skill and patriotism. Sad times for Japan. RIP .
Shocking - heart breaking news, RIP , SAD SEEING GREAT PATRIOT MAN ASSASSINATED TOO. CONDOLESCENCE HERE,  HOPING DUDE GETS DEATH PENALTY
Poor wife. What s shock! And his 90 yr old mother. The japanese peoples hearts are with you
Looks like those gun laws don't work
Coward attack, shoot from behind, there are two body guards guarding Abe' s back, how did it happen? Seems like a political. He made enemies inside Japan and abroad. Sad to say he was murdered in broad daylight and one of the safest country and the most discipline. Rest in Peace PM Abe.
What's shocking is that SP as secret service was not providing protection and let the suspect to shoot twice... Police was just standing and doing nothing.
HOW DID THEY GET A GUN IN JAPAN?!?!!? THAT'S LIKE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
Nara, like Dallas, became infamous forever. And surely the murderer will not survive like Kennedy's murderer.
in 28 years of my life I hear something like this happens in Japan, wtf.
Bbc keep ur rare voilence to urself ....its japan not america...japanese culture and histroy not connected with bbc
Condolences
Was the man who killed Shinzo Abe a member of the Yakuza? Maybe Shinzo Abe was killed by China or Russia. Also, North Korea may have wanted him dead for some reason.
Shinzo Abe amar rahe. ଭଗବାନ ଶ୍ରୀ ଶିନଜ଼ଓ ଆବେ ଙ୍କ ଅତ୍ମା କୁ ସ୍ଵର୍ଗ ରେ ଶାନ୍ତି ରେ ରଖନ୍ତୁ।
Which organization do you belong to? Which association are you hiding yourself to promote violence? Which tribe do you hide to promote killing, stealing and destruction? Who has turned you into not only  a spiritual terrorist but a physical one. Kidnapping people, innocent souls, killing them anyhow. Destroying them and their families. Blood is sacred and should never be wasted by anyone. Christopher Orji!   If you cannot live along people with different views, from different religions, status or creed, kindly ask God to take your soul away from this earth instead of working for the kingdom of darkness to kill and destroy human lives. May the former Prime Minister Rest In Peace. 😔
That's a kill shot
RIP! Unacceptable reality! Why are good people so unfortunate!!! Remember that 2 years ago, you resigned the prime ministership because of physical discomfort but ppls’re waiting u for return. Shinzo Abe, Japan's Longest-Serving Prime Minister, Abe had been an "outstanding leader of Japan and unwavering ally of the US".  He is a respected politician".
I'm sorry that I will not be able to make it to Japan for my Godfather's funeral I really want to be there for my family and I want to be there for my godfather and I want to be there for my godmother also even my god sister and my god brother also all I want to do is get away from the United States for good
Condolences to his family and the people of Japan. May you support each other in this difficult time. From someone who care in South Africa 🇿🇦
This is horrible. I’ve live in Japan 🇯🇵 for over 8 yrs of life and recently left there in June ‘22. You never this type of violence in such a peaceful country. #RIPAbe-San 🕊🙏🏾💐
My deepest condolences; he was a great man who will be missed.
That extreme behaviour is disappeared few decades, now may be back again😶 Can't imagine if the assassin has linkage with China or Russia
Japan prohibits people from owning guns, but this criminal made his gun. That is why he was able to shoot. But Internet public opinion leaders in China and S Korea may now start saying that Japan is a dangerous country. Oh, it's depressing...we really can't do anything about all these enemies.
Sad News and also unexpected news from Japan, Yakuza is real
This shows that gun violence is everywhere no matter where you are. Rest in piece. I’m sure Shinzo made Japan really happy.
🇮🇳Very sad news😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Japan helps Bangladesh like a reliable friend. Bangladesh can never deny this. Sorry for Him.🇧🇩🇯🇵
It happened in japan.its the most shocking incident ever happened to me.
Thank you for your emails , i read them all the time !
Why dont you say "in terrorist attack"?!
This is sad
Good news! Abe thought kidnapped 12 year old Korean girls who were raped by 25 Imperial soldiers per day were just "prostitutes" and so it was ok. Fuk Abe and good riddance. Today is a good day.
Undercover assassination
Why xijingping and Putin still here?
Wouldn’t be surprised if a political opponent is behind this, Japan while generally safe and beautiful, has some slimey people
Dios mio
Meanwhile, in Venezuela, Maduro's still alive
A Tanto would have been nice. A gun has no homare.
I don't like him since he became a Japanese PM, but lost 1 Japanese person in this planet with too many stupid people is hard
Oh, a nationalist...
So sad
Shinzo Abe has died....it's more like Shinzo Abe has been assassinated.
अस्मिन्महामोहमये कटाहे सूर्याग्निना रात्रिदिवेन्धनेन | मासर्तुदर्वीपरिघनेन भूतानि काल: पचतीति वार्ता ||-   Yaksha had asked Yudhishthira, “What is the news?” In answer to that Yudhishthira said – In this frying pan of great illusion (the world), Time is cooking the Creatures with the fire of the sun having the days and nights as it’s fuel and the months and seasons constituting it’s ladle. This is news. Time consumes everything and hence one should utilize the available little time for his own emancipation. Many people do not realise that they are gradually being consumed by time and hence that is the news deserving widest publicity.
Such incident happened in most peaceful nation of Asia
Mr Abe was respected around the world and was the pride of the Japanese people. Such an end is unacceptable. It is wrong to change with violence. Japan, Asia and the world have lost a great man. I'm in the deepest sad as a Japanese. RIP Abe former prime minister.
Rest in peace. He took a shot to the neck that must have been a painful death.....
Peace hope he recovers
I wonder if the CIA knows more about it...
Damn what the hell this is awful Japan is a safe country. Death penalty for this evil SOB killer
Biden is next!
Omg.   This is so sad.   Just don’t understand why people are so cruel.  Terminating other’s life just doesn’t solve any problems in this world.  Japan has always been known to be a peaceful country in Asia.
those trolls who say "japan is safe" ok give all Japanese weapons i want see ur safe country 🤣🤣
I’m sorry japan for ur loss all politicals put them self in risk for us we all are sorry for what happened 😔👎🏻
Condolences for the people of Japan as well as for Abe's family from Finland.
It shows the world leaders we the people won't play your games anymore even though he didnt like the left like I dont but do your jobs or else. This is 1776 all over soon.
Drep condolences to the family
How did the person get a gun in Japan? From what I understand it's next to impossible to get one.
Being shot at ? he was shot not shot at lol nice headline lmfao
the saddest. love to Japan.
RIp Abe
the prime minister's security team has a lot to answer for ...
GOOD RIDDANCE.  Hope this Happens to Tyrant Biden 🙏🙏
So sad to hear this! I really liked him as a prime minister. Felt he served Japan well.  Bless his family and supporters!
It's actually quite fitting actually. Live by the gun, die by the gun after all.
In a country where they have such strict gun laws being shot to death is such a baffling way to go. My condolences to his family, not having a chance to say good bye to a family member must hurt on top of just the loss.
It's odd that you're not saying assassinated.
Plot twist: the Japanese man is a CCP assasin
How horrible and senseless.
He deserved it!!! 😁
Shooter was obviously a Chinese agent. Japan is on the Chinese agenda for future expansion. Increased military in Japan would make it a hard target.
(VIOLENCE)  It can happen anywhere people. dont know why people are shock.
Www3 officially on ..
It should have been Trump instead.
We're all on this earth for a purpose. He served his. RIP, sir.
67 years old and he looked 50, dude definitely had so much more life in him at such an age that its genuinely inspiring and its heart breaking that he's been taken this way. :(
Did that anchor seriously suggest Japan doesn't experience violence??? Lmfao people hack eachother with Katana and shit what is that dude talking about 🤣 literally cases of Japanese men breaking into kindergartens with knives stabbing kids I mean.... you don't need a gun to be a fuckin psychopath dude so sick of the anti-gun shit.
Interesting how people pretend caring about some random Japanese guy shot.
Devastating for Japan. Mr Abe was instrumental in keeping Japan on the World stage, and retaining it's status there. Well respected wherever he went, he will be sadly missed, both in Japan and Internationally..... A true Statesman.
Take notes "citizens."
see? when you are distracted by nuclear reactor, tsunami, earthquake, and brown newspapers that is when bbc makes news which you never expect
I really never followed Japanese politics but Abe's face is instantly recognizable as he travelled all over the world promoting his country.  My condolences to the Japanese who have lost a great statesman and for having to experience gun violence.
RIP Abe!!! The people of Japan and your friends and family love you 👪 👨‍👧‍👧 👩‍👧‍👧
I can see you are trying to spin things by saying it was "during a speech". He was campaigning not just giving a speech. BBC and your likes are blood suckers
very sad
The lapdog deserves its place
live by the sword die by the sword
I didn’t even know he was no longer prime minister
Easily one of the most loved leaders in the world.
As much as I hoped for it, I knew this would never happen to Trump because all the crazy morons in this country were literally his main fan base
This is barbarism no doubt. However, the BBC's reporting is confusing: This video says the suspect (a Japanese veteran btw) shot Mr Abe for disliking his policies. However, the Taiwanese news quoting from the Japanese police say that the suspect's reason is not political, but for a serious dislike of the Mr Abe.  Security camera at the time of the shooting shows the suspect was standing behind Mr Abe and clapping from time to time. He used a home-made gun, perhaps something he learned to make as a soldier. It is all very weird.   Also, to mention that Chinese netizens "celebrating" on this matter sounds like typical British warmongering, omitting a key factor that the suspect is a Japanese military veteran.   RIP.
Very sad
I will never forget when me and Shinzo went to the mall together we went to hot topic and tried on sun glasses he would look at me with that beautiful smile and say “this looks Nicee , and I said yesss you should get them they Kawaii , then we went to the movies and watched the interview, we never laughed so hard 🫶🏻 miss u forever shinshin
The 3 more world leaders will  get assassination before the WW3 starts
R.I.P Mr Shinzo Abe
Why is there so much smoke? Were blanks being fired?  Something seems strange here
I am heartsick! However, folks, don't be surprised. It's true. It's the SAME DEVIL everywhere we are dealing with! Praying for you and your family. My dear brother.💝🙏🏿🙏🏿
But guns are illegal in Japan. This can't be real.
This comes very shocking if you know most ppl think of Japanese ppl as very respectfull ppl who are very respected around the world, ofcourse you always have crazy ppl in every society
How? Guns are pretty much illegal.
The only thing surprising about this is that it didn't happen in the USA
"Shot at"
RiP homie, he was a good friend and  master
Rest in Peace Abe Shinzo, you will always be remembered as one of Japan's influential prime minister.
So sad to hear this. Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe
*R.I.P* 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
"some Chinese nationalists are celebrating his death" such a shame
This is bizarre. Didn’t expect such in Japan
The world is truly falling apart geez
My favorite leader in the world even I'm Not Japanese people,  Rest in peace Otto san
Again Putin😃!?
Go, Brandon！
Haven’t wars started because of assassinations?
I am absolutely shocked...at how BIG that chick's forehead is! Damn she hurt her mama lmao!
What kind of security service was there,
Governments around the World have created so much stress upon the citizens that more of these incidents will occur....hopefully Klaus Schwab is the next to be wiped out.
when you see such brutality in a peaceful  country like Japan, you will lose hope and trust,  a lot of love from Iranian people,  rest in peace man
May his soul rest in peace, this shows that no where and no one is safe.
What a weird title. I guess he didn't get shot? He just died after getting shot at? Also, I guess he just was their "leader" not the former longest serving president.
My condolences to Mr shinzo family 💂‍♂️RIP
I am very saddened by Shinzo Abe's death. Why did he have to die like this?! He was a good man and a wonderful leader. My heart is breaking inside because of this!! R.I.P. Mr. Abe-san...the world may have lost you, but you will never be forgotten 🙏
The current leader said with a chuckle .
RIP😔
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N4Pi_YUsZU
this man had a family.. i can't begin to fathom how they must be feeling right now..
RIP to one of the greatest Prime Ministers of Japan in the last 50 yrs.
'dies' is such a passive word for what actually happened. He was killed, assassinated...
What happens when you refuse to give poison vaccines to your people.
PM Shinzo killed after all of these years? Killed after Rahm Emanuel becomes Japan Ambassador 🤨 🤔 😏
I am in still in shock.
To bad he got the wrong one he should have come to Canada
There are not very many leaders in this world that I thought of as competent, wise, or even likable but Abe had always been a reminder toe that those types of leaders can exist. Very sad that he was offed like our a Abe Lincoln.
Shocking!!
Should have been Putin….
Nothing in this world will make all the people happy, when you do something even if it's the right thing someone will still hate you.  RIP PM Abe!!!!
These 🇮🇳 will definitely have a hand in this murder, they are the instigators of all issues in Asia
I heard the shooter was aiming at Klaus Schwab.
"Alot of Chinese Nationals celebrating his death"🤔
So sad that it can happen in Japan. Condolences to the ppl of Japan.
Means japan aint such a peaceful and safe country after all.. they’re just considered safe cuz we compare them to usa india or the middle east countries. When we compare japan to Korea, japans waay dangerous and unsafe
who did that is a hero
I doubt it...on the Left...the Golden Retriever Boris, then on the right Abey Baldwin retreats to his yachts...
Isn't it murder? Shot at? Has died??
Sad news god bless 🙏
Wow that’s just crazy. Rest In Peace! Who’s gonna take his place?
Rest In Peace ✌️
So very sad so sorry to all of Japan and the world for his loss 🙏❤rip
American say if he had a gun he not get shoot.
🙏❤️🌞
Finally got the retribution👏🏻 Thx god🥂
Give him a new heart, push electricity, put him on life support lungs. He isnt dead until you give up. Bring him back
Japan’s death penalty activated!
"he's a controversial figure", but his critics can be seen here using slanderous broadcast and senseless murder. i think it's easy to judge who earns reputation of being controversial
This is so awful!  This is so heartbreaking My deepest condolences to his family and friends.  I would never have dreamt of something like this happening to him.This is so heartbreaking. Can't believe this incident is happened in such a peaceful country.Rest in Peace Mr.Shinzo Abe...a very strong leader, who pulled Japan out of recession and economic downturn. Japan and smaller nations in the region will definitely miss him.❤❤❤🧡🧡🧡💛💛💛💚💚💐💐💐🌸🌸🌸💮💮💮🏵🏵🏵🌹🌹🌹🥀🥀🥀🌺🌺🌺🌻🌻🌻🌼🌼🌼🌷🌷🌷
I had to laugh out loud when the talking head said, ‘’ world leaders have expressed shock.’’ Who is leading the world? Everything is a lie and every political clown a liar. No one is elected, rather selected. The only goal of these circus performers is to do what their told so that the video of them performing heinous acts is not released to the public.
This is an awfull and brutal tradgedy. The former president was a great man.   RIP Mr. Abe and condolences to his family and associates
Gods speed mr.Abe..
Rip in peace🍂💔🍂Om mani padme hum💟🙏🙏🙏🌿🕊🧎‍♀️
Very nice video!
Read the history of Japan. The rich clans against the rich clans, killings aafter killings, and the opression of the naive working poluation. Nothing has changed. Capitalism - people die at their work place, unempployment, homelessness, poverty, working poor.
Political violence is incredibly rare in Japan
So heartbreaking..
😔😔😔
Wtf! Why did he die? Shooter is a jerk
Japan is meant to be one of the most peaceful in the world, where you rarely can get hold of a gun.
He maybe not the best leader .. but he is better than most world leaders these days .. he tried his best for his country though .. rest in peace ..
So sad RIP my friend 🥲
Capitalists desperately want a war !!!!😁😁😁
Another one falling under the heel of the globalists aka communists.
I feel disgusted living in China right now and reading all these posts on my feed about how they're happy and celebrating, even one of my "friends" posted saying tonight drinks are on him, absolutely disgusting inhumane behaviour. I don't care what happened in world war 2, this man wasn't even alive back then, he had nothing to do with it. Most importantly, politics aside, this man had a wife, he was a father to someone, a grandfather to someone, he had a family, and he was taken away from that. That's the most heart breaking thing to me
There will be a judgement day sir . there is God rest n peace . God will punish who do evil
He was one of the good guys…RIP🙏🏻
i thought they didnt have guns in this country that it was like almost impossible to get a gun well here you go.
Holy shit he died?
Who dies after being shot at lmao
crazy.  Shinzo Abe  i hope you are in a good place i will pray for you
Ha gottem
ごめんなさい...ごめんなさい!!
Sad news
Bangladeshi people will miss you Shinzo Abe 🇧🇩🇯🇵
Under his leadership up to 2020  suicide in adult male Japanese men was the highest in history apart from during the war with kamikaze pilots,
"dies after being shot at" .....He was assassinated. He was shot. He died from being SHOT....the wording is so pathetic
As a Japanese, I was very shocked when this news came out suddenly… First it was reported that Mr.Abe collapsed during a speech, so I thought that he had a heart attack or something. Later, it was reported that he actually got shot in the chest, and the health situation was very difficult. Several hours later, he was claimed to have died due to blood loss because of the injuries on his neck and heart.   The most shocking part is that a famous politician was shot dead in daylight and public while he should have been protected by many police officers. I couldn’t imagine something like this because Japan is one of the strictest countries for gun control, but the attacker reportedly created a gun by himself. The loss of a great politician would be a tragedy for both Japanese and global politics, but we will never forget what he had achieved through his career.
Shinzo Abe is a hero…
Feels so weird something like this happened in Japan. May he rest in peace 🙏
Of course the Japanese would shoot their own leaders.
Oh this is some shit that would expect in the US not Japan!
What?!?!
Rip
James Cann can’t catch a break
Who sent the assassin?
Rip 😢
Prayers for all governments to be in direction of God and Jesus 🙏🕊️💗. Churches pray 🙏.
This is indeed shocking new. Very unfortunate 😭 it feels personal loss to Indians 🇮🇳♥️🇯🇵
He killed by mercenary payed by UK monarchy. All WEST PRESIDENTS - elected by UK Monarchy.  All WEST "independent" countries is COLONIES of UK Monarchy
Very sad as he was a good man.
Off topic, but her glasses are way too small for her head
We live in perilous evil times!  This is such shocking grievous news.
china is celebrating
😔😞😞😣😞😓
If this could happen in a country with strict gun laws, how much more in the US where Gun laws are not that strict and civilians are able to purchase and own a gun legally, no wonder why they have 200+ Mass Shootings just a few months into 2022.
😭
The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. And it seems, he really stood out. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️☝🏾☝🏾🙎🏾‍♂️ This is sad!
So sad to lose a political figure like that!!!
So sad 😥
Rest In Peace
Rip Best leader.   everyone love you to
Faulse flag operation to start a war with China and Russia. Enjoy it !!! Capitalists rule !!!
Why criminals always make great men look like nothing????!!#
Democracy isn't a good system of people.
So now the question is how much Brandon paid to have Abe killed.
Why was he shot?? Why was he set up??
Popular leaders should of been protected.
Do you remember JFK? Over 200 vitnesses mesrireously "died". We are ruled by criminals. Nothing new for intelligent people.
Russian cell
Sorry to the Japanese people for their loss. Straight thinking conservatives have become an oppressed and endangered people. Hopefully, we can be galvanized world-wide to oppose a non self-sustainable (without the contributions of the conservative sector) liberal militant segment. RIP Sir.
China is ramping up it's war efforts
Means even Japan is not a safe country
Russian assasination! Because he has influence and. Acks Ukraine sending weapons! Did you forget who Putin realy is?
Condolences 💐 to Mr. Abe and his family.   He seemed so mild mannered that I wonder what motivated the assassin. This just goes to show how dangerous Politics is.  Was the gun a homemade weapon? Because guns can’t be bought in Japan legally. Very sad news.  RIP
This is what happens to you when you get in the way of the New World Order.
A great day for most of the WWII victim Asian countries to see some one finally got his judgement and punishment for visiting and worshipping WWII war criminals 4 times as PM in  Yasukuni Shrine! Westerners, if you don't understand this. just imagine some one build a church to worship Hitler in Germany and the German Chancellor goes and worships that place every year. That's what Abe did. 4 times!
Nobody untouchable.
RIP Prime Minister Abe. I can not believe such a great man passed this way in the country of Japan.
RIP
maybe I need to reconsider my trip tp japan😅
Chinese assassin...?
The Abe administration falsified GDP results. It continued to deceive the public that the economy was booming and imposed heavy taxes, incurring public anger. Of course, he should have been made to understand this through elections, not murder.
I don't understand nothing anymore, how could this happen in such a country like Japan. such a peaceful developed country. Who did this?
Why dont they show the part when he got shot . And did the shooter get caught?
Capitalism is a planet scale fraud (and crime). This has been gpoing on for centuries. Nothing new. Learn history.
I am so saddened by the passing of this man.. I have never heard anything bad about him; he carried Japan and was the face of Japan as long as I can remember. I hate to say this; but Rest in Peace Mr Abe; you didn't deserve what happened to you
Prayers and healing for the families. Give the good people protection to those that are yours and churches prayers 🙏🕊️💗.
Sounds like Japan needs some gun reform.
Fare thee well Shinzo, ditto Putin!
Rest in peace! Can't believe this.
Wonder if China is involved... Killing opposition is the communist's way after all.
To take another persons life is not what we were put on earth for 💔 R.I.P. 🙏
Amen Me Shinzo Abe Will Rest Well In Heaven With the care of Jesus Christ and God YHWH
The killer is a chinese or a russian
He had cancer that's why he resigned from his position why not let old wonderful man rest on God's will!? Prayers and thoughts goes to the family
I very sad.....!Abe was an  innocent man..!! RIP   ነፍስህ በሠለም ትረፍ......
Rest in peace former prime minister Mr. Abe
Is this a joke, BBC? Is there a reason you can't say the word "assassinated?"🤨
It is a tragic loss to the Japanese people and the world. Very sad. He now rests in peace.
Sort of like Kennedy’s assassination, dead end case with just a single lone gunner, zero connection to anything or anyone, wow. Kennedy was Russia, this one by Russia or China too, no doubt about it.
He always seemed like such a nice man and it is always such a tragedy whenever anyone dies like this.  Such a terrible waste.
Who would do this to him?
This is not normal to Japan,if this is happened to Japan, it means to say that the world have no chance anymore to be good, Japan have the most strictest gun law.
can the shooter make it to the us...........................................
What a dumb headline. "Dies after being shot 'AT'. No. He died from being shot. Not like a gun went off in his vicinity and he had a heart attack. Or better yet, say what it was. He was assassinated by a gunmen.
Rest in peace.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
my tiredness from work has been replaced by anger and resentment Rest and peace Former prime minister Abe you are one of the ones who seal the hearts of our Filipinos Sir  ￼
Meanwhile in malaysia harga ayam melambung and everyones goin bananas
Has been murdered
RIP Shinzo Abe you will not be forgotten. Your voice will not be silenced it will continue to bring a better life to all.
JAPAN STAY STRONG!!!!!!!!!!💔
I hope that the "person" that killed him gets locked in prison and rots there for the rest of his life. This is just unthinkable! The only Japanese society that the killer should experience from now on should be one in a brutal prison. Japan as a country is like a phoenix that was reborn from its ashes. "People" like that who come to disrupt a peaceful and progressive country should be kept away.
Come on BBC correct this headline. The former Japan Prime Minister was ASSASSINATED during his live public speech!
Nara is in the old Iga province.  Iga is the birthplace of ninja.
It's too shocking  I PRAY ALLAH MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE
I wonder the motive? Political assassination is so rare these days (thankfully).
Another murder by the American special services of a foreign politician who tried to pursue an independent policy. He was like a bone in their throat.
why he shot him what was the reason?
"Its so hard to get  hold of a gun..." Yeah, for you nerd. Abe was likely supporting a controversial (aka bad) canditate, i dont see other way this happening.
Violence happens Everyday in Japan! They just don't let the world know! There ruthless just like the rest.
Wtf kind of gun was that?
If it would only happen to Trump!
My sincere condolences toMr. Abe's family and indeed the people of peaceful Japan. I'm personally shocked coz  Japan is known for ✌.  I woke up to the shocking news today. I personally had a special liking for the man. He was calm. May the person who committed this violent act not know peace. Let justice be applied here.
Very unusual for this to happen in Japan,  Just watch the clamp down on Freedoms
He was an American puppet,  good riddance.
He wants Japan to invest more on defense. China wouldn't want that, won't they?.......
En latam no dicen nada sobre esta noticia... Increible.
Good and peaceful leaders will soon all be replaced by wicked monsters for the end times.
Like community service for 60/40
A  fine politician and a good man.may god give him peace.condolences to his family and Japan.
F
It's a way to go on fuckin politicians who caresless about their people!!
Shame USA Media for not making this your NUMBER ONE STORY. Thank you BBC for at least acknowledging Shinzo Abe's terrible assassination
He was the Japanese version of Narendra Modi
Good that’s for killing the whales love the whales just like 2010 when japan got hit by that wave I can’t kill whales with out payback
aichou desu
What a nightmare? Very sad indeed.
Reposez en paix !😔
Omg
RIP/ so shocking to hear this. My condolences to his family.
RIP sir
Rest in love. 💝
indeed a tremendously uncivilized act. not much surprises me these days, but this very public and brutal killing seems out of place to me.
This is truly shocking news.
He blasted him with a big gun
i cant believe these fake words of support.  he was a terrible leader, the world is better without him.
R.I.P
Western block involved in this for sure...
RIP Shri Abe. India stands by Japan in this tragic moment. Shri Abe was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2021. He was a great friend and advisor to India. The Indian Government has declared an official day of mourning tomorrow in India. We stand by his family and the entire Japanese people in this hour of great loss. Jai Japan. Jai Hind.
Knowing how Japan is...I wouldn't want to be that guy who was caught...he is in for a rough time
So sorry for him and his family. My condolences.
Have they caught the person who shot him?
Americans, I know Japanese need to all go out and buy AR15s no background check no license just flood the country with assault rifles and this will stop it is working great in the USA.
ん
About time
This is so sad.
A Chinese government plot to weaken the might of other Asian countries and the beginning stages of WW3, but Biden and his cronies will do nothing.
No loss. This guy was a jerk. Despite what right-wing Japanese nationalists think, he was very bad for Japan. It is fitting that one of his own military did this. It will probably not stop the right-wing, nationalist Japanese from blaming it on someone else though, unfortunately. A lot of other dictators and political leaders could follow him and maybe the world would be a better place for it.  I do feel sad for his loved ones though.
First Netherlands, now Japan…  Any bets on the chances that the weapons black market got ahold of stuff from the US flooding UKR with weapons (we didn’t bother tracking) and that may be the origin of this gun violence in nations where this has been unheard of for decades🤔🤨🤔
Completely shocking - sad for Japan..  Even with tough gun laws, people find a way to get a gun
there is a place for politics after life, called "HELL"!!!!
Only a COWARD shoots you from behind. RIP Shinzo.
bad news for the political world...a prelude of the future?...
Hmmmmm....... suspicious.
I can’t believe
This was a political hit!
lol look at all these cucks of globalists politicians
I know abe was imperialist & actual dictator in japan politics. He was not a ruler but it exist unchangeable politic system in japan. Abe exist in center of that.
জাপানেও সন্ত্রাসী কর্মকান্ড হয় হালায় যামু কই।
The Japan Elvis Priestly has died; my sympathy.
RIP 安倍先生
What a coward. You can disagree his political views as many people do, but you have no right to take away his life, unless the leaders like Putin.
Very sad to hear this news. Mr. Shinzo Abe was a great leader, patriot and a true friend of india. Condolences to his family and to japanese people from india.  May his soul rest in peace..🙏 🇮🇳🇯🇵🇮🇳🇯🇵
Japan isn’t even relevant after losing world war 2, only thing they do is economic growth
Saki faki sushi lomg time
CCP 50 cent army are celebrating beyond the keyboard
Biden at it again!
Wow so liberals and democrats also cause violence in other countries
it much better putin died because of his demonic act than abe died.. rest in peace...
❤️☮️🙏
This is a rather sadden and shocking development. Abae was an elegant, peaceful and decent leader. My heart is very touched by this sadden news. My heart is with his families and fellow Japanise who are currently in mourning. May his Saul rest in peace! Prayers from Ethiopia 🇪🇹.
The shooter might not be a japanese
Blame Washington
Hey BBC, that's called an assassination. Say it with me now. Assassination
Communists/socialists eliminating strong conservative leaders... disaster... absolutely, devastated moment in our humanity... our freedom is fading away.... and red communism masked dictators and globalists will slavering entire global citizens .... absolutely doom to human rights and freedom..... very sad.
This man visited a shrine to WWII war criminals regularly.
I am completely dumbstruck.
Everyone keeps complaining about the elite class that allowed lockdowns etc and made big money from pharma.... This guy is (was)one of them. I feel this needs to keep happening.  The shooter is a hero to everyone who's been hurt by the policies these people implemented long after knowing it was a farce. Biden. Trudeau. Boris.Macron.merkle. Soros. Gates. Freeland. Pelosi. Morrison. The list of hard targets.
I’m shocked
RIP ONE OF THE  MOST INFLUENTIAL HUMAN BEING EVER LIVED IN THIS WORLD..... OM SHANTI
You disagree with someone and you react by killing? Horrifying. He was not even in office anymore.
They have to take everyones guns away in Japan in order to stop gun violence. Oh wait they already did that.
I wish it was Lavrov in his place. We gonna miss Abe.
One of the best leaders in post-war Japan; and Indian's and Taiwan's best friend. I mourn with our dear friends in Japan.
He dies, Trump lives. Something wrong with that.
May you rest in peace  Deepest sympathy to the Japanese people 🙏
Determined Japanese Leader, who wanted to make Japan stand on its feet. OM SHANTI 🙏🇯🇵🇮🇳
I never met Mr Shinzo but when I heard news for first time I was totally taken aback for a movement rip 🙏 🕊
Shinzo abe assassinated….we all know who that shit leads back to , china is dirty asf ….I put it on everything i love..that it was them..of course nothing to leads back to them….ccp nationalists were celebrating his death on weibo and then it was taken down real quick…the shade is real…he had alot of influence and china knows that if they want asia they have to remove that influence
Why is there so many gun violence in 2022? All he wanted is to do is speech😰😰😰
Sadly, goes to illustrate that the criminally inclined can acquire whatever firearms they need...whatever gun control rules are in place.
It’s funny seeing all these comments on “mY sInCeRe CoNdOlEnCeS aNd HeArT gOeS tO jApAn” when all these brainwashed zombies have no idea what he has done 🤦‍♂️ it’s actually cringe 🤡🤡
The whole Chinese people are celebrating. I'm very ashamed to be a Chinese because of many cursed remarks
Thoughts & Prayers...  To a right-wing populist, ultra-conservative nut bag who denied & downplayed Japan's war crimes & atrocities during WWII. Historical Revisionists in Power have only one place in the universe: the business end of a guillotine. Sorry, not sorry.
Wow even the Japanese acting out now. RIP Abe 🙏 🇯🇵
A great statesman for Japan and the world. He didn't deserve to go out like this
This was a hit job by the NWO pushers make no mistake about it. I hope leaders like Putin are watching this and realizing that anything is on the table at this point. Every Liberal woke Democrat leader is now a target in my opinion. I hope good leaders of the world are coming to the same conclusion as I am.
ex-leader or Former PM? Odd word choice by the BBC. Regardless, a sad day for Japan.
China killed him. Hired by hunter biden and paid for by Biden. Welcome to the china takeover
Why you all said, he die!!!. He was kill, change your news.
Democratic party & World Economic Forum whacking more people
😟
His out of the way so now someone who can sale out Japan and maneuver in.
Out for words.😳😳😳 what a loss!!!
You think the title would say assassinated
Who could it be? Someone in big asia.???
It's really shocking to hear such kind of news from Japan.
So sad...why would someone do this???
A sad day!
What do this place tell ya all we have more dumb ass people on earth then ever before rip Shinzo Abe.
They need to make the shooter talk; I am sure the Japanese  police will be quite proficient in this matter.
Uncharacteristic of Asian People(s).
“Shinzo Abe dies after being shot at” Really?! People do not die from being shot at. Mr. Abe died from being shot!
My prays goes to Abe's Family and the Japanese people.
Prior to the Meiji era Japan was highly violent and politically so.
#CHINESE_MEDIA and people of china Celebrating abes Death ..... .....sad
Why are headlines not reporting it as an assassination?
RIP Mr. Abe
Sounds like a Chinese job yup he was a threat to them and there goals
America needs to take heed! Enough is enough
i think he should be rest in peace, not die like this, too misery, i don't know what hate makes this happen.
The Chinese & Rossiyan are more than HAPPY NOW !!!!!
He didn't like PM Trudeau so he was a very wise man...RIP.
I liked the way he visited the Philippines as a prime minister but was entertained in President Duterte’s  kitchen in his simple home in Davao.
Mr. Abe sounds like he was a conservative and a nationalist. That spells disaster for the globalists. I pray Japan's leadership continues with this nationalist approach. And make Mr Abe proud. May he forever RIP.
Now Japan is gonna be different like something out of a video game or anime and that's how Thier law may work
Shocking Rip.....
This is bigger …no just one crazy…. Powerful outside forces are working, warning. You know who they are.
Not Chinese nationalists...most Chinese people despise him. Chinese leaders are just being polite when they send their condolences. LOL.
Will you call the attacker a terrorist  or he should be a Muslim/Arab to call him like that!!! ???? Fuck you BBC & all Western media with pleasure 😇
Chinese will sleep well tonight.
Why China is making fun....& Enjoying.....this is very shameful 😡😡😠
*Legends never die, they always remain alive in our hearts. Shinzo Abe will definitely be remembered.*
*"They attacked my friend"* These four words are enough to tell how deep is India -Japan friendships 🇮🇳❤️🇯🇵 May God give power to Shinzo Abe's friends and family to bears this tremendous loss.
He traveled around the world bringing peace. My condolences to the family.
Alright
Strange
祭。日。快。乐。
First Hati now Japan smh
When this kind of thing happens even in Japan, you know the world is truly going to shit
Just because Xi doesn’t like him because he actually had a backbone, doesn’t make him a “divisive figure.” Japan and China have had an acrimonious relationship for the last thousand years… Of course Shinzo Abe was not beloved in China. Stop trying to turn him into a controversial figure for that. This is why people don’t like the press.
Was he shot at or shot?
How awful. My heart goes out to his family and friends as well as the people of Japan
That is world problem . That is lost of world . That is world sad day . 😢😢😢
Right wing fascist militarist who loved to pray at the Yakasuni shrine where Class A japanese war criminals are interned.....
God Bless
Potato Biden 🥔 was at least able to get his anti-gun talking point in when he sent his phony condolences
It’s really shocking news for Japanese peoples Nn all over the world that how this could be possible (Rip)
Japan has some of the strictest gun control laws too but that didn't stop this sad tragedy from happening.
Rest in peace
Japanese gun laws are so much more strict than American gun laws but here we are... Over there I'm pretty sure you have to apply for a permit and take classes before you can even own a .22 rifle
this is so sad
*_Without love and sense of humor life is meaningless._* 💕☮🌎🌌
Violence is not rare in Japan, it just doesn't get reported because Japan wants to boast this reputation
I’m living in Japan. Still can’t believe what happened. I don’t know about politics well but Shinzo Abe was my favorite politician in his personality.
Probably something to mention, but the last PM assassinated in Japan was Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932, 90 years earlier, also by members of the Navy.
"Dying after being shot", as opposed to "shot dead"? Is this the equivalent of "dying with covid"?
What happen to all the bodyguards?
Oh god can't believe..he was the best pillar for India and janpan relationship...pls accept my deepest condolences...stay strong Japan from India!!
RIP Shinzo Abe 🇯🇵  Very sad to hear this kind  of violence coming from Japan. Condolences to his family and Japanese people.
The Solomon's 3000-year-old project of total enslavement of the world has successfully come to a standstill and is coming to an end, as evidenced by the failure of the pandemic (multi-million anti-COVID demonstrations around the world), the lawlessness of global and local degenerate elites (those who unleashed the war in Ukraine, against whom, and who " judge-peacemakers"), attempts to artificially "launch" new viruses and lockdowns, hunger, conflicts in order to reduce the duped and fooled population, and so forth. Just look at the faces of ghouls-imbeciles who rule in America, the European Union and other places, in such organizations as the UN, WHO, NATO, etc., as well as those who heart-rendingly support them in privatized media channels and on the Internet , while simultaneously reinforcing CENSORSHIP in them ... The classic transitional period, when the degenerates (according to C. Lombroso, G. Klimov and many others) are trying with all their might to stop the objective arrival of the inevitable, in order for the cattle to be slaughtered to calm down and submit. So that cattle finally understand that “democracy is for us, not for you”, and no longer dare to oppose slavery (“... Most of all, we are afraid that their ... eyes will open ... and they take the weapon...” - H. Rosenthal). Due to the above events and objective reasons, more and more people around the world, thanks to the Internet, understand already that until “one important issue” is resolved, regarding those who rule all spheres of life in modern society (and not the some other small issues , switching attention and diverting the community away from its decision - "globalists", "aliens", "lords of the rings", "Nazis and fascists", "patriots and liberals", and some other "unknown forces"), CHANGES ARE IMPOSSIBLE … And… The crazier and more inhumane their behavior, the closer the collapse of these ghouls-degenerates… But all the same, everything will be the way it should be, and not the way “they” want, which is two big differences. This is an objective process. God grant that the innocent would have been suffered less on the Judgment Day predicted even by religious books... Amen...
r.i.p abe - philippines
a politician gets killed, WOW
Prayers for a quick recovery mate! 🙏
This is a very big loss to not only the family and friends, but also in politics. He was always anti-china and was pro-taiwanese .
Was he one of the ones that were trying to fight the New world order
COULD THIS HAVE....BEEN MADE TO HAPPEN?  TO DESTABILIZE ANOTHER  COUNTRY?   BY WHOM?   FOR WHAT  PURPOSE?   THINK  ABOUT  IT.  MR. ABE  WAS A GOOD MAN.  ON THE  WORLD  STAGE.
The Violance is spreading.......not just in usa
China did it i bet.
I hope the perpetrator gets the death penalty for this. He was a great leader and an all round wonderful human being
My deepeest condolences for  familiy,friends n japan,, 🙏🙏 i was been there when he becoming a leader in japan  even am just watch in tv,,,sayonara SHINZO ABE SAN
rip. a respectful leader in Japan
I trust There is a good reason he died. Rest in piss japan
Very sad indeed. The man was a Great leader and has kept Japan a World Partner of Highest Tier Standing. What a very sad act that a former JSDF  committed this senseless atrocity. If I remember correctly Just about Every World leader actually liked Abe quite a bit. My question is why isnt their a high level security amongst former PM and High officials in Japan. This man should had never gotten beyond the first check point with his obvious homemade Weapon system. So Sorry for the loss Japan. RIP.
RIP Mr Abe, condolences for the family 🇧🇩
BBC afterall tells the truth of the death of Abe.very good sayonara
私はとても悲しいです ご冥福をお祈りします
Feel like China had something to do with this assassination
Hard to get a gun? What you smoking? Ever heard of the YAKUZA?
What this proves strigent gun laws do not prevent gun violence!  When someone wants to get a gun and shoot another person they can do so regardless of severe or rigid gun laws!
xi jing ping is next, unuh can stay deh a laugh
This is very sad. Rest In peace, Shinzo Abe.
China may go hell for his death
Very suspicious as soon as Japan announced that they will reopen nuclear power he is shot to death someone has done it for a country in interest
sad news for that great nation my heart's out to you
Nobody cares about what the Nazi Japanese government did to Asian people, millions of civilians were massacred including women and children, tens of thousands of Asians were forced to be sexual slaves by the Nazi Japanese government, and tens of thousands of civilians were killed as live test body for developing biological weapons by the Nazi Japanese. There are only a few women victims still living in the world, some of them uterus or anus got stabbed with stick or knife by the Nazi Japanese, some got their breasts chopped by the Nazi Japanese, some young girls got sexual destroyed by bunch of Japanese soldiers.  A lot of people would say you should forgive past history, yes if the Japanese government did same thing like German government, sure. However, they're doing something completely opposite, no apology, instead they praise criminals who massacred Asian civilians. If you still believe history should be forgiven, would the Japanese government forgive this gentleman who triggered the gun?
rest in peace 😢
This is remind me with same accident to King Faisal Abdul Aziz Al-Saud from Arab :'(  Deep Condolence. Rest In Peace, Mr. Shinzo Abe.
Why is the word "assassinated" not used anymore. Saying that he was "shot" seems to be a sloppy way to describe what has happened.
Inside job  ....Japanese security is impeccable and they let it happen... ..Something 🐟 🐠 is fishy.
RIP Sir #Shinzoabe
??? Why the fuck are people getting sad over his death…?????
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all!
😭😭😭😭 im crying
Global Deep State eliminates another powerful populist.
Really sorrowful moments, heartfelt condolences to the people of Japan and to his family
RIP .
China for sure did it !!
This is very sad, may his soul rest in peace. Condolences to Japan and his family from Ghana.
お大事になさってください 🇯🇵
The gun seems to be self made by the criminal
the Supreme Court justices need to be shook right now
He was shot with a scatter load shotgun.  Those bullets were shot and exploded.  They were aimed at his heart, which means his heart was blown up.  He died basically instantly the moment he collapsed.  Blood transfusion is futile because blood must be oxygenated from the heart pumping to the lungs to get oxygen.  Without a heart, blood is useless.  Think heart attack.  Blood transfusion is only for blood loss.   No hospital would have a heart readily ready to be transplanted for him.  Even an artificial heart is not ready accessible.  There was no hope for him.  The assassin served in the Japanese self defense military before.  So he must know how to manufacture his own ammunitions.  I saw footage of his assassination. You can hear loud explosions and see smoke. His heart was aimed at.  The bullets exploded his heart.  He must have died instantly.
I expect Trump to have the same fate.
Political violence in modern Japan is rare! My i remind you of their Shogun wars? and before ...
The good old, Chinese nationalists. Celebrating, all the bad things, that happen.
Terrible 😢
Why can’t we say he was assassinated?
Tin foil time: Y’all think Xi had anything to do with this?
RIP
It was a matter of time
Look how well gun control worked. A improvised shotgun made from hardware store parts by a criminal with intent to kill. It's almost like all reasonable people have been saying exactly that for the last 50 years
rest in peace       this is sad😭
😭😭😭😭😭I am so pity on him
Durk not going to slide for him
World lost a true leader . A loss will not be recovered. RIP Mr. Abe.
americans are hypocrites, they nuked japan 2 TIMES and are now acting like they care. atrocious.
Isn't Japan supposed to be safe?
A glorious Prime Minister for us, Shinzo Abe is an irreparable loss for India. May your soul be blessed and this is a prayer to Lord Jagannath.
Of course BBC can't help but put a leftist spin on the story.   There is nothing wrong with National pride and doing your job to better your people.  He was definitely not some limp wristed globalist, and thats a good thing.
RIP Abe!
Trump lovers are so happy right now.
Hmmm, no guns there, so how did the shooter get a gun?  (theres no 2nd amendment there either)  Sorry for the man, in any case.
RIP from the USA
Death is real, Heaven is real, Believe in Jesus.
😲This is madness! Condolences to his family.
I want to give my sympathy so much, but if you know what Japan does to dolphins in Taiji, .. at least he didn't suffer, unlike the dolphins.
The lion of asia.... Pioneer of QUAD group 🙏🙏
lol
My deepest condolences to his family, om santhi
WOW what a tragedy
ironical fact is that Japan is such a peaceful country and that made Abe misinterpreted the gun shot as fireworks or explosion, which he stood there.   as Japanese myself, I still cannot believe he deceased so suddenly. he was such a great leader and we, Japanese give all love and respect to you😢😢 RIP
The same corporation owners, multi-billionaire sociopathic CEOS, control Japan the same way they control the USA. They kill people with impunity to make more money.
wtf. thats terrible. I thought guns were illegal?
I loved his reaction to trumps stupid handshake.
We lost a great global leader
RIP so sad
Wait is he a politician?
guns must be held accountable !
Things like this don't usually happen in Japan. This is truly shocking.
Really? No one is questioning how he obtained a gun and yet people want to ban guns in America. Criminals will still get guns if they want to.
What is happening in the world after covid 19 ppl av just gone mad!!!! Totally disgusting omg omg omg omg
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
He got what he deserved as a corrupt politicians. He and his wife and his thugs and goons pocketed millions of public money. Few examples are killing an innocent man who was pressured to cover up Moritomo Gakuin school scandal,. his wife lavish parties with public money, Abe's Sakura watching party scandal and so other,,,,,,,. After-all he was from a war criminal family
I am very upset that such a heinous incident happened in Japan. As a Japanese person myself, I have realized that people's empty words, "Japan is a peaceful country," have blinded them to the actual chaos inherent in the country.
How many people died because of him in his life tho .
As this year goes on it feels like we are in a parody of 1914
Apparently someone disliked him!
India lost a dear friend today.  R.I.P Late Former P. M. Of Japan🇯🇵 Shinzo Abe.  Condolences from India🇮🇳
This is totally out of character to hear this type of incident from this country. I wouldn't be surprised if they find Maga on the shooter's search history.
Twisted politician need kill more of them
Islam complements other religions, as it is mentioned in the Torah and the Injeel that there will come a messenger whose name will be Ahmad and the nation of Muhammad that God favored over many of those before them because they obey God and enjoin good and forbid evil. Among the good qualities of Islam are the enjoining good and forbidding evil, benevolence to the offender, supplicating for him with guidance and good manners, turning a blind eye to what is forbidden, preserving chastity, living a lasting heartfelt happiness that is found only in Islam, avoiding vices, loving goodness for all people, and pardoning the oppressor who repented and not oppressing people or Eating the rights of others.. Advice for you. Enter Islam. Just try and read the Qur’an
they need some more gun laws, obviously some guns still exist in Japan and they were able to kill this man, Japan must rise up against the guns soon other inanimate objects will attack unsuspecting humans
😭😭😭😭😭
Proof gun  Control doesn't work
I'm shocked! I still remember when he put on Mario Bros hat at the ceremony to welcome Olympics in Japan. Such a nice guy. Rest in peace Shinzo Abe 🇯🇵😥
Sincere deep condolence 🙏.... 💔 (from India)
Rest in peace Mr.Abe...condolences from Sri Lanka...!!
terrible :( i really liked mr abe!
"Shinzo abe was a very powerful.and influential figure in japan". And that's why he was killed.
I can't believe it can happen in Japan where this type thing is rare
American cancer of mass shootings is affecting the whole world now... This cancer is more dangerous than the Russian nuke. The US is really a big mess. Feel sorry for the old man... RIP...
未だに信じられない。日本でこんな事件が起こっただなんて。安倍さんが突然、こんな亡くなり方をするだなんて。 ただただショック。 トランプ前大統領やプーチン大統領さえも魅了した、人間的魅力のある方だった。 I'm shocked by this news. Even now, I can't  believe this incident happened in Japan, my country. Abe-san was good PM. He had warm humanity. He attracted even Donald Trump& Putin, and so on. After the end of WWⅡ, we've never had such a violent incident.
I really hate this timeline
I was shocked that he died
what did he know about Hillary?
First Johnson, then Abe, who is next? Putin and Xi did clearly state those who oppose their expansion and new world order will meet with dire consequences. Everyone knows the CCP have evidence of shady dealings of all world leaders, and they are coming to eliminate all those who disagree with their abusive policies. If no immoral evidence is found, then physical elimination is the next method. The CCP and Putin want to disrupt democratic governments, cause chaos and fear among those in the free world. Don't let them have their way!
R.I.P sir.you're great 🥺😔🌟
This is really shocking. Why is a great person like Mr. Abe Shinzo being assassinated? Please rest in peace (former) Japanese Prime Minister. Amen.
omg! R.I.P Sir and my condolences to his family and God bless.🙏🙏
I think there is more behind it :) Every politician is corrupt and have dirt under their boots. So what ever
Shooting a man twice in the back. How brave you must feel. They will find you. It won't be pretty.. My love and Prayers to the Families and the people of Japan.
I'm Japanese,Send from Japan. It is very sad that we lost a globally influential Japanese person.
Sending condolences to the family, friends and nation. From Kenya
Let's hope the next PM is just as firm and strong as he was
Sounds like a organized hit.
Coward pos the scumbag who did this should be hung on the spot
Keep on fighting the communists Taiwan. Don’t let Abe’s death in vain.
My opinion is that he is outshining the master, he left power and still too powerful, mr Abe will be remembered as a great leader and a great politician.
Japan gave America sushi and anime. America gave Japan gun violence.
Really shocking and sad news. RIP 🙏🙏
Assassin made himself a directional IED. It may be many things but it’s not a Gun
Sad the guards to render justice on the spot to the assassin
Surprising. I though that the assassin would have used a katana. Did Abe preside over the Fukushima disaster?  Was he a globalist or a Japan first leader?
My heart goes out to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after this tragic loss.
Bye Abe.
Where he’s gonna go after he die ? He’s gonna be a president after he die ? The power  of a president is nothing compare with the power of god
He was a good leader. Rest in peace.
I was not expecting to wake up to an assassination of an ex Prime minister...in JAPAN of all places. Jeez, RIP.
Black flag po
Out of all the countries, it's surprising that this happened in Japan.
My deepest condolences to Mr. Shinzo Abe's family, his friends and the people of Japan. May he rest in peace.
RIP Shinzo Abe, you did alot for many countries. 🙏
I heard the gun was an ar15
if he killed you he had the weapon he made and the effects of the shock attack and this helplessness is the correspondence of a man who killed him
Unfortunately to hear. Japan is one of the last true pure civilizations, let’s preserve them. They also have the oldest people living
Japanese people are well known as people of honor! What has been done to him is terrible to happen in Japan!
He came from a "political family" was part of the political elites seems like this was a planned and coordinated assassination attempt because he had top secrets information that they probably didnt want the public to know. Why need the FBI, CIA when any regular human with a brain can solve this case.
RIP TO SHINZO ABE
Really odd.  Japan is such a safe Country.
Holy shit wtf!!!
一遍... 死んで見る？Good riddance.
wow gun control really works
RIP
I'm so sorry for your loss. It affects so many more than "just" the person shot. Your country's grief must be palpable. 💜
Is there a video of him actually being shot on Youtube? or is Youtube not allowing it to be posted? Surely a camera actually caught the actual shooting. Also, who would have done this and why? Is this due to his speaking out about the Russian and China conflict with USA maybe? increasing military spending? other?
RIP to Mr. Abe
Sending Condolences to Japan from Mexico
Japanese politics seems so sudate compared to the UK just now
🎗 喪に服している  永遠の首相、常に精神的に
Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Sir passed away it's very shocking news , may the departed soul rest in peace , deepest condolences to his family and to the people of Japan in this difficult time. 🙏
stop killing people and the animals
If that happened in Japan (where it’s extremely difficult to get a gun), it could easily happen in the U.S.
Let's go Brandon Shitbritches 💩
Condemned the killer
Love  po
He was pushing to change the pacifist ideals of Japan technically he got he wanted but not in a way any of them would want ironic I guess
The Last Samurai, long live and prosper 🖖✨
RIP Former pm of Japan 😭😭Your good works and good Deeds will always be remember. May God give solace to his families and his countrymen.
Never thought something like this would happen in Japan. World just isn't as safe anymore
Good reporting.... sad subject matter
So said
震惊！震惊！！震惊！！！十分悲痛！！！向日本及世界的杰出政治家安倍晋三前首相，深表哀悼！！！我是中国大陆人。
If a former leader can get taken out, when will we see a current very bad, incompetent leader be taken out?  In these times, anything is possible.
Sorrowful po
We know Japan can again become a threat for humanity but for interest of our country we must support Japan and it's right wing govt Because war cannot be stopped from one side only 🇮🇳❤️🇯🇵
May he attain supreme pure nirvana, so sad about Abe San died pretty quick, My great condolences to the people of Japan from Sri Lanka.  アベさん最高の純粋な涅槃を達成することができますように、 さよならアベさん。❤️　スリランカから。
Condolences to Japan for losing one of their leaders. 🙏🙏
of course they have to bring china in this, just to prove how bbc works.
好死，开香槟了。
Sad day. Maybe CCP is behind it
in Japan and similar countries  attackers attack  top politicians while in USA ,EU  attackers attack children and low middle class
As an American he was my idol he stood up against china and even sought efforts to strengthen his country’s military he was a legend god may he rest east and the japan he left only get better under his old policy
China CCP group agents posting all message to support the killer action(terrorism) . The world should ben al CCP agents activity base on homeland security reason.
Are you seeing  stupid  liberals  whe you wanna kill you build  your own weapons even with a piece  of pipe
The People of Peru shares the sorrow and pain of this tragedy with the family of PM Abe and with the people of Japan. Our condolences.
Rest in Peace Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Thank you for your support to our country, Philippines 🇵🇭 ❤️ 💖. Indeed, A GREAT LEADER and A GREAT MAN!! Condolence to the Family and to the entire JAPAN 🙏 😢.
Such a sad day for the world.
Shinzo Abe is a great leader, I know most people in HK love him as I do, RIP.
Wow all this happened with a gun control country.
Not the first assassination either for a country with almost no weapons.
My heart hurts, what a sad news, he don't deserves to die for serving his country,  my deepest condolences to his loved ones,  may his soul rest in peace.
One thing I take from this, gun control doesn't work. All the wrong people end up with the guns.
I think the word you are looking for is “assassinated”.
USA sends condolences to Japan!!! RIP Shinzo Abe
I honestly thought he would survive. It is saddening. RIP to the bereaved and to those who truly support him.
"Violence is rare in Japan" 🤔
Putin did it?
That 3rd rate Secret Service detail failed him miserably.
Beyond shocking! In Japan! The former PM! What has the world become
I THOUGHT  THAT THEY ONLY USE SWORDS
Must die to live?
As a resident of Japan, I am still upset that this has happened. He was not a perfect politician by any means, but he certainly did his best for Japan and for diplomatic relations. May he rest in peace. Thank you, Mr. Abe.
For me,after many years becomes PM. I’m Done,no more…Enjoying my days before Die !!. But,rest in Peace,sir🙏
Undoubtedly CIA is behind the curtain
Shoulder British people doing same killed the basted Boris Johnson to
Very rare gun murder happens in Japan, but killing former prime minister is bad real bad!
I think someone in his party might be a traitor and I hope they could dig more information on how the suspect got an access regarding his public visit at Nara. They should look into all angles . I felt bad because I believed he was a good leader and a man.
This is shocking, absolutely enraging. Abe was a good leader and good ally
That's soo sad I'm praying for peace for his family he was a great man
Yeah it wasn't china
Most of the Japanese really shocked ,and Why this evil thing happened in Japan？　What the fuck of SP was doing while he was shot behind him twice? So sad it it as a Japanese!
Sending condolences to the family 🙏
I’m so sad about this. My son who lives in Japan is upset, this is supposed to be one of the safest countries in the world. The counties that apparently are celebrating his death, I curse them.
Just say that there’s no violence in Japan is an absolute lie. One of the dirty little secrets is the amount of domestic violence that occurs.
Sending my deepest condolences to his family
Need to change the video title. The video clearly says that he was shot twice. The title currently says, "shot at," which, while accurate, implies that he was not actually shot.
Don’t forget the Japanese use to eat captured American pilots 🇺🇸
Criminal records open in Gujrath India against modi amithsha justice lawyers are all fear
rest in peace
Sounds like an assassination. Rip.  Can we no longer have an opinion?
When I hear news like this I always remember this saying  ”The world would not come to an end until a day would come to the people on which the murderer would not know as to why he has killed and the slain would not know as to why he has been murdered.”
🤔 hmmmm i thought ALL of the gun violence was only in USA?
It is really rare for such incidents to occur in Japan. There is definitely something behind this act.
Shame it wasn't putin
Wow... that is saddening coming from a country like Japan.  My condolences to his family and friends.
How can this happen in a country where gun laws are so strict? That’s right take a lesson in America take away the law abiding citizens guns and the criminals have them.
Now I may be wrong yet I am almost sure russians set it up 100%
Rest in peace Shinzo Abe. A great leader who will be remembered by many across the globe. Such incidents are very rare in Japan.
This would never happen in America. Japan needs to fix their gun laws.
He was assassinated.
Wow would have never imagined that  Japanese are a great people so respectful and mindful.
I have nothing but respect and admiration for Mr. Shinzo Abe. He did not deserve this. My heart is grieving even if I’m not a Japanese. 💔
In other words: RIGHT WING WHACKO GETS ASSASSINATED BY HONEST CITIZEN. Not too sorry to see an oligarch dead...
In a country where guns are illegal. How did they get a gun?
We can't listen plz..... enough is enough
To think that he was alive this morning. Giving a speech fully expecting to come home at the end of the day.  This is awful. The assassin needs to pay. What the hell was he thinking? He does know Abe's no longer PM right? He doesn't like a policy? Then write a damn complaint or make a youtube video! Why kill a guy?!
This is so heartbreaking I can't stop crying 😭 He was a great friend of Bangladesh and will always be remembered by us. Rest in peace  🇧🇩❤️🇯🇵💐
Damn assassination
RIP Abe
It's ironic how shootings  happen where citizens aren't allowed to have guns
Its really unfortunate when someone can smuggled gun to a peaceful society and killed a man who is campaign for someone, what hell are we turning this world into. Because USA is allowing guns as results Guns is becoming like toys everywhere now .Its really a pity that he has been associated .
Rest in peace, Prime minister of Anime land.
When did we stop using assassination when referring to world leaders?
A true friend of the US and the West. My condolences to his family and the Japanese people.
I'm sure China was not behind it.....almost sure......note or less sure
R I P Mr. Shinzo Abe 💐🕯🥲 Amen 🙏 and may god bless you and your family.
How would that happen like Japan is one of the safes country I think it was the Russians who did it
This is what happens when politicians betray their nation
He is like Kennedy of Japan . Rest in peace legend.  Om Shanti 🕉 🙏 .
My condolences to Japan and Shinzo abe family and friends, never expected this new to come from Japan more precisely the way he died. He didn’t deserve it. Rest in peace Shinzo Abe.
I know who did it. It's Putin 😂😂😂
based shut in samurai
Are Japanese leaders forbidden to wear bulletproof vests?  This is not the 1960's. Plus the gun the assailant used produced a cloud of smoke like the kind the western movies use.
Well that's unexpected..   One of the most influential person in the world just suddenly got assassinated in 2022, looks like this is going to be an impactful decade for Japan.
Being named Abe is a bad idea for any aspiring politician.
Political assassination has along history in Japan... just not since US  tried to change the political system.  Perhaps a return to form is coming.
I am a Chinese. Regardless the historical issues between China and Japan. I felt shocked and sad for this moment , my deepest condolences!Gunshot in the public is very rare case to see in Asia , and Abe is one of the great politician to advocate the “peace” and balance the tension among all the super powers! I hope the peace will remain in here and spread it out across the world. 中日友好🇯🇵🇨🇳
"It's very difficult to get a gun in Japan." And yet he did.
bansaiiiii
WE NEVER EXPECTED THIS KIND OF HORRIFIC SCENES FROM JAPAN
So sad. He was a great man. I can’t believe someone could do this. The fact he knew in such short notice is a bit suspicious. I hope this wasn’t an inside job. It makes no sense. Farewell Shinzo Abe. 🙏🇯🇵
Disagreeing with someone doesn’t give you the right to physically harm them , what a coward move !
must be geopolitics
Boris Johnson resigned on the same day. Notice the coincidence? The World Economic Forum is behind it. Klaus Schwab
Rest in Peace Mr.Shinzo Abe...a very strong leader, who pulled Japan out of recession and economic downturn. Japan and smaller nations in the region will definitely miss him.
Yep it sounds like an inside job to me because an everyday civilian wouldn't be able to get a hold of a gun prepare for an assassination and be positioned just in time when there was little too no announcement to his arrival to give a speech. It is just horrible and unacceptable
They OBVIOUSLY should have more fun control.
Good people stand no chance in this world
Shocking news and felt so sad hearing the such heart breaking news
This is a terrible thing to happen. It is an act of terror. I would seriously fear for the future of democracy in Japan (already quite shaky). I am actually sad about Mr Abe, I thought he was a decent politician. (if you are familiar with Japanese politics, this is a huge compliment) . His legacy won’t be forgotten.
In before the American liberals try to use this to ban guns here.
It shows Japan is not the same as before.....
Rest in peace
Best false flag event ever.
It's a like a flashback to the nineteen twenties and thirties.
尊重生命 死者为大 虽然不能完全认同安倍先生的政治观点 依然感谢安倍先生为中日关系向好发展做出的努力  希望家人节哀  安息 RIP！
This has never happened before it's crazy
Attrocious.Deepest condolences to the family and Japanese people who love him
Rip
The SPs of Japanese police did nothing  there for a couple of sec after 1st shot by the assassin toward Abe. Then the assasinator have shot him down with a 2nd shot. They're horrible dick.
RIP sir Shinzo Abe u did great for japan in this life hope u live longer and get a better life more than this life🖤💐🕊️
I am Chinese and it is terrifying to see a gun shot happened in Japan. I was shocked and extremely sad about Mr. Abe's death. He is one of my most favorite politicians.    Sincere condolences to his family and people of Japan.  May you rest in peace Mr.Abe 🕯
This can't be done in such a beautiful and peaceful country...... My heart is full of deep grief after listening it..😭 My deep condolences with His Family and People of Japan.. It's really  painful news.
RIP
This just sounds very suspect.  If you want to assassinate someone publicly, make sure they die and be able to pass it off as a crazy persons job.  This is how you would do it.  A double barrel sawed-off shotgun at close range is almost certain to kill someone, and it is "homemade" so no one can trace it.  Then you just need to find someone that has nothing to loose that you can extort the safety of someone he loves of and you are golden.
🥺🥺🥺😭 Rest in peace Sir🙏🥺
R.l.P  former Japan PM Shinzo Abe we give our deepest condolences to his family and the Japanese people. 🙏
JFK 2.0
Firearms in general are rare in Japan, even moreso any sort of Political infighting/violence. My condolences to the Japanese people.
Japan is very dangerous, if the ex prime Minister isn't safe, the common people is doomed
So sad
The killer is a terrorist or a mental...or in between!!!!
After being shot. BBC is a joke
#1 home-made guns work  #2 sad 😔 it was used to kill Abe Condolences 🙏 to all in Japan and its friends 😢
Liberal World Order is what Biden wants.
my condolences to Shinzo Abe's family. but its hard to believe this is perpetuated by only a single lone wolf scum.
Gud News👍 God is still exist in the Universe for Evil people.
I will never forget the day he came to our fundraisings on Tokyo streets. We talked, shook hands, etc. RIP Abe san, and condolences to your family🙏
In India court judjes in fear bjp ruling government stop violence in India 🇮🇳
Bloody hell, i just thought he died of bad health, not this
who would want him dead?  gang killing?  was it ordered, or was the guy a sociopath? How does a sociopath get a gun in japan?
Japan has Fallen....this is a plot by Russia to assassinate the world leaders as they visit for Abe's funeral.....which will be the official start of WW3.
All world leaders r evil 😈 great job guy u did it
Sad news. I wonder which nation’s secret police the assassin was affiliated with (because that should be everyone’s initial assumption).
Ohhh ohhh ,Abe sorry hmmm
As a japnese,i'm so sad
Where would you get a gun in Japan? Amerikkka we all know the corner store or even pick a free one in the park. But Japan?   REST IN PEACE BRO
It was a Chinese assassin get ready they're going to invade you soon that or they're going to do s***** tactics like this
Well clearly the most restrictive gun laws work......
Rest in peace PM
what was the motive?
I am shocked that Mr Abe has been shot. What a lot of people don't know is that his country is full of right wing (very right wing.. you what I mean?) men who refuse to move with the times. Mr Abe had liberal views by japanese standards. The relations of Japan with other countries cannot be blamed on Mr Abe but on the entire country traditionalist view of Japan as unique and the rightful main power in Asia. Japan has never got on well with its neighbours (Basically, if you cannot be invaded, they won’t like you) This is a very complex subject so let’s just leave it there..
my condolances to Japan ang his family. America loved him
Investigation agencies should thouroghly probe if there is China's hand behind Shinzo Abe's assasination.strongly feel China's role in this
Bloody hell. Condolences to his family.
The USA exporting their gun violence to once pacific countries.
RIP
I bet the Chinese did this
Friend of India, rest in peace.
Extremely shocking , unexpected news from Japan . My deepest condolences .
Didn't agree with many of his views, but it's unquestionable how much of a statesman he was... irrespective of his own political inclinations and the views of his party, it seemed to me he always managed to keep balance between the extremes and focus on problems and worries that affected most of the Japanese population instead of playing favoritism and ruling only with particular interests in mind. Japanese economy may have been in recession over his entire time there, but there are lots of positive changes that happened in Japanese society that most of international media coverage does not recognize because it's not in their interest. You know how you hear about suicide in Japan all the time? It has been reversed to a point that most western nations have worse rates these days, did you know that? There is a bunch of stigmatized "only in Japan" problems often reinforced and exploited without context by foreign view "documentaries" that are not huge problems there anymore thanks to the hard and often hidden work of politicians there. I understand and agree with people who questions things such as historical revisionism, militarism, revising the constitution, among a few other controversial topics, but we need to understand that while he was prime minister there was no radical action to push these far over the will of people. There was a balance kept between the wish of people on all sides of the spectrum, which is what great leaders do. It's not only this politician or that party that has these radical views too, it's a portion of the population. Keeping the most extreme views at bay is what good politicians do. It was a shock when he left office due to health issues, this news is just surreal. Political views for political views, he was far from acting in a radical manner in any way, so it all just doesn't make much sense. There are far more radical politicians in Japan's governmental system. Feels like this was done much more on attention rather than politics disagreements. Regardless, this shouldn't happen in any democracy, and much less a peaceful country like Japan... the damage extends far beyond one man's life, career and legacy - it could change the entire dynamics of politics in Japan. The nation does not need political radicalism, no country does. May he rest in peace, his family be comforted by his achievements, and that his legacy is seen as a way to keep peace, moderation and diplomacy.
Its really shocking considering japan isnt really so polarized ..
Sending condolences to Japan and his family 🙏🇯🇵
Make them think
What did he die of? Because the title said he was being shot at... not that he was shot.
I didn't know the guy, but i never had a reason to hate on him. I wish his family and community the best during this time of mourning.
Such a sad way to go, he will be remembered as a great leader for Japan.
If this man was a western politician we d call him a nepotist right wing nationalistic establishment politician. But no bad words about the dead because the west isnt actually invested in foreign politics.
Bring back Unit 731 and punish the killers.
The beginning of the end for globalist leaders, I'm just shocked Biden wasn't first.
so sad untimely death. my condolence to the people of Japan.
BBC , please wake up your bot response team. Wake Up BBC !
Shinzo Abe is now in hell serving sushi 😂
Rest In Peace ✌️ condolences 💐 from Bhutan 🇧🇹
RIP
lol
Bias comment on China, you think everyone should like Abe? Do you think all Japanese like Abe??
Must be Yakuza
Death sentence for the killer now and rightly so. Rip Abe.
Was it a lefty who killed him?
My condolences from Chicago, was the ccp/pla responsible? I know china and Japan got territory beef
I genuinely hope this doesn’t start a flow of gun violence in Japan. It’s absolutely unheard to see shootings in Japan and I have high respect for him. He didn’t deserve to die that way AT ALL. RIP Shinzo Abe 🙏🏼
Very surprised to hear of this in Japan.
China is setting up to take back Taiwan.
Another Abe gone too soon.
so sad!
Rest in peace
RIP. Smooth ride to the stars mr Abe. 😟
boris johnson resigned and japanesse former minister killed i hear the jingle of rubles
Alot of Chinese celebrating his death?  Alot of muslims were also celebrating the death of Americans during 9/11, why didn't BBC report that too?  UK is herself crumbling under the scourge of Islam.  Abe's biggest problem was he was too close to stinking USA.  Otherwise, he was fine.  And because he was so close, he failed to protect the economic interests of Japan against the wiles of americian democrat politicians leading to the dwindling japanese yen.  Now, Japanese are getting impoverished every minute and the country on the verge of economic collapse.
If Japan had made guns legal he could have defended himself.
Whenever they make it sound like a single gunman acting alone, I’m always so skeptical.   Who do you think wouldn’t like a influential Japanese political figure pushing for more militarism 🤔
No one deserves to be gunned down like that but all you people here don’t know what the hell you are talking about!  Great man?  Respected worldwide?  Good statesman?  WTF are you talking about?   Please do some honest research am before commenting.
The criminal attacked former Prime Minister Abe in the sense of revenge on a particular religious group. One of the religious groups he cooperated with is the Unification Church.
辛い、辛すぎる…これは日本とって計り知れない損失です… 今まで本当にありがとうございました。 rest in place Abe
RIP legend  always love for you from India
Very sad and tragic incident.Rip from India
Remnant of imperialism in japan.an  LDP warlord is dead and world is a better place without him
What a sad news 😢 why would someone kill such beloved man.
This is the second shooting in Japan this  year! The first one was when a doctor made a house call. A Japanese man was  angry that the doctor couldn't save his mother. So he shot the doctor dead! If you folks don't believe me please research it!
Are homemade firearms illegal there.  They should pass a law immediately!
china is  behind this. china knew Shinzo would back Taiwan if they invaded. He had to be taken out before he was reelected.
Rip🙏🏻
Easy target when not expect..
violence is so rare in Japan… you can say that to the shocking number of womenn who suffer from domestic abuse…and nobody gives a damn about their plight.
FYI Japanese gun control is on next level.  Which means gun control does not work. 😎
ॐ शांति 💔🙏🏻
Such things do not happen in Japan, unless Muslims have migrated into Japan.
Lets kill all China gov official they kill us we kill 20 of them
Those very strict gun laws done him some hood
Wtf
How!!???  In Japan!!???? Safest country- felt so safe when I was there this is shocking!!!
That's one aspect of life America is light years ahead of the World. We stopped assassinating politicians and started murdering innocent children decades ago.
A shocking news indeed  🤥 I like his gentle approach to life
That’s bad isn’t it.
The world has been given crazy, may he rest in peace 🙏
Who are the most likely benefactors of this assassination. Someone is sending a message. Notice the feeders of this story arent going there..
RIP Shinzo Abe, pray for his family. 今までお疲れさまでした
I'm so sad.
ABE SHINZO SAN, ANSHIN SHITE O YASUMI KUDASAI 🙏🙏🙏
just lost my respect to some chinese. You celebrate someone's death? bro thats beyond lowest of the lows. Not unless he did something that justifies such treatment after death, these actions are just appalling.   From my perspective, no matter how much I hate Xi Jinping, I would never celebrate his death, for I know that his actions are for his country. Not unless he starts invading other countries.
Yakuza
2 shoots to the back piece, seems like the wily catholic jesuits got to him just like they did to Abraham Lincoln 🔫
My deepest condolences
R.I.P 🇯🇵
https://youtu.be/p36bN1ch4bw
Liberals always resort to violence. They shot Bolsenaro and Reagan, too. Let them have power, and they will kill you, too.
I am totally surprised.  I am feeling sad for Japan that successful country. what will happen to the sharpshooter
This makes me sad, mr Shinzo Abe was a highly respected man here in Scandinavia. A very kindhearted and just leader.  Rest in peace ♥️
Kick out the u.s. militsry who has been blatantly occupying your land for 80 years without justification or consent.
The killer Probably hired by China communist party.
Unbelievable. May he rest in peace!
May he rest in peace ✌🏼 under the 🖐 hand of God condolence to his family
You chose THIS guy to shoot?   C'mon, man...
America probably send somebody to assassinate him
I can't believe that such a terrific thing will happen in Japan. 🤯
Wtf man ww3 is coming have fun people we all death 💀
What heartbreaking news! He was a genuine patriot, he dedicated his time to making our country a better place.  Some of his policies were controversial, and he was often exposed to fierce criticism.But it never means he was a incompetent politican. On the contrary, it was proof that he was working for Japan, not for his own benefit.  If he was only considering maintaining power, he wouldn't make a policy that would be criticized. Though I've neither voted for the Liberal Democratic Party, where he had belonged, nor agreed with some of his policies such as constitutional amendment, I appreciate his work as a PM. I really feel sad that a person who has dedicated everything to us, Japanese,  is killed by  Japanese. He doesnt deserve such a cruel end.
Just a sad day in our world,doesn’t matter where we live or our politics violence is is tearing us all apart,condolences to his family
Shinso Abe a Divisive leader? 🤔 What are you saying? He has majority of his people's votes, longest serving prime minister and doing everything that he can for deplomacy, FUCK BBC news, my condolences to Abe's family and the japanese people.
Are the reasons of the shooter known?
Omg rest in peace. Such sad news.
Out of all the countries in the world, you would never expect something like this to happen in Japan.
How dreadful. My sincere condolences to his family and to Japan. 🕊
Jfk die shoot too 🛎
JFK
So sad, Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe,a great leader indeed.
How sad, the Japanese people lost a national hero and a patriot.
nice shot,good soldier.  tell me,how happy you are?
I'm so shocked! So sad n horrible. A great leader now gone. 😟
My condolences to Japan from Portugal 🙏❤️
Uneducated dumbasses around the world. This dead dude tried to change the constitution that doesn't allow them to start a war again and prayed for the WWII war criminals every year to disgrace our troops who were killed by Japan during WW2. RIP??? My ass!!!
My sincere condolences to the family, friends, and the people of Japan on the passing of the former PM Shinzo Abe! He was truely a good man and friend to many. May he rest in peace..🇯🇵🇺🇸🌹
The fk??? Why????
RIP Mr.Abe. deepest sympathy to his family.  It is loss of Japan.
OMG!!!
I thought this stuff only happens in America huh smh
Evil will try to silence the good, for now the best option will be to carry the legacy of PM Abe.

He dont have enemies like other politicians around the world. He mostly beloved at his country. The country is almost to no gun violence and less crimes compares to other countries. The information obtained by his attacker of him is very quick (late last night 2:03 ). Only agents from some countries are capable of like this. The only people probably dont like him might be Japan's THE Neighbour.
RIP.
Japanese political assassinations are not new -- in the 1960s one was stabbed with a katana in live TV.
In india the communal powers are destroyed the democracy through Hijacking the elected representatives please protect the  democracy in india
Other countries crazies are becoming emboldened by those in the US. First Sweden’s mass shooting now this in Japan? This is worrisome.
His dedication for extreme right wing war craze gone too. RIP prime minster
He stepped down due to health issues and now he's dead because of getting shot. Very terrible. What could be the motive of killing him?
The shooter made a pipe shotgun to kill this man. I wonder what drove him to this?
In india day by day fear of gujarat type communal clashes democracy in danger peoples are feared UNO intervention is necessary please protect the secularism in india and FBI investigation is necessary
5:10 “He may not have been the most popular of politicians in Japan, especially among those on the Left.”

The world has gone mad.  My deep condolences to Abe's family and the people of Japan.
This is very heartbreaking, words can't enough to express my condolences for  Mr Shinzo Abe. May your soul rest in peace Mr Shinzo Abe.
What a tragic Death for the Prime Minister Abe😭, Thank you for being a good Friend of our Former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte Mr.Prime Minister Abe and thank you for all of your help/contributions here in my beloved Country the Philippines ❤️🇵🇭🇯🇵hugs for the Japanese people rn🙏🙏
How can this be,I thought Japan was gun free🧐
He knew this was part of politics
I have a theory that due to his influence on increasing the military spending. China may have had a hand in this murder. Recently, they have been clipping Canadian aircraft and dropping chaff on Australian planes.
Bump. Bump. Bump. A corrupt politician bites the dust
RIP
Our deepest condolences from India on this sad news about Shinzo Abe's death. He was a good friend of India and  took the indo-japan ties many miles forward and strengthened it during his tenure as head of the state.
😱😱😱 shocking
rip😭😭😭😭😭
Why wasn't Boris on a Visit?
Some of the strictest firearm laws in the world.......
O God Nooooooo ;_;
well his protective detail failed
Government assassination
How cruel SAD
South Koreans will celebrate this
Doesn't seem like calling him popular is honest.
I hope the police can seek whos behind this tragedy and what motives behind it. R.i.p mr abe 🙏 my pray for the family that had lost u
Taiwanese are grateful for what Abe has done for Taiwan. It’s really regrettable that Taiwan lost a best friend. Rest in peace🙏 🇹🇼❤️🇯🇵
3 shots from 3 m behind._one missed, 2 shots on his neck n left chest...Total shock...
RIP, you were a great leader.
Retire..keep your mouth shut....don't try to be relevant
They need to ban guns in Japan
No way
See....people will find a gun regardless of the laws. Just like drugs.
Mr Abe looked very happy and spirited after having been released from the huge pressure of being the prime minister whilst suffering a serious disease. He was set to make the country better in a different way in his new career. His life shouldn't have been ended this way. This is just too sad to happen. May he rest in peace.
Dude got the curse of assad
Wow! Assassinations like this are unheard of in modern Japan.
Probably one of the MOST GUN RESTRICTED areas in the world.....so how did this happen?  The laws and restrictions didn't work??  GO FIGURE!  STILL the Democrats will NEVER understand!
My heart goes out to the family and friends of this dedicated man, also to the Japanese people. Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe, you will not be forgotten.
The Japanese people should re-embrace their warrior spirit and stand proper in accordance to their capabilities.
"He IS influential."  Nah,he's a Dead body. He has 0 influence on this world. R.I.P
So very very sad he was well liked man RIP 🥲
More shocking then watching a defenceless civilian get shot, is hearing how some people celebrate that on Chinese social media.
This is terrible. Japan has intense gun laws. Not sure how the suspect made the homemade gun, but there are vids all over the internet overviewing how to make a printed gun.
OUTRAGEOUS crime! P.M Abe did not deserve this!
Abe was a monster and corrupt but I'm still surprised this happened.
Apparently, Abe was a good man, a patriot. His being murdered makes me think that he stood in the way of the elites' (attempted) plans for the world. Note - bbc just another old-line propaganda outlet
Surprised they didn't use the term assassinated rather than died. Shocking news!!
This is heartbreaking and shocking news. Shinzo Abe was a solid partner to the United Kingdom. He was a kind man and an influential politician in Japan. My heart goes out to his family, friends and the people of Japan at this very difficult time.
Too bad gun control doesn't work
WTF! Good grief! Shit is wild everywhere!!!
Please Trump next.
RIP Shinzo Abe.
why? is it because people are depressed post covid?
Sad to see such incident in Japan.  Rip Mr Abe 🙏
The World really is going to 💩
This so sad after this man served his country longtime. Rip
Nobody dies from being shot at.... you die only when you are shot not when shot at
The assassin should be electrocuted to death
I Pray hes' in a better place now
CheckList for World War:   1. English priminister resign  √ 2. Ex-priminister of Japan assassined  √ 3. American economic recession √ 4. Russian in war √  5. German rearmament √  Now it only leaves:  Blitzkrieg Poland
Heart breaking
Hillary Rodham Clinton is behind this.
It’s unfortunate that such a capable leader gets assassinated
RIP Sir🙏
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Holy fuck no way 😳
Terrible news, such an awful loss. My condolences to his family and to the Japanese people.
Evil is all over the world  I hope that evil man who Killed great leader like Prime Minister Abe will punish slowly until death
I didnt believe it at first but now its sinking in
this was chines spy doing
Who's the suspect and what is his reason why he killed ABE?
Political violence is not rare in Japan.  Remember the Japanese sided with Nazi German/Hitler in WW2. However, Shinzo was a great leader and representative on a global level.
RIP Abe, he did a lot for Japan, may he enjoy his deserved rest after a life of dedication and service.
Haha fuck him. That's what he gets. Warmonger. Refuse to acknowledge japan's war crimes in China. Changed the history books in schools. Let American troops occupy.
He was asked to stop influencing govt I'd imagine. Looks like he didn't 🙏🙏
C written all over it. RIP SA 🙏 xx
Security be lacking RIP
Japan has very few death from guns Why?? Strict gun control
BBC finding every opportunity to work a dig into China.
There are many evil leaders born in Asia. Latest 4 are Kim Xi Abe and 4th is dumb ex Korean president Moon.These 3 have different political views yet they created a dark clouds over Asia. One gone two will go hopefully asap. Going back to Radical socialist North Korean spy Moon. Among many crimes moon committed as president he deported two North Koreans defectors back to NK. That is automatic murder.
Shocking 😮
BBC you need to get your story straight there is a difference between shot at and hit and shot at and missed shot at and missed is not shot! my condolences to his family and friends and the country of Japan
Not "shot at"....he was SHOT
talented  people leave early, it's unfair
RIP.ABE
India lost its great friend
End of a towering leader from Asian region, very saddened from this incident!!
No. Japanese media reports that the suspect DOSEN''T disagree with Mr. Abe's policy but had severe trouble with one religious group that has strong relationship with Mr. Abe. It's not clear what kind of trouble he had and what kind of relationship Abe had at this moment.
"Would that I had seven lives to give for my country" - Kusunoki Masashige
Sorry to the deceased.
Stop visiting Japan
Condolences to his family and friends.....as they are saying guns are very rare and very hard to come by in Japan....but from a picture I seen  the gun was homemade..pipes wires, wood and black tape. When they raided Yamagami Tetsuya's apartment they found several handmade pistol like items
He liked Elvis. Makes him cool in my book. Sad to hear this news.
Sending condolences to the family and people of Japan. 🥺
Kim jong un not messing around
🙏
Rest in peace,dear sir.
My condolences to the family and relatives, I know that Japan is not corrupt country and their prime minister do their best for their citizens.
All I will say is that he looks great for 67.
What a shame 🙏
China definitely has something to do with this!!!!
This is about China and Taiwan
Shock ((
Unbelievable...this happen in Japan
As a Chinese, I don't like some of Abe's policy. But I feel very sad and shocked to hear his death by gun violence. Why not we all have peace in the world?  Some people always want to create conflicts. Americans have been targeting China as an enemy but we only want to develop our country to live a better life. Trade war,  chip sanctions, democracy ally union, all these are creating conflict. Actually we China is acting peacefully in world, but western media only look at our wrong part and never see our good part. We admit We have a lot to improve and we are continue doing that.
A patriotic prime minister Rip sir
Deeply saddened to know about the demise of Mr Shizo Abe my heartfelt condolences to his family may his soul rest in peace
Well at least he didn't see it coming.  Wish someone would 3d print something for Putin.  Now there's a state leader who needs to meet his maker.
Rest in Peace
Russos y Chinos Mercenarios Lo Hicieron  Porque ??? Por Traicionar a Asía y Venderse a La OTAN. Amén.
First time in japan very sad
The COOMunist 🐽🐷🐷 pigs are celebrating his death .
gun control works
Big mistake that, you've opened up a huge can of worms, big big mistake! ☠️
Shocked and saddened by this news. Good friend of India and will be missed 🇮🇳❤🇯🇵
“but online I’m noticing that a lot of Chinese nationalists are celebrating his death”  Is that your idea of journalism?  Which Chinese nationalists?  Some kid from 7th grade in Taiwan could pretend to be 50 different Chinese nationalists quite easily.  I’m not so sure about that statement unless it is official accounts of well known Chinese nationalists.  Even in that case there is always hacking, but I really don’t know about the credibility of this type of report.  Very hard to go on that sort of evidence.
Will the person who killed him be accused of being a terrorist, or as long as the person who killed him is not a Muslim, he will not be accused of terrorism?
I remember during Iranian regime crackdown, ppl of Iran begged Shinzo Abe to show support, he stood with terrorist Mullahs of Iran. He could’ve made a difference.
His hair had more body than any other Asian that ever lived. R.I.P.
Japan loses a great man today selfless Acts come with consequences abe new he was a marked Man for years rest in peace prime minister😢😢
His bodyguards are to blame. Where were they, & what were they doing?
What?!  I felt like these kinds of things only happened in the olden days. Wow people can be so mean to do this to other people !
I wish someone would assassinate this news people this reptilian MFs
Why is no one saying assassinated? He was assassinated.
Those buggers had a lot of violence in WWII
The speech was that bad?
God bless this tiny warrior
Truly sad and shocking.
The United States sends our condolences to the people of Japan. Rest in peace former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
China is behind the killing
This is so sad .. heartfelt condolences to the family and Japan at large 😭😭😭
I am so sorry.  He was a good man and will be missed.
End of times...Japan considered a safe place and things like this are happening now in those places.
Rest In Peace 😔🙏
R. I. P OOO HE was nice person, love from Iran
good
Beheading in public square. Abe was a great leader and the coward deserves to be executed.
This PM was an extreme right winger, the level of praise is saint like. Also considering Japanese people take a minimum of 100 photos and videos a day why does nobody have any clear footage 😂
POLITICS and POLITICIANS both can never be trusted EVER and their this like end is not shocking rather NATURAL. In India GANDHI had to face this like end eventhough he was    TALKING ABOUT NONVIOLENCE. BECAUSE NONVIOLENCE AND POLITICS CAN NOT COEXIST. Gandhi was a POLITICIAN so he had to face that end,NONVIOLENCE was actually his mask. 😷🇮🇳 .No one DARES/DARED to trigger GUN to Tagore because BEFORE WAR HE TRUELY TRIGGERED HIS PEN. Today BANGLADESH, INDIA BOTH KEPT HIS NATIONAL ANTHEM. Afghanistan to Albert  EINSTEIN all were his friend. Be a true TEACHER/HUMAN no need TO BE POLITICIAN.  ABE being POLITICIAN now made one concious HUMAN A KILLER. Why this POLITICS?? WHO NEED THIS POLITICS?? "AMRA SOBAI RAJA AMADER EI RAJAR RAJOTTE"....WE ALL ARE KING IN THIS KINGDOM THAT IS OUR EARTH. Written by Great teacher Tagore. Admire TAGORE'S PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION IN UN🇨🇳🇺🇸🇬🇧🇷🇺🇫🇷....🇮🇳. IT CAN BRING WORLD PEACE🙏
Sorry for your loss Japan and to the families. We live in a messed up world and bad things happen to good people.
R.I.P. bruh...
This is not the type of news I expect to see from Japan.  Condolences to the man and his family.  I hope authorities are able to root out the cause and hold everyone accountable.
I was expecting this to happen to Puttin not to  Abe my deepest condolences from USA
Om shanti......
Sad.  Gun violence is rampant in the USA.  Daily and random.  Hard to think of living in a country where gun violence is rare.  Senseless murder.
My sincerest condolences to the people of Japan.
I learned today that Shinzo Abe was murdered. From what I see, it concerns pro-Chinese and pro-Russian troops around the world. Of course, the murderer committed a crime based on his personal likes and dislikes. It was closed like the murder of US President John F. Kennedy, but I think it will be difficult for Japan to know the truth this time as well. Therefore, there are forces in the world that want China and Russia to challenge the international leadership of the United States. Of course, the most supportive beauty must be supported by Taiwan. It's the only way to get rid of Shinzo Abe, but of course you can't blatantly send the murderer to kill him, but to adopt the method of social lonely wolf crime. It is unlikely to be suspected by a Japanese prosecutor, and many friends may not think that Prime Minister Abe was killed. What impact will the killings have on the world, but judging by some international data, I think the international situation is more chaotic. It may not affect the currently recovering international stock market in the short term, but the fastest global stocks of the month could fall.
2 questions,  who did it, and is he available for joes next embarrassing public shit show?
아베신조에게 조의를 표합니다 삼가 고인의 명복을 빕니다
иманды болсын
Why him ? Why not that pigshit putin ?
ABE was pushing for the removal of USA generals who sit in their parliament and the deep state of USA got him eliminated  In India we have the wicked evil British Lord's who sit in our parliament too
What I can't believe is that there are people from one country who are very happy when the prime minister of another country dies (China
I hated this guy so much, and this is so sad. No one should interfere with public officials in such a violent matter. It is disgusting. I feel for his family and every Japanese person.
I'm so shocked after hearing that,he is a very peaceful person
Shido is dead
Rest in peace Mr.Abe.
this is the last news I ever expected coming out of Japan.
May Shinzo rest in peace.  May his family find inner strength and calm from GOD's love.
Disgusting that anyone would ever do this to a great leader
Newscaster said Abe-san was not popular with the "left" Our World not just USA is at War. Appears left vs right like red vs blue rings true. Beginning of the end rings true. Rest in peace Prime Minister Abe-san 🙏
The HEADLINE should be FORMER JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER WAS ASSASSINATED!!! You guys soften the fact using misleading phrasings... this supposedly media is DOOMED!!! Shame on BBC aka "Bought By China"
I cannot believe someone could have the freaking balls to shoot a priminister, this is so sad he was just giving a speech on the side of the road and got shot😔
😱😱😱😱😱
So very sorry!
The killer had balls, we need one like that in the Usa to get rid of this damn government ruining our country.
Unbelievable. I was shocked when I wake up with this news, Japan is the safest country in the world.My Condolences to Abe's family , May his soul Rest in peace. Truly no one is safe in this world. All we can do is Pray to the Lord. No one knows when your time will end.
a person was shot dead in broad daylight before others, that in itself is horrible
I didnt know japan  had guns
Even Japanese are against militarization of their country. Enemies in Japan and enemies outside Japan. never again should World War 2 happen. Violence is not the answer.
May you Rest In Peace prime minister Shinso Abe
good guy
This was a shocking moment and I send my condolences to Mr Abe's family and the country of Japan. Rest in peace Abe.
Violence is rare in Japan? Their empire was violent.  Yakuza.  Mass killing cults.  Assassination in the past.  Serial killers, etc.
Shot at? No...he WAS shot.
In a country which averages less then 10 shootings a year on average. This is indeed shocking on the level of the Kennedy assassination. Abe was the quintessential statesman  and a huge presence in Japanese politics for decades.   Not just for himself as his grandfather was also Prime Minister. Abe was a great leader which loss will be felt the world over. The world looses  a good man today & one who's legacy will live on.
They have Guns in Japan??? Very shocked.
The last Japanese Emperor has fallen. RIP ! 🙏 🇨🇴
I'm absolutely shocked by this News,I think Mr Shinzo Abe is a great Nobleman,he did not deserve this way to die😱,my Condolences to his Family and Friends,may his soul Rest in Peace🌼🌹🕊️
This is a direct attack on conservatives.  Boris, needs extra protection at this time; maybe for a long while.  This shot, heard around the world.  Peace and safe blessings.
Violence is so rare in Japan. Is that a fact?
A man died in Japan today! The world is shocked! 10000 civilians died in Ukraine yesterday! The world is not shocked! This is the new international order new rules by Russia !
R.I.P🙏🙏🙏
FUBAR
My condolences to shinzo and his family and all of Asia 😔
日本の人々に哀悼の意を表します。 尊敬されるリーダーの安倍晋三の死を悼み、悲しい知らせ。 彼に別れを告げる。 尊敬の言葉！
Nowadays all first world countries behave like fourth world countries.
Putin's tentacles could reach very far
နောက်ကွယ်မှာ တရုတ်သမ္မတချီကျင်ပင်  လုပ်ကြံခိုင်တာနေမှာ
Easy Work for PUTIN
Very sad. Condolences to his family.
So Tragic, he was actually a great guy for a Liberal.. My heart goes out to his Family and the Japanese people, RIP Mr. Prime Minister you will be missed Sir.. Godspeed!!
This world is a nightmare
He was hiding for a long time before this assassination.. after that guy on Japanese news held up the "Japanese regalia" and said he was the oldest king..  and lineage of true Jewish kings..  ✡  the tribe of Reubenites a lost tribe..
Abe is anti - chinese, so china is responsible here
I rarely heard City of Nara in Japan but now it will be forever remembered as a city where PM Shinzo Abe being assassinated. History is being written!
Sajonara means ,, good bye forever,, ....
yes, I am to celebrate it and would do it same on British queen as well.
My condolences to his family 🙏🏻  I’m still shocked.
0:45 violence is rare in Japan.
Rip
My greatest condolences to our Japanese friends for losing a fine man.
Whoa! Asian on asian crime! Or rather honorary aryan on honorary aryan crime!!
HES A GOOD MAN, HE VISITED THE PHILIPPINES. ITS  SO SHOCKING , BECAUSE HE IS A DIGNIFIED MAN.
I thought Japan was one of the safest country when it comes to assassination.
The business of politics is a corrupted one... not shocking at all.
Chances are he was assassinated by a Chinese spy. Abe has been very vocal on arming Japan with Nuclear weapons.
YouTube help we indeed obviously need help more policemen policewoman both need to help Americans and other families an friends faster put more cameras right now in our community hospitals we need your help hospitals why we all are dying gotta be something you have to say
As a Japanese man, I can't imagine that shooting happened in Japan.
Wonder if there's any Chinese link behind this? Local politics doesn't seem competitive enough to warrant this
In a country were people don't have rights to had arms they are only two choice to be the killers of that high profile citizen , the organice crime or the government.
we will always remember your legacy RIP ...I'm in tears , you don't deserve this ..... condolences japan it's an honor to meet you in person , philippines loves you...
WHAT THE HELL???
The term is ‘assassinated’ isnt it
RIP PM. Rest in Peace.
SHINZO was CORRUPT deepstate  CABAL
I wouldn't rule out the Chinese in this one.
As a Japanese,I wanna correct one thing which is mentioned in this video. This reporter said the assassinator shoot Sir Abe because he dislike Abe’s policy,but in Japanese domestic news,it is said that the cause is not related to his political policy,but it is related to his actions or behaviour out side of his political policy… I know it is quite weird,but it is what I heard from tv
He was a great leader in Japan and I respected him ! 😢🙏🇯🇵⛅🌌🌌
Capital punishment !!
The title of the video isnt written by a journalist or they wouldnt use the word "at" after the word killed. Still no answer to my question of why did my earthquale annpunce a 9.1 earthquake then remove it as soon as i posted a screenshot?
RiP Shinzo...you didn't deserve that!
Abe was a great PM for Japan. A class act.
Thank you Abe for supporting Taiwan so much, Rest In Peace .
He was a good guy, but perhaps he was resented for being friendly with Trump.
The suspects shot totally second and the moment he shot to Abe first time, he still stood on the ground and so as Abe. After two seconds it had happened, suspects shot again to Abe, then Abe fell on the ground. At the same time, Abe’s bodyguard was so shocked by sounds that he would’t cover Abe before second time. I thought it’s fully responsibility to bodyguard due to lack of consciousness. We, Japanese, always soak into peaceful days. We need to realize what we should appeal to elections or public places if necessary.
What is the gun control in Japan like?  Oh, wait....
Just like Abe Lincoln.
Nara means bye bye in polish language slang ........
Wow this is so disturbing and shocking. So sad!
Order 66
Japanese government escorts securty system not professional all escorts services no enough for EX Pm gun shoot very sad mood. ....no safety body jacket no use why ? RIP
My condolences to the good people of Japan
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Rest In Peace 🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
Boris resign and Abe get shot in the same day, something that really fk up happened behind the scene.
There’s a few American politicians I’m sure America wishes was there on his side 🫡
This is the saddest way we Japanese can deeply feel on deeper and more realistic levels for the sadness and grief of the American people's loss of JFK almost 60 years ago. We hope the investigation will be as thorough to include the conspiracy theory as was in the JFK case. He was the most influential individual who held the key to the future of Japan in such an evolving world situation.
Japan needs to ban guns.
Nara means good bye in polish language urban dictionary.........
He is a nationalist and patriot. Sure our hidden evil master is behind this.
I’m am so completely shocked, this is such an unthinkable occurrence. I can only hope that his legacy and family will be honoured in the wake of this monstrous tragedy. I hope his killer is brought to justice, and that this may never happen again in the great nation of Japan. Rest In Peace Honourable Prime Minister, you were a great man
Japanese PM Shinzo Abe   Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called children of GOD. Prayers and thoughts  for his family and the people of Japan.
Rip sir
Brutality? Really? Why you don't ask to Chinese people when they were slaughtered by japanese army? THAT WAS REAL BRUTALITY!!
What a shocking n heart breaking news today, 8 July 2022 at 11am+ in Japan.  My deepest condolences go to Abe san's family n citizens of Japan🙇‍♀️🙏 My prayers go to Shinzo Abe San n your family, as well as to the rest of the friends in the world. Let's extend kindness to one another instead of resorting  in violence.  May your soul RIP,  Abe San🙏🙏 May Buddha blesses all human on earth filled with  compassion n  loving kindness, AMITABHA 🙏🙏🙏🙏
我的天啊，原来日本太危险了，白天会有这么糟糕的枪击。
My condolences to the people of Japan and his family.
Fend off an inner demon using the internal monologue derived from your inherent compassion. When bacteria make their way into your body, ward them off with positive energy.
Too bad Japan has no gun control laws. Oh, wait.
Ahh.. what a waste of life in times of turmoil in this world , may he rest in peace ... god would be upon him now..
Love u Shinzo Abe from 🇹🇭🙏🙏🙏😔😔😔
我是中国人，我没有庆祝，我也感到悲伤，然而我要为你们英国媒体新闻中所强调中国人的庆祝报道而感到悲哀，你们能不能不要拿别人的悲惨作为政治武器，谢谢。愿安倍晋三的家人节哀。
The way he approached cameras with the propaganda mask on his face tells me all I need to know!!
This should've happened to trump
I had a feeling he wouldn't survive.
Georgia guide stones vandalized Boris johnson resigning   This guy gets shot (i dont know his affiliations to the nwo)  Geez lot happens in one day
Probably related to organized crime
Bloody sad. Good man, deserved better.
RIP
Wonder who,s behind this !
And we thought this type of gun violence and assassinations only happened in the USA by the right-wing-nut tRumptard gun-loving republicans.
Hope its not the us behind it.
😥😢😔
hello people
Sending love and prayers from the Philippines. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is one of the few good and kind leaders across the globe. I remember him visting the Philippines during PNoy Administration and how he has been very supportive of us by extending generous aide to our country. May he rest in peace with the Lord! 💗🙏
Conspiracy 😢🇯🇵⛅🌌🌌👀👀🌌🌌🌌
Abe did not die after being shot at, as the title suggests, he died after being shot (or assasinated or killed)
The Japanese have stood by us through many difficult years in no small part by Shinzo.
As you might not know. 😂Abe is the most hateful figure in China, second comes to US president. It's funny because right now you think the rest of world is weeping alongside Japanese for the horror tragedy while China is indeed celebrating his death.😂
Rip
They need to ban guns in japan.. then this could never happen! Oh wait handsguns and rifles are banned there.. damn
PM Abe’s death breaks my heart. God bless his family over the loss of a great man.
Bbc last news channel in YouTube to give the news about anything happening.
How odd that Boris Johnson ( UK prime minister) announced his resignation the day before.There has been alot of talk of China invading Taiwan.Any connections?
This BBC report will make the world despise the Chinese more.
Someone must have been really upset to have shot Abe. In Japan this is something that never happens. Only in the rarest occasions will anyone choose to kill. Hopefully the actual truth will come out as to why this happened.
New world order
wonder if Russia had something to do with this killing.
Inside job? 🤔
Chinese netizens celebrate the death of any Japanese person.
Me shocked !! May God bless his soul with eternal peace !!
quite rare  in a modern country, especially Japan, a so-called democratic country.
RIP Abe.. My respects..
ちくしょう、まじで悲しいがな・・・・。一部の声が大きい奴らから批判されたアベノミクスだけれども、日本の中流以上の多くは安倍さんの方向性に間違いなく同意していた。本当に悲しい、悔しい。
Damn, that’s unfortunate.
What has China to say about this shocking incident.
tons of people who know nothing about Japan saying tons of good things about Abe, sure, shooting him wasnt a nice thing and he was old with health conditions so..  not sure why he had to be assassinated..  but at the same time, the LDP has made Japan weak and overly socialist as well as become so spineless against the US that they let american pharma into the country regardless of safe medical processes..  I wonder if the Emperor's security is going to be upgraded.  Who will cry when bill clinton or George W bush die??
In japan, opposition is "known" for "eliminating" their political opponents. But no mastermind has ever been caught. Remember the man running for mayor in tokyo who "suddenly died" at a remote area? Yep. That was just a few years ago. But yeah, who knows. No one assassinates for no reason. That's just my opinion.
Why?
So sad..A terrible loss..A great gentlemen.. So sad...to hear...
RIP from CHINR
ここのコメントを見ていると、日本だけでなく海外でも彼は慕われてたのだと分かり、鬱屈とした心が少しだけ楽になりました。 みなさん！暖かい言葉をありがとう。この場を持ってお礼を申し上げます。
BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!  FOR MR ABE
On behalf of USNS Sacagawea our Deepest condolences our Flags our Half Staff 🙏🙏
I would care but political figures are dirty and a lot of them deserve this.
RIP
Very sad news . I dearly love Japanese
He was a great friend in the Philippines. Rest in Peace great leader. The guy that shot him, I think he is the one and only guy was not happy of what he did throughout his political career. He did good things. Salute to Shinzo Abe.
Allllright sooo Israel’s government dissolved, Boris Johnson resigned and now this guy is d3ad… 🥳 Happy Birthday to me!
I hope they caught the person responsible for this.  Condolences to his family
His a good prime minister and the longest serving prime minister in Japan.  I like him zinso abe
Where was his security for protection if he was shot behind he certainly wasn't protected
It's sad. RIP mr.abe
Finally Japanese wake up now
The little comment that China celebrates his death is careless
We are always with neutral and intellectual media।
My condolences to his loved ones.
Sincere condolences to his family and the people of Japan.
Shocking news. My condolences to his family and the people of Japan.
Feels like democracy is under attack
He is a gentleman and a good man
Assassinations are rare in Japan, let alone targeted on a figure as huge as Abe. I can understand the shock.
So many shots
sad
RIP Abe
Gun control didn't work in this case.  😞
日本はどんな困難が訪れようと、何度でも立ち上がります。 安倍さんこれまでありがとうございました。 天国で安らかに。。
RIP
What a shock that such a terrible thing should happen in Japan.
Bbc you called this brutality how about japanese in massacre of Nanjing, firstly he was kill by a Japanese,
Just another yellow man gone. Big deal.
My God. I honestly would have never expected news like this to come out of Japan. My condolences to Abe's family and to all his constituency.
I'm speechless
Condolence to the family! He was a good Prime Minister of Japan. Much respect for him.
It was murder I wonder if he was hit man
DEFINATELY ITS A POLITICAL ASSASINATION. JAPAN IS AT LOST losing Abe. I really like this guy who does poltic with good virtue & value but strict with wisdom and real nasionalist but also grear globalist
I am an Aryan from Germany. I like Indians.,,,
Japan is very safe country. Almost we can't witness crimes in there. I guess for that reason Mr Abe did not have bodyguards around him. RIP Abe-san 🙏🙏🙏😥
Chinaaaaa🤬🤬🤬🤬🖕🏻🖕🏻
BBC don't have even have a Japanese based reporter? Why are we asking someone in Singapore?  It's not even close to Japan.
I can only imagine...
Respect to a fine international leader. One that Drump couldn't hold a candle to...
And the Spirit of Darkness has emerged in Japan and is emerging in all the world  ... God comfort your family Mr Abe. ... an Australian friend.
New anime
My sincerest condolences. A sad and shocking day.
My thoughts are with hungry African children, NOT with Japanese people 😒
R.I.P shinzo condolences from my side...still on my favourite president list since he very known in india in modi govt bcoz he was among the first to visit varanasi (ancient indian city) .......
Oh my god
May his soul rest in peace. Deepest condolences from Indonesia to mr. Shinzo Abe family & all of Japanese.  🇮🇩❤️🇯🇵
🤯🤯
Crazy stuffs happening all over the world. A lot of anger and frustration among people
Strong smell of cia mi6
After all his service and sacrifice to humans,  an evil human has taken his life. Very sad. May God keep his soul 😢😢😢
Damn this shocked the hell out of me, especially in such a peaceful and anti-gun country!
What a shite world we are living on right now 😳
Perhaps created too many enemies during his time in office? now karma - RIP
ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པདྨེ་ཧཱུྃ།  ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པདྨེ་ཧཱུྃ།  ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པདྨེ་ཧཱུྃ།  OM MA NEY PAY MEY HUNG.  OM MA NEY PAY MEY HUNG.  OM MA NEY PAY MEY HUNG

The newsreader's pronunciation Abe's name sounds terrible.
FUCK YOU CIA.FUCK YOU ALL INVOLVE IN CONSPIRACIES...FUCK ALL GLOBALIST WHO DOEAN WANT POSITIVE CHANGES IN THIS WORLD....FUCK YOU..RIP PM ABE😭😭😭
But we need more gun control lma
THERE IS A LOT OF ANGRY PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD , STUCK IN POVERTY .
might be an inside job
These devils play everything to benefit Ukraine. I'm sick of it. Please leave Japan alone. You damn devils
Sad to hear the sudden demise of Mr. Shinzo Abe an able and beloved leader of Japan. One can't imagine that he had been the victim of a maniac within his society. May his soul rest in eternal peace.
This wouldn’t happen to Putin
Would this by any chance have anything to do with Japan going nuclear again?

What were securities or bodyguards doing at the site?
Haha, in a country with some of the most strict gun laws..I'm pretty sure that was a ghost gun..and why do so many people give a crap that didn't even know this guy
The world is so broken right now.
RIP Shinzo Abe.
After the last two years and all leaders showing complete contempt for the people they serve, I think it would be best if they all think very hard about their the people they have damaged going forward, they all need 24/7 protection for the rest of thier lives, I'm glad I'm not in thier shoes.
These other evil western leader better see what going on now, especially some in Europe and the americans
Slava Russia 🇷🇺
The Chinese nationalist hatred campaign is truly disgusting. Mr. Abe put so much effort into stablizing sino-nippon relation and many Chinese has benefited from (and frankly, taken advantage of) policies backed by him. To me, a Manchurian, such hatred is all too familiar. This tragedy means more than a loss for Japan - Northeast Asia is facing a downward spiral in the years to come. As for those Chinese, they celebrate the loss of a keystone, so they'll deserve a cave-in.
So everyone has to begin to be extra careful in Japan henceforth.
What a horrible event! Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe.
And Trump is still running around destroying America
This has devastated me this man was always for peace such a great PM this is tragic prayers to the people of Japan 🇯🇵
Security team would have some explaining to do. How does the shooter get that close to any figure of power?
As if any comment means anything.
never thought this thing can happen in Japan. Japanese is the most obedient citizen. This killer must be sick or brainwashed
You were a good honorable leader how very tragic
Really shocking news. My deep condolences to his family and people from Japan. 😥😥😭
Politician in Japan is more powerful than the Yakuza in Japan? Just wondering🤔🤔🤔
Was it John Wick?
His open view and speech on Ukraine Crises has made U.S unhappy. Decades long rooted far right ideology in Japanese society will be impossible to changed. Any Japanese who want to have independent government , peaceful relation with neighbours will need an another gear. He was the only one to find answer for lost decades and to improve relation with Russia and China. Chinese should shut lousy noise. It is very inhumane to celebrate on death of a human who might have some positive view on China but his hands were tied. R.IP . I for one will remember him as a true patriot who struggled under the shadow of deep dark state . Japanese have to consider their independence first, not Taiwan, not Ukraine. As a human it is so painful to see Japan is dying in lingering slow painful way till all four islands will become an extra star on a flag of war symbol.
RIP
All the leaders who love to kiss the white man's ass need a bullet in their head, it's either you serve your people or the white man.
Huge loss for Japan   I'm stunned  Good bless rest in peace 🙏
I always liked him. There will always be evil in the world, but this was so unexpected. I hope they find out who was really behind this. God bless him and his family. RIP good man.
What a coward to shoot a man …in the back. Mr. Abe seemed a very humble man. So sorry for his family.
This is the same message from the other  assassinations
Rest in hell you puppet of USA and west........
It was a US spy? Is this the beginning of WW3?
F
It looks world doesn’t like peace because good killing and bad people helping so sad that crazy people bad luck
Maybe he is assassinated
RIP
Some African leaders needs this
Very very sad... Bulletproof vests should be required from now on...
The next hopefully gonna be the western leaders
OH BOY !  SOMEONES GONNA GET  HUNG NOW! GET READY FOR WW4
Why would anyone kill Shinzo? Disgusting. You don't kill someone because you disagree with their policies. Trash human.
Like most shooters, this was a man without a sex partner.
和肯尼迪打复活赛吧
Sending positive vibes to the Japaneez peeple
No no no.....!!!🥵🥵
We just wanna to know  why the killer did it. please give us the reason as soon as possible
Classical CIA type operation
he is a good man or bad but he served his country highest level & this kind of death  if you against him like Mr junior bush got treatment in Erak people can do that but this no one deserve
He is not using a gun he made a pipe cannon using diy stuff, you can clearly hear the sound of that thing when he was shot live on tv
BBC as always, ..........
Wonder? Crazy. Why and who behind this.
Does anyone know what his speech was about?
ccp china is happy
Putin the blyat is the culprit no doubt about that!
Việt Nam đã mất đi một người bạn tốt . Nhân Dân và Chính Phủ Việt Nam xin chia buồn với đất nước Nhật Bản . 🇻🇳🤝🇯🇵
🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊🕊
Who will bet that he is assasinated by CCP?
It was the yakuza
heartbreaking...condolences!
Definitely more to this story.
Ww2 pfft... Ww3 here hold my beer
My condolences to the family of mr shinzo abe,to the people of japan..RIP
Shinzo Abe's family is a veritable family of war criminals, his maternal grandfather even led the declaration of war against the United States, resulting in the death of many innocent people, and he himself is also several times to visit the Yasukuni Shrine dedicated to the hands of war criminals stained with the blood of innocent people, and even led Japanese government officials to the Japanese emperor shouted long live, not a fool knows what kind of person this is. Comment section of everyone, it is possible that your compatriots, relatives, are because of this person's family and entered the human laboratory or head was cut off by a knife, and this person does not have any contrition, although as human beings out of humanity to his encounter with regret, but not sympathy .
Sad to hear this 😭😭
idk just Spitballing but maybe he was part of the Yakuza or made a deal with them i just can't wrap my head around it cause the Japanese people are very friendly and peaceful people.
Aren’t guns completely outlawed in Japan? Im confused…
I hope they have the man who did it and I hope they give him the ultimate punishment that he deserves. 'Disagreeing' with someone's policies and ideas, is no reason to murder them! RIP Shinzo Abe.
What is wrong with the world now?
R.I.P Abe
Rest easy. My condolences to the family and Japan.
rip abe a true friend to america
What horrible news for such a lovely man my heart goes out to his family and friends 🇯🇵😥🇬🇧
Why does no one assassinate trashes like Putin, or Xi Jing Ping but a leader supported by the people? Sad
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
When we get this 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Spoke to me as well japppieeeaaaaaiiiinnnnnnnn
Everything happening at once makes me thing the world controllers script everything.
This just shows bigger things are coming for all the world leaders in every countries should get ready! Because it has been long any world leader was assassinated!
I think he had a gun
今後日本をまとめていく人が出てくるか不安(´･_･`)
Rest in peace
He was very crafty
The world has lost a good man, prayers for his family and the people of Japan.
Wow his death follows his role model
Not gonna lie, almost nothing shocks me anymore on the news but this actually did. It was so unexpected. RIP
Something isn’t right about this. It’s extremely difficult to get a firearm in Japan. Then to basically get access to the prime minister? I bet he had help from high powers.
Oh my god!!
An act of brutality, not an act of terror?
No way 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😳, he finally killed him.
I was shocked to no end over this
Rest in Peace
I'm really curious what's the real motive. Hard to believe the disagreement over policies is the real motive. I won't be shocked if this happened in USA, but politician shooting in Japan? It's unheard of.
🤒
RIP prime minister. I'm sure some foreign enemies sent someone to kill him
scary, what's wrong in the country? Japan was NOT like this but USA
May his soul rest in peace.🥲
Violence is no only by firearms! More people killed with blunt objects than rifles. Knives and vehicles are used way more than guns. You have mass religious massacres in India and The uk is famous for  bullies, fighting and crime.
This is so awful!  My deepest condolences to his family and friends.  I would never have dreamt of something like this happening to him.
Japannnnnnnn
I wonder if he being named Abe played any role in this. The fact that another president named Abe was assassinated might have on some level inspired the killer.
Who killed him?
japan is typically known as a ultra safe country so insane
That’s horrible. He seemed like a nice man. Condolences to his family 💐  RIP sir.
That's what happens when you emulate America and give up your own culture 😮
🤬❤We have to be able to protect our leaders from being murdered.
Bad man in Japan
We can't believe that it could happen in Japan. 😭😔😓.. our condolence for Mr Abe, we strongly demand the justice of his murder. Who ever did this, need to take strong action from the Japan government
it was a shocking news earlier this morning. I couldnt believe that this kind of thing might happened in Japan.  My.heartfelt condolonces thoughts and prayers to the Mr. Abe's family, friends and to the japanese people, we lost a great leader a great man.   May Abe-san rest in paradise. 🙏🙏
In Japan, the private ownership of firearms is prohibited.  Further proof that gun control laws don’t work.
This is nuaghtie
We love you Shinzo and we will miss you.Our deepest condolences go to your family and friends.God picks his most beautiful flowers to to garnish his Heaven and that's why He has picked your soul and may you rest in peace while waiting for your loved ones to join you!😥
Is their red hand of china involved in this?  Probably not, otherwise BBC would pretend to be unaware.
HE WAS SHOT FROM BEHIND, WHICH MEANS, HE WAS SHOT TREACHEROUSLY BY COWARDS. JUST LIKE, FOR SOME RARE OCCASIONS, PHYTONS WERE ABLE TO KILL TIGERS, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GREAT JAPANESE LEADER.
very sad to see such a disaster in the most peaceful Country and population. but
Having worked between UK 🇬🇧 and Japan over 30 years. This is most shocking news and sad. How can this happen in such peaceful country.
日本人でも銃撃事件というのは未だに信じられない。
NEVER SAY HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP FROM HELL ON C-SPAN WASHINGTON SWAMP JOURNAL 😉
C-SPAN PROTECTING CHINA JOE AND HUNTER.
I was shocked his death.  He is great Prime Minister of History of Japan. Have guided his country last 15 years.  He is best example to today young Japanese and youngest of World.  Having good relationship with people and world leaders.  You are best inspiration to me.  Thank you sir for your support to development of India.  Rest In peace of your soul. Condolences for your family and Japanese people
No need
Sorry about his assassination!  Condolences to his family in their time of grief.
Is this true?
The most decent and kind of Leader for this chaotic era of leaders around the world this time.
🇺🇸🇯🇵
Anbe jong-eun his shooting is a tragedy for many in the world, where he has worshiped at the Yasukuni Shrine, denied history of aggression and even distorted it. The Chinese hated him.
I hate to guess, but I can't help. This lamentable incident shows that my country has already become dangerous enough to be killed by somebody who I don't know at all someday w/out any plausible reason. Japan is safe? As if !!!
Here is the last paragraph of NYTimes obituary today ; In a speech in August 2020 to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, Mr. Abe focused almost exclusively on the Japanese victims of the war, either on the battlefields of Asia, in air raids on cities across the country or in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   He made no references to learning the lessons of history.
Heart breaking :((
RIP. Too much terrorism in the world right now. Give free speech and democracy a chance.
how that’s cud be! With a lot of security??? so sad
Very disgusting to hear not only someone taking his life but the celebration of Chinese Nationalists, truly goes to show who is good and evil in this world of ours.
What nobody is saying is that Abe's grandfather, as well as his father, were nazi. Shinzo Abe was a shame for Japan; look at his racist immigration policies and his shintoistic militarism, or, if you can go back to the roots of the matter, look at his grandfather's (Kishi Nobusuke) role as governor of Manchukuo during the operations of the Unit 731 and the Massacre of Nanking (the best reference in English is Mark Driscoll's "Absolute Erotic, Absolute Grotesque: The Living, Dead, and Undead in Japan's Imperialism, 1895–1945" (Duke University Press, 2010)). Unfortunately, BBC reports are ignorant of history and will never tell you the whole story.
CIA killed him. He was most popular Prime Minister of Japan. US doesn’t like popular leaders rather puppet.
And we have still got Boris Johnson.
I thought this must be a joke. Upsetting that people feel a need to destroy anyone who has a different view. It only takes one determined person to change the world in the worst way.
Now, if that happened in China, it would have been a whole different story.  There would be dancing in the streets to loud music, and the might even have cake and ice cream!  Don’t you just love the holidays?
*Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe*
😭😭😭
So in a country with some of the most restrictive gun and weapons laws where cops don’t even have guns, and permits are required for swords a criminal still manages to get a gun…USA take note…
The Creator gave us this beautiful Earth and we have failed miserably the nukes are coming and we will return to Ice Age sad but true
いい方でした、ご冥福をお祈りします
This is... unexpectedly happen... What on Earth just happen..? Why are they shoot him..?
He may not be perfect, and does not deserves such a last moment. But, he choses to bring his country's knees  down  to the US in every sense though his country economic was hammered and destroyed flatly by the US. His leadership was indeed very upsetting to many Japanese. RIP and deepest condolences to his family.
He built the gun.  Which totally negates the guns are hard to get angle
Rest In Peace, Sir🙌🏽.
Guns dnt kill people ,but people do
He got hit by a double barrel. What a sad day!!
He didn’t just „die“, he was assassinated!! RIP!! 🙏🏼
Assassination is the act of a fearful coward may the investigation be successful blessings to Japan
まさか日本でこんなことが起きるとは思いませんでした。
Present day is no katana days, wake up Japanese! Thought you were arisen, still fast asleep you are. RIP Abe.
China 🇨🇳 involves? He is An-Ti communism all his life.
Descend ant of a class a war criminal....advocate of militarism in Japan.....I ll drink for his demise
The only people that profit from this terrible act are the CCP.  something to think about.
Condolence. His legacy is mixed at best for the people in China and Korea but he was working hard and boldly for the good of his people, while at least based on his judgement. Only history can tell if it is wise to put Japan firmly on the collision course of a rising power - China.
TOSHIBA company not home ABE Support clear 👍🙏🔥
RIP TO HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS
Died? Why not "was killed"?
Do you know Korean and Chinese response to Shinzo Abe death ? Do you know what Shinzo Abe did with Republic of Korea when he was in PM office ? He declared Japan should have nuclear weapons and push the congress to change the Japan constitution to have own army to join the war with other countries . He never apologized to Republic of Korea and China , other Asian nations who suffered the WW II .  If you believed Japan is a peace loving country , you can look at WW II and the history from end of 1800s tp 1945.
Its called an assassination bbc ! Doing everything you can to confuse  !
rip
Rest in Peace and condolences to the people of Japan .
Chinese are behind it for sure. They never liked the idea of Japan increasing military spendings. Left and communista hated him.
This is very sad news not just for Japan but for the entire Democratic World. My sincere condolences to the Former Prime Minister's family and to all the Japanese people at this time of pain and grief. May Shinzo rest in peace. Force Japan. Brazil stands in solidarity with the national and international Japanese community.
He died!? I remember seeing him years ago man he didn't deserve this.
...deepest condolences to the wonderful people of Japan.
Condolences for his family and Japan, may he rest in peace 🕊.  Hopefully this will shed a light on the people with psychological problems. There's been too much cases like these across the world lately.
Very sad day,this is just sicking, thoughts and prayers for the family.
That’s horrible
Condolences to the family of Shinzo Abe and the people of Japan. No one should be surprised about the events of the world anymore. Who would have thought Russia would invade Ukraine in 2022. The world is currently in the early stages of a major conflagration similar to World War 1 and World War 2. Except something brings us back from the brink. Pray hard not to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Inspired by the US democracy and puppet allies now rest in peace shinzo abe
handmade gun killed him. gosh
彼が好きだった、彼のおかげで今の日本がある。彼は世界の国々と日本の間に良い関係を構築した功績がある。涙が止まらない。悔しい。どうか安らかに。
One less Globalist.
Rip shinzo  UK is shocked and saddened
When humanity decided to make money sluts of the golden calfs the stars. Leaders of Our Baby killer race things started to go down hill.The Dumb blind deaf are easy to please.
I was Stunned. A Wonderful man.
I have a feeling a political rival paid the mob to take Abe out if he has such great popularity and political influence in Japan. Won't benefit to go against someone who has so much popularity. Or the mob took it in thier own hands if his policies was messing with their bussiness.
What’s with the title of Abe “dies after being shot at?” Why wouldn’t it state Abe was assassinated by being shot? He didn’t die from being shot at he died after being shot.
Japan allied with America... American submarines are in Japan... China Russia....... ........... Rip.....
It’s time to ban trigger fingers and eyes in japan lol. Don’t forget knives can be thrown they’re dangerous too heck ban everything.
Must be a shock in such a chill country
Same thing happened in South Africa in 1993 when MANDELA gave the order for Chris Hani to be assisanated  ....but he is today a UN hero      POLITICS IS A DiRTY GAME
ক্ষোভ থেকে নৌবাহিনীর একজন সাধারণ সোলজারের পক্ষে প্রধানমন্ত্রী কে হত্যার বিষয়টি জাপানের প্রক্ষাপটে অকল্পনীয় ব্যাপার
TERRORIST Took A Wonderful  Man. Japan Love To All IN this Grief.
I cannot believe this happened.
Shinzo Abe is the grandson of A-class war criminals during the second world war, the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi. Shinzo Abe himself, a conservative who refuses to admit Japan's war crimes, is shameless. I celebrate the shooting of Shinzo Abe. A shameless person from a bloody political aristocratic family, truly deserved such an ending! Banzai! Hurray, banzai! hurray!
RIP MR ABE.  A steady hand through turbulent times.
Japan is a mess right now. It is only G7 country which has banned tourists despite Japanese freely going anywhere.   Aging population, no English, no innovation, inflation, lost soft power to Korea, surrounded by enemies. Get in the G7 proper Japan.  Ps: lived there for 10 years
😔... 🌷
Can I just say that I appreciate the comments more than if this had happened in the US or even in Canada (where I am).  People are choosing to be respectful and share their condolences rather than attack one another and make this hyper-political.  Thank you to everyone for being civil during what is obviously a very difficult time for his family, friends and the community that loved him.
Well of course BBC is gonna blame it on China rather than what Abe actually pursued, Japan's own military prowess and removal of that pacifist constitution and american military bases, against the wishes of the West. Shinzo Abe Rest In Power.
Just wondering...who is writing your headlines?  Shinzo Abe was not "shot at", he was shot.
I think China did that, assassinations are there thing
sad for his fate!
I'm so sorry to hear this news. It's my prayers that his family will heal from this tragedy.
Sincerest Condolences to Abe's family and to the Japanese people.
Did the shooter have ties with the CCP?
He asked the W.E.F. to restrain military expansionism in Asia.....coincidence? 🤔
Wish it was biden
Putin has a habit of killing people whom he considers to be "traitors".
So appauling   , my sincere  condolences  to the Family and people  of  Japan  , this dedicated  man gave all of himself  so very sad.
Such a gentle soul Sooo sad , may his soul rest in peace
Gun control doesn’t work again. SHOCKING🤯!
How are those gun control laws working out? 😂
It will be interesting to learn why this 41-year-old man assassinated Shinzo Abe.  You can disagree with someone politically without killing them, so there might be more to this than is being said.  Maybe I'm wrong about that, but it's just my first impression.
When you expect something like this to happen in Russia to Putin but instead it happens in the least expected country in the world
Life is always precious but let's not get too sad for a corrupt individual who incited hate in order to arm Japan for aggression.
R.I.P.
Human are unpredictable.
But Japan has strict gin control. How could this have happened?
you mean he was "assassinated"?
Yesterday Johnson step down, today this… The Great Reset is happening fast… new world order.
I'm surprised nobody boycotted us for all are American imperialism across the world
Dammn that's tough
🙏 rest in power
Haha, has anime really softened Japan's image this much? Imperial Japan must be having a laugh!
Rest in peace. He did so much good.

Japan has always been ruled by the criminal gangs (like all the capitalist west, actually all the planet) 😁
二二六事件以来の衝撃
Yakuza committed the 1st nerve gas mass killing and you say Japan is a peaceful country? Japan has a terrible justice system, very 3rd wordly.  That is why Western Nations has the best judiciary system, the 12 jurry system.
RIP MR Abe🙏, Great Man, Legend
I can't believe this thing happened in Japan , condolence to the Family...
He wasn't shot at. He was actually shot 3 times with a shotgun. If your going to report on an assassination, call it for what it was.
日本は深い悲しみに包まれています‥。 安倍さん‥悲しいよ。
Rest in peace Shinzo Abe. I don't know much about you, but you did not deserve to die.
My sincerest condolences go out to Mr. Abe's family. May he rest peacefully.   The actions of certain individuals in this world makes me mentally exhausted.
RED WINNIE POOH  AND ADOLF PYTIN   hahahahahaahahahahhaha
Bloody bbc channel, killed many leaders indirectly worldwide
How could this happened in Japan supposed to be one of the safest country on earth
WHO SHOT HIM? WHY?  damn this report was virtually useless.
Who is next...   must be Russian PU & Chinese XI.  Then, for a while, the world will be a little more peaceful and livable.
That's too bad.
Rest in peace Shinzo Abe. Nothing he did made him deserve such a brutal death. A disagreement over policy should not lead to someone being murdered that is barbarism. I always admired his policy of Japanese rearmament as I believe a stronger Japanese military would help secure peace in Asia. Japan is far different than it was 80 years ago they have not been a threat to other countries  for decades now so I think it is fair we finally  give them the same freedom in how they want to build their military that other countries have. Japan today is a pacifist country at heart so a stronger Japanese military would only be used for defensive purposes.
BBC ka haath hai isme...500%
It's a good reminder for every politician, who thinks that he's immortal
India had great connection with this great man and he was also awarded Padma Vibhushan ,India's second highest civilian award because of his deep allies with India.Having no words to say after getting this horrible news.He didn't deserve to die in this way.A great man with a great soul.My deeply condolences to his family and closed ones.Rest in peace sir.💔🙏That culprit should get punished for what he did.
Whoa... Whom ever he supported Wins! Very sad to see this violence in such a civil Country...

China pushin up
Thats what humanity gets for inventing politics.
Oh god why😶😐🤨RIP he did so much for this country 🤔🙄
It's shocking. And condolences to the  Japanese people
Well my theory is that he was shot because someone OR SHOULD I SAY SOMETHING.......wanted Japan to fall into the abyss of death and destruction,he was a strong leader............THEY WANTED HIM GONE.....................but its not over........they are just beginning............this will be something.......very sinister and unexpected..........
SAD DAYS BAD DAYS RIP
Japan people. I want you to blame Japan for this case. The media impression manipulation of the Japan in particular is really terrible. I was tired of TV stations that repeatedly told me things that didn't matter.
Japan is a terrorist country from the very beginning of 1938 till now
Rip mr shinzo abe 🇮🇳🙏🌹🌷
Inside job by someone with money and means to a gun. His family had to okay the  hit.
When i see this my mind says what are they setting us up to see next.
Every country is getting influenced to do evil deeds thanks to the evil  western countries ....
Thank you
It should take place yesterday.
RIP, hope 🇯🇵 🏯🗼⛩🗾 🕊✌
God will Jugde him and all of us.
The world has gone insane. Every day it gets crazier.
Mr Abe was a true leader, reaching out to try and build bridges, make friends and was a true ally to the United States-very very sad.
I am stumped as to who gains or benefits by Shinzo Abe's death. This could be our Archduke Ferdinand assassination. That sparked of the First World War/ Great War.
気狂い沙汰
My sincere condolences to Abe's family, this is a heartbreaking and shocking news for all of us. May he rest in peace and be remembered.
May God bless his family
May your beautiful soul rest in peace 💔💔💔😭😭😭
Definitely the world is up side down... I'm shocked. My condolences for Japan.
This is shocking! What’s the killer’s motive of killing Mr. Abe? He’s such a good man and brought honors to their country Japan😞
How can this sort of brutality happen during this pandemic, when we mostly need cooperation, love and care.
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8VfoDgCtbRUYICl9ZYjgr6H5TmVtgI8h
Abe was the rightwing extremist leader for so long in Japan.  He was the worst possible person to lead Japan.
Really. This prof the security company was paid for the Misson the security complain are the kill lesson 5o report sigpore report to how did he knew come inversgate the security complain how did the got paid
So sad this morning for the country of Japan and Abe's family. I respected him as a leader and join the world in mourning his untimely death.
Rip Abe                      from 🇨🇦's
Violence isn't rare in Japan but gun violence is very rare
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8VfoDgCtbRUYICl9ZYjgr6H5TmVtgI8h
I was shocked when I read the news. I thought he had a severe illness. Prayers for the Abe family from Manila.
Assassination in 2022. This is awful. May he rest in peace.  Election Sunday? Who was he campaigning for? What is Japan's security protocol for former PMs? A comment said the perpetrator was Japanese navy???
Kawaesho ne Shinzo Abe 😭😭 Rest in peace Shinzo Abe 🙏🙏
Another senseless assassination by an insane person.....ala JOHN LENNON!!!!!
I didn't agree with many of his politics, but I still had respect for him as a politician and it's horrendous news to hear of his unjustifiable end.   No person involved in the political system of any country, politician or voter, should fear for their lives because someone disagrees with them. Sadly we don't live yet in a world where that's reality.
Justice for Mr. Shinzo Abe. from Philippines.amen.
Good ones are always taken first so sad and shocked
Condolences to Mr. Abe family   sending thoughts and prayers from Albania
It's a bad world.
Rest in Peace ABE
You're trying to say assassinated but just can't quite say that?
He is someone. As a human we indian loved a lot. He was a gem and a true leader.. Rest in peace abe sir
That is tragic. I hope the mentality of America hasn't gone worldwide. Just a senseless killing.
Lets go to our correspondent in a totally different country.....
ramsfield, bowell, trump, bojo,now shinzo. we have lost so many honest people these yrs, so sad 🐶
All the weebs in the world will cry for him.
Single global government coming
Biden and his clions should learn from it.  When people are pissed they are pissed.
Rest In Peace to Japan from people in Cambodia 😢
must be fake news
PM Shinzo Abe is a good friend to the Philippines.  He was the one who granted DU30 our much needed Coast Guard ships, Subway Train development, North Rail, etc projects.   I am very disgusted as to the people behind this shooting.
He wasn't "shot at" he was shot
He is close to my father's age , for some reason that made my heart drop more. I can't imagine how his children feel
I will argue with someone until the cow's come home,but violence is never the answer to a question! He was one of a few Asian/Pacific Leader's I had faith in that sought Peace over War,and preparedness of an inability to respond. My "Best Wishes and Hopes for the people of Japan! I really do miss the quality of Japanese Electronics's, and I love my Toyota!
One cannot die from being ‘shot at’. One can die from being shot.
Japan needs to pass more gun control.
Gee I thought gun control worked lol
The grandson of a World War II Class A war criminal, Shinzo Abe was a war fanatic who wanted to make Japan a war-ready nation by denying history and revising the Japanese constitution. It is ironic that such a person would die at the hands of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, which he wanted to raise himself.
Deeply Saddened. A very good leader RIP🙏
Acts like this cause leaders to isolate themselves from their people for their protection. Maybe Japanese politicians won't want to give speeches and talk to constituents in public like this anymore
Wellllll.......he died for a reason..........and we should all accept that....whatever that reason is............
Shocked
God be with him. Shinzo Abe was well respected by so many people throughout the world.
This man has had an impact on Japan's politics for a long time. I was shocked to read the news this morning about his passing. May His Memory Be A Blessing.
Again Putin is guilty?
illuminati confirmed.
😞
Rest in peace Abe-san.
Japan are known for interfering in other countries politics for the benefit of the right wing, for money. stalling progress, especially when  it comes to rights and social policies. Other countries do this but generally back the major party of the left and push for social change
Dies not Killed? Funny how they play with words depending on narrative
omg.  Condolences, this is just horrible.
He was assassinated
He was a fine bank agent--Rockefeller guy--who was given a little freedom to help Japan, but not much. Kept Japan under US Bank Cartel that did Covid/Vaccines with Big Pharma and Media. Maybe he tried to separate from Banks a little too much in recent years--that would explain it. The guy in power now will stick with Cartel to detriment of Japan. BBC is responsible for all this--it pulled the trigger.
The security was awful,realy amateur,you can see in youtube  After the first shot they still had time to save him.
भगवान उनकी आत्मा को शांति प्रदान करे🙏 ओम शांति🙏
One of the most respected politicians of this century and certainly one of the ablest . Japan has has lost a respected statesman who always put the country first in everything that he did .
Ы
This is ludicrous! In Japan? This is unheard of. How could this happen? My deepest condolences goes to his family and the Japanese people. No matter how much one disagrees with the other, violence is never the solution.
🕯️He is beyond the reach of the bullschitt of this world now.
Probably shot by of those hikikomori’s from Japan. Watched a documentary on them. Lonely losers of society
Google is an evil big tech company which is helping CCP behind!  I tried to leave comment several time about my viewpoint.  They censored my comment, deleted and don't want to let others see my comment.
Planned hit by bigger people
this is crazy man...
I am truly in shock. Firstly, the fact that there was a shooting in Japan and secondly, he was a HUGE patriot and did so much to rebuild Japan. My condolences to his family, friends and country 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💗💗💗💗💗💗
Horrific.
Rest In Peace from Japan
My deepest condolences to Shinzo Abr's family and friends and to the entire world  What have we become?
it was important to remove Shinzo if China intends to over-run Taiwan. Shinzo kung-fu was very very strong now that he is gone, there is no one to stand up to Xi. Please don't say, Biden...are you kidding?
R.I.P Abe
Whos next?Biden?
4:08 人の死を祝うとは……. 所詮はその程度の国なのでしょう。　隣国やメディアに何と言われようと　自国の為に　強い信念で臨んだ安倍晋三氏に哀悼の意を捧げます。本当に悲しい。一番大切な人を亡くしました。
Parents and teachers stopped teaching children the "golden rule" 40 years ago and now honesty and caring for others keeps declining.
CIA job?
That is the poorest byline. “Shot at” implies that the shots missed. The fact that the bullets hit and he died (RIP) means you would just say “shot.”
China did this
This is not the kind of thing that usually happens in a place like Japan. What a horrifying situation! I hope that this wonderful country will be able to stray away from the political nonsense that is plaguing places like mine. My condolences to the family and friends.
Not expecting this.
My sincere condolences and sympathy to his family, and the people of Japan, and may he rest easily in peace😔👏✨ sending prayers for better,  from NY 🏙🇺🇸❤️❤️
Heartbreaking... japan used to be very peaceful and sweet
Oh dear, the "weST" governments are falling apart, now they are being shot.. who is next?
I’m so sad. I like Shinzo Abe 🇵🇭😞
He served his country to his limit, now he may rest.  Rest in peace, Shinzo Abe.
JESUS IS PURE TRASH YOUR GOD IS PURE TRASH YOUR GOD LET THEM DIE   JESUS= 🤡🤡🤡👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮
CCP has a blood on their hands.
Always the same thing all over the world: a moron with a gun😢
What's the reason for being shot??
BBC putting down the man because he was a conservative. That's the BBC
Meus sentimentos
Can't believe it
I wonder who's trying to cause a reason to open up Japan's gun selling markets   Trillions to be made in designer guns and ammunition
Koreans and the West are celebrating
https://youtu.be/MxbfKsRwq0k
Murdered for not mandating the jabs.
2:03 Inside job?😮
You don't deserve this! Incredibly shocking for the safest country in the world. You will be remembered as a good leader. Rest in Peace PM Abe! My condolences to the family and to all people in Japan.
Prayers to Lord for good Soul
Rest in peace Abe. It was shocking to see news like this in Japan, which is supposed to be one of the most peaceful countries in the world. He truly represented the character and spirit of Japanese people. What a great man he was. Respect to Japan, one of my favourite countries in the world! 🇯🇵🇯🇵
😰😭
But gun control right oh making guns illegal did nothing..
My condolences to the Abe Family and to the people of Japan.🙏🏾
Sorry, your correspondent for Japan is in Singapore? I used to live in Kuala Lumpur. Having a Malaysian correspondent in Singapore would've been enough of a joke, but for Japan? Her Singlish is not bad, though. Err, lah.
I hope this happens to prime minister of Albania
Violence is all too common today.
I can’t believe this is happening in Japan. What a horrific moment. My heart goes out to the whole Family and for the country of Japan.
Intresting
This absolutely a shocking news. My deepest sympathy to the families and people in Japan. Most of the time good leaders are killed may justice prevail. And may his soul rest in peace. 🙏
I'm going to assume he was a nationalist and not a globalist, so he had to go.
the world is going to shit
My condolences for his family
RIP PM Abe. Thank you for helping Philippines. ❤️🇯🇵🙏
Sad! Reading these comments, it's so obvious that Mr. Abe was globally liked and respected. Mean comment is like just 0.1% of them. R.I.P 🥀
Laughable to call him a "nationalist" for making empty gestures while aiding and abetting the occupier -- upwards of 70,000 US soldiers there since WWII.
Thank you for showing compassion toward him and Japan. Shinzo let us Japanese realise the spirit and the pride of this nation, and neccesity that we must beef up our defence. We cannot predict that brutal assassination broke out utterly, and neither can he. After all, as BBC reports, in Japan it's extremely rare for someone to use a gun to shoot another one, whether or not he/she is a VIP.  Anyway his death is a great loss to us. Besides democracy shall not yield to violence.   ---from somewhere remote in Japan
Why, there is two parts to the story, what did he do to the man?
heart breaking 😭
Japan is such a close friend of Europe and US. So sad…
We knew that CIA hired this man.
Historic day has been unlocked
I'd expect this to happen in America or the Middle East but Japan? What's happening to Japan?
How the hell was this allowed to happen, where were the armed security?
I hope Islam dies the Prophet Muhammad was a dirty disgusting filthy pig just like your God the Muslims worship a pig
Very sad moment for India and Japan 🇮🇳 🇯🇵 We will stand together, we will stand strong.
There is a lot of violence in Japan that the world never hears about
I hope Islam dies the Prophet Muhammad was a dirty disgusting filthy pig just like your God the Muslims worship a pig
I take out the pages of the Holy Bible I take them out and i curse them then wipe my dirty filthy butt with them put them in the toilet with the filthy diarrhea and let the scripture soak
I take out the pages of the Holy Bible I take them out and i curse them then wipe my dirty filthy butt with them put them in the toilet with the filthy diarrhea and let the scripture soak

JESUS IS PURE TRASH YOUR GOD IS PURE TRASH YOUR GOD LET THEM DIE   JESUS= 🤡🤡🤡👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮
He was a prime minister for so long that I still remember him being the PM. So sorry for Japan’s loss and his Family.
Proppa Cia business not being alluded to by the good cowards at the beeb
Omg
Ask the Jesuits why?
Was a home made shotgun.
Rip Shinzo Abe one of the good friend of india.. he help india giving low interest loan in metro, railway, bullet train project. Om shanti 🙏🙏🙏
Deepest sympathies to his family and the Japanese people.
Why Google censor the comment I left here?  Because I am saying CCP?
A failure of Japanese security and his personal detail. Shame on you.
This is a very dark day for the world!  Something nefarious is going on!  As the build up for WW3 continues, will there be light among the Nations?   RIP PM Abe, & may the mercy of the LORD be upon your soul!  😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
Absolutely shocking deep condolonces to Shinzo Abe family and the people of Japan.RIP🙏
I wonder which terrorists organization will took responsibility. My bet on "Russian Federation" since killing PM is not so easy, but media and politicians will admit that some "Front of liberation something" with 1 table in possessions until putin will boast he did it (like with Crimea before).
Very sad. I heard his speech during his visit to Ethiopia when he was a Prime Minister. He had very good character. Why this happened to him??? May God rest his soul in peace!
He apologized to the Americans for pearl harbour but did not apologize to Koreans who suffered under Japanese rule. Pathetic coward and hypocrite who allowed the US to use his land for military bases
📖 St John chapter 5 verse 24 🙏
You mean assassination.
Yakuza!
He wasn't shot at , he was shot and killed.
Absolutely heart breaking news my thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends
As far as I can remember he's the only Japanese Prime minister that reach out to us and build schools and houses after WW II. My condolences to his family and the Japanese people.  From the Philippines 🇵🇭.
What the hell!?
Deep condolences going out to Japan and family of PM Abe. May you rest in peace!❤️🙏✝️
Rest in peace dear friend.
So he was killed while giving one more speech pushing Japan's abject submission to the US dictates. If he had any shed of honor he should have committed seppuku there BEFORE giving the speech. Now they will try to spin his dishonorable death (following a dishonorable life) as somehow China's fault. That would be a missed opportunity: why not make it China AND Putin?....
Greetings from Pennsylvania.  Indeed these awful guns are killing us innocent civilians, day in day out.  Condolences and prayers for this noble Japanese Prime Minister.
Да простит бог твои согрешения Синдзи . Спи спокойно , добрый человек 😔
He was one of the good guys, Didn't he have security?
Rip😢😢😢🙏 from srilanka🇱🇰
Someone order that..
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
What a great news 😍😍
RIP leader🙏🇮🇳🇯🇵
Just another episode of ghost in the shell
Rip 🙏
The world has an undeniable love for Japan and it's people. They stand as an example of how the world should be on many platforms.
I am deeply saddened by Shinzo Abe's death. Our thoughts and prayers are with him, his family, and his loved ones. Shinzo Abe was a true visionary leader who built the idea for QUAD. He is also awarded by "Paddam Viboushan", the second highest civilian honor in India. May his soul sleep peacefully.🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Brag about how safe it is in Japan, it's just ruled with an iron fist so ppl have more difficulty lashing out with impunity
After the 1918 flu, acts of violence increased.
So bad why he need to kill him?? His a good man and leader😭😭😭 my deepest sympathy
This is sad and shocking.🙏🌹🙏😥
It’s so nasty that BBC mentioning Chinese are celebrating…absolutely incorrect to focus on less than 1% nationalist with this event. It’s a tragedy, and majority are feeling sad and shocked.. stop trying to bring more conflict/hates among neighbors by using such a sad accident. RIP Mr. Abe
RIP SHINZO , 日本に哀悼の意を表します。
In many videos a saw today about the time the shutter get near Shinzo Abe I have to say, those bodyguards fail to protect him...  In those videos is easy to see all those bodyguards facing forward. No one looking at the back. The first bodyguard just take action after the first shoot. He didn't saw the shutter approaching before the first shoot...
Other than the police and the military, no one in Japan may purchase a handgun or a rifle. Hunters and target shooters may possess shotguns and airguns under strictly circumscribed conditions.
All that Japanese gun control seems to be working lol
So sad. RIP sir.
karma. japan is a very violent country actually. the thing that is rare is political activism. comfort women all over asia must be smiling to themselves and there is no reason to respect this person or mourn him. he WAS NOT POPULAR IN JAPAN. he wanted to eliminate the humanities across all universities. He rewrote history books of japanese colonialism. Good riddance.
❤💚💙💯💔🌻☘🍀
Shootings in Japan. That is shocking???  Who has ever heard of him violence in Japan?
こんな事が選挙中の日本で起きるなんて、残念すぎる
“shot at”  Wow, that’s about as lame as a headline could possibly get for a murder.
HA Ha Ha I hope he suffered alot before he died. 🤞🤣🤣
This is my first time to hear such news from Japan. Iam shocked. RIP to the victim. Condolences to his family and friends.
It's almost like when someone has their mind set on doing harm they find a way 🤔
I still can't believe it :-( My heart goes with Japan. He was great leader that did so much for Japan. He will never be forgotten.
Holyshit
Extremely sad to hear, always felt he was a very humble and nice person.
Homemade gun looks like????
Shinzo Abe-San  was a Great Leader, May he Rest In Peace!  His Assassin should be Publicly Executed! He has brought Total Dishonor to all of his family.  My Sincerest Condolences to Abe-San’s Family!
Japanese are so non-violent. Just ask any of our WW2 surviving US Marines.
心からご冥福をお祈り致します。  I've lived in Japan for 6 years and first came to Japan in 2013. Abe has been Japan's Prime Minister for as long as I've loved Japan. It's still not really even registered to me that he's NOT the prime minister anymore, with Suga-san lasting just 1 year and me not even noticing the transfer to Kishida-san. This came as an absolutely horrific shock to myself and everyone I've talked to today. The fact this happened within Japan is Heartbreaking. Abe-san was a great politician and leader of Japan, and he absolutely didn't deserve this. May his soul rest in peace, and may the people of Japan be strong in this hour of grief.
Rest in piss 🤣🤣🤣 Abe.
May his soul rest in peace 🙏🏻
Abenomask
It was a great tragedy, God bless his soul 😢
He knew some secrets of his western allies and was thus removed once he had served his purpose
that man who killed him is either been paid or politically motivated or driven insane to kill him for no reason
Rest in peace in Yasukuni Shrine.
Who the hell would be so angry with him, just insane. Was it the Golden Triangle? 🐻🙍🇺🇲⚒️🇷🇺
It should have been putin
China
This has just begun
Apparently everybody has forgotten their history. Japan isn't some utopia. It never has been. It has through most of its history been quit violent. This is a fact of "humanity".
Rest In Peace Mr Abe 🙏 💔 😔.  My sincere condolences for the family, friends, and fellow countryman . I hope that the killer will be put to 💀☠,a deserved punishment!! What a sad day for Japan 🇯🇵 😢.
May his soul rest in peace
Who cares? Screw him lower the gas price
❤💚💙💯💔
I extend my condolences on behalf of the people of Iran. He was an incredible and influential leader who served his nation diligently and I can admire that quality, especially now when so many leaders lack such quality.
I was a study abroad student in Japan during his tenure and he was divisive but respected by Japanese citizens. Think of the most tolerable conservative you can imagine in America and that was him. Still, people are universally disgusted by the callous killing!
R.I.P. Mr. Abe.
Soo sorry to hear that bad news. My condolence goes to all Japanese people.
May he Rest In Peace 🙏🙏🙏
Wish someone here in the 🇺🇸 U.S. had the balls to shoot Bydone.
Politicians, how many  people are dying every day??? Let's consider him a regular citizen, would we see such attention??? Every politician is dirty regardless to anything he does or say.
God is about to reset this planet. Tooo much violence smh
Such a bias news reporter...
I'm a Filipino but I'm greatly  sadden of this event, you may rest in peace sir and thank you for making Japan help our country, SAYONARA MR. ABE 😭
Are they still playing the coronavirus game??
Won’t say violence is rare considering there one of the countries with the most serial killers in prison
Very tragic. Senseless violence.  Never expected anything like this. RIP Shinzo Abe. 🙏🏽🕊
*Such a great loss* Condolences to the families and Japan. Need to upgrade political safety for leaders presenting speech during campaigns.. *A full box bullet proof podium*
Insider Conspiracy?
This is shocking! What the hell is going on in Japan? It's the last place in the world I would think of gun violence.
Damn
Growing up and being introduced into Japanese culture, Shinzo Abe is the prime minister. To hear and see his passing, this gives me sadness for the Japanese people. He is a great man.
Such a shocking incident . My deepest condolences to Shinzo Abe. It's such a huge loss not only for Japan but also to India. He shared a great friendship with our political leaders and laid strong foundation for Japan and India. Now law must take its place and punish the culprits.
wow... assassination by the gun of a former leader.!
Japan? really?  wtf
Oh bad
America sends its condolences. Rest well Abe -san
Rip …good leader..!
I think that the Conservative MPs should be way more scared of what Johnson might do than of what Starmer might do. Starmer is perfectly clear on what he wants done!
Unfortunately, in the Philippines, this is more common on low level politicians and journalists to get assassinated. High level politicians are expecting this, so that's why they have security detail.  I think Japan had their guard down since it's very uncommon for them to have a gun, let alone, use it to assassinate a high profile politician.  I do think this was either a crime of opportunity, or was an inside job.
My sympathy to the Japanese people! He was a great leader of Japan and a World Leader who had a great relationship us here in New Zealand!
So sad,
Oh my gosh!!!!! 😱
That's just HORRIBLE😔🙏🏼 WE'RE going to have to not let our leaders stand in public if we don't want to lose them!🚩💔✌🏼  RIP🥀
The guy who shot him was ex-navy and somehow made a homemade gun this is so unlikely to happen in japan
China behind this for sure.
🥲🥲🥲🥲
But aren't guns illegal there?! How could this possibly happen? Did this criminal not know that guns are illegal??
Did Putin have him done in?  🙏 🇯🇵
He loved his country wholeheartedly. Good job ... rest well Sir! You are sorely missed.
What's going on there.. Japan orderly country
Shocking to see something like this happen in a politically peaceful country like Japan. RIP 🙏🏼
check out china and north Korea for a financial backer in his death. there's a stink in the odd house
No guns in Japan, boi still got blasted.
Political violence is never justifiable. I'm so sorry for your loss Japan.😣
Guns ... An evil invention
Another leader victim of gun violence.  Time to eradicate guns worldwide.  To be used strictly for the military and police law enforcement.  Enough is enough...
They have a highly strict gun law. Some countries led by Liberals should take note.
After   the assassination of fomer Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this   morning, it became known that the attacker was extremely dissatisfied  with the policy pursued by the Japanese Prime Minister, one of the main  points of which was the strengthening of the American presence in  Japan.At the moment, it is known that despite the emergency medical  assistance provided by Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese Prime Minister  died in the hospital. However, at the moment it is known  that the  Japanese citizen who attacked him was categorically opposed to  the  actions of Shinzo Abe, who advocated not only the preservation of  the  American presence in Japan, but also the strengthening of the US role in  relations with Japan.At the moment, an investigation is underway into  the attack on Shinzo Abe, however, experts note that if the murder of  Abe is really connected with the pro-American policy of the former Prime    Minister of Japan, then this can seriously affect the promotion of  such  policies in the future, since earlier citizens Japan was  categorically against the strengthening of the US presence in the  country.  US killed million of Japanese with atomic bombs that still being remembered by the families effected by USA radioactive. '';
Abe's assassin probably has ties to China's CCP.
Journey on now you're on the other side
Who was it Russian?  china's?  India?
I love how people post comments saying that abe was a good leader lol. He wasn’t and the current state of Japan proves that he wasn’t. He brainwashed his own people and resulted in ongoing depression, low birth rates (actually negative and not recovering since), and warped history. It is sad that this happened, but he shouldn’t be idolized cuz he was a shitty leader.
Punya
But wait Japan has Gun control….. how could this have happened? It’s almost like gun control doesn’t work!
As Japanese watching this news over and over again on TV makes me feel heavy and speechless 😔 Almost all of the TV stations in Japan are continuously reporting this news since this afternoon. What happened today was unbelievable and I’m in shock….  I was praying for him and thought he could be resuscitated…  My deepest condolences to his family🙏 安倍さんどうか安らかにお眠りください。
If only someone could get Putin
Japan could go woke!!
Very very sad. Deepest condolences for the family and the people in Japan. Great leader from Japan. RIP Mr. Shinzo Abe.
"Nothing happens without the approval of the government"- Quote from the movie Shooter.
Wonderful that so many comments are condolences and good memories.
My heartfelt condolences to the family of Former PM Mr Abe. He was certainly a great leader and it was a loss not just for Japan but the world.
Can't be true- Japan has maximum gun control- the kind U.S. democrats want for their "subjects".
Good, now do western countries next.  There is no surprise that politicians responsible for damages to the environment eventually gets punished.
Very sad
BBC doesn't have any representative in Japan to cover the news from the ground? You are covering news thousands miles away from the ground. How ridiculous!
My condolences to his family and the citizens of Japan. If this can happen in such a peaceful and stable society like Japan I fear the worst for western culture.
Incredible japan god bless u dear friend om santi om from India
May you go into eternity knowing the world respected you
So sad news for Tibetan people and I pray for you and Om mani pae Mey hun
I am neutral over this video
You think who's behind it?
Was his speech in the US? So rare hearing of this in Japan.
表面上死的是日本首相，实际上死的是台湾人的爹😂😂
Hope he shouted banzai first
That’s a damn shame I had just saw the video there was literally no need for violence against him he’s still an elder you can disagree without violence smh RIP he did his best at his job as former PM
God help our world!!!
It is not a terrorist attack, its an act of brutality, political violence at worst, maybe an act of no no BUT it is not terrorism. Only and exclusively us are described as terrorists even if a kid playing with fireworks. The USA and its well fed puppies have no terrorists. ESKUM mf hypocrite media. Trump was definitely right
Rip abesan 🥲
Hmmmn what a world.may God  and the law deals with that gunman.may his soul rest well in the bossom of his maker.
Any idea on the motive? What exactly was the ex-navy assassin dissatisfied about?
HWTA
Awful. RIP.
In Japan !!!    in a NO weapon's country!!! very sad.... RIP 😞
Fuck Japan!
台湾🇹🇼の方の追悼コメントに対して侮辱的発言をしている中国🇨🇳人が多すぎる。反吐が出る。人が誰を追悼しようが勝手でしょ。
I believe people are just losing it. This is what 2years of lockdowns and restrictions has done to people and their mental health. God bless his family 🙏🏼 RIP
I didn't expect that from Nippon. RIP
我只能说好死😂，开香槟喽
Terrible security
More power more problems.
Deepest Condolences !! RIP 🙏🙏
Irresponsible news says violence is rare in Japan. I digress. The whole world is nothing but a man made culture of death. Play it down Sam. No big deal in your world.
Horrific news, RIP Abe you mill be dearly missed
Mala Aquino ah
Patiently waiting to see America's gun laws backfire like this.
It is not a terrorist attack, its an act of brutality. Only and exclusively us are described as terrorists even if a kid playing with fireworks BUT the USA well fed puppies have no terrorists. ESKUM mf hypocrite media. Trump was definitely right
The world gone insane its getting worse.
The word of the day in English: Assassinated!! Call it as it is!!!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭 very sad
台湾人和死了爹滴一样伤心，可把我笑坏了
VIOLENT WORLD.. ..
現代の日本でこのような事件が起きてしまったことはとても残念に思います。それと海外の方々にもこのように哀悼の意を捧げられていることが彼がとても愛されていたリーダーだからこそでしょう。ご冥福をお祈りいたします。
Ok... russian relations...national...high influence... ...... so we know, why..
Shocking and Heartbreaking😢😭 My heartfelt condolences to the whole family and to the people of Japan.💐🌷💐 Rest in peace PM Abe🙏😢
His death was tweeted before the shooting how come?
Our evil leaders murder us off as many ways as they can treat us like dirt control us yet 1 of them is murdered and the person is evil  the word should be real hero
My condolences to Shinzo Abe and family, may your soul go to heaven
一路走好
Oh My!!! Abenomics is gone? Ahhh... Such an unnecessary sad loss for Japan. My condolences to his family and country.
Real murderer behind the scene needs to be found out
Condolences to Japan. This is very rare for Japan, but every country has a few crazies.
They don’t show it
ขอแสดงความเสียใจ ต่อครอบครัว อดีต นายกรัฐมนตรี ชินโซะ อาเบะ และประชาชนญี่ปุ่น อย่างสุดซึ้ง 🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵 From Thailand 🇹🇭
Must be an inside job.  RIP
He wasn't shot at. If you are shot at it indicates they have missed.
Ím thinking óf family.
That’s so sad….
GUNS AREN'T THE PROBLEM, JAPAN HAS THE STRICTEST LAWS ON EARTH AGAINST THEM. CRAZY MANIACS LIKE THIS FORMER BATSHIT SOLDIER CAN CREATE ANY WEAPON FROM ANY MATERIALS.   REST IN PEACE ABE SAMA.
Why are you talking to Singapore? Talking to local Japanese contacts would be smarter.
Absolutely shocking news
元首相を殺害したのはスパイだった
whacked
Hope this assassination had nothing to do with Russia or China, if not, this means WAR!
Because   that's  the  kind of  world  we  live in today   poor middle  class  and  elite. And I'm  afraid   the  lower  two  are pretty   pissed off  with being  fucked. It's only  going to get  worse
😭😭😭😭
China did this! China and it's mongrel pup state north Korea is global threat.
China people all congratulate the things when known the news.
Damn.
Really sad. I am not good at politics but I very respected him as one individual - he’s always gentle, calm, and positive, Abe-san was really one of a kind before he’s a PM. I’m proud that we had such a charismatic leader, and I still cannot believe we lost him like this, it’s terrifying. Rest In Peace, where you don’t have to fight anymore.
So sad 😞 😥
Sad news,   Rest in peace Shinzo Abe
You can be touched, be aware Schwab ,gates Johnson,aderne,Trudie,biden and the rest of the WEF shills
But but but, if had his own gun this wouldnt have happened, right America, RIGHT ???
China
There's a word for it when a political figure is murdered... gah, I'll think of it...
What the F is happening to our world today
China is all over this.....
RIP Shinzo Abe. My condolences from here in Thailand.
Them killed Putin friend
Haaaiittt.....Rest in peace neh
靖国幽霊屋敷に遺骨が安置されるのか。
I'm shocked.
This is quite shocking. RIP Mr. Abe.
What?? In Japan also?? Such a charismatic, handsome man he was!
🖕🖕🖕🖕China from AMERICA
Look at these comments, despite his success and failures, people all over the world still respect him. Contrast that with Trump.
💐ॐ शांति ॐ शांति ॐ शांति💐🙏 यह शर्मनाक और दुखद घटना कतई नही होना चाहिए था। विश्व नेतृत्वमें शिन्जो आबे कि अभाब अपूरणीय। जय हिंदुस्तान जय मा भारती🇮🇳
It's really shock to know such incidents
heartbreaking news. my heart is with the Japanese people as they come to terms with this unthinkable tragedy. the American people grieve with the Japanese today
Unreal. Very Sad end to this legacy.
Wao, wao, wao. The Empire smells close.
Horrified!  I mourn with Japan at the loss of such an important and influential  figure, well known and liked around the world.
It is still unbelievable that this has happened.
This is really heartbreaking💔😥 My deepest condolences to ex pm abe's family and to japan. He was a great leader and very supportive to my country Philippines. Rest in peace pm abe. 🙏🙏🙏  #justiceforpmabe
It's a Chinese conspiracy
Do you know how far Singapore is from Japan? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Since when do they carry guns in Japan ??????????????!!!!
So sad 😯😭😭😭😢
Why do I have a feeling that Russia is behinds this
Noooo!! RIP 😢😢
Chinese honored him with fireworks
China had this done
Terrible news
awful man, had it coming. wanted to take japan back to the imperialist fascistic time of WW2. the man was like the japanese putin and the fact he still had power after leaving office, which is horrifying when you consider his ideological beliefs. terrible man, glad he's gone so his reign of terror against thr japanese people ceises.
The shooter was in the wrong place he should have been in Russia  to help PIGBIN along  his journey to hell
Bad thing about assassinations is the wrong people get shot . This should have been  Trump or putin not someone that did good for his country
My condolences to family of Abe san and to people of Japan.
Remember it’s the new norm
This is quite shocking. He was definitely the face of Japanese politics to me. May his soul rest in peace.
Rest in peace abe
In Asian-Russian Federation we trust
The current PM probably had it done.
Im sorry japan🕆❤
He was assassinated let's be honest all the good guys are......................
wow this is super rare for japan politics, a gun violence? assassination? if it murica it wont even be news worthy , but japan? so rare
NHK Japan's national news agency has no coverage of this.
I'm very doubtful that any Japanese people are actually surprised by this assasination though.  Was this the second successful assassination of Japanese prime minister or third?
- Most terrible incompetent bodyguards ever - Most brain dead crowd ever, only watch, do not help  In short. This was totally a preventable tragedy.  Abe will be best known for his smart economic development plans which saved Japan from economic collapse and actually led to a growth (Abenomics). But he also increased military spending and capacity by a lot which is very controversial. But he is very popular and beloved most Japanese and that's why he is longest serving PM of all time.   However we can all agree that Abe is by far the most handsome and charismatic Japanese leader in a very verh long time.  Rest in peace. This was quite the shocking crime. But Japan's society has long been sick and twisted so its unsurprisingly some people have gone insane for them to do this to a retired old man.....
Chinese loyalists killed Shinzo Abe. No different from Haiti president killed.
Wouldn't surprise me if China was involved.
Хуясе
Why couldn't this have been Drumpf?
As a Chinese, I’m here to apologise for those those who celebrating for his death. It’s apparently wrong. Not everyone is nationalist here. We’re deeply shocked and sorry for his death. Although China and Japan didn’t go well. But at least when he’s on stage we are better than now. Hope Abe Rest in peace.   Salute from Budapest. Hungary
I thought he was in the USA giving a speech. Absolutely shocked.
Deeply shocking and unexpected coming from Japan.
Do you know 45 tanker trucks loaded with Syrian oil STOLEN by American army crossed into Iraq illegally today, while, ironically. On America's independence day July 4th, another 55 oil tankers were also reported to have crossed Syria into us military bases in Iraq  You don't reported that one and you will never ever do because is not Russia  China  Iran  etc.
Security was sleeping?
Karma never fails. It's one of the few things that still work.
What were his influences in Japanese society?  News reports give the shocking story, but not an in-depth one.
We (FILIPINOS) mourn with you Japan this is so shocking news and sad 😞😢 EX PM SHINZO ABE is a good man he help us also here Rip Sir. Condolences to your bereaved family.
Was he an anti-Globalist or was he a threat to Soros or the Rothschilds banking dynasty?
I have no words, Abdolutely Shocked!!! RIP Mr. Abe , Condolences from Chile , South America 🇨🇱
My condolences to... everyone this is a great loss for the entire world...
The first thing I want to say is Where was the security at tho
Shot from behind, even. What a coward
安倍向来支持台湾，日本定要好好调查背后是否有中共指使。
I didn’t know much about this person but r.I.p
The medias have not revealed anything about his private life and dealings. As during his political career, many have observed him, as hawkish. So has he remained as hawkish ?
A genuinely good man, very sad.
This is the most shocking event in 2022
Jesus ... . I’m speechless.
OMG How sad and horrible...my heartfelt condolences to Mr Abe s family !!!
When politicians start getting murdered,  you have stepped into an abyss that Europe has already witnessed over one hundred years ago. The assassination of the Austrian princess was the beginning of two world conflicts that saw the destruction of social order and the displacement of millions. This is the beginning of something much deeper and dangerous for all of us. God help us all and peace for humanity no matter how impossible it might seem.
My God..
The fact that the killer got that close shows how loose his security was. Our politicians and celebrities are gonna have to start wearing bulletproof from  head to toe, at every event .No One is safe in these streets 😤 May his soul rest in peace 🙏💔
This is some freaking  *hit. My condolescences.
RIP.  Sending condolences to Japan,  his family, relatives and friends.
A Hardworking,Peaceful and much Loved man ?? TOKYO (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of protesters gathered near Japan’s parliament building on Sunday to oppose legislation allowing the Military to Fight Overseas, the latest sign of public mistrust in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Security Policy.  In one of Japan’s Biggest Protests in years - organizers put the crowd at 120,000 - people of all ages braved occasional rain to join the rally, chanting and holding up placards with slogans such as “No War” and “Abe, QUIT”. Demonstrators swarmed into the street before parliament’s main gate after the crowd size made it impossible for police, out in heavy numbers, to keep them to the sidewalks. A second nearby park area also filled with protesters. The rally was one of more than 300 this weekend in Japan protesting Abe’s move to loosen the post-war, Pacifist Constitution’s constraints on the Military. We need to make the Abe government realize the public is having a sense of crisis and ANGRY. Let’s work together to have the bills scrapped,” Katsuya Okada, head of Japan’s largest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, told the Tokyo rally. Rest in Peace.
This is a big thing. These kind of political assasinations doesnt happen frequently. He was a very influential man.
They tricked him out of that original seat and position SMH
Killed by akatsuki
He honored the Japanese war criminals that allied with the Nazis before, you know the war criminal that did to the Filipinos, Koreans, and Chinese worse than what Hitler did to the Jews.
Very sad day in Japan.  Very soft spoken & warm hearted gentleman to the core. With appreciations to his contribution to Japan & the entire globe, in his unassuming ways.He will be well remembered. Salutations to Abe Shinzo.
lol political violence is "really rare" in the history of Japan? RLLY? No clue, BBC.
Shows guncontrol don’t work
Point blank maybe he shouldn't of gone there then
abe was weak PM.
It's sad.... Very shocked !
China and South Korea are involved in the attack. These two countries along with North Korea are a blot in our world. While China and North Korea are openly deviant, South Korea are nothing but their dogs, hiding under the veil of the Entertainment industry.
Omg! Just waking up in California and saw this news. My heart goes out to President Abes family. 😢 God give them peace and closure soon.
Really Shocking news. My deep condolences to  his family and the Japanese people. Given the life span of Japanese people, his life was cut off by Atleast 30-35 years. So so not fair
😏😏😏🤪🤪🤪😎😎😎😈😈😈
BANZAIII
Boris Johnson, now this????
RIP Shinzo Abe. An honorable statesman who was respected and welcomed with open arms throughout the world. He worked hard to enhance his country and his government helped so many developing countries throughout the world. My country is grateful for his friendship and generosity.
This is probably done by a commie.
What a shame for a country like japan. What were the securities doing. This shows how unprepared japan is if the war breaks out. Feel so sad for him n his country japan.
Killing men , that represented women they Malcolm X him smh what’s going on I never seen this in Japan publicly u never really know what people are seeing where is that love Nd perspectives
Putin is behind this !
There’s only two types of people in Japan who wanted the ex-prime minister dead: those godamn Nazi-inspired neo-imperialists or the Yakuza who wanted to fix an unpaid debt!
Shooter needs hooking up to the mains until he talks
I am shocked and saddened by this horrible assassination
So sad rip
🙏🙏🙏💔💔💔
ARE SO SURE ruzxia didn't do him in since he opposed putin's aggression? FOOLS AND WORSE are trying really hard to disturb a peaceful free world for their long-handed greed; who's next you have to ask ...
The crime rate and violence in japan is low but never 0. Rip
😭😭😭
RIP Love you from Thailand.You are strong man!!!
Looking from Outside into Japan... Shinzo Abe was a Great Man ! Rip .... he definitely didnt deserve such an end in this life, unnecessary and animalistic act. Whatever the Criminal claims ...to me he is rather a psychopath that did this for attention, a frustrated nobody. Sadly eventually due to the very short range of the fire towards Abe his criminal and animalistic attack was successful ...
No one should celebrate anyone’s death. It's horrible.   --from China
It was an assassination   ........ definitely  more to come 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Mr. Prime Minister Abe has served his whole life for his country. And Millions of citizens have to carry Abe's Spirit to run the most beautiful country Japan ever! May gory to Japan and rest in peace Mr. Prime Minister Abe Shinzo
Saddest day in the history
Angola former president is also Dead
I was hoodwinked to believe in the no crime Japanese myth
Ive only been to Japan once in my life and it was my favorite place to be. The people are so nice, the culture is amazing, i always hear the gun violence is almost virtually non existent, guess i was wrong. RIP i have a lot of respect for the Japanese people.
Daily horrors on this earth.
EVIL MEN DIE
Billion's of books but the Best one is QURAN.❣️🕋❣️❣️
Who would have thought this could be happening in Japan!! I'm so saddened to hear this news such huge a shock that this happened to Abi San! May he rest in peace! 🙏 Can't help but thinking this could have  driven by some larger evil force..... Why would the Chinese people celebrate at hearing this dreadful news?? 🤔
End of the world is coming folks!  It’s a cookbook!
believe it or not before we are born we decide how we are gonna die
Never would've expected this
So sad. RIP PM Abe -san.
Wow Japan is so dangerous
A friend of the UK rip 🙏
What tension Japan have lately that might enable something like this happen?
This is sad some far left Japanese probably shot him
What??  My condolences.
You wouldn’t think things like this would happen to developed democratic countries in 2022
very sad but if he is from the Communist right fascist party ...then it's pretty obvious. because the poor struggling
waa so sad.
Something strange is happening around the world. Boris resigned yesterday shinzo was shot yesterday. The world is gonna collapse soon.
RIP 🙏
Rest in peace shinzu abe sir 💔😑🙏🙏🙏🇧🇩🇯🇵
Just shocking! Condolences to his family. May he RIP.
RIP Shinzo Abe. You will never be forgotten.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family at this sad time.
A rather powerful and influential man dies. The shooter used a homemade firearm. Attack was coordinated. Anyone else smell a dark degree of fishiness?
I’m in Japan and I still can’t believe what happened. Rest In Peace Mr. Abe. People will never forget. Nobody deserves this.
BBC why would you make the headline read "shot at" ...???!!! That makes it sound like the bullets missed and he just got scared to death. It's almost like you're a trash establishment news agency trying to downplay the assassination of a world leader because his politics weren't perfectly aligned with your globalist group-think.
Kyoto must protect him
Kami no go kago o........
Sincere condolences to the bereaved. What a loss for Japan! May justice be sufficiently served! Treacherous indeed!
BBC doesnt know japan its only hard for legal way , low crime or mostly unreported crimes political violence in japan is crazy
I always think of him rolling his eyes at Trump. RIP.
RIP 🙏
😱 omg..!Shooting has been such a normal occurrence nowadays..🤦🏻‍♀️😡..such a great loss from one of Japan‘s best PM..my deepest condolences to the family of Mr. Shinzo Abe and the whole nation of Japan..😔🙏from Philippines 🇵🇭
Jesus Christ….
Very sad news for us😢 A true friend of Bangladesh 😢 RIP, Sir💐
Wow...😳....such a civilised country.
Another failed gun law.
well he's from the right party we don't like fascist anymore
America style for fighting freedom 💪
Don't do that. Killing bring nothing..
In which way is he a devise leader?
China job
When was the last time we got important politician openly assassinated?
Ai
What a 💩 world we are living
🇺🇸 My condolences 🇯🇵
😔🌹🌸💮🌸💮🌸 you can expect a situation like this in the US, but very rare out of Japan.🗾🪔💔
To all the brain dead masses wake up and give some thought as to why I can't tell you the comment would be blocked
Amitabha Buddha to ☀ Mr Shinzo Abe 🙏
🇵🇷 😔
rest in peace and condolences for the family of ex minister abe and the japanese people. we will always remember all your assistance and alliance in the philippines 🇯🇵🇵🇭
Very very sad news . Political violence is never the solution. Canada sends its condolences to the country of Japan.  🕯🕯🕯
Sorry but the days of crying because a leader dies are long gone. He was an elite and most likely corrupt. If other leaders liked him than in all likelihood he was evil and the world is better off without him. Let us hear the assassin's reason for what he did. Didn't think so. The media will never tell us what drove this man to do what he did, less others consider doing the world a favor in their own country. Don't cry for this man. He lived a life of luxury while using his full weight with the boot on your neck. NEVER CRY FOR ELITES. They don't give a sh*t about you. Abe couldn't print money fast enough and he destroyed japanese people's retirement. He was a good little US puppet.
Such a shame.
I hope this doesn’t turn into a Franz Ferdinand moment… thoughts are with his family and friends
The incident in Japan is extremely triable. What is the world's future? To shooter, this is insane. There is no benefit to killing anyone. My God, may the souls of all those killed by terrorists in Ethiopia's Wolega Oromia region and the ex-leader of Japan be at peace!!
We Filipinos deep condolence to your leader. Justice well serve.
No one deserves getting gunned down in the streets in cold blood. Still it has to be said that man was kind of a piece of shit.
This is so sad
Let us never forget that the CCP and the weabos are celebrating. Fuck the CCP. Shinzo fought the CCP, Long live Shinzo!
🥲😭
It’s so shameful to see how people are killing everyone these days.. it’s happening very often. RIP Mr. Shinzo 🙏🏻
You can ban guns, but you can't ban the enginuity of evil.
Shocking and sad! Condolences to his loved ones and to the Japanese people. The murderer must be punished to the fullest extent of the law!!!
what a terrible shame abe shinzo was a legend!!!!
I never expected this in Japan to happen
Congratulations japanese intruder
Esto necesitaba Putiiin..para salvar a quizas millones..........y se lo hacen a un hombre bueno......Dios tenga misericordia.......Venga tu Reino Dios......
Perhaps the gun was 3d printed? I dont see how else he would get a gun
Fake news, guns are banned in Japan, this is physically impossible to happen in Japan
Had to be North Korea behind it…
One caring point about the makeshift story, which appears pre-planned and bogus at a point. A homemade shotgun is highly unusual and outright a lie about amount of shots that kills like it's said. Reloading error with this story makes it false. So the guy might have been hurt, but he was not hurt by a homemade gun. They only hold one shot at a time that I've seen.
A WEF NWO HIT - simple
去时好好的，回不去了。
Yakuza hit job?
RIP Shinzoslav Abic
Why?
Rest In Peace legend.
Horrible.
Rest in Peace.
How bout assassinated you people are pathetic!
RIP Abe
Rest now from this world going insane.
How would this b handled in medieval Japan? All it takes is 1 idjit to do something stupid.
Very sad news. My deepest condolences.
RiP.   A hero who sacrificed his life for serving the US interests
Really it’s a shock,how could that happen in that peaceful country
terribly sorry for the guy but Dahm japan has good gun laws they have less than 20 gun-related deaths per year whereas in America we have 45,000, wtf is wrong with America
my deepest condolences to mr Abe who should not deserve this.Wish his family could go through this.
Aw man
Good. To hell with Japan and their inherent racism and segregation.
ご冥福をお祈りします。
🙏🙏
MY CONDOLENCES😔🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
That's why they killed him too much influence.. An opposed the Aggressors
This world has gone mad. So many bad news pouring out every day. It just reinforces my decision to never have children… This planet is not a safe place anymore
Very upsetting news.  My sincerest condolences to his family and country.
modi and amit should learn a lesson from it
On behalf of cruz okinawa karate. My sincere condolences to the family.
Really shocking news. My heartfelt condolences to the entire people of Japan. Praying for the peace.   Sincerely From India.
CIA prolly wants to arm Japan to use against China or Russia. Shinzo Abe a pro-Putin leader gone and people in Japan will likely to push for more armament resulting from this?..
My condolences to the people of Japan during this tough time
What is happening in the world?! May Allah protect Japan and its humble great people.
killer is hero of truth
I’m Chinese living in Canada. I’m extremely shocked by this news and I’m sad for the énorme loss for Japanese people and this country. Mr Abe is a great leader in east Asia, he did his best for the good of his country. I respect him. Sleep in peace.
I’m shocked. I liked him. Someone wanted him dead
It will be interesting to see if Xi is behind this.
Why did he get shot? Just crazy
My brother  former  Japanese  minister  I very SAS my condolences
Sad to see these people were threatened by this man. I hope Japan prevails and comes back stronger.
Criminals will always find a way to kill if that's their goal.
My condolences to his family! 🙏🏻
God bless him 🙏🙏🙏🙏🤲🤲🤲😪😪😪😪
May Allah destroy Israel and USA ameen
China is behind this duh
That should happen in zim
I wish he will burn in hell
Prayers from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
I’m curious if this was a deranged person or was it a political/power assassination from behind the scenes.
Sad
First Johnson is resigning now this!?
Rest in peace Mr.Shinzo abe and my deepest condolences to his family =   M M M   =
The shooter's family are ashamed of him. Death penalty!
Terrible news
I bet China was behind this
i can't believe. may rest in peace 🙏🙏
I'm very saddened. My heart goes out to the Japanese people. I remember going  through the loss of JFK.
This is certainly a shocker. Something like this hasn't happened in Japan since the 30's to my knowledge. My condolences to his family and friends.
Japanese intelligence services are notoriously bad and the guy was 10ft behind him and got 2 whole shots…
What a cruel world. RIP. :'(
安倍晋三已经死亡，享年67岁.。Shinzo abe has died at the age of 67.。安倍晋三氏は67歳で亡くなった.。https://youtube.com/shorts/EICx2KD1PeA?feature=share
RIP. Britain stands with Japan always. 🇬🇧🇯🇵
😱
He made efforts to tackle the Northern Territories dispute (Kuril Islands dispute) with Russia. BBC, please color these islands! They are Japanese territory!
Too many demented individuals in this dysfunctional world
Rip
My condolences  so sad
I thought the Japanese could dodge bullets
This is really unaccepted violation against democracy itself. Regardless any opinion on politics, this can never justified. Personally I highly respected Mr. Shinzo Abe as a powerful leader of Japan. Rest in peace.
When it comes to diplomacy, he was one of the greatest leaders in Japanese history and had seriously tackled the problems about the defense capability of our country for many years. Thanks to him, we can be relieved and live peacefully in our country today. We will never surrender to violence and terrorism. So, rest in peace, farewell to the leader with respect.
Shocking! Sickening! Sad!
My condolences 🙏
All the best to his family and Japan in this moment 🇬🇧♥️🇯🇵
Sounds like left wingers carried out an assasination
ex pm abe did so many good things as partners of my country Pilippines  he may rest in peace
I cannot believe this happened in Japan. Japan is becoming America. Using gun to kill people
😔
Very bad news..He was a great leader..RIP Sir..
May Shinzo Abe RIP. May Servant of God, Takashi Nagai, intercede with God for all who are mourning his death. May they be comforted.
大変ショックです。日本でこのような事が起こるとは思ってもいませんでした。
I can’t think every thing. Shinzo Abe was the greatest prime minister to us Japanese. Rip.  安倍さん あなたが成し遂げてきた偉大な功績を我々、誠意を持った日本人は忘れません。 まだまだ貴方にはやって欲しい事がたくさんあった。 ただ、今は安らかに眠って下さい。 安倍さん、本当にありがとうございました。 安倍さん、本当にお疲れ様でした。 安倍さん、さようなら。
Rip from Indonesia
looks like someone casted a solid vote and made it count
It's really heart breaking to see someone go down violently, my thoughts and prayers go out to PM Abe's family and everyone mourning from the loss of a great leader.
WTH this is wild
Nice title 👍
He was corrupted just like them all
If guns were banned in Japan this wouldn’t of happened
Banning guns won't do jack, if someone wants you dead they will find a way
this world is comming to an end. japan lost one of it strongest leader in modern time and as american we put an idiot in the white house.
Look like this assasination under CHicom's hand
No surprise. Considering past war crimes of Japan. Karma is coming home to roast.  Why was the world not shocked then?!?  The very fact that Japan leans towards the USA,  bloodshed would not be far away even Japanese blood.
Shinzo Abe was one of the best prime ministers of Japan, because of him most of the Japan is developed and there is no wars. Japan became a peaceful and highly developed country only during his time. This is absolutely shocking !!! May his soul rest in peace ❤️
Ban guns
Why are people so evil... We are worse than animals...
Us citizens should watch and learn
China celebrating…hmmm…I suspect somehow China was involved in this…just the day before China commented that Japan had better get used to Chinese military being around Japanese sea and air space. The twitter sphere was absolutely vile with comments from China coming out and celebrating, saying its time for China to invade and war with Japan to “make” Japan and the Japanese people “right”…whatever that means
My condolences to Japan.  Mr. Abe was a great man.
Japan is the last country is what comes to my mind when it comes to Political Assassinations this comes as a Great Shock to most people R.I.P Shinzo Abe
I had lost a father in my life no words
A senseless tragedy. One that unfortunately demonstrates that gun violence will happen no matter how gun control is passed.
Rest in Heaven sir..thank for your  long service in your country..your in Gods hand now..no worries,no pain,no sickness..happy leaving forever in paradise with our God
Good people don't get to live that long..there is a lot of evil minded and  politically corrupted minds out there..we all need to get together in figuring and recognizing these people and eliminate them before they do any extra damage or harm..RIP  Mr.Shinzo..
So sad to hear this terrible terrible news. May he rest in peace...!
He was such a increvidly one and only leader in Japan yet was assassinated
Condolence to the Japanese people, From an Iranian 🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵 🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷 ❤❤
aww. what the world coming to, this is a sad day for Japan..they are such a lovely country
why does good leader must be the one to die, why? there so many evil leader outthere that deserves to die
No offence BBC, how on earth did you bring China into this conversation. Was really strange just sneaking a random statement in there. Rip former prime minister of Japan.
本当にショックです。ご冥福をお祈り申し上げます。
no ordinary person could have done this-he had inside help
OMG. What?
BBC the guy built the gun. People are evil, they will find a way to kill their target.
I heard world military are on the mission on rounding up/Military sting operation on Global corrupt leaders.
Tragic am an Indian am unable to control my tears
He was at Davos with Klaus Schwab.
I’m Japanese. Thank you for Abe’s hard work. Rest In Peace.
Truly sad.
hugely charismatic , wonderful man he was. Very strange and tragic this.
MY FAVORITE WORLD HAS BECOME VERY CRUEL ! 😳🥺  "  O GOD" !! DELIVER EVERYONE FROM THIS CRUELTY 😭🥺🙏  🕯️🕯️🕯️🖤🤍
Thoughts and prayers for his family and friends 🙏🏾
American, American no comment
Although I am a Chinese, and Japan have hatred, but, the Japanese prime minister's death, or very sad
Rip
What the actual fuck.
It sounds like an inside job to me-because this guy knew where he was going to be and should not have had that information
Was he shot or shot at?
🇺🇸💜🇺🇸🇺🇸💜🇺🇸 My thoughts and prayers TO Japan..friends and Family...VERY SAD DAY IN OUR INTERNATIONAL STAGE...🇺🇸🇺🇸💜🇺🇸💜🇺🇸💛🇺🇸💛🇺🇸💛🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💛💜💛
The assailant shall be interrogated in the imperial Japan style. We have to find out if there's bigger picture to this...
Prayers from the great state of North Carolina!
The Deep state is one that took him out
Please take note that Abe was killed by a homemade shotgun made from everyday hardware store supplies.  The gunman never had access to any antique/factory manufactured gun, he made his own gun easily and then used it to kill Abe.
😨😥😥😥
120 Innocents are shot dead each day in America, by gunmen or self. No gun laws and very easy access to guns. Sorry about this gun tragedy in Japan.
Deep respect for the Japanese people, and terrible news to come in such dark times.  Condolences from Australia 🇦🇺
As a Hong Kong people, l remember he said that he supported to the Hong Kong people democracy in 2019, This is  heartbreaking,l deepest condolences to his family ,The greatest former Japanese PM,Rest in peace!
Sad
I was very attached to this man. He was a great leader. You will be long live in our heart. R.I.P great leader.
Shocked and saddened. Much respect for Abe. My condolences to his family, friends and country. May the Supreme Creator walk with you in your time of sorrow.
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
Why do you say (shot at) instead of shot? He was shot in the back with 2 shotgun blast. He hated the CCP and spoke openly against them.
Ha ha ha
But Japan doesn't have gun crime, cause they're illegal.  Just like the U.S. doesn't have a drug problem cause they're illegal. 🙄  I guess we should make murder illegal, that should put an end to that problem. 🤔
The world is going mad. You know Japan's going through it when the most powerful leader gets assassinated. The turmoil is going to be so immense it's not been seen since the end of World War II. The Japanese people are going to he angered & this will no doubt in increase already evaporating relations with China & Russia.  Just another shocking event in 2022 as we head ever closer down the road towards World War 3.
lousy security , around him..
日本でこんな事件が起こるとは思いも寄らなかった。
I miss that guy.
RIP to great leader
Man how did the guy get so close, from the pics the guns looks big. RIP
One of a kind man in this world♥️ Condolences to the entire people of japan specially to the family
Our condolences to the Japanese and the EX-PM family. So sad
Wow look at that
Sayanara Abe San . This world did not deserve YOU .
May he rest in peace and the almighty God be with his family and ease their pain.🙏
coming to every leader that has ruined their country
🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
Shocking behaviour. So well known.
Should've kept your emperor. You had more honor and wisdom back then.
R. I. P Abe Shinzo 🙏🙏
China's work? So sad, rest in peace 😞🥺 god bless Japan 🎌
They should do the same to Biden
Rest In Peace, Mr. Abe.
Aweful
A friend of Trump Donald
There are so many Shootings in the last days Chicago Copenhagen Nara and technoblade died its so sad
This is saddest news for Taiwanese people thank you PM.Abe for supporting Taiwan internationally, may you Rest In Peace
Inside job !! no doubt
China very happy by this incident.... They celebrated it in their social media.... sick people..
India mourns death of Mr.Shinzo Abe.
Even Japan is not safe. 🙄
RIP.  He had a friendly face and a nice smile
I don't trust BBC.
Isn’t he a reptilian
Good riddance
He was liked all over the world😔
Where bodyguard?weak,and shame on you bodygurd
Very sad. My condolences to Abe's family and friends. I cant help but think "well, here comes the globalist replacement."
Rip shinzo
Something fishy… commies in a smoke screen
Maybe he was signing, endorsing, and ordering laws that were unconstitutional against the people he serves
BBC news and their propaganda techniques
China at work 🤔🙆
The guy that assassinated Shinzo got him twice with a home made makeshift gun
Wtf what wrong on this people they celebrate PM Abe death
Damn this came out of nowhere May he rest in peace
Shocking 😞
It happened in Japan. That's shocking.
WTF?????
it's a pity! He is a great Japanese statesman. Pray for him.
Who cares Japanese are racist 🤷🏾‍♂️
Heart felt condolences.
😮
Japanese people have spoken.
It's not being shot when it's a assassination
Things are unpredictable.  There are exceptions to everything! 世事难料，什么都有例外！
RIP
A great loss for the Japanese people and the world.
news A says 3 THREE now News B says twice
This is about one of the most rarest of political assassinations in global history. Shinzo Abe was a perfect gentle man with an admiral political career spanning over 2 decades. My heart is with his family and the great people of Japan..
Horrible
He spoke against China lately. You should know who is behind the shooting!
Why am I seeing so many news stories express shock at the fact that this happened in a country where it's so difficult to get a gun, when it was known from the very beginning (because the police recovered the weapon) that the assailant used a HOMEMADE gun in this shooting? As in, a gun crafted from segments of pipe and other miscellaneous parts?  That's a pretty major part of this story, I feel, as it shows that Japan's gun laws did NOT fail Abe-san -- rather, that his assailant went to great lengths to pull this off, and there was really basically nothing that could've been done to prevent it.  I mean, this particular news story is about Abe-san himself, and his death is absolutely a tragedy, and a huge shock to the entire nation (and the world, really). But it almost seemed as though the newscaster here didn't even KNOW that a makeshift gun was used in the crime, and that's got me wondering how many news outlets simply aren't reporting that fact...
Where the hell do you get a gun in Japan?
Thr new world order.....
A great leader and good friend of tatay digong.. Condolence to the bereaved family.. A great loss to Japan🇯🇵
世事难料，什么都有例外！Things are unpredictable. There are exceptions to everything!
lmao fuck him, this dude can now be buried yasukuni shrine along side the dead imperial Japanese soldiers, since he loved so much to pay respect to them😂
Opposition parties worked,...simple🤷
This used to be very common in Japan before WWII.  I believe this is the first major post WWII assassination.  We'll have to see if there was Red Chinese involvement.  Interesting that the BBC reporters are so clearly hostile to him, perhaps due to Chinese and Russian interests which exercise such a major influence on the Left Wing BBC..
世事难料，什么都有例外！Things are unpredictable. There are exceptions to everything!
🙏❤❤🌲❤❤✌✌
My condolences to the relatives of Abe-san. Rest in peace, Shinzo Abe.
That guy is paid to kill or he hate that ex prime minister for some reason which is baffling but anything in this world can happen even in that country japan where crime rate is so low
people are walking a round with no hearts these days. violence every where Omg💔
My deepest condolences. Thoughts and prayers to Shinzo Abe's family and friends, my thoughts are  with all of japan, as its being announced he has succumbed to his injuries.  RIP Shinzo Abe.
It's an act of terrorism
Anyone want to take a bet that the assassin is a member of the communist terrorist party of china
I thought this was a joke at first because the Japanese people are one of the most peaceful and humble people Ive ever been around. My condolences to Mr Shinzo Abe and the Japanese family.
NOT a Liberal WOKE Politician and loved and respected by Millions - Australia is saddened by this loss and we salute your service Sir - May you rest in Peace. Shocked and very sad to hear this - What a great and respected leader - may the killer rot in hell.
Seems like a hit
I'm terribly shocked. It's really a shame. He served the Japanese people then this is what he got in return. I am sad. I pray that he rests in peace.
Finally killer clown is dead! Time to burn in hell forever! How many innocents was killed Afghanistan and Iraq! Time to answer for ur action murderer!
They do not take such precautions as in the USA as it isn't as violent. I guess things will change now. This will sadly be on film/. I hope for the family they manage to keep it from being released on social media.
Rest in peace... he's a great leader.
虽然中日外交关系很艰难 但是安倍先生在任日本首相时中日关系相对稳定 刺杀政客这种行为是懦夫的表现 中国人坚决反对 愿逝者安息 🙏
This is where they should realize that they are copying the US a bit too much
Strange none of world media is calling it terrorist attack 😂😂hypocrats
Very sad, I'll always remember his funny moment reacting to the Trump handshake
Stop talking about UKRAINE BBC NEWS. RESPECT
the world has reached the terminal stage of cancer, the cancer cell has spread to all good organisms, the great people has been targeted by the sniper, no one can say the origin of the cancer here
Reminder Shinzo Abe was a historical revisionist and denialist of Imperial Japanese war crimes in China and Korea. He was also the literal child of a multigeneration lineage of Japanese imperialists.
Let’s hope this is not going to start a copycats trend for all the other leaders around the globe
YAKUZA was behind it! They kidnapped the suspect family and pressure the suspect to eliminate shinzo. But who order the YAKUZA? who is the real mastermind??
He was killed I'm sure because he is changing the financial system
Horrible
He was shot because the shooter didn't like his politics of revising the pacificst constitution, if Germany has a man like the shooter Hitler would have never got to power
😭💔🙏
I’m sure they killed him for some evil reason!
阿部は私たちの最高のリーダーでした。私たちは宝石を失いました。これらの中国の活動家は彼らを殺しました...あごをファック........
So sad. RIP.
RIP GREAT WORLD LEADER 🙏🙏 from india
SO IT SHALL BEGUN CHINA...IS VERY HAPPY FOR THIS MORE POSSIBILITIES TO CONQUER TAIWAN...
Did China do this?? After stepping down, Shinzo Abe had only been advocating for protecting Taiwan and normalizing constitution. He should have limited domestic enemies??
Japanese new resources say the killer didn't like Abe's policy.  But what policy ? I assume it was about the military defense policy.
This is just the beginning😬The world have a LOT more terrifying scenarios to experience. Rip to him
This was a paid killing.
安倍ちゃん…ありがとう。 ご冥福をお祈りいたします。
Putin is behind it. Just like all the mass shootings in the USA
Hope the use dead sentens for that guy there shut him.
This is truly terrible and shocking! RIP Shinzo Abe.
no matter what,death isnt a happy thing. i know japan may have done many bad things to china but the fact that they are happy about his death is merciless and brutal
I hope we find out the motives behind this killing.
Very sad news, made all the more shocking by the fact such violent crime is a rarity in Japan
As a danish citizen, this makes me sad. Denmark generally adores Japan and it's people, all the nordic countries do. He seemed like a considerate and humble gentleman with no bad intensions on the international scene. Anyone against Japan strengthening it's army should take a good look at how Russia, North Korea & China are behaving, military might and determination is the only deterent against such behaviour.
Rip in peace Prime Minister!
Inside job
Abe-dono was a true ally to the United States, and a bold and decisive leader who looked to the best interests of Japan.  May his family and the nation he served so long and so well find closure and peace.  As for his assassin, let Japanese justice be swift, fair, and resolute.  The world weeps at Japan's loss.
Concorrencia mundial..gaaaaanaaanciaaaa
Rest In Peace PM Shinzo Abe ❤️
I really don't understand why people kill good decent leaders and elect and adore the selfish narcissistic corrupt ones. The world, not only Japan, lost a good man today.
Wow, this is very rare, they have extremely strict gun laws. Only the police and military can have a gun. Hunters can own a shotgun, but it takes a long time to get a license.
The Jesuits of Rome are very much responsible in such acts according to many numbers of times in history till now ,so says  the bible 👉 Revelation 18:24 ,read the history of the reformation and many books so long they talk about Jesuits
👽 ...  MORE TO FOLLOW ...............
🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭
An icon of Japanese politics.. RIP Abe-san.
What does Japan think they are? America?
Oh it's really sad  😔 😟 🙁 RIP Mr.Abe
So sad
Damn
Rip
FK China
日本は平和じゃないよ
I only regret that Shenzo Abe didn’t see China surpass Japan! 😌😌😌
I only regret that Shenzo Abe didn’t see China surpass Japan! 😌😌😌
Shinzo was based, wanted to make Japan great again. Rip the Japanese goat
I have been studying gun laws and guns per capita and Japan has some of the strongest gun laws in the world. A country of 125 million people and only 12 gun deaths is astounding!
I never knew that Japón had terrible criminals.
I am so sorry for this man  and his family.    I do not know much about him but this tragedy is just terrible.    I would expect this here in the US, but certainly shocking in Japan.
Afsos naak khabar hai Allah unko sukun de 🇮🇳
Heartbreaking 😭 may you rest in peace prime minister 🙏🙏🙏
Rest in piece. I hope Japan doesn’t become like a shit country like America.
We can disagree with policies without recurring to violence. So sad.
Terrible
I am indigenous Montagnard Jarai tribe pray for  Japan 🇯🇵
CHINA HAVE A BIG CONNECTION THIS
This is not at all common in Japan
This is what happens when you threaten China ahaha. JK . RIP Abe. And looks like Japan's turning into US style in felonies
I'm Japanese,where living nerest Nara in Osaka. Mr.abe was very very big success domestic politics. 1,Economy politics At first,He was between goverment and BOJ partnership agreement. Inflation target 2% and until limit ununployment rate adoputed quantitative easing,monetary policy. 2.all new Univercity graduate student join company. Because In japan had monetary policy has an effect. Very sad.
Heartbreaking. Rare incident in Japan. Possible geopolitical angle?
MAYBE THIS IS PLANNED BY RUSSIA?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The whole world shocked for his died condolence the people of japan 🙏
I can't help thinking the guy was paid to do it! 🤔
まだ信じられないわ
Died after being shot!! So he's been killed not died..
UMMMMM.... MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE??? JUST LIKE SIRHAN SIRHAN!!!  (THEORY PROVEN OVER THE YEARS AND DOCUMENTED BY DARREN BROWN TOO).  CLUE IS IN THE WORDING "POWERFULLY INFLUENCIAL". SOMEONE OTHER THAN JAPANESE WANTED HIM GONE. THE YAKUZA STILL CARRIES A LOT OF BLADES TODATE. GUNS ALTHOUGH EXIST, AND DAMN GOOD ONES, THEY ONLY EXIST WITHIN THE HIGHER RINGS OF THE YAKUZA. ONLY A MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A HANDGUN TO ASSASSINATE SUCH A BIG POLITICAL PERSON. TYPICAL OLD SCHOOL.... WHO REMEMBER YITZHAK RABIN.... SHOT THE SAME WAY.... FROM BEHIND!!! THE SECURITY APPARATUS USUALLY HAS A TIGHT CIRCLE AROUND THIS KIND OF VIP WHERE NOBODY CAN ENTER WITHIN THE CIRCLE. SO I LET YOU DECIDE. A BIT LIKE THE BANK ROBBERS CALE INTO THE BANK, ENTERED THE VAULT, EMPTOED IT AND LEFT.... SOMEBODY OPENED THE VAULT FOR THEM OTHERWISE TAKES DAYS IF NOT WEEKS TO BREAK IN TO....(UNLESS YOU ARE GODDAMN ENGLISH AND DONT EVEN USE THE VAULT DOOR... THE ENFORCED WALL WLL SUFFICE!)  IRRELEVANT ANALOGY BUT YOU GET MY DRIFT.
The shooter is a coward
My gut tells me this wasn't random, but a premidated, maybe intelligence backed attack.
As a long time resident of Japan who has met Abe-san a few times, this shocks me to the core. Vale Abe Shinzo, you will be remembered well.
What a terrible terrible thing. His poor family. My deepest condolences to his family, friends & associates.
Man the whole "japan doesnt have gun crime" crowd went really silent today
HIS SECURITY GUARD ARE NOT WORKING WELL 😠
HE IS ONE OF THE GREATIST LEADER OF THE WORLD
Another Archduke moment.
What a great lost to humanity Abey San was a good man
Why did the security failed?
Evil finds away to do evil.   Laws can't protect against a determined maniac.
R.I.P 💔
The world has gone mad.
日本の存在を世界に知らしめてきた素晴らしい首相でした。 それだけに、こんな事件が起きるなんて、本当に悔しくて残念です。
Very shocking in a country like Japan where guns and assassinations are so rare. Condolences to the country and his survivors.
R.I.P. This news anchor looks like 2001 personified.
This is absurd
I thought nobody has guns in Japan?
Condolences to his family.
These guns oh god 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Malcom x was shot multiple times while giving his speeches
CIA is behind, or China. keep in mind Abe is in favor for the constitutional changes in Japan.
Absolutely shocked, how scary that a person final moments can be just giving a speech and then shot dead the next moment. I never expected anything like this to happen in Japan. My deepest condolences to his family. Rest in peace Shinzo Abe 🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊🕊
This is horrible news! At the same time this proves that the democrats plans to get rid of guns is a worthless idea! Japan has very strict gun laws. And look what just happened!
Ohhh My God.. . RIP PM
This person was unapologetic for the crimes Japan committed during WWII. This couldn’t have happened to a more deserving person. There might be such things as karma after all.
Shinjo Abe was a great leader, peace loving and friendly.my heartfelt condolences to his family.
Maybe assassin has a connection to China?
Never expect this happen at Japan🙏
💔🥺
This is a direct attack on democracy and free speech in my country. Its takes away our choice to vote in the coming election. What a scumbag.
This is the world leader i look up to! I was amazed during his serving days. I am not even a Japanese. My condolences.
RIP so sad! Why not the evil and cruel leaders Putt & Drump and many Republicans.
Another guy named “Abe” was shot before
Rika, the caster, sounds a bit biased against Shinzo Abe. But please be aware that he served the longest period as a PM in the Heisei era and that means he was supported by the population most.
Horrible security team they just watch him getting shot...
So sad, who is responsible for that?
Actors.  Puppets for the federal reserve and world central banks! People are waking up.  See 👀 thru all this digital programming propaganda horseshit! I ❤ y'all
It is really shocking news. RIP.
India lost a friend today He played an important role in the relation of bhart Japan. He has been instrumental in bringing bullet train to India and in projects like Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor.  May God give peace to his soul 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐

Om shanti shanti
RIP wonderful personality gone too soon
In today's time, scenario America's security is the best. RIP gentle soul 🙏 😢.  Worst is how could assassin reach so close to ex PM holding huge bag? His looks were so suspicious, how come security personal ignore his presence? Failure on part of security arrangements.
Now he will the Kennedy of Japan
Niceeee letss gooooooooooooooooooo
This one shock me oooo Kai that assassin must be dealt with
how is this brutality but the Russian occupation is a liberation?
Condolences to the family and the people of Japan. May Mr. Abe rest in peace.🙏
Very sad news. I have my deep condolence for the people of Japan, Abe's family and friends. Somalia  has deep and long-standing relationship with Japan. The culprit should get the highest punishment for such a heinous act.
"The current prime minister has condemned the actions..."  Well I don't think he's going to have a song and dance is he?
China hates Japan... I am willing to bet China is behind it.
So sad to hear that.
so sad
My deepest condolences to the Family.
The fact that this happened in Japan a relatively peaceful nation is shocking.
When I heard of this tragedy, the first thing that came to my mind... China is behind it.
Absolute gun control...
So sad and heart breaking. Condolences to the family and the people of Japan. MHSRIP
Really sad
WTF!!!
みんなありがとう
God bless his soul
God bless his family. A great statesman , representative of his people and overall good person. He will be missed. God help his family. Condolences from America.

R I P
💔
Notting surprise me.  ..humans are worse than animals.
this. is something huge, and deep. wondering whats gonna happen to JP politics in next few month. Maybe this is only the beginning.
My heartfelt condolences to the Japanese people, especially to the family Mr. Abe left behind.
Japan is peaceful country than your country.
Heartbreaking news and very sad indeed, my condolences to his family and people of Japan, RIP Abe San🙏🙏🙏🙏😢😢😢 Sincerely from Canada
Or assassination?  Just sad to hear...
Cut shooter into little pieces.  Humiliate him 1st for being stupid
Yakuza hit or some nut with a manifesto?
R.I.P Shinzo Abe! May your ancestors welcome you in their KINGDOM inside the after life!
My deepest condolences to his family and whole Japan..
😱😢
1:02 lady sounds like Trisha Takinawa
Saw 3 clips of this.... EVERY ONE of them either drop down or cut off at point of impact something's VEERRY fishy about it
What a tragedy😮😮😔😔
at least hes now playing Minecraft with Technoblade
But guns are almost entirely banned in Japan.
I would not be surprised if Russia paid for the assassination. Putin needs to be removed from power.
What a disgusting set that would do this !
Deepest condolence former prime minister of japan 🙏🙏 Love form India 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Nice
Rip abe
🙏
My deepest sympathies to the Abe family and the people of Japan. He is a great leader and he will be missed.

It quite wild that this happened in Japan of all places.
The west killed him 🤮
RIP MR.Abe🙏💙😢 From Iran, Trump💙✌🏽
This world is very wicked. May Jesus Christ protect us by his great power 🙏.
I'll never understand how people can "celebrate" someone's death.  I might be relieved someone has died, or felt it needed to happen, but to celebrate? A life has ended and no matter what, the ending of any life is a sad thing. Humans. I swear.
Anyone wanna bet China was behind this?
安倍元総理は午前11時30分頃、日本の奈良県で選挙の応援演説中に2発撃たれてしまいました。そしてその犯人は取り押さえられ、安倍元総理はヘリコプターで病院に運ばれて、懸命な治療を受けましたが、残念ながら亡くなってしまいました。67歳でした。 犯人は取り押さえられ、その男は逮捕されました。その男41歳、元海上自衛隊でした。そしてその銃は自作であることも分かりました。 そして、岸田文雄内閣総理大臣はこう述べています。「安倍元総理の命を奪った卑劣な蛮行が行われた。断じて許せるものではなく、最も強い言葉を改めて非難を申し上げます」と述べていました。 僕はとても悲しく思います。心からお祈り申し上げるのと、彼が安らかに眠ってくれることを願います
Shocking !!! We will mis you Mr. Abe friend of we indians 🇮🇳 ❤️ 🇯🇵
:O :(
This is bad, because it will push an already right-leaning country further to the right, if for no other reason.
Shocking News all over the world for a very great man
Sad .,..I liked him! Rest in Peace!
😔💔
Miss you sir SHINZO ABE..GREAT LEADER ..R.I.P
😒 after your propaganda and lies about The RUSSIAN military operation, I don't trust anything from your channel... I need to watch this news on a different source before I believe it
I have read a book entitled SECRET TERRORISTS,READ IT AND KNOW BETTER
Can't Japan help uganda with such good snipers. We have a dictator whom we are tired of bt RIP  t Mr Abe
Another person dead. Happens all day everyday in Chicago and the media only covers it when they cracking down on gun control
tRump has empowered and set loose every crazy on earth! This jackass has done so much damage to our planet and continues to this day, with his ever growing army of misfits and conspiracy morons who will commit acts of violence in his name or for a twisted personal agenda.
Q
🇺🇲🇯🇵🇬🇧
where is that footage?
台湾の友に、ご冥福をお祈り申し上げます。  Wish you Rest In Peace, the friend of Taiwan.
Rest in paradise abe saan 🙏
RIP Abe
im confident that this was a rival aka another country most likely china since they hated the idea of him supporting the Americans and having an  naval exercise with the them
This smells like a China execution.
Where was his secret service? Shameful. Other politicians need to review their secret service personnel.
Did the United States arrange the killer?
Thats really sad, poor guy. He didnt deserve this, he didnt do anything, died for nothing.
I feel this was planned
I seen this shortly after it happened...being Canadian I am saddened greatly. He was a remarkable person.
Who's Next!!!!! HMMMMM!!!!!
Главный жополиз сша словил пулю… япония давно под внешним управлением
This can’t be real, he’s not even hated in Nara
Sad to here ..Good friend to the US and the West..a good Humble Man 🇯🇵
My dad killed him lol
We have to stop being kind for “different” opinion. The world must red purge fast.
If only Japan passed sensible gun reform, this tragedy could have been prevented.
Horrible news😱
He was admired by people around the world, prayers for his family.
こんなニュース見たくなかった
Rest In Peace Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Sending love and condolences to his family from Vietnam.
Dreadful news. May Mr Abe rest in peace.
The killer deserves death sentence
Shot *at* or shot?
"Extremely Rare" in every news.
Blame COVID, people are going crazy with all these BS currently happening, war, inflation, high prices.
Yippee...
porque lo mataron, que forma del bien estaba ejecutando esta persona ??
China’s CCP accepts responsibility for assassination of Shinzo Abe
Bruh Does Japan not have their own intelligence agencies like the CIA, KGB, MSS and others? This wont happen if japan has its own intelligence agencies. I think after this incident. Japan will reform their securities policies. Rip abe :(
It's a good news!  It seems that Russia has launched a mechanism for the cleansing of Nazism around the world!
The doctor who treated him said he was shot from the front and footage showed that to
Well he had to go since he spoke publicly about the responsibility of ukraine and the west in the conflict against Russia.
R.i.p !
May his soul rest in peace. We know who we love, we don't know who loved us.
This is sad and shocking  ,this shouldn't have had happened.
Japanese people may want to take note of fellow Japanese people taking joy in a man getting shot in the back. What up with that? Condolence to his family and friends.
He was against NATO
So very sad.
I’m Japanese and this is the saddest thing that ever happened among prime ministers’ accidents. He served the longest period of time as prime minister, which means most Japanese people loved him.  I’m doing piano playing as hobby so I’m gonna tell you this. There’s a video of him playing the song called “Hana Wa Saku” which means flowers will bloom, on the piano. He did practice it to play it for those people who died from disasters and so on. I just imagined him practicing it a lot of time for those people and it really shows what kind of person he is. He got the most beautiful heart as Japanese prime minister and worth living more. Almost everyone in Japan is really shocked💔 I can’t stop crying😢😢😢
IT'S A BLACK DAY FOR US 🇮🇳 ALSO..... IT'S HEARTBREAKING 😔.... 🙏🇮🇳 THE WORLD WILL SURELY WITNESS THE  DESTRUCTION OF 🇨🇳 😠 VERY SOON LIKE THEY DO WITH OTHERS 👈 🙏🇮🇳
abe is a good leader.. such a loss for japanese people..
China ?
send that guy on a first class fight to russia !!
😔😔😔🙏🙏🙏
Today this is second bad news I’m receiving.. absolutely shocked…
He got JFK’D😭
Thank you so much for your compassion from Britain.  This our Japanese great shock and in sad and anger…  Mr.Abe… He had served and vocated his life to our country of  Japan . We Japanese proud of him. We never forget Mr. Premier Abe and this terribly sad day.
Act of Brutality? This is terrorism and a huuuge tragedy for every democracy in this world
Absolutely heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and the beautiful man himself. Rest in peace 🙏✨💗
Sad news😕 RIP !!
Ffuuu. I didn't know too much about his politics but I did like some things he did and he seemed very rational and nice... RIP, Abe. You seemed like one of the good guys.  🇺🇸❤️🇯🇵 😔
The question is why would they do it
Damn
We love you Mr President of JAPAN  respect from the Philippines you're good friends to us 🇵🇭🤝🇯🇵
ヤクザって言ってる人多すぎる ヤクザは国家に対して反逆したらすぐ解体されるのを知ってるからそんなことする訳ないんだよな
Unbelievable.May his soul rest in peace
Did the Yakuza Kill Him???
RIP Shinzo
This is heartrending.  Japan of all places??? May he RIP
Just a reminder to the world that japan isn’t what it’s portrayed in animes .
This angers and saddens me beyond belief. My thoughts and condolences to Shinzo Abe, his family and any/all japanese people who are affected by this horrible incident. Too sad for words really.
This is sad. I found him to be one of the most calm and admired in the world.
cia
No matter what haters may think or say, this right here was the most progressive head of state Japan has ever had, he tried hard to change the stigma of conservatism that has bedeviled the country for so long, heck, he's also the reason why it's considerably easier to live in Japan as a foreigner than it was some 2 decades ago. God bless your memory Prime Minister Abe.
STUPID SECURITY TEAM didn’t protecting him behind
RIP Abe...
I’m Vietnamese and I hate him he is like hitler
The suspected assassin is known to be ex-officer of Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. I smell some fishy smell here.
Sending condolences to his family and the people of Japan.
VERY HEART BREAKING & HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS HAPPENED IN JAPAN.
Rest In Power Shinzo Abe
this is so heartbreaking. My condolences to Abe-san's family.  RIP PM Abe-san  😞😞😞
Why would they assassinate him when he was no longer Prime minister? Doesn’t make much sense
God Bless Him. As a Bangladeshi, I knew Shinzo Abe as a Japanese Prime Minister. I don't know any other Japanese Prime Minister. Shinzo Abe's death is a tragedy.
Condolence Family  of Prime Minister Abe
安倍氏は日本の多くの人々に愛された。 彼は神の公務員であり、非常に多くの指導者を静かに導いており、確かに安倍晋三でした。 この地上での短い人生が許す限り、日本国民が赦しと平和を求めますように。 日本にはいつも花が咲くように、人生を愛する日本人もみんなそうかもしれません。Mr. Abe was loved by many in Japan.  He was a government servant of God, who silently guides so many leaders, and certainly Shinzo Abe.  May all of Japan seek forgiveness and peace while our short life on this earth permits.  As flowers bloom always in Japan, so may all Japanese who love life.
Wtf?
Omg !!! I cannot believed will happened to the  Former President Abe 😭💔😭
This proves that in nations with the most strict gun laws that criminals will still get guns.
Sad and shocking! His securities, this is the reason why you are hired guys🤷‍♀️
A giant loss for humanity. RIP Mr. Abe🕊️
Seeing Trump and Abe in the same picture: “Aaaaahh! My eyes! I’ll never be able to see again!….” Abe is great with visiting any other person, but with Trump? What is seen can’t be unseen. It’s like acid thrown into the eyes. Or a flash from a nuke blast…. It burns the eyes
Never expected something like this to happen in a country like Japan,  god rest his soul.
Respect and condolences.  Sorry for your lose Japan.  Undeserved.
Heart breaking! Wow. He was a loved by many
I always liked him, i'm American, he seemed so decent...very sad
Miss u sir india is in shocked
Shocking News
Why? Why kill a former PM? What did he know or what was he going to do?
Nothing wrong to protect a country, facifist? That word has been overused lately.

It's really unexpected and very sad, I strongly condemn this killing and I wish peace to the disembodied soul of this great man.
bbc牛逼啊，什么时候都不忘记拱火中日关系。大英帝国传统技能，抓住一切可能的机会来分化异族。
it's a sad new, by the way , Japan is not as good as many foreigners think, and something you can not truly feel how it is to live.  Don't exaggerate japanese culture.
So sad
Very sad, very unfortunate.A great friend of India.May his soul rest in peace.
It is very shocking, and they should NOT have let it happened. He truly tackled with the North Korean abduction issues, and served the country. Of course, not all of his policies were welcomed, but what he did means a lot. I can’t still believe it, and I don’t want to. Please reveal as many facts as possible about this tragedy. R.I.P. Our dearest citizen of Japan.
Long live the great people of Japan. Mr Abe's good name will never be forgotten.
RIP
Heart felt condolence to respected Abe and the people of Japan
God bless
What’s a great loss for Japanese people and the world .Very sorry for your loss Japan!
_______ﮩ٨ـﮩﮩ٨🫀ﮩ٨ـﮩﮩﮩ٨ـ
So sad, we Japanese loved and supported him so much. We lost him now. Thank you for your condolences, PM Abe was the man who officially made Japan a country stand against totalitarian powers in Indo-Pacific region. We will not go back to pre-Abe "business justifies everything", "business over freedom" era. we will carry on with his legacy with US, Taiwan, UK, EU especially Poland, Australia, Canada, India and other partner countries, and of course most of all, UKRAINE.
Lol...good riddance ahso
Rip bozo 🔥🔥🔥
RIP Abe
Very sad news my deepest condolences to his family RIP SIR
Good god, political heads are rolling all over.
Omg.. Rest in peace PM Abe, God bless your soul
Justice for the kind PM Abe. 💙💙💙
But gun control. It's supposed to work.
Good riddance to bad rubbish.  Or Ding Dong the Witch is dead, the wicked witch is dead.
首相は長生きする
abe is still critical, you guys are too early to tell the news
We so sad 😭
Americans killed him. From serbian
Bloody asshoses! Love from New Zealand
He was a good man. Fly high Abe!
it serves him right!
May he Rest In Peace what a horrible thing to have happened to a very powerful leader in Japan.
Japan needs to increase its military power even more now.  Abe was right in attempting to make them stronger to deal with China, so don't reverse his ideas, if that is how he felt.  May he RIP.
i hope they find the motive, very sad. i always hold japan in high regard.
That was barbaric act really. The perpetrator should be sentenced to death through hanging naked. Let his soul rest in peace.
🤔controversial on some social and political stances…”nationalistic” and down with Putin🤔influenced the government without being in office🤔 reminds me of WWII
My deepest condolences to his family and friends.Today we lost a great leader .Rest in peace sir from 🇮🇳
God bless him and the people of Japan
Sad day.
It is truly sad that this can happen in a country with the strictest gun control in the world.   It's also written into Japanese law, as of 1958, that "no person shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords."  But it didn't stop an evil person from getting an illegal firearm to do an illegal act.  Our heart goes out to the people of Japan.
He was the kind of PM that i admired most...it is so heartbreaking that he passed this way.😥🙏
So sorry
The End of Russia. Leaders need to feed their ego, and to fill the power void, they invest in big parties, to show up, and send the bill for the people to pay. This was the case with the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and in 2020 in Tokyo. The Japanese people paid an expensive bill just as the Russians did in 2014 in Sochi. The playground of the rich in Sochi today is a ghost town. All Gazprom billionaires who vacationed in Sochi are now buried in very humble graves.
In Japan its Almost impossible to get hold of a gun so that this happend in one of the safest countries in the world is a tragedy   In Sweden 🇸🇪 our hearts goes out to the family of Shinzo abe and to the people of Japan 🇯🇵 our hearts are with you
Japanese political mafia and wannabe warmonger....not the biggest loss really is it.
Japan is over Good work Japan
好似，开香槟咯
Correspondent Marika very easy to listen to, interesting.
So sad
When I watched BBC on YouTube  I felt very alive very clear in term of providing information . The guy anchor It seems very nervous or tired of because affecting the way he reports
As a Japanese,this is so heartbreaking news. I thought my country was peaceful places.
the murderer must be sentenced to a life of torture and finally death. this is unacceptable. Down here in ghana and especially west africa, we have many corrupt and useless leaders yet we dont even consider murdering them because its inhumane. How can they kill such a leader?
The Heart Part 5
As an overseas Taiwanese I appreciate his contribution to recognize the critical situation in Taiwan straight and support to the island state.  We will miss him forever.
Aren't guns illegal over there!?
The communist countries have killed Him
Unexpected news he was very respected All around the world.
Did he get democratized by the US?
Rip
I can't get over this. I admire Mr. Abe so much. 😭
Shocking terrible news. Not many people know this but this crime was committed by the same man who murdered Shane Warne, Yoko Ono's son, Bobo.
I am.india.
He must have been doing good to be murdered , probably one of president Brandon's crew
DEEPEST CONDOLENCE FROM SRI LANKA
THIS IS INDEED VERY SAD .GOD BLESS HIS FAMILY .A GREAT MAN GONE .WHAT AN EVIL WORLD WE LIVE IN .
OMG thought this only happens in Africa,   so sad
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Is this the truning point for politicians to be the subject of hatred as the economies moving south and quality of life deteriorated?
R.I.P.
WHAT THE BRO NOO THATS MY FAVOURITE PRESIDENT
日本語にて失礼します、この事件は完全にテロ事件と呼ぶべき憎む事件です。
😔My sincere condolences and prayers to the people of Japan and to this Honorable man’s grieving family. I am so sorry for this senseless and tragic loss of this Most Honorable Public leader and servant of the beautiful country of Japan. 🙏🏼May his soul find rest and peace 🕊
May his soul rest in peace.
RIP Mr. Shinzo Abe ....Condolences from India
Congratulations yamagami nice shot
I am very sad. He is one of the politician i respect.
RIP
Peaceful Community back at it again
So sad. So shocking. So painful. Beastly and cowardly act. May his soul Rest In Peace
Absolutely awful.  I will never understand how a person can take another persons's life in their hands and kill another human being in cold blood,  If someone has a political dispute with another person, they need to discuss their views with other people and try to change things peacefully, perhaps even run for office.  Killing another person solves nothing.  It destroys the life of the victim, the victim's family, and the victims friends, and resolves nothing,  While I'm sure I would disagree with some of the policies advocated by Mr. Abe but violence is certainly not the answer.  I hereby condemn the perpetrator of this awful crime and any one else who chooses to murder innocent people.  I don't understand why Mr, Abe's protective detail weren't able to prevent this tragedy from occuring.  No one should have been allowed that close to Mr.Abe at a political event.  Surely he did have a protective detail.  How on earth  could they not see someone approaching Mr. Abe from behind with such a weapon and stop him?  My sincere condolences to the Abe family during their time of grief.  He served his country with distinction and honor.  He will be remembered for his leadership and serve as an example of integrity, honor, and service for all  those who aspire to public service.
RIP
How are those gun laws working for you?
Japan? Makes no sense but truth will tell
It was the China man
My condolences to his family! ♥️🙏🏻 RIP 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
So sad. So shocking. So painful. Beastly and cowardly act. May his soul Rest In Peace
The madness that seems to be sweeping the world has now come to Japan. What the hell is going on?! Condolences to all of Japan.
Pre-meditated murder. The killer built his makeshift weapon long ago and just waited for news about where Abe would make an appearance, especially since street rallies are common in Japan.
I’m Japanese. Until now , I didn't believe this breaking news. In Japan , even shotting gun is rare. We feel sad about losing the greatest leader and happening this violence in peaceful society.
RIP Mr. ABE 🕊🙏
A home made gun was used to kill the prime minister of Japan.
A great leader who does not deserve such an end.  Rest in Peace, Shinzo Abe. The entire world will miss you.
I am so heartbroken to Hear of the Death of Shinzo Abe a man that brought light and love to Japan burning his time as leader of Japan my condolence to his family and friends and the people of Japan.
China shot him
People, you got your targets wrong!!!   It is the tyrants, current dictators and the dictator wanna-be's, like Putin, Bolsonaro, Lukashenko, the Trumps, Maduro, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, Kim Yo-jong, Erdoğan and MBS that should be targeted.  All the good guys get killed and the roaches - they survive everything, like Bolsonaro, who is now on his way to becoming Brazil's dictator for life.
🤪😂🤣😎 funny stuff
We extend a heartfelt condolences to the people of Japan..PM Shinzo Abe is a well-known political figure esp. here in the Phil..the news of his untimely passing comes as a shock all over the world..a leader like him will surely be missed esp.at an uncertain times like this..Rest In Peace, Shinzo Abe..former Prime Minister of Japan.
Poor coverage bla bla
This is Japan's second shooting for the year.
Shot at or shot
"...after being shot at"? He wasn't shot "at", he was shot and killed.
This is just the beginning for the "elites"!!!
Im not a Japanese, im really shocked its happened in Japan 😥my condolence to the family, Rip sir former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe🙏
Japan president is a good president, the killer must arranged by America FBI , America FBI killed him
My deepest sympathy to Abe's family and all the people of Japan. Even though he was retired, loss of such a leader is always a shock to the country. When former U.S. Senator John McCain died after his long illness, he was mourned by his supporters as well as his opponents. I believe the loss of Abe so suddenly and violently is as momentous as our loss of McCain. 🛐🕊
It’s sad that some people are celebrating his death. He was a good leader and had good knowledge of the world.
RIP Thankyou for your kind and  loving relationship with Australia when you were Prime Minister why has he been killed
我也不知道那些人在欢呼雀跃什么，逝者已矣！
Japan president is a good president, the killer must arranged by America FBI , America FBI killed him
May he rest in peace and my deepest condolences to his family
Putin is winning 🥇🏆🥇
My heart goes out to the people of Japan.
It's heart breaking. He had such a good heart. I remember being a beneficially of his program.
More violence from the left.
On behalf of my name. Let me pray for him and share my pure deepest condolences for the family & your people.  🙏
Holy thats wild
I am Japanese. I am really shoked and sad to hear this news.  He was the longest prime minister and the most loved politician in Japan. If they have different ideas from yours, attacking to politicians is unforgivable. R.I.P.
so sad! Shinzo Abe was a good man and a friend of our Western allies. 😔
It was a set up I seen it in Naruto
Disgusting!!! May he rest in peace 🙏
Surprised so many people don't know how awful this guy actually was.  Just a bunch of weebs reacting cause he's Japanese but don't know that one of his favorite places to visit was the WW2 Japanese Memorial and if you know even a shred of history you'll know that Japan was allied with Hitler in WW2 and the memorial site is very controversial even in Japan.
India has declared national mourn day for long lost friend 🇮🇳🇯🇵
There were 8 shootings in Japan all of,  last year gang related with, 1 death. Because, Japan is not known for gun violence except with Yakazu. I can't even imagine the horror the people are experiencing today. Just think compared to America, 8 shootings in 1 year with 1 casualty would seem like living in the Land of Oz.
Came for bbc stayed for the news
Rest in peace... but I think it is Chinese Quatation...🕵🕵🕵🕵🕵🕵🕵🕵💣🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩
🙏🇨🇦montreal
Great leader, india loved him, god bless him,
I hope Mr Shinzo Abe RIP and that we will always remember him as a great leader of Japan. My condolences to the people of Japan. Prayers from Singapore🇸🇬
Holy shit
R.I.P. Shinzo Abe 😢. Condolences to the whole of Japan from your friend Türkiye ❤️🇯🇵❤️🇹🇷❤️
Om shanti 😢 may his soul rest in peace 😢🇮🇳🇯🇵🎌
Yakuza?
🙏🙏🙏
Rest In Peace 🙏🏻😔
This news is very sad and angry news for Japan.We will never forget you.
Heartbreaking. May his soul rest in peace.
If nothing else he was always smartly dressed unlike our own ex PM Clown Johnson. R.I.P. Sir
Abe Shinzo Lincoln
Conspiracy why did security did not have enough  to secure PM Abe. Condolence great PM.
Sorrow from us in australia.condolences to family.
Shocking. RIP.
Japan is not a so peaceful country afterall, let alone UK
CIA is to be blamed
RIP
So distraught over all this violence we are witnessing. Condolences to Japan and the Abe Family. 🇯🇵😥
Boris should watch his back aswell. I bet there's plenty that would like to put a bullet in the loser.
Gun violence in Japan.
Maybe we are far from WW III, at least for Asian people
The black hand strikes again
This is very upsetting!!He was a great leader. He will be remembered as a great statesman, envied by many others. May He Rest in Peace.
This is very upsetting, I hoped for him to recover soon but RIP
Sey hello from Putin 🙈
How the hell did he get a gun in Japan
Japan lost its most dependable statesman today. Japan goes to the polls in two days for the Upper House election, and Abe's sudden death would not ensure the ruling LDP win, since Kishida has been disappointing Japan's conservative voters with his vacant policies, adding tax hikes to be expected.
So sad, heartbreaking...   God will punish evil
THIS EVENT SHOULD BE AN EYE OPENING THAT FORMER PRIME MINISTER OR PRESIDENT SHOULD STILL HAVE A TIGHT SECURITY AFTER THEY GO DOWN FROM THEIR POST. SOME DISATISFIED CRIMINAL IS ON WATCH WHEN THEY GO DOWN FROM POWER AND WILL TAKE REVENGE. NEVER RELAX AND CONFIDENT WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY MEASURES. THERE SHOULD BE CHECK POINT OR GUARDS CHECKING ATTENDEES. IT WILL HAPPEN TO ANY PM OR PRESIDENT.
My sincere and deepest condolences to his family, friends, and to the people of Japan!🙏🏽
….I will never understand how killing people makes anything better………….
I smell CIA
I thought strict gun laws stopped shootings? He is a former prime minister if he isn't safe who is? Goes to show gun regulation only creates an uneven playing field. If people had guns the shopter wouldn't have got far especially trying to do that to him in Japan because they basically are a one party state and occasionally the others win for one term just for renewal. Sad news but I guarantee his party will win so the shooter made a mistake doing it during an election campaign if they hate him so much.
Japan is becoming more dangerous than it is before, or same as around the era of war.  Anyway, I hope such a cruel incident like this will never happen any more…
RIP PM Abe Thank you for your service specially to us foreigners living here in japan 🙏🏻🥲
THE VIRUS had reached Japan.
It was the joker
Politician making a nuclear bomb may be forgiven, , but politician being "Nationalist" couldn't be forgiven. NWO "New World Order"
I wonder what grudge someone had against him? people you wouldn't expect have skeletons in their closet but this one got out...
Who cares
RIP Shinzo Abe (1954-2022)
Awful news. Bloody Chyna!!
The killer knew where Abe would be when it was a last minute location. He got a gun in Japan when really only Yakuza and the military have guns. Very curious.
Woah
Oh man, he was one of the greatest contemporary politicians. Very sad news indeed
Unbelievable...R.I.P.
I know that he's not a popular politician but didn't think someone would assassinate him 😧
Terrible thing to happen what a wonderful guy
Deeply sorry this happened in my loved Japan. ❤
US far- right terrorists group is responsible
Sincere condolences. Rest in peace. 🙏🙏.    🇯🇵 🤝 🇩🇪
Although I hate this person very much, it is unacceptable for him to be executed like this. Extreme people will attract another group of extreme people, and moderate people will be surrounded by moderate people
Wow history just came and go. R.I.P Mr Prime Minister.
All coups and assanations are an inside jobs.
horrendous. so horrible and to such a good man.  may he rest in peace. :(🙏
THE MOST HAPPIEST AND CELEBRATED DAY FOR INDIA  🇮🇳🇮🇳🍾🍾🍷🍷🥂 🔱....YAHOOOOOOO
Rest In Shinzo Abe 🙏
This is unbelievable😔.. I WAS FEELING LIVING IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE😯
Very sad news abe - san you will surely be missed 😢😭 hope the culprit is brought to justice 😣
Politician dies after being shot at during speech. Umm…there’s a term for what that is.
No one going to mention that Shinzo Abe and his government greatly admired Nazi ideology ?
Not y'all acting like he was a good person. He's a right winger who denies Japan's war crimes and his own family's criminal past
I NEVER EVER THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC COULD HAPPEN IN JAPAN OF ALL PLACES.....THIS IS VERY MUCH UNJAPANESE !  I'M STILL IN GREAT  SHOCK !
I'd like to express my deepest condolences for the death of former PM of Japan, Mr. Abe. He does not leave a "political heritage" as in this BBC report. It has been handed down to the present day as a great "negative heritage" for the Japanese people. As evidence, there are now officially about 20,000 suicides per year in Japan, 70,000 including the number of "unknown deaths" that have passed more than 24 hours since the attempted suicide and did not leave a suicide note. The above suicides occur every year. That means the fact that he was capable in international politics, but not in domestic politics. For example, one of the effective factors is the introduction of an employment system that has completely different characteristics from Japanese customs and cultural psychology, with the advice of Mr. Takenaka. As a result, many Japanese, who are close in age to the assassin,  have had to lead a terrible life due to the effects. Due to these social factors, they still cannot even have a family. Immediately after the sad incident, I hope that everyone in the world will take into account the current situation in Japan. I'm sorry I made such a discourse. Please forgive my very long comment.
Send money to Ukraine to save Japan
Congratulations to the killer Shinzo Abe ... We all Malaysians really hate him .... all Malaysians have banned Shinzo Abe from entering Malaysia ... congratulations to the killer from  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  TAKBIRR FROM BARISAN NATIONAL & PARTI ISLAM SEMALAYSIA ( PAS BN)
Hmm, It looks security bodyguards were sleeping 😴😴😴 because it is & was always peaceful in Japan anyways,   but also after covid pandemic many people have lost their mind and can't accept disagreement.  Now even in Japan 😱😱😱.
Onichannnn whyyy
Next, Putin!
Omg he was such a gentleman RIP 😢
"Jahpaan"
RIP Mr Shinzo Abe Sad day 😢
You guys are still supporting an ex axis country lol ridiculous
Sounds like Russia politics , if you cant beat'em Kill'em .
May God Blessed him
How was the shooter able to get so close to him like that! They never check the entourage? My condolences to his family.
Rip
Will Japan’s policy change for Russia and China?
Deepest condolences to the bereaved family and the Japanese nation.From Nagaland
This is heartbreaking.
And Japan has "total gun control" regular citizens cannot own firearms!
My condolences,from the people of Republic Indonesia.
He's just one of the gangsters. There's a lot more and you would understand what I am saying if you know anything about Japan's politics.
Condolences… … A Great leader.. my contry India loses a true friend..🙏
RIP Mr. Abe. I have not seen anyone as humble and dynamic as you. My condolences to the people of peaceful Japan and his heartbroken family.
Oh noooooo 😭
RIP from India !!!  🤥
The assassination attempt is likely to be the work of China CCP because Shinzo Abe's stand against China's aggression in the Pacific. Any country's leader, especially those in Asia, opposes China will be taken down one way or another. China CCP will rule the world soon because every country in the world is too afraid to go to war with China.
Security must not have been tight.......God Bless him.
So sad that he died in the hands of the evil gunman, he doesn’t deserve this, his killer should be punish and put him in the death row because he killed the very kind Former Prime Minister of Japan.  Prime Minister ABE is a very good man a very good Leader and very generous. I think the gunman is working with someone very influential person in Japan because the election is coming soon already.  He helped Philippines a lot because he is a friend of President Duterte. This is very very sad 😢😢😢 Philippines love Prime Minister Abe 😟😟😟😢😢😢 We love him because he is a very good man and very generous to the Philippines 🇵🇭  Thank you very much to the former Prime Minister Abe for helping Philippines and for your generosity to my fellow countrymen. Rest In Peace Sir 😢 God bless your family.
Blame china
Condolences from Taiwan. Thank you, Mr Abe, for what you have done for Taiwan. 🇹🇼   Taiwanese people will not forget you. Thank you for seeing Taiwan as an independent country.
So nobody thought to put a bullet proof vest on this man before the speech. 😖👓👀
I remember that chick being a hooker in Cape Town
Japan seriously 😳
I'm so, so, sorry, my friend!!!
Days of Noah:  "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with VIOLENCE. So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth." Genesis 6:11‭-‬12 NKJV  Before Christ returns it will be like days of Noah increased violence:  "And  as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man (before Christ returns)" Luke 17:26 NKJV
My god . If this is happening in a place like Japan , it shows you CLEARLY the state of the world . They totally underestimated how peaceful Japan has been since the war . This was totally an act of terrorism from outside of Japan no doubt . Disgraceful. RIP Shinzo.
Chinese are very very happy😁😁😁
They don't have alot of guns. 😆
Assassinated is more like it fools
🇯🇵 悲しい   😢
I think do this China
Prayers for Mr Abe's family and friends 🙏🙏🙏  I'm so sorry to hear about this. 😢
윤석렬과 벗들 .친일양반들 위로합니다
People have guns in Japan? Lol tf
This is so sad, his poor family. Gun violence is an everyday thing where I am. But in Japan?? Shocking. I know each country has their own issues.
Sad news, RIP, what a crazy world!
The best Prime minister ever . He was so smart and diplomatic man
私はとても悲しいです...神のご加護を
My God. That's awful! That really left me in shock.
I’m so mad right now about this
I keep wondering why do people like guns😏?
RIP Prime Minister. Truly the loss of a noble leader, not only for Japan but the world. Sending prayers for the people of Japan 🇯🇵 from USA 🇺🇸 🙏
Noooo :(
Sad news. R. I. P.
Rest in peace~
PM Shinzo was a good friend of President Trump and of the United States.  This has the fingerprints of the Chicoms on it.  My sympathies to the Japanese people.
Chinese nationals are celebrating his death and calling the assassin a hero. What sick minded people they are....really.
One of the most humble and prominent leader of the world. Heart goes out to the people of Japan. Prayers and thoughts with his family and friends. Om Shanti 💐
I’m Japanese. So shock… I can’t believe he died. Because he is the most popular prime minister in Japan. We are so sad now. I pray for him.
😭😭
Chinese people are over the moon while Taiwanese are mourning
Hell someone needs to do that in America
That this distinguished, honorable man would meet his end from being shot in the back with a zip gun is beyond awful, I am speechless.
My condolences Japan. 🇯🇵🇺🇲
Great loss for Japan India relationship 🇯🇵 🇮🇳 deep condolences 🌹🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹
johnson resigns and abe shot dead 🤔 as an after thought its amazing the definition of conspiracy usually entails events, dates, motives........people.
CNN we know it’s a hit is it a cia coup or what
He was a great leader from everything I’ve read about him. Very sad. I’m curious to see details as they come out
Deep condolences. Who is the killer,why .
I can’t imagine how the country of Japan is feeling right now. A lot of people in the west are desensitized to killing and acts of violence but for this To occur in Japan of all places really breaks my heart
OMG… peaceful people successfully landed on the land of the rising sun!
Omg..my condolences to his family and loved ones.
CIA killed him to send a message to Japan that if you try to get rid of U.S influence in Japan then we will eliminate you.
Cue all the right wing Americans "I thought gun free meant nobody ever got shot"
Condolence
RIP!
So it begins 👽😈👽😈
one of world leader i respect in the world.....i would like to express my condolence honestly.....rest in peace.....
RIP shinzo
It's happened in the USA ??
Devastating loss. He was a great leader and good man. Only an evil crazy madman a coward would commit such an act. My condolences to our Japanese brothers and sisters.
The west aint no angels show ur faces to the world
The man is murdered and BBC puts on this Chicom shill nutjob to talk about how "controversial" he was. Why? Because he wasn't fooled by China and knew Beijing has nefarious hegemonic aims.
😥
Very Sad
Rest in peace Shinzo Abe 😔🙏 (September 21st 1954 - 8 July 2022)
behalf of Philippine citizen condolence sir you will never forget
The west aint no angels show ur faces to the world
Rest in peace..🙏
I saw some pics of the asassin and the gun on the ground. 100% a homemade weapon.
He was a good leader RIP. Sir
I’d offer a real comment, but I realize which channel I’m on.
Within their own countries, Every prime minister or president leader has 55% who love him and 45% who don't. Internationally, he may be adored by the West, but in his country he has friends, frenemies & enemies.
I'm so sad to hear this news,my deepest condolences to Abe and to all japanese people, and may him Rest In Peace,from China🇨🇳  愿所有人余生安康幸福
My heart goes with the entire people of Japan.
Guy had some kind of homemade double barrel 12 gauge
💔💔💔💔💔
I suspect Russia and China considering this country is not being liked
I am quite sorry to hear that. The world is not a safe place even in Japan.
His death should be a warning to all of us: you can be m-worded for your beliefs...
This is extremely sorrowful moment for Indians as well.  He was a visionary leader not only for Japan but also for the world..  My heartfelt condolences to his family and people of Japan. India has lost a friend. His visionary leadership has played a vital role in India-Japan bilateral relation. May his soul Rest in peace 🕉️ OM SHANTI🙏
How on earth did he get a gun? There must be more to it.
He was assassinated because he was making a speech about protecting Taiwan from China. Something is not adding up.
"Political violence is rare in Japan"  Yes, in the last decades, but in history? No.
Rest in peace, Shinzo Abe. This is so heartbreaking.
Huhu He's kind and President Duterte BFF Rest in Peace you will never forget your kindness specially to poor country
Somebody did not want him in power
Japanese people are gunless. So, how can it happen???
So sad
May his soul rest in peace.  I am saddened to hear about his demise.
Shocking.  Poor man.  RIP.  Peace to his family and loved ones and the people of Japan.  I hope justice prevails and his killer is prosecuted to the fullest extent of Japanese law.
Oh dear... Abe was a U.S. puppet but still... nobody deserves getting shot like that.
Sad. CCP will be happy?
Apparently the suspect " Tetsuya Yamagami " was dissatisfied with Shinzo Abe and wanted him dead with no shame in his action. That murderous rat can ROT in prison for all I care!
Condolences, peace and prosperity for Japan.
Heartbreaking & devastating news for Japan & the world. Condolences to his wife Akie Abe & loved ones. This will leave a huge void in Japanese politics even though he'd stepped down 2 years ago.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
He was the ex PM . There are many ex leaders in Japan. Poor reporting.
What a devastating news. The world will miss you sir Shinzo Abe. :(
Love from India. May he rest in peace.
Shinzo is not forgotten.
Violence is so rare in japan? You have never been to Japan have you buddy!!!
Okay politicians like Abe get assasinated while war criminals like Bush and Blair get to walk around and crack jokes about the millions they killed. Truly an unfair world we live in
Still shocked and heart broken. Weren't any military guidance?
If they need a guest speaker there, I recommend Donald Trump.
This is just the new Persona game.
RIP
today in the fake news central
🤯
Chinese assassin?
Deep condolences to the bereaved family and to Japanese people. May  he rest in peace!  🇯🇵 🇵🇭
My condolences, RIP Abe Shinzo 🙏
Why not just put Assassinated. Learn to report
this is EXACTLY why former US presidents still have active bodyguards.
Who did this?and why? China and Russia  maybe behind him
I wonder if China and Russia had anything to do with his death.
Châu chấu, những dòng sông nước chảy như máu, bệnh dịch, hạn han, lủ lụt, các điềm lạ, động đất.. là báo hiệu tận thế  Phản Kito là ĐGH  Sắp tận thế lúc 15 giờ v
Condelenses 😭😭😭🇵🇭😥🇯🇵
Man in Japan, shits gone wild in the world fr
rest in peace. may god bless him and grand me a wisdom like him
This is messed up… RIP
How did the suspect find out? Obviously it was a inside job.
Absolutely shocked, how scary that a person final moments can be just giving a speech and then shot dead the next moment. I never expected anything like this to happen in Japan. My deepest condolences to his family. Rest in peace Shinzo Abe 🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊🕊
It is the world where good people will be killed.
CIA is behind this terror attack.
rest in peace shinzo abe. 🙏
"Violence is so rare in Japan, it has been for a very long time..." NOT TRUE - Gun violence is rare but violence is NOT.
Ramifications to the overexposure of American culture. Condolences
:0
Rip
he was not one of those bum ass politicians we used to in our bum ass countries, as a foreign living in japan for 10y i can tell he was really appreciated. and respected, even by the ones who disagree with him, its a sad loss. one of a few politic figures that i could really look up to...
This morning changed my opinion about Japan. I always thought Japan is a peaceful country
Oh god RIP 🙏 🕊
May he be accepted in Heaven,Valhalla, Swarga and Jannah.
A good leader, a voice had been silence. Japan is a very nice peaceful place...why did that man harmed ex-PM Abe...
Recently Japan has changed. Not being a peaceful country caused increased immigrants little by little. Especially from China. Many members of parliament have been on money or honey of China, so Abe can't make his policy for Japanese on them. Mr. Abe was a real patriot.
😭💐❤️🙏🤲🇯🇵❤️🇦🇺
Boris gone, Shinzo dead. This is the doing of the you know who’s
So sad indeed !
What ideals did he represent? I don't know wether to to feel good or bad yet
someone big is hiding in the shadow of that assassination. RIP Mr Abe
Am i the only one who feels that the world is going through some narrative or hypocritical ways by loosing good influencing ppl, political instability wholeover the place, economic crisis and etc.!
did the word "assassinated" get deleted from Webster's and Oxford Dictionaries because I could have sworn that your caption ought to be "Shinzo Abe assassinated" to capture the gravity of the moment. Otherwise condolences to Japan, Shinzo Abe was probably the most recognizable Prime Minister out of Japan
Some dies in China: "he's dead" Offset dies in an accident:  *"government clones him"*
Snitches get stitches
Shot by his own people sad
Dude.
The world is losing its mind...world leaders stepping down, getting shot.... condolences to Abe's family and the people of Japan...
toàn cây hài ko ta ơi
The Another Great loss for All humanity such a Great Leader.RIP Mr Abe.
Chinese is very very happy!🍻
He was in Rio 2016 olympic games with a Mario hat 💔😥
Assassins really don’t like leaders named Abe for some reason.
so sad
Serve him right
💙🇯🇵❤
Horrible thing to happen to a great man. Best wishes to his family, and hope for  brighter days ahead.
Leave it to bbc to bring in politics while reporting his death. Not cool.
Abe is the reason why Abe is still powerful right now
Wait until we hear about his murderer's suicide.
Very respectful,powerful yet humble leader...Salute to you former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Im deeply hurt hearing this news. Love from Philippines!Rest in peace Prime Minister Abe!
I am pretty shocked an assassination can take place in today's world. That too in a country like Japan where it's so rare.
This is horrible. My condolences to all affected.
RIP to Mr.Abe.
It's not just a shocking news, it's totally heartbreaking for me.
Very tragic 😢 news from Japan  R.I.P the golden leader mr ABE.
Rest in Peace Shinzo Abe
Xipingshit had something to do with it.
Abe had dirt on Hillary
The criminal used his homemade gun..  My condolences to Japan🥀
We are all on borrowed time. Live and love today, because nobody knows what might happen.
A dark cloud has fallen upon Japan 🇯🇵
we cant go a week without major gun violence somewhere. this is insane.  prayers to his family 🙏
Crazy I thought guns were banned there
We never forget you. You were a good friend of ours.🇧🇩♥️
Ohh,,so heartbreaking news  .... can't believe that could happen , it's so hard day for Japan 😥
Meet mungkar dan nangkir.
That’s true that I hear he is like a shit in China. Forgive me to tell the truth.  They also celebrate the getting out of Boris
I am Japanese.  I really understood that he was loved by People from other countries too.  Many Japanese people are in great shock and confusion now. but sadly insulting remarks from a heartless person to him are occurring on SNS.(It's so embarrassing for us)  Hatred does not give birth to anything. he will not return.
Absolutely devistating… Such a pleasant man who was so good for Japan  And Japan being such a safe country… With very few gun and violence problems So sad  Vale Mr Abe
"Oi MUCH HOMIE RESPECTS 2 MISTER SHINZO ABE REST PEACEFULLY HOMIE BUT VIOLENCE EXIST EVEN IN PEACE TIMES"!!...aarrmm???..."BUT DAT JAPANESE TOP LEVEL SECURITY DETAIL WERE AT BEST CIVILIAN NOT REALLY A VERY PROFESSIONAL TOP SECURITY UNIT WERE THEY"!!..like "NOT VERY OBSERVANT WHEN CONSIDERING BOTH AMERICAN NSA AND BRITISH MI6 SECURITY ARE DAH BEST IN DAH WORLD NEED A OVERHAUL JAPAN VERY LAZY HOMIE YUH"!!..
I'm more interested in the speech he was giving right before this incident.. Nevertheless, hearbreaking news and my sincere condolences. Rest in peace Shinzo Abe
If it was any where else i wouldn't be surprised but japan of all places
💔🙏RIP Mr. Abe
This is such great news !
Chinese noodles were found around the crime scene.....🙃
what is going on in this world seriously violence is even hitting Japan now condolences to the family and to all of the people of Japan
Who shoot him ?
ショッキング...
RIP
😔😢
A lesson for the puppeteers!
fact: even though he fromer Prime minister. He can be consider the most powerful politician in japan from LD party killed by :41 year old Tatesuya yamagami ,a former member of maritime self- defense force
So strange... 😔 He knew too much about Fukushima
Did some american high school kids go to Japan or something?
Such a tragedy! My condolences to the Japanese people. I am from Denmark, and I really liked him
RIP
Our deepest condolences on the passing of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, may the bereaved family be given strength
My condolences to the people of Japan
Reverse order 44
They shot the wrong person… it should have been Putin
Why would anyone want him dead after his term as PM is over?
Deep condolences, i can't believe, it's so fast
So sad!  could be Vladimir  Putin, not Japan's ex-leader Shinzo Abe! My Condolence to the family and friends .😭😭😇❤
Condolences to the family  Rest in Peace
Deeply sorry to know that💔
As an American this is awful, its a travesty of democracy to have anyone be shot while giving a political speech.  If you don't agree with someone then get a microphone and argue your points on merit not silence them with brute savagery.   I condemn this utterly.  That said maybe it was a personal motive I guess we'll see.
Japan. Of all places.
Very heartbreaking May you rest peacefully 🙏
condolence from us pilpino Abe-san is really kind to us pilipino so its really sad
If this is not thn that is nonsense
So tragic and unbelievable in such a peaceful country.   Deepest condolences to his family for their loss.
Nothing is predictable these days 😓. He was among the most respected leaders of our era. His contributions to the world are really unforgettable. He was the pioneer and reviver of QUAD. Proper Investigation of this attack should be done by QUAD.      🇮🇳♥️🇯🇵
Ask right questions. Was he WEF Soros / Schwab man ?!  Who was controlling him?! Or was he AGAINST Soros /Schwab elites ? Then you will see is this next trend
The guy must really hate him from letting Dutch people into their country in the colonist times and not apologizing to the world for letting this happen. Hope it comes out what the real reason was he got shot, and not some made up press talk. He was already out of office unless his influences.
What is terrirism
May his soul Rest In Peace 🙏 Japan helps Cambodia a lot 🙏🙏
better aske North Korea  for the fake tears.
*Next: Queen was murdered by her butler* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just can't believe that he was allowed to go among the crowd without a bullet-proof vest, as the minimum precaution. Apparent peace has been hiding violence so efficiently while Fukushima disaster was also the result of intimidations exerted on local officials who tried to warn the government. The sarin gas attack more than a decade
Yeah....ccp strikes again
He has done so much for my country. A good leader that we hope we can have. From the Philippines my condolences. RIP PM Abe.
So sad 😭...my deepest condolences to Japan and Abe family ❤️🇵🇷
Send him to snake Island
My deepest condolences to the population of Japan in this tragic moment 🇯🇵 RIP Shinzo Abe
I don't know anything about him, but perhaps politicians should learn to not LIE, and CHEAT, STEAL from their people.
Wow.. what is happening in this world
Where were his bodyguards looking? The shooter “crept of behind him” and got off two shots - 2.5 seconds apart?! 🤔
Is he Modi's friend?? .because of Modi is big panothi.
😪
R.i.p Mr. Abe 💕💕
one less communist 😂  fake arse government  world wide coming to an end. 😅
He was the only politician whose death I felt sad for, my dad actually met him when he worked in Japan a few years back, said he was a pretty swell guy.
I smell a hit job 🧐
Terrible, RIP
RIP😥
I was not a fan of him and his politics, but he certainly deserved better than this. Just because I disliked him doesn't mean I wanted him dead. Rest in peace. I'd be a fool to deny the work he's done for his people.
i mean his retired why this?
It's a terrible thing. But his security should hide their heads in shame....if he even had one.
Condolence from Malaysia
My condolences, from great Britain the man was a great leader and who ever did it deserves the highest punishment available
Not a Japanese but I love this man😭 rest in peace Mr. Abe. The world's loves you😭😭😭
Greatest of all time.
I want to go some Japanese 🇯🇵 channel to say our condolences, but I can't typing Japanese fonts yet, please forgive me.  May Mr Abe family and all his colleague have patience and stay strong with this tragedy
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY AND HIS SOUL SHINZO ABE RIP. THANKS TO ALL YOUR SUPPORT IN THE PHILIPPINES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT NEVER FORGET U GOOD NIGHT SIR ❤🙏
That's crazy! I liked him. Prayers.
No more have baby
The people who control the media, like this news outlet, are the ones who are behind it.
メディアの過熱報道→ネットで曲解された主張が拡散→SNSしか見ない孤独な貧困層が自分が報われないのは安倍のせいだと思い込む→犯行
RIP 😔 from India 🇮🇳🇯🇵
Ah, man I am sorry to hear this. As far as world leaders go he seemed like he was one of the good ones.
4:26 related to this... Abe saw what China was aiming for. That's why Abe wanted to change the constitution. Now China got aircraft carriers and Japan is barely aiming to employ F-35B off shore..   Japan should be deploying F-35C and F/A-18F on aircraft carriers by now, not crippled F-35B.
Very kind man 👍
RIP Abe, sorry for the lost our fellows Japanese friends stay strong from America 🇺🇸.
偉大な総理大臣でした。哀悼の意を表します。海外の方、コメントありがとう。
This world...
Abe was the unque PM  who wanted  to revive militarism and  possess nuclear weapon in Japan,  now  he can discuss these issues with his grandpa there!
https://youtu.be/Iq_zMuo-G_w 👆#When work is a love affair
_Abe says Japan 'cannot do without' nuclear power._     News headline from 2016.
Is China involved?
R.I.P.
🇺🇸🇯🇵
So, very sad.  He was one of the most down-to-earth politicians that I know of.
The local media said, the man told he had done it not against Abe's policy but against some connection of him with a group.
This is a very very sad day. Condolences to all the people of Japan and the whole world.
Too bad it wasn’t Trump.
Rest in Peace Mr.Shinzo Abe Sir 🙏
As you can see,  the first shot slipped through Shinzo Abe's body.  It shows that Shinzo Abe’s Kamui had not yet abated; he was shot just after he materialized his body to attack the attacker during the second shot. We lost a great Shinobi. RIP
😔🥀 condolences
So many good an innocent people from world leaders to school children killed by the barrel of a gun by unhinged individuals!
R.i.p Abey sir 🙏
Japan has strict gun laws and shootings are a rare occurrence. I say it again...  The laws don't matter to the lawless.
Apparently the Chinese Government has ‘condemned’ the murder but within the country, it free for all to make fun of the killing. So typical of #CCPchowchow
Our deepest condolences to Mr. Abe's family and loved ones and to the nation of Japan. Mr. Shinzo Abe was a good and generous friend of the Filipino people. May your soul rest in peace. Arrigato and Sayonara.
the American culture is in Japan Now 🤣
One does not hear about shootings in Japan. I guess they're getting the idea from the USA where shootings are a common occurrence. Very sad.
Especially Especially the person is punished
He was corrupt to the core, but still, he didn't deserve to go out that way
Rip Mr Shinzo Abe The Greatest Prime Minister In Our Hearts Thank You For Your Service To Your People 😢💞😿😔
I know a guy who gave good speeches and was a painter, but they missed him when they tried to shoot him.
WOW THERE IS NO HIDING THE NEWS IN JAPAN SEE HOW QUICK THEY ARE that would take a bit where we are at
Putin is the catalyst
They keep saying political violence is rare. Gun violence is, of course, rare. But political violence is not as rare in Japan as they'd like to believe.
I am so heart broken. He made me love Japan so much . I love Abe !! Rest Sir 🇯🇵💜😢
Very very sad news.
maybe they'll crack down on guns in japan now
Im saddened because he is a great leader and helped Philippines in Infrastructure projects.
May his soul rest in peace. Amen
He was my role model 😢 Rest In Peace Shinzoabe 😭
RIP SHINZO ABE
this changes everything for japan. first it was Inejirō Asanuma, now Abe.
Rest in Peace, Mr Abe...
Oh noooo!  First, a Minecraft YouTuber died on Cancer now this.
戦後、日本の首相経験者が殺害されたのはこれが初めてです まさか安倍元総理だとは思わなかった
If anybody have any disagreement with your leader policy, step up to the plate and run for office. This is unacceptable.
very very sad
Innalilahi wa Inna ilaihi Raji'un, rest in peace. 🌐
Please read about unit 731!
wow
My deepest condolences to his family and friends in this saddest day.
Shinzo Abe's grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister in the 1950s and was a cabinet member during the war who was accused – but never indicted – of war crimes.  Abe refused to apologise for the 20,000 women forced into brothels to serve the Japanese army.
心よりご冥福をお祈り申し上げます。
Condolences from Ukraine. Horrendous to see this unfold in peaceful Japan.
Wait , I didn't expect such thing from a peaceful country like Japan .
Nice, the rest of ALL politicians need to go too. ALL OF THEM.
Rip mr. Abe one of my political leader idol...
Yep. Regimes that have gun control don't have assassinations *....Guaranteed* *!!!*
Con Speranza che mi auguro che faccia la stessa fine ….
Iam really socking ! He was a good man , my he rest in peace ,
Condolences to the family and to the great people of Japan, it's a sad time, where the peace fool country of Japan long has been a been pointing to a brighter future for the World, rest in piece
I really like that man, I hope the person is punished
oh shit
Our most sincere condolences to the People of Japan for the loss of former PM Abe. The Philippines lost a dear Friend.
It has been a long time since I have seen a bad news related to japan. Well people everyone are turning evil
He made Japan economic rise again with his policy called "abenomics" if you ever heard that.
The world is crumbling on it's kneet so just wait and watch it's final stage with a prayer of confession.
the world is ending....
Rip mr abe
:( this isn't fair
WHAT!? NO!!    So So Sad  !! beyond belief…and yet, and Our Hearts are So Sorry as Great Minds get Assassinated throughout Time….where would 🌏🌎🌍be if they hadn’t been killed. Rest In Peace,  Shinzo Abe….Japan’s, …….Abraham Lincoln…JFK….❤️Peace Be With You…🕊🕊🕊🕊
This is a dastardly act and highly condemnable.
Rest in peace🙏
I am American but live in Japan. Rest In Peace, Abe-sama.
Japan is one of asian nation who follow american democrazy. Like father like son. Feel danger in their own country. Keep selling gun biden. Will see how its goes the next 10 years.
R.I.P, I really don't hear violence in Japan, so to hear this ,it's shocking
We all know who killed him: The ever evil CIA and British secret Service agents. Japan is tasting the fruit of their unholy alliance with the West.
I wonder where they would trace back the link to...hmmm🤔. Seems someone is determined to make sure only one special man wins...would disrupt plans if someone else wins 🤔 This goes beyond Japan...🤔
Sad, Sad. My condolences to his family and the people of Japan and everyone around the world that loved him ,R.I. P🙏🙏🏿🌍
Hey BBC , political leader 'dies after being shot' while giving a political speech by a guy who disagreed with his policies. That's called an assassination.
😪❤️🇯🇵🙏🏽
How disheartening, surely the man who assassinated him is insane for doing this.
Loads of nasty stuff happening this year , wonder if it will continue like that till the end of year 🙁
😭
Sir You Are Brave & Truthful Person  Lots Of Respect For You & Great Japan 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The world is in dis array and if you go back to the start mostly due to the disruption caused by covid which is ultimately caused by China. He is def right about japans military spending. If I was a neighbor of China and Russia I would have an army.
https://youtube.com/shorts/q7ht_0vBz_k?feature=share He was a kind and sincere Prime Minister
As far as gangs intermingles, no difference between Japan, Myanmar, Mexico etc..
😑😟
Did you catch the anchors analysis of who’s to blame at the 4:15 minute mark? That It’s somehow Abe’s fault that the Chinese are online celebrating his death because ‘he was such a controversial leader’?!! How about any person who cheers on the death of another strictly over political reasons is a terrible human being. Can we at least start there?? People suck! (starting with these two vacuous shills on BBC)
But they had gun control?
May his kami be with the Japanese people.
The world has lost a great leader.  This is heart breaking
Corruption controlling greed the end is coming
Let’s see who wants to blame this to CCP…
The chinese must be behind this
The gun was handmade
Guns are for cowards.
"Violence is so rare in Japan" *kamikaze plane screaming by* *and explosion of the USS Lexington* .  Japan is the only country on the planet that was nuked just to calm them down.
No one is shocked he's been in cabinet forever?
I am Japanese. He was the longest-serving prime minister of Japan.Many Japanese, including myself, respected him the most among the prime ministers.
Tell me this is not a coincidence the. Leaders all over are Resigning or being killed….. nwo underway……………….
So sad, my deepest condolences to his family He is calm and wise leader May his soul rest in peace
India 😭😭😭
As a Filipino i deeply hurt from this news because Mr. Abe has a good relation to us.  Rest in peace Mr. Abe! We will not forget the help you give to our countries projects.
ここにいるイギリス国民の皆様、我が国の元首相に対する哀悼の意をありがとうございます。一日本人からありがとうと言わせてください。
Shocking News. Although the wrong ex-world leader was shot. Why couldn't it have been Trump.
RIP
Murakoze is thank you 🇷🇼♥️🚀🔥🚀 e
Who's behind this China, CIA, Mossad? We will never be told the truth
My deepest condolences .May his soul Rest In Peace.
This is about Shinzo Abe - not some shabby body-builder advert you worthless commercial  cretins intrude upon
RIP Shinzo Abe
Rest in peace Mr.Abe
So sad. Rest in peace Mr Abe
Political terror of USA in action. Many people in Japan were supporting his balanced position. But USA only like position when politicians are obeying them.
So sad
Incredibly shocking 😞
RIP
It was Chinese spy’s to destabilize Japan
This is completely impossible. Guns are very strictly and tightly controlled in Japan and there is a mini Police station on every corner. How could someone have obtained a firearm and shot and official? Gun control works, and he had an added layer of protection too because he was standing next to a sign that said "gun free zone". How could this have possibly happened. Guns are completely illegal in Japan.
Today is a day to celebrate for South Korea, Australia and China.
This just shows, we never know our last day on earth would be.
Condolences,  from Nepal.
Metro to India..lovingly person.hartly consolance to his femily..
Shocked and saddened by the news.Considering we are still stuck with a lying corrupt government it proves life really is a throw of the dice.
Heartbreaking news. Abe was a good man and liked by most around the world. Shocking to see such incident in Japan which has such polite culture. Given current geopolitical turmoil, seems foreign interference..
Behind the murder CIA
😢
Such an weak Japanese security agency to protect former PM 🥲
RIP Sir 🥺
RIP
Rest in peace Abe San I'm deeply shocked about your passing my heart goes out to your family and friends and of course the Japanese people who worshipped you for a long time and a great prime minister of Japan may you rest in peace from all of us in the UK
bad people lost job or got shot, justice comes back these days.
😨
I expect they'll do a thorough investigation. I don't believe the killer's explanation. Appears to be an assassination. RIP
Violence is very rare in Japan- a country where six prime ministers have been assassinated.
So tragic.
That  female  needs  to  learn  correct pronunciation  of  words.  Politi cian  is  not  correct.  Poli   tician  is  correct.   (ci  is  pronounced  as  sh).
I'm not a Japanese but I feel so heavy, sad and my tears started to come out when I heard this news that he passed away. he didn't deserve to die this early people in Japan need him.
isn't that called being assassinated?
The Chinese and the Rusputins must be overwhelmed by this “great” news .  Whatever it is, my condolences to his family and my thoughts are with them.
Criminals break laws. They have a history of not following the law. Make a law saying you can carry your gun without a license or permit then the criminals will be likely to not carry a gun cause they don’t wanna obey no laws. That’s their logic.
I am Chinese and feel sorry for his family. My sincere condolences to his family. Violence is absolutely unacceptable.
He got the wrong leader lol
Heartbreaking  News!😔😭 Condolence  to all Japanese, We love you Former Prime minister .
This is truly sad.  Heartfelt condolences to the people of Japan.
This is sad...not only for Japan but to the whole world.
My deepest condolences to his family and friends. Rest in peace PM.
What is going on in this world!!! The Japanese are the last culture I would expect to be violent 😢
What will be the response when Boris Johnson dies?
China is responsible
本当に悲しい。 RIP
Why not an act of terrorism
I am sad and disbelieve this horrible news.   Rest in Peace to the great leader.
Sad
On behalf of the Sri Lankan citizens, I'd like to express my condolences to his family members and the people of Japan. Japan has always been a true friend of Sri Lanka
谴责暴力，但一个中国人对于右翼分子，淡化侵华历史，政策遵循甲级战犯祖父，参拜靖国神社的人，没有什么好悼念的
Whoa....
Should've been Biden
Why?
It's incredibly shocking and astonishingly sad news from Japan . To be particular,Japan was not known for such brutality.... Ohh god, rest in peace Late Mr Abe .. condolences to the family. From Republic of India.🇮🇳🇯🇵
Hmmm… still think shootings only happen in America? Guess again
My deepest condolences to his Family and the Japanese people 🙏🙏, RIP  Mr Abe , he was a Great Man  🇯🇵🇺🇸 😥😥🙏🙏🙏💐🌹❤️
I did not know who this man was, I recognised his face. I follow politics closely but he must of been before my time.
Goodbye, Japan Hitler
Japan better build a huge army because China will destroy Japan before they destroy Amerixa
I think Shinzo Abe really died. I think the current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida think it was fake news. I think Fumio Kishida is mistaken. I think it was not fake news. I think it was real news.
The only influential Japanese Prime Minister.  Rest in peace 🙏
The assasination maybe connected  with the Russian Ukraine conflict. He was a major key player
its amazing to think that in 1981 the Queen, The US President and the Pope survived assasisnation attemps
People celebrating another person's death is so low class. Subhuman species.
Putin paid the shooter big bucks
Why no proper treatement was given to revive ? Why doctors didn't do nothing???
If the shooter is found to have acted with Chinese backing ......... This could become an Archduke Franz Ferdinand moment.
Nanking, anybody?
Very heartbreaking news , incredibly shocking news. He was such an amazing and talented person. RIP PM Shinzo Abe- San
Cowards.whoever shoots a person in the back not having the guts to look a person in the eye is a coward in this life and the next
So sorry for Japans loss.
Nah I actually cant believe it. Who is really that sick to do that. Like wtf this is such a bombshell wtf
I wish heavenly bliss for him. And a lot of politicans consider this accident and reflect their political activity.
Rip sir from 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I didn't think someone would want to end Abe's life. That's such crazy and insane. I feel so sorry for him. May he rest in peace.
American gun violence spreading peace in Japan
Just curious...what does IL DOUCHE have to say? He was "friends" with Abe..an oxymoron, I know. Doofy has never had a real "friend" in his miserable life.
It shows that even completely strict firearm and knife laws doesn't prevent anything. Those who want to kill will do it regardless. Tragic event, indeed.
Shocking news coming out of Japan, especially from such a peaceful country...  Condolences from Ireland, may he rest in peace.....
Terrorism in japan is either nothing or everything. Years back they had a terrorist team who deployed deadly gasses in the metroes
TAKE NOTES AMERICA AND DO THE SAME TO OUR LEADERS THEY NEED OVERTHROWN
Why bycicle man not keep.
Is this real.  There's no way in hell this is real
Rest in peace in heaven Mr. Shinzo Abe 😇
Former Prime Minister Abe was the best of all Japanese prime ministers. Democracy has freedom of speech. The most barbaric suppression of speech, which is killing, will not be tolerated. I sincerely pray for his soul rest in peace as he protected Japan in the most dangerous region of the world surrounded by dictatorships of Russia, China, and North Korea.
I'm 17 year-old Japanese and he's the person who reminds me my childhood 'cuz he had been prime minister during almost all of my childhood. This tragedy not only makes me sad but also brings me a sense of loss.
Such a terrible news! Can't believe this could happen in a nation like Japan, Sincere heartfelt condolences to a great patriotic man family, black day in the history of Japan
Wow
Welp..... that was bad really bad R.I.P Abe-san... you were one of my favourite leaders  Rest in peace 1954-2022 🕊
RIP Shinzo Abe the great Japanese Prime Minister.
Our deep condolence to all Japanese friends from us in Indonesia. This men not only really popular in his country but also around the world
May his soul rest in peace 💟
I don't know why he was killed is it because of any corruption case yet still of course it is wrong to kill someone whether you have hatrer or like him you can enlighten me people of Japan
RIP Abe,what a loss for Japan.
Dam!
In a country with the strictest gun laws. Wow.
China did because he said we should support Taiwan 🇹🇼
Violence is not rare in Japan.  A few weeks ago, a far-right extremist attacked a female candidate's office.  A few months ago, a male candidate was punched by a far-right nationalist.  Female politicians and members of the opposition party are often threatened by extremists during campaigns.
I wonder if the labour party had something to do with this
He internally was a conservative but liberal Keynesian politician who was aiming to positive finance and walfare state. He surly wanna change the constitution but his tone was down because he mind citizen's emotion and political tendency. He partly recovered the economy. In Covid 19, not only medical personnel but also he made tremendous effort to prevent Virus from spreading and as a result Japan became relatively safer place in this pandemic.  He externally was a flagman of international cooporation which was at the edge of danger in late 2010s. Unfortunately, his alternative doesn't exsist in Japan.Good bye Mr Shinzo Abe.
Where was Hillary???
This is not just one person’s death. His death makes the world confused and threatens democracy.
Condolences to the family. Truly a sad day.
No one likes to hear a news like this about the Great Shinzo Abe. Its loss for Japan.  R.I.P Shri Shinzo Abe.
So sad
My deepest condolences to his family. Rest in peace sir.
Someone is probably trying to provoke Japan to react and start a war in Asia. Damn, scary times.
Japan is being freed from the lies of the world and some Japanese are beginning to awaken. The death of Shinzo Abe will anger the Japanese people. This was a state plot to profit from his death, carried out by a double agent.  The war between Ukraine and Russia is a war launched by the US.
Wow this man was well liked globally
It will happen in Russia soon.
RIP
My deepest condolences from Germany.  R.I.P Abe-san
RIP. The world is going crazy.
"There is so much trouble in the world. The way how things are going, anything can happen".   Bob Marley
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 RIP
This is heartbreaking
RIP
If someone does this to Putin, Thousands lives will be saved.
I am very sad to hear that.!!!
Saddened by this shocking news🥲RIP 🙏❤️
Oh My Goodness.  Shinzo Abe is so kind person!.  May god guide his soul.  Rest In Peace PM Abe!
It may be the plot of assisination of Chinese government to kill the best leader of japan
Wtf... is this. I lived in japan and Shinzo helped a lot!
銃規制の問題だけじゃないんだよ 犯人は銃を手作りした。 全世界、不平不満、誹謗中傷をやめて感謝の心を持とう！
阿部元首相のご冥福を心よりお祈り申し上げます。He was a great existence for Japan. May his soul rest in peace.
His security was so lax to be honest. Japan has become so comfortable with it’s low crime rate but all it took was one psychopath.
Why did he?
Anybody else getting 1930s flashbacks?
He was a well-known politician in many ways. Some people disliked him because of his political beliefs and corruption cases. I am surprised that such an incident occurred in Japan, which has strict gun control, but I have no further feelings.
World at war
what??????????
本当に悲しい。 もっと警備がしっかりとしていれば未然に防げていたはず。 ご冥福をお祈りします。
Rest in peace..PM Shinzo Abe.
Rest in peace po sir Shinzo Abe. You will always be remembered. 🌠
开席
Assassinated...🤔
The guy who killed former Japanese president. he has ties with US japanese sources said.
Former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe was making a strong political comeback & he was also well known not only in Japan 🇯🇵 but globally for being tough on belligerent bullying hegemonic actions of CCP China 🇨🇳 so sensing danger this could be a preemptive covert strike by CCP China, Chinese mafia Triad’s presence is very well established in Japan 🇯🇵 & the Chinese communist government using the Chinese mafia Triads to do its covert dirty deeds overseas is well established & documented, millions of Chinese netizens in mainland China 🇨🇳 is celebrating the barbaric assassination attack on former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe & even the Chinese communist government’s official mouthpiece ( Global Times ) is justifying the cowardly attack on it’s official Twitter page, absolutely barbaric disgusting 🤮 behavior of CCP China 🇨🇳…  Note : May the departed soul of the one of the greatest leader not only of Japan 🇯🇵 but of modern democratic world Rest In Peace & may his family find strength, love & peace in going through this difficult & tragic loss in their family…  📿🙏📿🙏📿🙏
It's not political violence. The killer said he killed Mr. Abe because just he didn’t like Abe's behavior.
It’s heartbreaking 💔
Why a singapore newswoman speaking in a Japanese news? Find a Japanese newswoman...
A stark reminder of the dangers facing political figures
If someone had done that to the disgusting Merkel, I'd still understand, but Abe?
Sad course of events 💔 May he RIP 🕊️  Condolences to his family 🙏🌹
Guns don't kill people...People kill people no matter how much you restrict access. This insane person would have built a bomb if they couldn't get a gun and we would be looking many many more deaths. Lets focus on finding humans with problems.
BANZAI
Shocking and sad...
I’m appreciate he that always speak out for Taiwan ,he is a really nice person to me 😭and I feel down to hear about this sad news😢 God bless to the dead🙏
that shooter is completely lunatic  why someone does not shoot xi jinping  with whom disagree entire world. i had  never heard the news of shooting in a decade in japan  . R.I.P SIR
Shooting a man in the back...... What a disturbed coward the shooter is. This news of Mr. Abe's assassination is gut wrenching and heart breaking. He was a good man and that came across on the few times the U. S. Media covered him. My condolences to his wife and family.
Never thought this will happen in Japan.
Former Japanese Prime Minister Abe provided 300 billion yen in support to welcome Ukraine to the EU and NATO as a G7 member during his tenure in 2014-2020.  The money was used to reform Ukraine's police, develop research facilities and security systems for nuclear power plants, renovate water purification plants on the Don River, and renovate theaters and cultural facilities throughout Ukraine.  May the unfortunate war be resolved as soon as possible.  Terrorism is not allowed.  I pray for the souls of the former Prime Minister.
Never thought this possible...still can't believe this...
So tragic...deep regret.. RIP Shinzo
Rest in peace to one of a great leader. This is quite heartbreaking to 😢😢
rip
ABE IS A REPRESENTING TO 21 century Adolf Adolf NAZI HILTER. HE DESIRED DEAD.
Japan has the best gun control system, and unlike the US,  this sort of things are extremely rare. This is very sad.
I like this man, so sorry for Japan's loss.. Duterte and Shinzo Abe are good friends. Duterte must be pissed..Japan, please book the assailant a flight to Davao city Philippines - he will be treated with Filipino hospitality.
Someone mistook him for Putin
Koreans will be happy to know the news.
Homemade gun
US-ophobia in Japan , very sad news, my condolence to the family.
Our sincere condolences to the family of Mr Abe and the people of Japan from your friends in Kuwait.
Heartbreaking news. RIP
O M G , I’m so so sorry , My condolences to his family God bless his soul 🤲🤲🤲
He was a good guy.. Not like the other ( Leader ) in China, he's a bad bad person...
So sad We pry for him. Violence really hurts the prospects of mankind.
Should have been putin
The guy who killed former Japanese president .he has ties with US japanese sources said.
Let's see ... pals with Putin, militaristic,  nationalistic, "frosty" toward Korea and China, two countries Japan brutally attacked, subjugated, and forced to endure more atrocities, inflicted by the Empire of Japan, than any other, a shameless Trump flatterer who personally nominated him for a Nobel Peace prize ...  Sounds like a first class A-hole!
Why is American 🇺🇸 news still sending prayers for being in the icu.i heard the report 20 mins ago :/ rip sir.
Why?? Jesus Christ... That is, indeed, truly shocking. My condolences to his family
有難うございます。
Lmao
USA killed abe
Wasn't a Yakuza affiliated hit was it? BBC didn't specify the gunman in question RIP - Shinzo Abe ☹️ Although an international assassination order is Unlikley 🤔
😢😢😢
Is this Beijing’s fault ?!
Abe exposed the CCR and he strongly expressed his animosity towards their behavior towards their own people and other countries like Taiwan. The man was always for the people and he always prioritized the weak and vulnerable. It's a shame that he goes out this way.
so sad
Because he was a friend of Putin, intelligence agencies from the United Kingdom, Israel, France, and the United States assassinated him. Britain intended to resume having a significant international impact after leaving the European Union, but obstacles from Russia and China prevented that. Thus, in an effort to antagonize Russia, drag it into a conflict, and deplete it, these nations installed an agent in the position of president of Ukraine. The plan did not succeed, and the world is extremely grateful for Russia's and China's perseverance since it can no longer put up with Western foolishness.  they afraid that all Asia might United. but they will.
Sound like something the CCP  would be involved  in
Rip
You sure ?? Shinzu dies ??
This has China written all over it. Abe spoke out about increasing military and even defending Taiwan in case of an invasion
Homemade gun? Like a pipe with gunpowder?
Here we go . With Ukraine War , Global chess has started and pieces are being  moved and removed.
chinese hitman
That's so awful... My condolences to the beautiful people of Japan... =(
😭😭😭 Om Shanti 😭😭😭  🇮🇷❤🇯🇵
it is a tragedy that he is killed. His family has had political power for over hundreds of years including WW2. The end of a dictator disguised as a democratically elected PM in a controlled society.
In such shock here 😪😪😪😪😪
Remembering PM Abe from India 🇮🇳 may his soul rest in peace 🙏
What a great loss, RIP
Is this China or Russia trying to destabilise the region?
R.I.P🇯🇵
Very sorry to hear this
This is really sad and shocking.  Here in Japan, gun violence is extremely rare so hearing of an assassination, especially of man who served as the countries leader,  is leaving a lot of people in disbelief.  I can't believe it either.  RIP 安倍晋三...
😭 so heartbreaking
RIP a great leader and a great friend of India.  Respect from  🇮🇳 .
Very sad . A very tragic passing. Never figured this would occur in Japan. Such a quiet country. May he find rest in peace . Thoughts and prayers for his friends and family.
There was a deep resentment in the heart of the shooter All these yrs the Japanese shown normality in their lives But suddenly hell is revealing Boris Johnson has been ousted Morrison has been down recently Joe Biden fate is on the brink too Do you believe it will happen guys
死得好👌🏻
"Divisive"?
THE US KILLED, THIS IS CIA DOING.
Biden is responsible for this. Fak west.
R.I.P
Shocking death of former prime minister of Japan shenze Abe. condolence with the  nation of Japan and their family who deprived from great sympathetic leader.RIP. We are with the Japanese people in this hour of sorrow. May Allah grant patience to the Japanese people.
Western imperialists puppet taken down by China or Russia? Mmmmmm….
This is awful where was their version of secret service? Blessings for his family. Texans are with you.
the chinese conspiracy rings loud around his death. its time the world unites against sino terror
anybody getting shot in the back and dying is an act of brutality....sad for this guy....
This is crazy! In Japan!!! 😱
What the hell
The last place on earth you would expect this, my sincerest condolences.
😳
Should have happened to Kim jong un, not this guy 😭😭😭
Very Sad to hear this. He was a true friend of India! 😢
It seems a political assassination, shot in the back no less and during a speech.   The Japanese don't really go for random gun violence.  I guess whatever he wanted, someone else didn't.
HIs face was clearly corrupted.
What goes around comes around🙏🏻
I thought it was a sniper, but it seems not the case. How was the gun man able to go near to Shinzo Abe? Were there no security check and police/ bodyguard around him?
Why delete my comment? Japan is still a pedo country.
Wow! When was the last time something like this happened in a democratic country? I can't think of anything since the USA president was killed.
Condolences from India 🇮🇳 🇯🇵🙏🙏
Very sad to see. Another example of criminals not following gun laws.
His Western policy became his doom  He had forgotten that he was Asian and a Japanese
Well I can't say I know a thing about Japanese politics, but this is awful to hear about. Seems he was a well respected and influential man so this is going to affect a lot of people.   What is this world coming to eh...🤦🏻
What could be the reason? He was no longer even the PM.
Vale 🌻…  dreadful 😢
Terror is not accepted but he has made Japan worse and worse. Sad for himself and his family, bright side for Japanese people though. I don't think he ruled his country for the people. RIP
Deepest sympathies to the family of Mr. Abe and the people of Japan.
You sure about that? We, now just heard that he's still alive and the news is ahead of their time announcing this.
Xin Jinping is smiling.
Sad🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
To be honest, didn’t know him until now so rip 🪦
omg.... seems like a nice guy
That's really horrible
He was always committed to his work  100% throughout his term even though some of them was controversial.  I am very sad as a Japanese who has seen his commitment and hard work for over a decade. Pray that such sad thing will never happen again in this country.
I am shocked
They're copying on the US
Abe must of had info on the Biden crime family
Either it was china or someone in the CIA is doing the good ole out with the old in with the new
Damn shame for this to happen to such a fine gentleman, I remember even during the beginning of the pandemic he was hopeful telling folks it's ok thing's will get better. Rest in peace Shinzo Abe san my prayers and condolences to his family he was a true man for his country and people.
CONDOLENCE TO THE WHOLE FAMILY
This is very sad he was loved by the people. My friend from Japan says they are in shock, he passed away at 5:30pm Japanese time.
RIP⚰️
Shocking News i realy liked this guy
After being shot at??? I believe we call that an ASSASSINATION in English.
Just when rearmament issue has been raised.
Aww tragedy the world has a black hand behind our eyes and goverments
Rip sir....So sad
Woah, an assisnation of political leaders in Japan. That's rare.
Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe.. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
My condolences to his family and the people of  🇯🇵 🕯
I can't believe this happened in Japan and to Shinzo Abe because he was one of the good guys, why wasn't he wearing a bulletproof vest is beyond me especially how shootings and killings have escalated.RIP 🇯🇵
heartfelt condolences.. 🇯🇵
While many may sing praises of how Abe was such a great leader, the undeniable fact is that he was just another puppet of the U.S, like all Prime Minister before and after him. Now, can a leader without any backbone and the courage to decide its own foreign policies be labelled as great? Why kind of leader takes orders from foreign powers?
Why?
The World has gone mad.
Why can this be putin instead
Does anyone know the motive for the killing?
Rip 🪦
Hopefully someone gets
Boris is lucky
2020s is already absolutely crazy
RIP Abe
Those must be some major disagreements about "policy" for the suspect to sacrifice his life. Something like going to war or building/closing many power stations. I get a feeling that we don't get to hear the true motivations of any of the gun persons in this case and in America.
3:22 What...Abe wasn't like "friend" of Putin, Abe was a diplomat and constantly want to settle the issue of Kuril Islands dispute with Russia. Also after invasion of Ukraine that Abe suggested that US can set up nukes in Japan as to defend any possible invasions. He wasn't "divisive" because he was actually a moderate that rarely willing to take a hard stand on some international issues. He wanted to settle most of issues through less aggressive means.
ABE betrayed Japanes and Japan and he did like USA pupet. Japan is suffering and Japan will not suffer for USA anymore. Japanese will raise and destory the evil of USA!!!! USA make divided Our Asians country and touture. Japanse are not dog of USA Americans. The leader who betrayed their citizen must die!
I remember his face from when he met up with the orange president .. he seemed to be a very nice man.. RIP
Couldn't believe things like this happened in Japan. Rest In Peace Legend PM Shinzo Abe
Wow!
RIP to a great leader of the world's most loved country Japan. My condolence to the people of Japan. 🥀
OMG 😔 😲 😱 😥🇯🇵
He was one of the good guys
😵 what is happening
Why oh why can't this happen in the US.
.. .meh JOHN na mabait din to cguro.. .taz ung bumaril, meron nag-uutos sa mouth, sa ears, sa tounge or hostage din ung ng-utos na barilin c PM Abe kc ganyan ung gusto gawin d2 sken eh.. .meh nag-uutos sa kanila.. .
So he was shot in back? Sad RIP
Russia and China is behind this. World war 3 is coming. Brace yourselves.
Western puppet is finally eliminated, good job for the japanese people
RIP Shinzo Abe
ஒரு தலைசிறந்த ஆட்சியாலரை இழந்து விட்டது ஜப்பான் நாடு 😔😔😔
JAPAN claimed to have the same value as the US that means also the increased popularity of gun shooting. Japan is catching up.
😭😭😭😭
I read that the perpetrator had a homemade gun??? Clearly this person had the will and went to an extreme to find the way. That kind of evil determination is virtually impossible to stop. It's a sad day for obviously his family, Japan and the world.
Oh look. Gun control fail in Japan.
Red and Yellow Color Codes TieNess Add a comment
Gun control laws don't work.
why does BBC mark Nara at Kobe's location?
Yes, condolences to his family. The thing is if you train a man to shoot (suspect being a former navy guy) more likely that he will use his skill to do something else that is not proper. It’s like people in America who have so many guns to “protect” themselves, but it turns out that they and their families are more likely to die from suicide or accidental shootings than from any actual intruder.
I just want to here facts lady. Time, place, type of gun, shooter’s name, motive, that’s it. Spare me your opinion, thank you.
this is what happens if you are a former WEF member who speaks against the narrative
R.I.P. 🙏 India lost a great friend today🇮🇳❤️🇯🇵
He'd been to our former Philippine president Rodrigo Roa Duterte's home here in Davao City,we like him so much,loved him now & will not be forgotten 😢
Chinese pay for  shoot him
RIP Sir🙏
Shocking
Please not detain the man as  Russians are required like this person immediately
Disgusting!!
But why, though?
Should be BoJo who receive this fate, not Abe....
Shocking
All of you SHINZO WO SASAGEYO!!   May you Rest in Peace Sir.
How corrupt was he ??? When are they going for Biden 😂 Normalize killing corrupt politicians 💯❤️
Shinzo Abe was killed, which indicates that anyone visible can be killed in Japan. The police may attribute the failure for lack of resources or money, which can not be fixed in short term; the risk for such violence can stay for foreseeable future. It is irony that Abe who promoted violence by the government was killed by gun violence. It is called "因果応報".
日本は平和だったはずだが、この出来事で世界から平和だと思われなくなるかもしれないことが悲しい
I can't believe we lost such an important person in the society this is such a cowardly act! May he rest in peace.
Guns are rare in Japan even for police
Political violence has a long history in Japan, esp. assassination.
I'm so upset
A samurai never dies
OMG! This is horrible! He always wanted to just protect his country from China. So 😔.
And to the people of The U.K., as Boris has just resigned, whether you like him or loathe him he has young children and NO democratic leader deserves to be shot just because you don't agree with them........People need to save their opinions for the ballot box and that's it.
ده ارهابى يابانى مش صح كده يا متعلمين يابتوع المدارس ولا الارهاب ماركه مسجله لناس وناس ربنا ياخدك يا بلحه
Japan big friend of Italy. Deepest condolence
Who cares
People forget, Japan is STILL property of the United States as long as China & North Korea are prominent forces in the Asian continent.
The attack on Abe is disgusting. Part of that feeling is that now he will become a hero. We have to remember that this is the guy, more than anyone, who has tried to destroy the Constitution and make Japan into an aggressive state again and who has militarized the society and schools. He was corrupt and faced no punishment for it.  He still had enormous power and used it to attack the Constitution and the current PM's anti-nuclear stance. His grandfather Kishi was a war criminal literally plucked from prison by the Americans to run Japan. This is why Abe became so powerful. Abe's goals were similar to his grandfather's. However, of course, there is no excuse for this attack in a democracy. The irony is it looks like an ex-military guy.
Omg condolece for the best Pm..
We Bangladeshis are very saddened by the death of Shinzo abe.He was the best friend of Bangladesh.😥😥😥
the new world order, the juice wins yet again. don't trust me? research them yourself, you can thank me in the hereafter where its all will be shown to us all so clear you will have no reasons at all to deny the truth.
Crazy people living in the world today...... very sad
Most likely it was Huilo- Putin revenge for the failed agreements between Russia and Japan in 2020 on a peace agreement!  Putin's revenge for Abe's failure!  ☝️
Rest in peace great leader of Japan 😢
🙏🙏🙏
condolence
Should have been Putin.
International investigation should take place.
The shooter might start saying goodbye as well cause this will certainly be a call for the death penalty.
I can’t believe. Rip sir 🙏🙏🙏.
I was saddened by the news. Rest in Paradise Sir Shinzo Abe
Really shocking, I am basically in Japan for my graduate studies because he advocated for ABE Initiative ( African Business Education) scholarship program. It is really sad for a man of honor to die in such a wicked manner.
Really heart breaking 😔😔😔🙏🙏🙏
My deepest condolences to his family and friends
how is it trudeau and biden are still alive
why this doesn't happen to Putin in Russia? will not be bad news then...
Backed by China?
Would the Chinese have anything to do with that?
This is the second political assassination I’ve seen that came from japan, i remember a video about some other political that got hit with a katana a long time ago
RIP
Crazy, they have zero guns over there.
The reporter trying to pin this to the  Chinese is part of the media war, China has not been an offensive country in other than technological advances their military is way small compared to the US.
WTF man
The Prime Minister i will remember 🙏🙏🙏
Let's set things straight. Abe was not an uncontroversial figure. Personally, I have always, strongly disapproved of his right wing nationalistic rhetoric, strongly militaristic policies, numerous denials of Japanese war crimes, and countless visits to shrines that honor men who murder-raped little girls and tore the eyes out of alive children's skulls. Political assassinations are very rare in Japan, but when you have that kind of personal history, it is not that surprising that someone would try to take your life. Even so, the man was a law abiding citizen with a family and a loving wife. As much as I disagree with many of his policies and views, I strongly feel that the man, overall, did what he thought was best for his country. No one deserves to get shot like that followed by hours of stress, excruciating pain, and a needless death.  R.I.P. Abe Shinzou.  (Some of you may think my comment is unnecessarily cruel or insensitive, but I think it is important to be candid about these things at times like this. Everyone has bad and good sides, and you need to remember the good with the bad.)
涙は出ていないけど、自分が思った以上に悲しいです。ほんと辛い
Guess this is what happens when one pushes and promotes a propagandarised 'war'.
Sad sad sad world 😢🌍
I haven't really followed Japanese politics, but regardless of that, my deep condolences.
It’s so heartbreaking I can’t believe it it’s that happen in Japan
how can someone assassinate such a polite political leader who made every right choice for the people of Japan 🇯🇵 my condolences are to his family and friends
Condolences to Japan Ex PM shocking news
The way Abe was attacked is not unusual, even though gun violence involving average people is rare. In 1990 Nagasaki Mayor Motoshima was shot in the back. His successor was also shot twice in the back but did not survive. Both attacks were connected to right-wing/yakuza. Let's see if Abe's killer is one of these types. In late 1988 during his third mayoral term, news that the Shōwa Emperor was gravely ill and not expected to live long had put Japan into a somber mood. On December 7 Motoshima was asked in a city council meeting by a council member from the Communist Party his opinion of the Emperor's responsibility for World War II. He answered: Forty-three years have passed since the end of the war, and I think we have had enough chance to reflect on the nature of the war. From reading various accounts from abroad and having been a soldier myself, involved in military education, I do believe that the emperor bore responsibility for the war... — (Buruma 1994:249) The Liberal Democratic Party Prefectural Committee immediately demanded that he retract the statement, but Motoshima rejected the demand, saying he could not betray his conscience. In response, the Party Prefectural Committee removed him from the post of committee advisor, and many conservative organizations vilified the mayor. Furthermore, many extreme right-wing groups converged on Nagasaki and demonstrated in the streets with more than eighty speaker trucks calling out for divine retribution upon the mayor. On January 18, 1990, when police had relaxed their guard on the mayor, a member of the right-wing group Seikijuku shot Motoshima in the back, but he survived the assassination attempt.
NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Rest In Peace ☮️🥲
RIP. Unbelievable! Why would someone want to do this? 🙏🕊🙏🕊🙏🕊
I feel shocked and very sad about his passing away. My deepest sympathy to Mr Abe’s family😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
🙏 Rest in peace 🌹
OMG this is terrible...
Man did say that killing Whales was a "cultural right", not that this justifies in any way what took place. I hope his family heals.
I'm sad
Greatest news for mankind
This is a tragic loss for the Japanese people and their friends around the world. Violence and murder are not legitimate solutions to political disagreements between a countries citizens. 🇨🇦
Very sad,shinzo abe is good leader.its seems china moving now to eliminate people against them.
Very shocking for us as Japanese  He is the longest serving Prime Minister since WW2 and still a popular politician in Japan  This should never happen. Our country is proud of its security and the Japanese people are proud of their security  How could this have happened... He is like a father to us Japanese I am so sad I am crying
Terrible
Killing our heros. Sad sad sad.
Didn't see that coming, expected something like that to happen in North Korea or Russia.
Nationalists have no place in this world, good on the gunman
RIP Great leader of Japan
😢
My condolences to the family
Unbelievable. Japan should ban guns. Wait a minute they already have. Having said that I have a lot of respect for this man. He was a fantastic prime minister from what I know. May he rest in peace and his family not suffer too much.
This is devastating. I'm so shocked. I liked him more than my own country's president. R.I.P Abe 💔😩
This is an unfortunate tragedy :( my deepest sympathy to his family R.I.P 😣
How come the comment section is open today? But normally closed off?! Cowards!!
This is so sad, our deepest condolences to the family. What a coward his killer is.
So sad. I love this guy. Strong leader. Chynaman probably has their evil hands in it. RIP
They wanted more weapons in the streets and this is what you get
Horrifying! I lived in Japan for seven years. Japan is one of the safest countries in the world with almost zero gun violence.  I am sickened by this news. As an American, it makes me feel like America's violent gun culture is spreading all over the world.
The world is truly fucked when there's a shooting in Japan
I am asking myself, what is wrong with more and more people on this planet!? Shooting a politician, because the assassin just didn't like that politician, shootings on streets, shootings at schools. And Vladimir is killing thousands, because he doesn't like democracy!? WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD???  My condolences to his family and all people of Japan
It must have been a yakuza hit.
Condolence to the family of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe💔💔💔
This sounds like a set up. Something  had been cooked up here. Farewell Shinzo... 🇿🇦
Rest in peace 🖤🖤🖤
I though japanese security were super high and mighty All it takes was a one random guy with a homemade shotgun RIP
The new Yakuza game looks great. Can't wait to see who we get to play as this time.
Rip🙏
Slava Russia 🇷🇺....Death to all enemies of Russia 🇷🇺.
RIP ⚘️
This is sadder than all sad. This was one of the GOOD GUYS. But like the screwballs in so many other countries, if they don't like what they have, they will either assassinate, abort, gun down, or murder. They need to put these people in a lockdown facility for the rest of their lives!
Can think of a few globalists that deserve this treatment!
America inside trade hairy carry USA excuse invade Asian ocean trade flow. C. H. I. N. A.      Target Biden dollar world war
Noo this is sad 🤦‍♂️
He was a good man.
I believe that's commonly referred to an assassination...😑
Why was he shot? I'm sure it's a lot deeper than what's portrayed. I mean, think about it. Japan is one of the world's safest countries. Someone went through a lot to get a gun to assassinate an ex-prime minister(guns are illegal). Why did they shoot him in daylight and in front of cameras and people? Did Abe know that someone was out for him? Why now? Did he do something worth being shot over? I have so many questions.
Rest in peace Abe sama and Condolence to the whole family.
He might still be powerful, but he has already stepped down as the prime minister.   Sad that a servant of the public get gunned down in public in one of the safest countries in the world.
Why are leaders exalting killings? The same people you are killings also have families to take care of like you have. Why are we allowing the seed of murder to dwell in our hearts??
I can’ t understand why the security agents let the stranger get closed to Mr Abe? Mr Anbe made great contribution to the development of Japan. RIP Mr Abe.
好④，这下去面见肯尼迪了🎊🎊🎊
I'm sorry for him, his family and Japan.
Rest in peace Prime Minister Shinzo Abe! Condelence to his berave Family!! History of shooting  like ex Pres. John Kennedy! Maybe some of  the envy enemies caused Killling of him!   Consider his a Patriotic leader!
Shinzo Abe, a former Japanese prime minister who supported World War II war criminals. During his tenure as prime minister, he has been visiting the Yasukuni Shrine dedicated to Japanese war criminals. Seriously hurt the feelings of Asian people. I have no sympathy for such a person.
Why are leaders exalting killings? The same people you are killings also have families to take care of like you have. Why are we allowing the seed of murder to dwell in our hearts??
As a Japanese I still can't believe that this is happening, and I'm in a deep shock. I've never imagined that an incident like this could ever happen in this country...  RIP Mr. Abe🙏🏻
Poor guy extremely sad and heartbreaking. Condolences to his family 😭😭
When I listen to the BBC I listen with skepticism for they are renowned throughout the world for being a bunch of liars.
are you    what the hell      oh well japan is fucked
I felt sad until I heard he was friendly with Putin.
Never heard of assassination in Japan until now...my condolences to his family...
Ukranian NeoNazi ideology has been transported to Japan 🇯🇵. So sad.
Oh Nooooo what Sad News 😔 to wake up here in the USA!!!... Such an Educated Humbled Man!!!!... Why? Why? Why?...in Japan!!!!????? So weird..  May He R.I.P.  🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
😢 he has served well and was trusted Japan
This is heartbreaking. I'm really sorry for his loss since I've met his wife before in the public event.
This is so sad. I didn't think Japan has political hits .
This is the New World of doing things crazy world to live in
Too bad what's not rare, is threatening a nuclear country, putting military bases around its border and supporting a country that has neo-Nazi nationalist who refused to honor the Minsk agreements and killed 14,000 Russian speaking Ukrainians since 2014.
You don't kill people just because you have grudge 🥲
Rest in peace ,
This is a shocking. May his soul Rest In Peace.
The world is diving into darkness just like in the 20th century .History is repeating itself.
My deepest condolences.  Sorry.
Rest in peace
WEF member??? if so, i have no tears.... if he was a nationalist my heart bleeds for your loss japan
This is very shocking to happen in Japan.
R.I.P
:((
i disagree with many things but don`t go out and destroy them. this is so wrong. the world we live in today is in serious trouble.
Republicans really needs to step up to the gun lobby.
Shock and broken💔... RIP Mr. Abe
*when politicians think they are untouchable and conduct themselves in a criminal manner........
we are so sorry for that
Another Asian nations in political mess created by themselves. Killing is not going to change anything he was political figure  it will change nothing.
Seems to me lately, a lot of world leaders are being taken down...
The world is on fire🔥🔥🔥. Domestic terrorism has come to Japan. In the days to come, I'd like to know if the assailant acted on his own or has ties to any opposition groups. R.I.P.
Very strange for this to happen in Japan. This happened so fast.
Another American congract fullfield
ご冥福をお祈りします。
China?
Is CIA behind the assassination?
RIP Shinzo Abe, cant believe this could happen in Japan
One of the beloved political leader around the world. Great loss to peace loving people
wouldn't that be called murder then not died?
He was caught lacking by a Conservative who doesnt like change.
Japan needs to stop letting foreigners in their country
Great news, burn in hell !
This is just as bad as the John F. Kennedy Assassination of 1963, but it’s in modern times.
I was so shocked when I heard the news. We Japanese never forgive the assassin. It’s crisis of Japanese democracy.
Sad!
Heartbroken 🇿🇲.
this shouldve happened alot sooner though
If politicians are being killed, then clearly they are doing something people don't like. Nobody here thinks politicians are pure people. So why should we care how shocked they are or what happens to them.
"Abe was *a conservative whom political commentators widely described as a right-wing Japanese nationalist.* He was a member of Nippon Kaigi and held negationist views on Japanese history, including denying the role of government coercion in the recruitment of comfort women during World War II, a position which created tension with neighboring South Korea."  -- Wikipedia
You Know it's political when MsM ain't covering It much
It’s shocking this happened in Japan of this happened in usa or uk that’s okay because they are dangerous countries to live
Respect for Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe! May he rest in peace. 🙏❤😞
I didn't see this coming......
One of the few world politicians that the majority of the world liked and respected. R.I.P.
💔🙏😢 RIP
He was just doing his job
I’m in shock!  But as the world has become. I don’t know how  to believe in human hope anymore.  My condolences to his family and Japan.
Trudeau next please!!
Home made gun, home made black powder, home made electrical ignitor/trigger. Media: "let's ban guns!"   idiots.
longest serving prime minister
Look you can’t treat people like they do and get away with it !!!! How many people has this man starved an took everything from the people… god bless
My sincerest condolences to the family and to Japan.  He may rest in peace 😢 . -from philippines 🇵🇭
It’s about time
What the hell is happening in the world?
Unexpected death due to assassination. 😧
Rip to a great leader
Thank you for always supporting our country, PM Abe. You will be missed.
In a country where guns are banned!!! How could this happen!! Watch and learn you Democrats wanting to ban guns!!! It doesn’t work!!!
This man built the gun he used to fatally shot the ex. Minister of Japan, he could have used a different weapon. The entire world is devastated over so much violence. Peace is love 💖
Very sad. RIP dear soul  💐💐💐
somebody paid the shooter... someone who is fond of killing leaders to put a puppet leader
Abe was shot in nara western japan...lets talk to another asian chick in singapore....
Condolences to his loved ones. This is sad💗
I gasped in shock. 😲😱 Rest in Peace. He's the only prime minister that I know from Japan. I don't even know who's the current.
Damn son , if this was done by foreign forces like maybe north korea or china or russia  , its bad , but if this was done by another japanese political party , this is messed up , Shinzo got straight up assasinated.
This is heart breaking news ..He was truly a great leader..RIP SIr..
Awwww so sad. I guess now we should just all feel bad for the country that secretly desires to be in control of the world. We should feel bad for a country hellbent on destroying the environment. We should all feel their despair and let them open all of their nuclear facilities because let's not forget, it's hot their..... And they are in pain..... Hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is good news!
See you space cowboy...
Incomprehensible
This sort of atrocity hasn't been a feature of Japanese politics since the bad old days of the 1930s.
Dear Kinoko Nasu, please DO NOT make Tetsuya Yamagami join the Throne of Heroes and place him in the Assassin class container! At least Charlotte Corday had a valid reason. This man killed out of brutality rather than a noble cause.
Ok don’t say violence does not happen in Japan it does instead of shootings they have mass stabbings and this is prim reason why you don’t give up your guns criminals don’t pay attention to laws
Your tagline and description say "shot at" - implies he wasn't actually shot .....
My deepest condolences  to his family .
R.I.P. 🙏🙏🙏
*Rest in Peace.. Condolences 😔*
The fact that a second shot was made from behind showed how unprepared his security detail was. To be fair, nothing like this has ever happened before, so they probably didn't expect something like this could happen. Tactically, he was impossible to defend. He was in the middle of a road with sparse traffic with plenty of angle from which a shooter can do the deed.
Guessing who ever wanted Abe dead gave his assassin all the info he needed
Your correspondent is thousands of miles away from the event. No one closer?
Guns make politics more fun brotha
This is so sad 😭😭
Rest in peace Shinzo Abe and may god bless his soul.  🕊️🇯🇵🥀🥺😢😭😿
YEEEEES!!! HE IS DIIIIIEEEEEEE!!!! 🤲✨️
Omg! 😱😱🙏🏾
Holy crap, this is American cultural appropriation.
Gun control moment
This is what happens when a leader is in office for too damn long ,. Term limits for all public works , especially political departments and Police departments too
The security was so poor there. A man casually comes up and shots, misses first and then shots again. The security parameter was also very questionable. There should be a strict investigation. Surely, some people in high position needs to be put behind bars.
All the virtue signaling in every comment section makes me sick
May God have mercy
Seems like the stage is getting prepared for something big  Hopefully I am wrong
RIP🙏
Sir, may you rest in peace and be remembered with great respect!  He was my all-time favourite president. Despite the fact that I am not Japanese. Love and respect from Ethiopia 👑🟩🟨🟥👑🟢🟡🔴🌾🌷🌻🌺🥀🌸🌹💐☘️🍀🌿🌺💐🌹
Who could be behind his killing,,?when every Japanese Love him.
Pvtins kidnap, rape and murder of any people his gang attacks... W private mercs of many toxic male faiths...that?
Where is bodyguards?
Who could be behind his killing,,?when every Japanese Love him.
RIP! One by one, US allies is falling! Humpty dumpty falls from the wall....!  Henry Kissinger once quipped that "it may be dangerous to be America's enemy, but to be America's friend is fatal."  He is so right! Who is next?
शिंजो  एक दिग्गज नेता थे  भगवान उनकी आत्मा को शान्ति प्रदान करे
Liking this video just didn’t feel right..
what is really the motivation behind shooting him if we was no longer in office?
The ccp must be behind this
Assignation is what it is called ffs 🤦‍♀️
In Mr.abe instargram there is a lot of Chinese word right? Those are not from Taiwan. Those are from China. Those are China little pink. Please understand that some of those China little pink use Taiwan flag to disrespect make the friendship weaker between Japan and Taiwan. Hope you guys. can understand it Thank you.
It's a great news I heard since Russian invasion, he deserved to be killed for backing a nation that bombed and killed millions of Innocent Japanese people.
What the fuck
Why was Abe assassinated?
Assassination of Shinzo Abe very regrettable
Shocking!  The problem in a country with strict gun control laws is that everyone is defenceless when faced by a rogue with a gun.
Terrible news
As a Japanese citizen, I`m very astonished at former Prime Minister Abe`s death. Japanese people are very proud of low crime rate in Japan, but our confidence is smashed completely by this assissanation. Day dater tomorrow is an election day for Japan`s Upper House, and I would like to cast a ballot for a candiate who would make efforts to prevent crimes.
So sad! He had good governance in his time. 😔
:(
Japanese police sucks
Wow. This is crazy.
Great respect for the leader of Japan  He was a pioneering figure at the world stage.  It’s very shocking to see him go this way.  In Japan the land of Shinto and Buddha It’s very heartbreaking to see this.  May his soul rest in peace 💐
RIP  安らかに
Wow ! He was a kind hearted man 🥹
I feel for Japan and his family. Love to his family from nz
Im not a Japanese citizens but this is shocking. How he lost his life like this ...its shocking...
Sad😞 RIP 🙏
Controversial diplomatic policy???
Love from Pakistan.
As Japan is a safe country,the security is not as tight. The suspect seems not to have any political reason to attack and he just made guns by himself... 本当に残念です
A war crime apologist. History has been made today for all the right things
Heartbreaking news 🥹😭
Evil knows how to skirt the rules and attack the innocent. Gun violence is rare, but knife violence has been common. I lived there for 25 years and Evil stuck its ugly head out a number of times per year.
* more condoms, rights of LGBT, ganja.. EVs. Might help.. Japanese 🌎👍😎✌️🧠⚖️🕵️‍♂️📰🌍🌴🌄
I'm assuming most of the people writing r.i.p don't know anything about the dude and are just trying to look like decent people through a YouTube comment.
Japanese they should wake up and be also physically tougher as mentally and intellectually which they are already you can see that Japan don’t have a proper national army Donald Trump then president of USA he warned them about that and I send my condolences to his family and to all Japanese people 🙏🏽
Very suspicious 😮  he openly supported peace in Ukraine and critisized West
Damn I liked that dude too! RIP!
A homemade gun in top of that... a toy then
Act of brutality??? Its an act of terrorism funny how we don't use this phrase for it huh
Stay in our hearts. Forever 💔
Sounds like a political assassin
ShinzoAbe is loved by all Asean country.
Condolence to the Family & to the People of Japan🇯🇵🙏🏻😞😞😞
R.I.P. to such a great statesman and my condolences to his family and friends!
Japanese politicians jills Japanese workers by overwork so yeah it was neded putin no good and it's lover no good too...
Wow.
Totally unexpected!
All His bodyguards and security should pay and spend the rest of their life in jail
I'm waiting for the American NRA to try and twist this somehow.
why from Singapore
Asking their anchor from Singapore instead of Japan. 🙄
I support Boris Johnson, he is the best politician in the history of the United Kingdom, his statesmanship, diplomatic ability, personal charisma...... It all made me support him even more. I love you! Prime minister!
Imagine getting a correspondent from Bahamas to talk about US...
Condolences from Sweden 🇸🇪 Rest in peace legend
So heartbreaking for  Japan   our condolences to both Shinzo Abe his family and Japanese nation...🇯🇵🛐🇺🇲
r.i.p.
Rest in peace Mr. Shinzo Abe🙏
so sorry to listen such a news for Japan. heartfelt Condolence
Condolences from the bottom of my heart for such a calm and influential person.
very sad and unfortunate. Japan is not known for violence..it's shocking...
A good man. Let's all pray for his family during their lose.
i am shocked     just hear former PM is shot and now he is dead    condolences from Pakistan        for me anybody die like this is a hero     RIP Abe
I was talking with a friend and We think it might be an inside job from elite. Former PM Shinzo Abe was against Digital ID and I've heard Japan don't want the Great Reset NWO
My condolences to his Family. RIP Shinzo Abe.
Humans prove over and over again how gross they are.
Sorry 😐
F
Damn Zou 😂😂
RIP 🇱🇰
I saw the local news here in Japan when the story first broke and I'm still in shock, can't believe this happened here!
RIP 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
There's no way... Rest in power 😔
😢😢😢😢😢 SAD
What is happening to this world
如果安培因为自己的政治主张被刺，那这绝非正义，也非英勇，只是懦夫的泄愤。
Very sad news, I prayer for Shinzo Abe sir, He was a good man and a believeable friend of Bangldesh.
😭
So sad for the people of Japan. This is terrible news.
I can’t say anything too shock ... regardless of political briefs ,murders must not be legitimated
Unbelievable.
RIP. Shocking, in Japan! So sad.
That’s so heart breaking
This reminds me of former president Abraham Lincoln’s death
Oh God, this news shocked me, Shinzo Abe is one of my favorite prime minister, He behaves very well with everyone, really a heartbreaking tragedy, RIP for Him😔🙏🏻
Good died！
I still can’t believe that such horrible incident happened here in Japan.  What is going on……
japan has 13 strict steps to require  a gun.. HOWW :(
Hoo boy if you could only see the reaction by Chinese nationalists
Rip love from india⚰❤🇮🇳
All countries can prepare for similar events. When unfair "lockdowns" are continued, people's livelihoods are destroyed and individual freedom of movement is restricted, and the constantly decreasing standard of living and crises, which are the cause and intentional harm caused by our own governments.
The world has gone haywire .... what the shit!?
more proof that gun control doesn't work
Very shocking indeed. Dark time we are in RiP.
very sad incident as japanese
From the comments, it might appear that he was an uncontroversial, universally liked character. I don't believe this was the reality at all. Having said that, I would never wish him dead.
This is terrible news. To my understanding he was a much respected and much loved man, with moderate positions while serving a liberal democracy. He was perhaps the most influential leader of Japan since the end of WW2. While the report claims "the left" didn't like his policies, their interpretation of left/right politics is vastly different to what you might see in a fanatical country like the USA. Even "conservatives" in much of the modern world still understand the importance of liberal freedoms, science, medicine, public health and education etc. A Conservative in Japan isn't very dissimilar to a Liberal in Canada. No doubt we'll learn more in the coming days and weeks, but obviously political violence is extremely rare in Japan. This is why my instinct is to consider that this might be a mental health issue. Mental health services in Japan are considerably lacking, there's a preference to ignore such issues and very little funding is provided. It's considered "shameful" for someone to experience mental health concerns and this leads to very high suicide rates. It's speculation, of course, but in a country like Japan it's incredibly unlikely that this was political extremism, unless it was facilitated from outside the country. I hope they get to the truth soon. May he rest in peace.
Very sad to hear the news, my deepest condolence and prayer to his family and the country. Rest in peae
That  is   disgusting  there    was    no  harm   in   this  man.
why kill people???  just use banners or cards to voice out!!!!! 👹👹👹👹Lots of evil men  around the world!!!
Rest In Peace 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😇😇😇
安倍は偉大だった 静かに眠れ
Rip😥
this is heart breaking, he was a good guy
How can this be ? Japan has no guns !
That's what you get for trying to make a pacifist country go back to militarisation again. Clearly someone was not happy and decided you should "retire" earlier.
Wtf this era is fcked up
Rest in peace ☮️🙏
This world is becoming more dirt.
The BBC still refuses to report on what is happening to the poor citizens of China. The central banks have ousted Boris Johnson and now killed the pm of Japan for supporting the XRP standard. Learn more than you're taught or you can only ever be a slave,  black or white.  Stay free ✌
RIP 🌹💐
My condolences to the Japanese family and of course, the friends and family of PM Abe,  this is indeed shocking and unbelievable. I know that he or his policies may not be perfect for some of his countrymen but he is a great loss to Japan esp that he embodies a great and incorruptible leader compared to our leaders in the Philippines. A lot of Filipinos respect PM Abe esp that he is a  great and respectable leader I have many Japanese friends being that I used to be an ESL instructor for many years resulting to me having lots of Japanese friends, and not only they're some of the cutest, but they're also some of the most polite even if sometimes it's just frontal but generally they're nice and great people. Thoughts and prayers to Japan and PM Abe's friends and family, of course to PM Abe as well.
No Violence in Japan lmfao
omg
What in the world is going on? 😳  this is beyond believe. Japan is safe nation and this is shocking
Now, there has been a lot of cheering and celebratory speeches on the Internet in China.
Japan is a peaceful country, Who is importing these evil acts?.
What a shame. Violence is gripping the whole world. These people are found to be the most peaceful. Rest in Power #shinzoAbe 🙌
Security failure..what were his security doing
Defund the BBC
You are one of the leaders I respect. This is really shocking. I can't believe how this could happen even he was no longer Japan's PM. R.I.P.
Another sad events
RIP 🙏 🪦! Hey do you wanna know what's really strange and ironic? It is illegal to own a gun in Japan but the perp crafted his own gun and shot and killed the former prime minister of Japan. The perp must've gotten some help or something cause this shits ridiculous!!!
Such a good and positive man. It's heartbreaking. RIP sir
a country with strict gun laws remeber. criminals who want to kill will find a way. STAY SAFE EVERYBODY PLS
Wake up folks ,,, This guy was a corrupt World Economic Forum and Davos 's Puppet ... The same bunch of vile guys who are stabbing you in the back big time at the moment.. Stop having blind compassion for this type of person ..
Rest in Peace PM Shinzo Abe,prayers from Philippines🇵🇭
This is not acceptable, it´s heartbreaking 😭. My condolences to Japan and to his family! Greetings from Sweden
USA: hey media, dont make a big deal of it. Japan is our ally.
Rest in mr abe
Rest In Peace.
皆さま､ありがとうございます。私たちは､とても悲しんでいます。😭⤵️⤵️
Rest in piss
My sincere condolences from the US. It’s so tragic this happened in a peaceful country where gun violence rarely happens 💔
Liberal World Order put out the hit.
Huge Shocking, RIP
That's sad
Wasnt he the longest serving PM in Japan's history? My deepest condolences to the Japanese People.
All those smartphones, yet no footage of the " shooting " .  Hmmm . . .
who gains the most from his death? the current leadership. stop falling for this time and time again.
I believe other is the country matermind of his death 100% not a japanese …
Usually u don't die from being shot at. Guessing someone shot him
Condulannce from Nepal.you are the Great soul.Rest in peace 🙏💐😭
Great leader and great soul. Love from Pakistan. We love Japan. Such a beautiful and peaceful country.
Is this sarajevo assassination again?
Very hard to believe
If you're spilling your heart over this remember he is the same guy who refuses to admit the war crimes committed against South and North Korea as well as China and many other nations with mass rapes and executions, he didn't seem to be spilling his heart out over their losses so save your tears the world didn't lose some hero.
Condolences from the US & Australia. Rest in Peace, Mr Abe...
NWO doesn't like competition or just a scapegoat. What's next? No guns allowed. Japan will become a police state like any western country because that's what elites want.
Buddha Blessings 😭😭🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏
A black op? by who? China? Russia? Who do you think? How did they know in advance that he was going to be there when it hadn't been announced?
Rip sir Abe
My Deepest And Sympathy To The Family RIP PM Shinzo Abe
My condolences.
why do I smell usa and nato in this
RIP........😔😔
RIP former PM of Japan. From 2
Please trade Marcos for Abe 🙏
I can't believe so sad

Giving me heart attack 😢
Shocking news in a Peaceful Japan  Condolences & Prayers to the Bereaved Family🙏🙏🙏

There IS violence in Japan, including in politics. It's just not physical usually.
Sincere condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Shinzo Abe. He was a great statesman and an honorable gentleman. Rest in Power, sir. 🙏🙏🙏
Deeply respect and condolences to Shinzo Abe's family RIP 😭😭😭

Rest in Paradise 🤍🤍🤍
So sad.... the World is getting sadder by the day...  RIP Shinzo Abe
You know the world has come to shit when assassination in broad daylight happens in one of the most peaceful countries in the world

Wow! RIP Shinzo Abe~
Off all the countries,  this happening in Japan....totally insane...RIP Sir

Terribly sad news.  Japan lost a great statesman and leader.   My thoughts and hopes to the Japanese people.
Georgia guide stones destroyed as well
That sucks
Rip condolences to the family
Rip. mister Abe.
Suspect was working as a JSDF soldier and a citizen of Nara city, 41 yrs old. probably he has dissatisfaction as some other japanese toward abe's policy. RIP Abe. 大ショック。
Rest in Peace sir Shinzo Abe.🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Such a tragedy. Prayers to his family and the people in Japan.
This is heartbreaking 💔 rip Mr Shinzo Abe  this is so so sad man.

I don't except this  in japan
✝️⚘R.I.P✝️⚘Condolences To The Bereaved Family And Friends✝️⚘
RIP Abe. Japan lost a widely loved and respected leader.
Unbelievable that the state do not protect past leaders. Crazy that Abe didn't have a personal security detail.
https://youtu.be/Czwbyp0a_Ow
My condolences to his family and to the Japanese nation 🙏
Rest in Peace 🇨🇳 🇨🇳
Thoughts and prayers to the Japanese people grieved by Abe sama's death. India stands with you all in this tough time. India mourns the loss. 🇮🇳❤️🇯🇵
জাপানে তো সহিংসতা হওয়া প্রায় অসম্ভব।
Finally
China strike.  Useful fools.
Thought's are with his Family and friends and the people of Japan so shocked when I heard the news he was a great man
Are we back in the 1930s, when there was violent madness all over the planet?
Governments worldwide are collapsing all by design of the illuiminiTARDi
Very sad horrific shocking disgusting.May the Previous Japanese Prime Ministers soul journey well and rest in peace.Amen.Condolences to family and friends.
Singapura is a concrete jungle and Asia's largest sex hub starting from dollar 5.  Go for Chinese very cheap  Singapore is officially the most 'fatigued' country on the planet as well
What a terrific way to die....for great men
Assassinated is the term used to describe this horror
This happened in Japan. The world has offically gone crazy.
This was an assassination not a murder...
As a Japanese, I’m really 😞 A lot of people in Japan were really optimistic about gun crime. When this shit accident occurred, people didn’t run away. Rather, they tried to approach. Now we have to realize that Japan is not a really safe country anymore
Abe was a patriot.  So the media has always blamed Abe.  The media made a murderer.  I and many Japanese will give a hammer to both the left and the globalists in this election.
Good men always disappeared on this earth. The world still remain with military coup.This world is dying.
🤷‍♂️
Its chinese doing
i believe not one country much peace after war 2
wish that would have made all rich nationalist maniacs pass away. its a start lol
From Japan He was very friendly and loved by many people. In Japan, many people are hurting his death.  I think the cost of losing him is huge.
People have no idea what life is really like in Japan.  Misery everywhere but no one talks about it.  Just your usual whining and bitching about the death of some cheap politician.
R.I.p🙏
Some strange stuff going on around the world. May he rest in peace.
R.I.p🙏
it broke my heart when the title said he died😢 may you rest in peace mr. abe
He was a sometimes divisive world leader.  At the same time he put Japan back on the world stage as an influencial power.  In that way he will be a historic figure. He did not deserve to be shot in the back. RIP Mr. Abe.
This is the work of Yakudza...
Notice how Boris Johnson resigned on the same day? Must be orchestrated by Russia. Looks like UK and Japan are more intertwined than most knew.
This is truly the saddest news, he was a wonderful man, great leader.  Really distressing news, senseless.  May He Rest in Peace, Amen 🙏 ❤
As a Korean, it is frightening because I know East Asia countries like mine and Japan are pretty safe in terms of the gun crime.. It's very rare.
May his soul rest in peace🙏🏽💙     An inside job🤔🤔🤔🤔
All part of wiping out presidents leaders worldwide to bring in the EVIL NEW WORLD ORDER which No one  wants!
Japanease are peaceful people. This is caused by global politics, I believe.
Rest in Peace Shinzo Abe😐😢😥😭😩😫😡😠😮
As if, I didn't believe the title when I saw it, crazy times.
Donald Trump had him killed!

WHAT! Japanese POLITICIANS ARE THE MOST DOWN TO EARTH PEOPLE! THEY HAVE THEIR " PALABRA DE HONOR " WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS WITHIN THEIR TERM THAT IS VERY SHAMEFUL AND UNFORGIVABLE THEY ACCEPT THE BLAME AND THEY RESIGN IMMEDIATELY FOR " DELICADESA". THEY ARE ROLE MODELS!... WHAT HAPPENED?!!... THIS MIGHT BE AN ANTI- " NIPPON KAIGI " ATTACK, WE KNOW ABE IS ONE OF THOSE FAR RIGHT TOTAL MONARCHIST RESTORATION MOVEMENT.
What's happening in Japan ? I'm from *India* 🇮🇳.  We have tremendous respect for Japan particularly Abe . Abe s' idea of economics- " *Abenomics* " have greater perspective in current world .
Was he shot at or was he shot? Who wrote thus headline?
So who he ki..ed him?
😢
Godse 2.0 in Japan.
THAT SUCK
Just a question do they not assign former prime minister security after they leave office Or was it a failure of security?
Can't believe this incident is happened in such a peaceful country . RIP Abe 🇯🇵😥😥😥
What a lot of words.  Shot by who?  Party of what? China suspected behind it?  Where was he shot?  How long did he live?
So sad😔...RIP from NZ 🇳🇿
I can think of a few more leaders that need shooting !!
Heart breaking news. Lost a great leader.
i wish that to putler and lukashenko
I hope will shot down more european and USA leaders, and will learn not tu serve billionaries, against population, the leaders have to learn to serve the people and forget the billionaries
With Boris Johnson resigning at the same time I think this is the work of Putin
assasinated.  never seen one in my life time fair reporting news
🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋 🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋 🦋    RIP    🦋 🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋 🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
May God continue to bless and comfort the rest of his family in Jesus name.
Rip PM Abe🙏😞🤍
So sad.
China 🇨🇳 is behind this attack.
Good. Screw that war-crime denying ultranationalist. Now he can say "hi" to his Class-A war criminal father in hell.
he was a good friend of our PM Kedi ji.. now he will fly in his official aircraft to Japan to pay his last respects..RIP
My deepest condolences to Mr Abe family and to the people of japan
SO SO SAD. The whole world is going to miss this great man
sayonara and domo arigato sir.....   from Philippines  😔😔
That's why i am asking for Japan to close its borders for permanent migration. If you want to enter Japan as a tourist, fine. But no migration. One drop of acid is enough to ruin a glass of water, then one glass of water can ruin a tank and then one tank can ruin a pond and then one pond can ruin a lake and the whole water body from thereon.  Stop them from muddying your waters Japan. Close the borders. #Saynotoimmigrants
The globalist left throughout the world hate Nationalists.  Although one could  stop and say the left just hate and leave it there
Mossad did this.
My deepest condolences to Mr Abe family and to the people of japan
caonima  Lao bi
This is indeed shocking and my absolute sincerest condolences to the family and to all of the people of Japan 😢
this will seal Asia's future Shinzo's dream of a militarized Japan is a certainty now. and gun control does not work this is good example.
Condolence my dear nation Japan. I pray and I wish for the peaceful election and peaceful community. 🙏🇵🇭!
Shocking
R I P
RIP🙏🌹🌹🙏
Condolence to the family and to the Japanese people! 🙏
next episode of boruto anime may not be aired after today's incident
Abe's grandfather started invasion to China killing of Chinese people in July 7th .and he died in July 8th. very sad about the one day delay.
To the people of Japan 🗾, I'm very sorry for your lost. He was a great man to the people of Japan. Bless you and your country 💟
yeah! this calls for opening my $6000 dollar wine for celebration🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Insane! Rest in peace.
It's really disgusting that in the comments section of CCP's propaganda news channel CGTN chinese are celebrating his death !
Rip.😩
日本は偉大な宰相を喪いました
This news breaks my heart.
Deep condolence & praying for his departed soul. Its appears to be  politically  motivated killing. As  Shinzo Abe's  being trying to looking forward to  establish mote  friendly  relations with China, &  tring to close gaps with other rival neighbours  and trying to change the Japan’s geopolitical status quo back to pre- ww2 stage. He been trying to regain the Japan’s heritage being lost in Second World War(WW2). He becoming the Nationalist, and trying  uphold  Japan with a self driven geopolitics entirely Japan centric, a self sufficient & independent Japan with all geopolitical aspects!!
So Sad . RIP mate
Probably done by the Yakuza.
wAS IT ONE OF Putin's MEN OR THE Chinese? sORRY, my angel. rest in peace.
Damn.
successful assassination's by the Chinese ccp. because they look very similar and because they have more than 1 billion person, and because they have access to Japan's data and it's people, they have found a doubleganger and they basically got rid of the Japanese one and put the Chinese one. and a long term operation they infiltrated the ranks and laid down the first strike.  I am watching a weird Anime at the mean time called SUMMER TIME RENDERING , very good highly recommended. RIP  jab prime minister I hope you can save the Anime industry first before the army :=3)
ma condolens 2 his family
Very very sad. My condolences  to Abe-san and his family and so the people of Japan.
All people are in danger if against whats going on with rf regim. Its fir long time civilized societies must have bern ready to take it seriosly ⚠️
He was only person that I know great person , shocking new !  May him soul rest in peace🙏
It's annoying how the lady reporter pronounce Japan.
This is so sad
I am laughing so hard🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
RIP
Fk the yakuza
Abe believed in a strong 🇯🇵. Others wanted a weak Japan. He stood and died a hero.
2:04 This was an inside job? 💡🤔Let the conspiracies begin!! 💡🤯  😒🙄🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️
So you bring on a Chinese woman to talk about it? You realize they aren't the same right!?
My condolences, from the United States. Japan has lost an incredible man this day. I weep for their loss
RIP!
Rest In Peace Shinzo. I always admire Japan and its such amazing people like Shinzo❤️🖤
I was just reading about the legend of the killer stone that just recently broke in Japan, and then I open the news and I saw this. RIP. 🙏
WTF!
:(
All we have to do is quietly complete the election.
Qual a diferenca de tentatulos e teia de aranha?
Heartbreaking to hear! Prayers with Mr Abe and the Japanese 🇯🇵
Rest in peace 🕊️🕊️🕊️🙏🙏🙏
Biden better look out
The first shot missed he didn’t move because He thought the loud noise was a disturbance
RIP.
Om Shanthi Shinso Abe Sir. Sad news
R.I.P. 😢
Really heart breaking and devastating 😭😭 May your soul rest in peace 🙏
Deep condolence & praying for his departed soul. Its appears to be  politically  motivated killing. As  Shinzo Abe's  being trying to looking forward to  establish mote  friendly  relations with China, &  tring to close gaps with other rival neighbours  and trying to change the Japan’s geopolitical status quo back to pre- ww2 stage.

Oh wow, crazy shit...
RIP  .............. Big lost to India 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
My condolences to the whole Japanese nation for loosing such a personality..
Rest in peace PM SHINZO ABE, ONE OF THE GREAT PM
Obiden better hide
This is really heartbreaking news I can't believe he is dead
Of course with 2 shots of shotgun at close proximity, it would be miracle if he can survive that. so I expect worse when this news shows up in TV.  rip on this guy
Putin lover ?
What's wrong with this month for Prime Ministers, just yesterday Boris stepped down now Abe die. Wow
The best leaders seem to be getting killed. You're in the hall of legends with JFK, MLK and others. Rest in peace, Abe-dono.
Next will be boris johnson and countinue untill for all NATO country leader will die, just because, NATO leaders not working for NATO population, they are working for few houndred billionaries, and working against people like Abe and Boris Biden.
RIP  .............. Big lost to india 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Looked like a homemade gun to me !
I am Japanese, but I think it would be better to stop giving Japanese-style speeches of support to an unspecified crowd of people. It is better to let him make his speech in a hall or other large facility like in the US for security reasons. Shinzo Abe was a man with many pros and cons, but I think he had great diplomatic skills. Personally speaking, he was a politician I supported. This incident is a desecration of democracy. It must not be repeated.
This is that boy’s eternal punishment for befriending a vile evil man in Donald Trump.
shot in the back like a whale - where is the respect the children  were promised by God?
So sad, prayers for Japan.
Oh well, I guess that's what happens when your friends of Putin! America needs to pay attention.
This is sad I heard he was a very humble man and for his people unlike most politicians.
All these gun free countries seem to have alot of shootings lately, I guess criminals don't follow the law, who could've guessed...
Rest in peace.
Unbelievable. A country where you can hardly hear a normal gunshot news and something like this comes up. Deepest condolonces. R.I.P
I thought these things only happen in movies..so they are real?
Killed by a trained American assassin no doubt for trying to get rid of U.S troops from Japan.
Shot at?  I'd say it was a direct hit.
Very sad. RIP to a great leader
Very shocking to see happened in Japan 😱😱😱
India lost it's one of the best friend 🥲
I hear a lot about the man but nothing about the murder.
Japan is learning US culture
🥲
Shinzo Abe pray for us Amen🙏😪
Russian spy?
Smells like the CIA...
RIP
who is this woman？so biased！A spy sent by China？BBC is so Influlenced by Communist China！
Shinzo was still the de facto Prime Minister.  What is going on, world.
The east are making their moves
Very sad. A crazy guy with a gun. For those in the US who want stricter gun laws , look at this incident and where it has happened. Japan has very strict firearm laws and this is an example of how the gun played the role of the weapon. If it wasn't the gun it would have been a bomb or a knife or a piece of glass or even a car or airplane. When crazy people want to kill , they will. Guns have little to do with crazy people. Regulating guns does nothing but punish the honest guy while the criminal doesn't bother with following the rules or the law. I am sorry for the people of Japan who loved this man and hope the criminal receives a harsh prison term.
So many changes so quick.  First resignation of Boris Johnson, now the death of former Japanese prime minister.
Never thought this would happen in Japan. Shocking!
Obviously the corrupted establishment needed him gone
Damn that’s sad prayers to his family 💐🙏🏾💐
Unbelievable!! So sad to hear this news! If this happened in America, I would've said "yeah, it's America, no wonder"....but in Japan...unbelievable!!!! My condolences to the people of Japan! He was an amazing leader which this world lacks so much!!! 😞
I liked him he was always calm and composed.. May his soul rest in peace
This is a sad news. Japan may peaceful country but their people are not like that. We have seen during 2nd World war and also japanese soldiers were held responsible for killing hundreds of Muslims during Bosnian war in 90’s If i am not wrong.
Holy gosh, So sad news. As a Japanese.I really really wish it were a absurd daydream. I also wished he came back to PM after Kishida resigned. He made it easy for young people to get employment. He was a outstanding PM for Japan.He was the great advocate of international corporation.  He's greatest PM in post-WW2 Japan. May his soul rest in peace. But I still can't believe he's killed.
this is sad
There are far too many nutters in the world at the moment 😔
Why?
Condolences from Singapore. May he Rest In Peace!
The chinese is laughing like crazy now.
Sayonara, Sensei Abe... till the next life.
This is so sad to hear, RIP Shinzo Abe.
Yesterday a USELESS PM was kicked out by UK ...Sadly today  a great PM  has died
Free Japan Republic
Jesus chinese agent is everywhere
American puppet
CCP Assassination
好！
Just senseless 😡 RIP
Terrible. I wonder if the Kremlin has a hand in this and promised the assassin they would set up his family forever. RIP
The World is gone this is crazy😢😢
and you wonder why Putin is so paranoid?  Trump too?
I think he wasn't just shot; he was assassinated.
I am so maddd at the person who killed him! Why must you do that!!! The PM literally contributed to the country so much, when he is abt to enjoy his rest of life, he got killed!!! He didn’t even have chance to see his family and close friends before he died that moment! Rest In Peace Shinzo Abe, although I don’t really know you, but you contributed a lot. Hope that ‘ human ‘ gets his consequences for killing such a wonderful man.
Enemy divertion - thats how bad thouse unhuman are 📕✒❗
RIP 🙏
Cruel world 🌍
I can't believe that such incident took place in Sach a peaceful country tribute from India 🇮🇳 ♥️ Om Shanti
abe's vision for a fascist remilitarized japan became too intolerable for many peace-minded japanese.  his constant insults toward china/korea didn't help either, causing japanese to lose many opportunities.    now the ghosts of the 50 million innocent chinese/korean/asian victims of japan's brutal invasion (that abe had more or less immorally defended) await his arrival on the other side...
Lord, have mercy on his soul
rip SHINZO ABE
Rest in peace.  Prayers from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳
W.W.3 START within 10 year
You can rest now Mr Abe, Japan suffering a great loss
As a Chinese, I was absolutely sad and sorry to hear this news, and so did my family, and we hope Shinzo Abe RIP.  While I was also shocked to hear that the BBC host said many Chinese were celebrating this news, PLEASE STOP MANIPULATING YOUR VIEWERS.
Assassination 😎😎 the CIA didn’t want him to come back.
Proved.. where there is light darkness always follows
rip! Sending love from Hong Kong😢
Must be political
RIP 🇯🇵
RIP from Thailand.
RIP That was a low tech handmade pipe shotgun.
WHATS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD..
China is all I can say
I’m so sorry. Prayers for Mr Abe’s family 💐
Very sad news indeed. Cant believe some  Japan's rival countries nationalists were celebrating his death. Such a inhuman behaviour.
Very bad 👎 news about this kind of problems in the world Happiness 😊
May his soul rest in peace
OMG. He is a very good man and prime minister.  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It shows how unthinkable the act is to Japan, when a man could walk up to the former PM and shot him in close distance. If it in America, anyone walking up to a senator, even without a gun, would have been stop or knock down by security. I disagree with a lot of his policies but bring harm to the one you disagree with is just a way of a coward. Hope he didn't suffer.
Rip
No one in public office who serves their people should be in danger of this happening. Not in Japan, in the UK or anywhere else. It happened to the MP Jo Cox in the UK too recently. She was murdered whilst serving her constituents. This is deeply disturbing and should not happen in the modern world. My thoughts go out to Mr Abe’s family, friends and colleagues.
It might be the Yakuza
RIP🙏🙏
😭condolances⚘
Right wing premier calling for a Nuclear war agsinst China. Very Dangerous indeed.
RIP
I'm still shocked to see such thing will ever happen in Japan
its so suck. some people blame japan leader for past cruelty emperor over asean. you guys a no heart. this guy is the best PM in japan. RIP shinzo Abe
He must have been hated by some Japanese...
Dude’s a massive pos. War criminal worshipping shill
Something makes me think the hit man wasn’t from Japan
It is sad day. Because It will must grow JP economy after he died.
RIP
"KGB" point blank 👉
Sugoi samishi, I idolize Shinzo Abe a man that have a nice ♥ heart Rest n Peace we will miss you
A great man who served his country so well.
American media you are hypocrites! Why don't you write that it was a terrorist attack?
What on Earth, Japanese didn't deserve losing this man. An incomparable leadership icon of this country.
Condolences to the family.
I condemned the war in Ukraine as well! - how d'ya know that the Japanese Prime Minister wasn't echoing MY sentiment?
-- BBC, Abe died because of shits like you CNN, MSDNC and all you F-tards that poison people's minds across the world.  Violence requires a gun.  Go to hell.  I'll put a real BBC in your mouth.  You'll live.
HOW I HOPE IT WAS PUTIN!!!!!!
How much you wanna bet China is in some way behind this?
who hired this b*tch, she sounds like an undercover ccp agent
damn I saw that he was shot afew hours ago and was really hoping he would recover, so heartbreaking to hear this :(
RiP mr. prime minister
R. I. P  😢
Religion of peace eh?
(:
Sounds so sudden
Prayers for his soul to rest in peace💐💐 Salute to a great leader 🙏
Rest in peace Shinzo
I am curious why they are not calling this an 'assassination?'
Japanese democracy itself is at risk
A big black mark to Japan, known as safety and a peaceful coutrty
Prayers for Japan and the japanese people
They think he has an influence on the current politics oh his country. Of course, he has. A looser  did this.
Ice t - colours
The Security detail should be interviewed by the police.
Jesus Christ! I wonder what befell that idiot who shot him? I feel very sorry to hear such a terrible news. My heartfelt condolences.
Ohh God... He was amazing leader..He and his country was hood friend of Modi and India... Om Shanthi 🙏🙏🙏😔😔😔
Do you really rest in peace if not dead of old age?
Shocking ...THAT ALSO IN JAPAN.....
😢😢
He treated my country well, unlike many western countries and the media including the BBC. Prayers are with Abe’s family.
RIP
Shocking and heartbreaking. RIP PM Abe!
Sad, seemed like decent person, RIP.  Why evil politicians in the world are never targeted is the mystery.  Who was the person and his motives?
RIP, I’m sorry to those in Japan. Cowards are those who do such acts.
akumetsu
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Some people are wicked... This is pure madness... Japan govt need to cut the killer into pieces...alive
No waayyyy
Valiant Hero for the people.
They have the strictest gun laws in the world ..practically no one gets a gun there..
Unusual considering how strict gunlaws are in Japan…very rare, and very sad
Very sad.  RIP
I am from Ethiopia,I love Japans.I want to forward deepest condolences to the family and friends during this very difficult of your huge loss  to the people of Japan stay strong.
Goodbye, good man. May you be avenged and live a eternity in paradise.
Shocking News About PM Japan. ABE SHINZO.
In the peaceful country of Japan, this is a shock.  RIP Mr Abe, you were a great leader who loved and served your people and country. You brought economic revival and were a great diplomat  You will be missed around the world 😢🇯🇵
The only State  leader that  has visited our Mindanao Island in recent  history I think. RIP Mr. Abe.
The American disease is spreading. May his family be comforted and may his soul rest in peace
I wonder what is the shooters punishment will be
what happened?
Rest in Peace Shinzo Abe :(
Motive? Sad and very shocking
Heartbreaking. I couldn't believe, terrible day. RIP
Our condolences to his family and to the people of Japan who grieve for this world leader.  An act of cowardice and brutality.  A great loss.
This is like really unbelievable!! Can't believe the man got shot that tooo in the back. What is the world coming to 😔 RIP Mr.Abe San
Gun control failed to prevent the murder of prime minister because criminal won't follow the law.
I smell the CCP.
My condolences to Mr Abe's family and the people of Japan. Very sad day.
WTF is going on? I thought things in Japan was mellow? Is there unrest that I didn't know about or is this some crazy?
Wouldn't want to be a former politician in a land drowning in weapons who encourages division and hate. Japan has very few weapons and a society that encourages unity and fights division. Even so this happens. Society will have to evolve and improve in the face of climate change or individuals will keep punching the powerful. I have a feeling we are facing a sudden collapse in the world's trade and economy leading to pure chaos...
I am very sad as a Japanese. He has been on a difficult voyage, and he was often criticized. However, he has accomplished a lot of things. Mr. Shinzo Abe, please rest in peace.
RIP :( great man
R.I.P sir this is really "shocking" news  I still can't believe this happened in Japan especially with Former Prime minister like Shinjo Abe   It's a big loss For INDIA 🇮🇳 and Japan 🇯🇵
RIP
RIP :(
He is still alive..
Japan is one of most peaceful countries this is shocking. Rest in peace sir.
Sad and heartbreaking may his soul Rest in peace. 🙏⚘
Very very sad news. May his soul rest in peace. From Papua New Guinea 🇵🇬.
And so it starts. The breakdown of civilization seems a long process, until it isn't . RIP.
Thats just messed up man 🤦‍♂️😪
thats messed up why couldnt it have been BIDEN and HARRIS!
Right wing Japan is on the rise.
Holy fuck. Damn, I just saw the video a few hours ago, I thought he was gonna make it! R.I.P. Shinzo Abe
RIP
the killer looks young..probably in the 20s. whats his nationality??
He's the first Prime minister who came and visited Pres Rodrigo Duterte in Davao City
We're the worst human century ever.
Never thought this could happen in Japan. Sad 😥
Chinese operatives in action.
The Singaporean reporter looks like megamind
It’s an unfortunate incident. What a sick thing to happen in a peaceful country like Japan. Condolences to the Abe family and Japanese people.
Deep condolences to Japan.
Maybe Vladimir Putin is behind this?
it probably was a yakuza hit

Death penalty waving and it should be done
A good man died today. Violence in Japan is really rare.  China must be behind this horrible act!
Wtf is Jophaan?
RIP
He was a great leader. Rip. Shocking news
RIP. May the perpetrator that robbed you of your precious life be in torment, of a tortured soul.and spirit
R.I.P. a fine statesman; condolences to his family and friends, to the Japanese people, and to all those in the wider world whose lives he touched.
Rest in peace ✌️
The reason it's so shocking when a leader is assassinated isn't because ordinary people are less important; it's because their constituents as well as their family and friends are affected by the loss, and that's such a great number of people.  When a person like the Prime Minister is lost, no one can be sure what will change, only that life is suddenly not the same.  Sympathy to the people of Japan, regardless of their political positions.
I pray the catch this terrorist !!!!
本当に残念でなりません… 安倍元首相は、近年の日本にとって最も重要な役割を果たしてきた人物です。  日本で銃は普通見ることがありません… 今でもこんなことが起こったことが信じられないです。  安倍元首相が亡くなったことは、日本にとって大きな痛手です。 今後の日本の政治のことを考えると、先が真っ暗になったと言っても過言ではないです。 このような非道な行いを許すことは出来ません。  ご冥福をお祈りします。
I always thought people loved him , what a shame
Violence is not rare in Japan you twit.
It's scary if this incident inspired other people around the world to kill their leader   Especially because the crisis that happened around the world
Heartbreaking and tragic incident 😢😢 rest in peace ،🙏🙏🥀🥀
"KeKeKeKeKeKEKEekEkKEk mooTHa fookAh" ??? 1:21
The world is moving so fast😰...why!?
seems like shooting is now everywhere
The assassin is a coward, in Japan ur supposed to use a katana or kamikaze.
I thought it was putin. Tsk tsk
So sad for his family. Hope they find peace and strength during  this difficult time and remember his achievements as a PM and cherish the good times spent. Japan will miss him.
The happiest right now are the Chinese,  they are extremely happy about this news 😅
Condolences to Nara Family
Still can’t believe he is gone really shocking and heartbreaking rest in peace…Om shanti
This video has nothing to do with me!!
RIP
I bet its the Chinese
😔
So sad 💔
It's shocking that it happened in Japan which not a place people go around with guns. RIP former PM. I really thought this kinda assasinations currently happens only in movies.
JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED! FASCIST IS GONE!!👍👌 THIS AWAITS HIS FRIEND NAZI PUTLER AS WELL!!🔥
WHY? for what..
He was shot with a modified shotgun, were they really expecting him to survive?
US-WEST "LOYAL DOG" IS DEAD 🐶🐶🐶 AW AW AW
RIP.. 🥺🥺🥺🥺
OMG 😭 💔  rest in peace sir🙏🙏
Thank you Abe from Taiwan 🇹🇼
This is troubling, this is madness
Terrible, just awful. Gone too soon! RIP 🕊️💖
Motive of the killer?
He was a really great PM. It's really sad.
Incredible the is so sad news. We should lot of support and safety former PM shinzo Abe family's.
Who is responsible? I suggest Japan looks at Putin.
Putin, you naughty naughty boy 😒
R.I.P
This happened in Japan, I'm losing hope in humanity in the end !! This is shocking R.I.P
Shot the wrong leader, should have gone to Russia.
Rip Sir!
He met with Hassan Rouhani president of Iran Really sad to hear this news. With love from Iran 🇮🇷❤️ R.I.P Mr Abe 🇯🇵
May his soul RIP.
Why mention Chinese nationalists are celebrating his death? He was assassinated in a tragic event. Seems in poor taste and unnecessary. I don’t know enough about him, but after WWII Japan has been one of the greatest allies to the United States. I feel sorry for his family. 🇯🇵 🇺🇸
rip😢
Rest in peace 🪦
RIP Sir #PMAbe ❤️❤️
A VERY SHOCKING INCIDENT.
I don't understand why it happened what are the police doing he was shot twice .  🤔
RIP.
First Boris Johnson is resigning now Shinzo Abe is assassinated?????? All in 2 DAYS???????????? WTFF IS HAPPENING?
Condolences
He was ...
Heartbreaking top bad it wasn't Putin
😔
Abe was an ultranationalist, far-right bigot who opposed equal rights for women and minorities in Japan. One of his main projects was pushing for Japan to regain the constitutional right to declare war. He was shot by a former member of Japan's military. Chickens came home to roost.
Can u see the signature of Russia here??...
Unthinkable something atrocious like this could take place in a country like Japan in this day and age. May he Rest In Peace.
United States and Nato at it again.
The very best  man the very good worlds leaders  specially on the south east Asian nations  I really missed that kind of people  The most brilliant leaders  Hopefully the justice will gave them and through their whole families
How easy it is to get a gun in Japan? How many times this even happen? I neved thought this could happen but maybe I am unaware.  this sounds so abnormal to me but I may uneducated about this.
まだ信じられません。 ご冥福をお祈りします..
Rest in peace sir 🙏 😔
I'm a Japanese. Rest in Peace, Shinzo Abe.
So sad. What is wrong with the world.   To family, friends and Japan  Kia kaha ( stay strong ) from NZ. R.I.P
why are you not calling it an assassination??
This is so sad 😞 and shouldn’t happen.
That’s what normally happens after being shot
No more covidshow in Japan , what a shame
Condolences to Mr Abe's family and the Japanese people. What's that makeshift device the assassin used to kill him? Looks like 2 pipes wrapped in duct tape....
What a tragedy.Can’t believe such horrible incident happened in a highly developed country with good security.
Bansai Sajjan...Vancouver-Amsterdam-Tokyo were legitimated (PBUH)
Hey maybe upset the Americans .
Today will go down in history as    the world has lost ONE  great leader today.
My deepest sympathies to Mr Abe & his family. May he rest in peace. A leader unafraid to stand up to the globalist cabal.
歴代総理大臣の中でも間違いなく優秀な総理でした この事は日本の重大な損失であり残念でなりません 御冥福をお祈りします
I love the Japanese people and culture. I know I would feel safer in Japan than I would in the USA. There was no reason to shoot him. America is a place of violence. Japan is not!
😮‍💨 My heart is broken...💔
BYEEEE BEECH 👋
The picture of Abe, bloodied and sprawled on the street, is very reminiscent of RFK immediately after his assassination.  No matter what your views on his politics are, violence like this has no place in a democratic society. This will no doubt have a massive impact on Japan for years to come. Rest in peace.
So sad 😭😭 from Pakistan Balochistan
Sad and also very strange. Who would want to do this? I hope they find whoever is responsible.
Japans was the swistrland of Asian after ww2 but this event has ended it as this is not a normal murder but had a political motive
I live in Japan. The mood here...well, you can really see it in people's eyes (everyone wears a mask here).
Unbelievable. Condolences from the US 🇺🇸. Rest peacefully sir 🙏🏾
So shocking, especially considering Japan rarely sees gun violence. PM Abs did great things for Japan, he will be missed around the world. 🇺🇸 🇯🇵
How can anyone celebrate his death? Even if you vehemently disagree with his policies, no one deserves to die like that.
this year is kinda weird
very sad
We will miss you àbe san
whatever this man's beliefs in his life, i hope he has found peace and is at rest, the same to his family.
Rest in peace prime...fallen but never forgotten..⚘⚘⚘❤💓💞you're always in our hearts and condolence to the whole family...🙏🙏🙏
RIP from mainland china.  We must admit that there are a lot of democrats making violent comments on the Chinese Internet. But more normal Chinese express grief, just like the Chinese government.
I felt bad when he stepped down as PM, all that I've heard about this man are good deeds.   Why would someone want to kill him?
He was a good guy and pm, Rest in Peace Shinzo Abe
Rest In Peace 🙏❤️ This world is just getting worse not better 😥
Chinese sleeper agent
WTF?! Sheesh...Crazy that someone could get so close to the former PM. Why would someone cut him down like this? What's the motive?
He was a great man. In His Time as a prime minister he helped many people including Myanmar and Burmese People. And Unlike China he didn't ask for sth in return. A very nice person and a very nice leader in my personal perspective  He will go to Heaven This day is a really sad day for me And I pray Japanese people to be safe and sound  And never encounter such tragic incident ever again  I pray for him and I pray for his family  I am so sad now that I am kind of speechless  And this is my Good Bye letter for him
very sad , feel for the family .
My deepest condolences to all Japanese people🇯🇵😥.  ❤from Australia
this is pissing me off. why did this to this prime minister. he didn't nothing wrong about it. it's much like who died john kennedy
Find people behind the man....he was nothing but an instrument....
Wow
😭😭😭
Of all the places, it's Japan.. I really can't believe it.
Someone: *shoots putin* That someone: *dies*
My deepest condolences and prayer from Laos 🙏🇱🇦🇯🇵
Why can't they use the word assassinated? Isn't that what this is?
This is terrible news,  so saddened to hear about it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family 👪 🙏
My sincere condolences to the family 🙏🏾
Mhsrp
I just don't understand why, he quit 2 years ago, the killer is 21 so it's not like he could have even voted for him before and this guy is going to be in jail for the rest of his life.  For what?
All government officials everywhere need to go every last one of them
しんどい😔
For me he is best and koisumi san
Rest in peace Sir, you have my highest respect
RIP Abe-nomics. Shinzo was top notch.
Rest in peace !! World of today suffer with crime and socially insecurity🥲 its perhaps a result of taking less concern with security than that of Arm force and atomic weapons !! So so sad to here this mews
So sad. Deep condolence. May he rest in peace🙏
Very strange this happened right after the headlines on Fox's website reads: "Japan lodges protest after Chinese, Russian warships spotted near disputed islands: a ‘grave concern’"
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Very sad. R.I.P. Mr. Abe.😢
"Japan is such a peaceful country" true. But remember, violent political extremism in Japan is common, not "extremely rare" at all. Japanese Red Army, New Left (fired ROCKETS into Imperial residences), right wing groups, Aum Shinrikyo (sarin gas in a subway attack? It was only in 1995), etc.
日本で周りに人が大勢いるなかで銃撃事件が起きるなんて！
wow wtf
From Japan
Deepest condolance from Indonesia 🇮🇩
The Russians or the Chinese did this. First Boris Johnson retired, then Aba gets shot, then Putin makes that speech saying the war is just beginning all on the same day.  I'm telling yall we have entered ww3.
Rest in peace Sir😭😭🇿🇦🇿🇦
Rest In Peace, Shinzo Abe
I'm legit shocked this happened considering how hard it is for a regular everyday citizen to get a gun in Japan guns are extremely rare in that country
I still can’t believe what happened. He’s by far my favorite PM in modern Japanese history. This is heartbroken. Rest In Peace Mr Abe
Disgusting what’s going on today! They’ll all answer for their behaviour, trust me nobody gets away with it, nobody.
No this lady is expressing her view. You are very one sided reporter.
Was he a left leaning individual?  Edit: I mean the shooter
Insane
Om Ami Dewa Hri!!🌷🌸🌹🍀🍁🍂🌺🌻🌼🌅
Very sad day for Japan. so tragic Rest in peace my prayers for all family and people of Japan.🕊
What....I liked this mf...since day 1 for some reason I knew I would
Hope the same happens to trump
Very shocking and sad incident. He was one of the greatest Prime minister.
RIP
God bless him 🙏🏽
Very-2 sad news,rest in peace sir
I think USA is exporting lots of guns in Japan I guess... USA big daddy of Japan
rest in peace mr. shinzo abe
Rest in Peace!🙏
Why? Why they did that to him🙁😪Rest in peace Mr. Abe
I just came from a short news clip about this. They showed him speaking, then (fortunately the person filming didn't catch it on video) there were shots. There was no news about his health. This is still a shock, however.  I'm very sorry for the people of Japan and especially his family and friends. His politics are neither here nor there, he was a human being Also, he served his country, which is more than most of us can say.
You would expect this in US, or any other country where shootouts are common but not really in Japan. RIP, but the question that bugs me, where the hell are the security guards been, how the hell one guy can walk in and shot so easly??
CARLOS GHOSN 😝😝😝😝😝
A neocon warmonger is gone.
My compassion with former Japanese PM  shinzo Abe and with her family too.
Heartbreaking news, Rest In Peace Mr .ABE
My deepest sympathy for the people of Japan and especially his family.
奈良近くの大阪に住んでいる日本人です。日本では、かなりのショックを受けています。 安倍晋三氏は、総理大臣を辞めたあともかなりの影響力をもっており、今後かなり政治的な影響が及ぶと考えられます。 現在は、参議院議員選挙という国政選挙の選挙期間中であり、日曜日が投票日です。この事件を受け、明日と明後日の選挙がどうなるのか分からなくなりました。 銃社会でない日本で、銃による襲撃を受けたこともショックでした。銃は、自宅で手作りされたものであることは分かっていますが、それ以外の情報はまだありません。今後の捜査が待たれます。 日本で、総理大臣が殺された事件は、第二次世界大戦以降ありませんでした。民主主義の国で、暴力による政治への妨害はあってはならないことであり、怒りとショックでいっぱいであります。 この事件は、政治テロであるものの、個人の感情による犯行か、組織的な犯行かは、不明です。現在、背景情報はまだなく、警察による捜査を待つしかないというのが現在の状況です。
Very sad  Who gave him the right to take someone life  Only God does that  He was very young  He could have done good to the country he belongs to
Condolences to Shinzo Abe family members. And RIP Shinzo Abe.
外交がうまい首相だった。 。
After giving most of his life to public service, it is heart breaking that he was shot dead. His legacy will nonetheless live on. We mourn with the Japanese people.
Is Britain going to blame China for this?
Boris did it
His death came as a terrible blow to Japanese.
It was a huge shock to me considering that Japan has one of the lowest gun violence in the world. May you rest in peace Mister Abe, thank you for the trust and investments to our country. Rip
RIP/VIP 💐💐💐
What disgusting is there are certain Chinese Ultra nationals celebrate his death like they won something. Very disgusting behavior from them.
Heart breaking deep condolences to the GREAT LEADER SHINZO ABE 🙏🙏🙏💐💐💐💐
F 😢
I don't think his fellow countrymen did it to him ☹️ any reason why that killer killed Abe?
Rest in peace Mr PM.
This is so shocking, my sincere condolences to his family and countrymen.  Dear God , please don't send Biden for US representative.  Ty, in advance 😇 😉
WTF
なんでシンガポールが出てくるの アホくさーーーーー
Om Sharnagati to PM Shinzo Abe... Gun culture and Jihadi Culture have to end... If Humanity is to survive.
Definitely an assassination 🤷‍♂️. Likely China
Disgraceful  ; our thoughts are with his family. Pity gunman cannot get a shot at Putin.
This is tragically surreal. I may not have agreed with his Abenomics, but this is just terrible. RIP and my heartfelt condolences to his wife and family.
But I thought guns are banned in Japan. How is this possible?
Rip Shinzo Abe
Next is modi
REST IN PEACE TO ALL THE BABIES ABE ALLOWED TO BE MURDERED BY ABORTION UNDER HIS RULE.
Wtf.
Truly tragic! Not only for the Japanese, but for countries in the region, where he was seen as a balancing force! Our condolences to the Japanese people. May his should Rest in Peace.
damn
God we couldnt go 24 hours without a beloved Japanese figure dying, could we? RIP the sex god and genuinely good person Shinzo Abe. Tell Takahashi we say hi
Rip samurai
R.I.P from India. Mr.Abe was a great friend of India.  🇮🇳❤️🇯🇵
Wonder if the perpetrator can take a trip to Canada for us?
Life is short and unpredictable
😥😥😥
🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
Where was his security?  Close protection detail is vital!
Commie dogs put Abe to sleep
A good man, senseless killing, RIP
JAPAN DON'T DESERVE NEWS LIKE THIS JAPAN DON'T DESERVE PEOPLE WHO SHOT THE FORMER BEST PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN.🥺🥺🥺
Sincere condolences from American friend. 🇺🇸  Gun bans don’t change an assassin’s evil intentions! RIP ABE
Coping the United States
Rest in peace, Shinzo Abe, September 21, 1954 - July 8, 2022. Thank you for opening your great country, culture, traditions, and hen tai to the world!
Japan: We rarely have violent acts happen here. But when we do... We make sure yo momma's momma feel it
The fact that some people are celebrating about someone's death absolutely disgusting.
Rest In Peace Abe 😥
RIP
RIP..... 😓😓
Heartbreaking news
Chinese are celebrating ...imagine  my shock
What dipshit writes your headlines - dies after being shot at? How about assassinated? Murdered? Killed? ….. wankstain
Rest in paradise PM SHINCO
Turut berduka cita
I stayed up to follow this. It’s now 6am in America, and I’ve been up since the news first broke. I just didn’t want to go to sleep and wake up to the news that he didn’t make it. Somehow, I was able to convince myself that if I stayed awake, he would pull through. But he died anyway.  I don’t know much about this man, which is why it’s so surprising to me that I feel so sad about his death.  I just don’t understand how someone can think they have the right to end someone else’s life. I’m so sick of people being killed.
In a country with the strictest gun laws on the planet no less..
R I P.
Sad news...😟... need more protection security specially when it come too imp top leaders mosy while public apesrence for political speech  or any other visits out side....
BE READY WW3 IS ABOUT TO START  !!!!!
This is terrible news 😪😪
THE GUN WAS PROVIDED BY THE CCP.  MR ABE IS A VERY GOOD  FREIND TO ALL ASIAN AND A TORN ON THE SIDE OF CHINA.   MR ABE,   YOUR PROGRAMS FOR A BETTER ASIA WILL CONTINUE AND BE FULFILED .
rest in peace honurable prime mimister
Welcome to japan👉😎🤏 This is just the beggining😆  see you on the next event🙏
Very sad news today. RIP, former PM Shinzo Abe.
Now next will be joe biden and xi jinping
🙏💐भावपूर्ण श्रद्धांजली 💐🙏
This is unbelievable in Japan!!!😱😱😱
Killed bye the CCP ! China virus strikes again !
😮
the contradictory system of government imposed by the west creat so much seperation withen the country creating enemies withen the countries people.
This is such a bad news, i am so sad and bawling with tears.  😭. We mourn with you Japanese.
RIP Mr.Abe 🙏
The world never expected such a heart breaking & shocking incident to happen in Japan.
RIP Eeyore.
So disgusting that Chinese netizens are celebrating a tragedy...
We demand the execution of the perpetrator.
Sad and heartbreaking 💔 😢 RIP, Sir.
So sad
Boris, Abe...pro-USA and pro-military-spending Western allied leaders will be gone one way or another.   Hopefully in elections but it is clear there will be no nuclear war with Russia or China.  Japan was nuked twice, anyone trying to get it into conflict that can lead to nuclear war will likely not live to see their schemes realized.  There are no laws nor human rights where there are nuclear weapons, neither where the silos and bunkers are, nor where target locations are.   The existence of nuclear arms has destroyed civilization.   The solution is to eradicate them and track and monitor all who know how to build them.
So unfortunate, may his soul rip
日本の為に今まで本当にありがとうございました。
Condolence
With him dead i have a feeling the nationalists in japan have a chance to rise
Very strange title to this. Was he "shot at" or was he actually shot?
貴方が生前残した日本を、日本人は素晴らしい国だと、誇りに思っています。 世界的にも数々の偉業を残した総理が何故殺されてしまったのか。 日本人はそろそろ目を覚まし、衰退した日本を再生するよう願っていますし、安倍さんもそれを望んでいるでしょう。  ご冥福をお祈りします。
Someone is trying to start some shit didn't world War 1 start this way.
Prayers from Indonesia 🇮🇩🙏🇯🇵 May the bereaved families and the people of Japan be given strength.
This is a sad day! My condolence and prayers are with Mr. Abe's family. Thank you for everything you did for Taiwan Mr. Abe. God is with you. Rest in peace. 😭
I wonder if North Korea or China had anything to do this it wouldn’t surprise me
Putin give order to hit man to kill X .   PM
The CCP members are in ecstasy now as their social medium boom.
Japan security pathetic security RIP
what
Deep condolences for Japan.. I can't believe the shoot happened in Japan a peaceful country
Paid Chinese assin !!

本当に悲しい出来事です 間違いなく歴史をかえることでしょう
RIP
All politicians should wear bullet proof vests to protect them from terrorists
I saw it happening in person and I can tell you Putin was not there
😭
Who had knew today its gonna be his last day of living! RIP Abe
Abe's not dead. He just went to the "Isekai."
Somewhere I can hear minke whales cheering!
yakuza
Deep condolences. RIP
Wtf how a peace lover pm are died like this!!!! Shit to the world
I was sad to hear that this happened to him. I'm not a Japanese, but i sympathize him for i know the goodness he had done for his countrymen and to other countries. He is a real public servant, he dedicated himself in serving Japan as the Prime Minister of the country for many years. He is one of a kind person, he influences a lot of things for the goodness of his country. I pray for your soul Prime Minister, may you now rest in peace, thank you for your service, you did your part, you will never be forgotten🙏
Херасе
he was a great man
C H I N A .
Very bad
Rest In Paradise Sir. You were humble and respected by all ❤️🌹.
Won't forget how he retired due to ill health.
Strange. He was so well known, i didn't even know he stepped down as PM. RIP.
the CCP is behind this undoubtedly
he is a dangerous man, better take it out now. before he drives japan to war again.
this is extremely sudden that PM Shinzo Abe passed away. It’s was crazy... I don’t even know how to say anything... Rest In Peace, PM Shinzo Abe  💔😢
Our deepest condolences to all Japanese. 🇯🇵Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is very close to the Filipino heart. Japan loves my country and we love Japan so much. Love from Philippines 🇵🇭
China might be behind this horrible murder, detailed through high level investigation must be conducted 👍😠😠...
May his soul rest in peace 🙏🇰🇭❤️🇯🇵
Oh my God... I always knew Shinzo Abe, it's incredible to see him go like that...
毎日テレビで見かけて外交と笑顔が印象的でした  20歳でよく見知っている総理といえば安倍さんでしたとても悲しいです  心よりご冥福をお祈りします
Sorry for your loss and hurt.  From Australia 🇦🇺 ♥
the shooter was guilty couple hours ago, but he is different person now, i hope everybody forgive him.
It heart breaking.he is a good leader all of us
This is terrorism. Whole conspiracy should be uncovered
Anything to do with Japans  closest neighbours who have underlying discrepancies with Japan in terms of squabbling over islands ,Ukraine  war , apparently some in china are celebrating. Organised hit possibly.
He'll  be deeply missed 💔💔😭.RIP legend 😢
Abe isn't dead. Just the body. His spirit will live on.
What are the chances that #Putin had a hand to play in this?
Pedophile Andrew is Ring leader of criminals
RIP pm Shinzo Abe you where one of the few good leaders in the world
Not only are we stunned by his sudden death but we should be equally shocked by how many Chinese people are making a mockery of such a tragic incident.  If you can read Chinese, you’ll be disgusted by the shameless remarks made by those CCP supporters
Is this a far right terrorist attack like what happened in Georgia (not as in the post Soviet country but the state in the US)?
There are many hater in Japanese internet called “Abegaaaa”.I hate them.
Lisa killed Diana...
So so sad, just speechless
I am so very sorry this has happened. You are in my heart, Japan.
Shinzo Abe worshipped Imperial Japanese war criminals so this is just karma catching up to him.
R.I.P.
お悔やみ申し上げます...
RIP. A good man died brutally today.
USA is terrorist state which killed thousands of civilians in Libia Iraq Afghanistan Vietnam...
I blame American 2nd amendment
What the f!??????? How did this happen?? Are Russians behind this?
happy shrining
Freedom to Germany from USA occupation of 1945
😂ha
4:07 appalling, but unfortunately pretty stock standard for China
Quite shocking Japan not exactly known for shooting and assassinations.
Rest in peace sir🥀
Our condolences to the family of Prime Minister Abe and the Japanese people. 🇯🇵🗾😢
Freedom to Japan from USA occupation
It was shocking news. I never forget the historical tragedy.
Rip love goes to the wife 🙏 💔 ❤️
Freedom to people of the world from democracy!!!!
wtf
May your soul Rest In Peace Mr. PM
This sounds like an inside job.
Given the number of victims of politicians, its not surprising. What is surprising is the low level of attacks on politicians.  It's going to get far far worse as politicians cancel pensions, tax people even more, axe services all because of those pension debts. When there are so many victims of their crimes, some will short cut the courts and take matters into their own hands.
Eyes shift to China....
it was hard breaking news
Deeply saddened 😔.  Rest in peace  Abe san.
A powerful, autocratic, ethnocentric, nationalistic man. So many collusion/systemic cover-up scandals; his subornates (not just one) have committed or suspected to have committed suisides etc. Violence must be condemned but if there was anyone who could become the target of such horrendous violence in such a peaceful country, he would have been. (I am not saying he deserved it or anything like that though)
So what...Lots of people in New York die daily from fentanyl overdose....
Shinzo abe was a legend and legend never dies. Condolences from india
he is very good  former president I respect him I always respect him he is a good person 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rest in peace
NO WAR BUT CLASS WAR
He was a divisive figure , the same as trump . He passed away now , what is the next for Japan ?
Liberal Democra 😂 more like imperial conservative. Good job by the navy vet.
😢неожиданно
KARMA HERE IT IS
Why does less problematic politicians get assassinated?
아베, 너는 지옥에 갔을 거야. 한국인에게 나쁘게 하더니, 일제 36년. 잘못을 인정 못하는 아베, 일본.
Rest in Peace great leader
Its A sad day for India as loosing a friend like Shinzo Abe is a great loss for India.🙏
自分はまだ20歳で、政治に興味を持ち始めてまだ数年ですが、安倍元総理はとても良い総理でした。日本の政治家として日本を支えて下さりありがとうございました。  病気や寿命で亡くなるならまだしも、このような形で亡くなられることがすごく悲しいです。 心からのご冥福をお祈りします。
F.
Condolences 🙏 from Greece 🇬🇷,  to his family.
glad to hear that. maybe i have such feeling because i am a bad person, not because my homeland is china.
School kids were shot to death just recently...so ... death of this guy is nothing in comparison
Where were the security guards? How could one have allowed someone to come so close to him from behind?
Heartbreaking 💔 😭😭😭R.I.P!
World good leader and very honestly 🖤🖤 🥺🥺🥺

Boris Johnson is gone... Abe is gone...who is next? Let me guess....I know but I will not tell you...
Oh so very sad☹️❣️💔😓 condolences for his family.
This tragedy reminds me of what has happened to the 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert F Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King. So tragic. My deepest condolences to all Japanese people🇯🇵😥. Love from Malaysia🇲🇾
Sad times
Americans: "ThIs iS PrOoF tHaT gUn LaWs DuN WeRk."
Wow this is so shocking
Heartfelt condolences
Nothing compares to what they did to others during ww2
This is basically japan's JFK assasination
feeling sad for Akie Abe
Was the shooter an American? It is the sort of barbaric act that happens there.
This will be the fate of Modi as well.
Que tristeza 😢
Most of people in East Asia really hate him due to his historical and political problems. But, R.I.P.
RIP.. Shnizo Abe
ご冥福をお祈りします
So sad that he dead

It sad to hear this tragic. I'm feel sorry for Japanese people for losing their great leader even he was ex-prime minister. RIP Shinzo Abe. 😔
They need stricter gun LAWS. NOW.
My deepest condolence & sympathy to the family of Shinzo Abe RIP
No matter how safe a country safe is…security for a president should be top priority not that they are special but their deaths can even cause wars
The idea of *QUAD* could never have came into existence without the visionary leader like *Mr. Shinzō Abe.* He made us realise how important it is to form a group like QUAD. _WE WILL MISS HONOURABLE SHINZŌ ABE_ ☮️🕊
praying for Abe-san.
I sincerely hope that this incident has no political involvement.
Good looking guy. Might be the governor of the Japan autonomous republic of Russia.
R.I.P
Rest in Peace Shinzo.  One of my favourite politian.

His security was useless. This could have been easily prevented. May he rest in peace!

So sad rip sir 😭🇫🇯

Good 👍
Why don't you call it for what it is...an ASSASSINATION? Maybe Western clowns are afraid of doing that for a strange reason.
Very sad news.Japan should remember his policy.

Rest in peace 🙏
Big loss to not only Japan but to Asia and democratic world.
Very unbelievable incident. Where were his security details? As a former prime minister was he not entitled to security guards? Very sad indeed. R I P. ABE. My condolences to his family.
But why
Heartbreaking . Rest in leace sir.Japan will remember your great leadership.
Sad for Japan Rest in peace sir
Very sad to hear that, May his soul Rip😔
May you rest in peace, you brave soul. You served your country well, Abe-san.
I can't believe people can shoot someone just like that. I am very sorry for the man and his family. Couldn't their security provide a better service?
笑顔のイメージが強くてそれがなおさら辛いです。ご冥福をお祈りします。
😞
May he Rest In Peace. Such a good leader. 🙏🏻
Gun was apparently homemade. This attack certainly is unfortunate, but you guys should educate yourself about Abe, his family etc. He was a war crime revisionist and Hardliner.
I thought  Japan always had strict gun laws .  RIP sir🙏
This is shocking from Japan
Major rising tensions with China, and suddenly this. I wonder what China's reaction to his death will be?
RIP ..
🙏🙏🙏🤲
RIP Abe
Nothing surprises me these days.  Lockdowns seem to have made some people more focused on their gripes.
Rip
Probably the worst security detail I have ever seen this guy missed his first shot and still managed to get a second off
Who kill him?
Really sad news. Awful seeing his last moments.
Rest in peace  Abe.Love from India 🇮🇳
So sad news
What a tragic ending….. Guardians who were standing there could have protected him. Now, our democracy is dying.
Hard to believe that Abe has died 🙏 RIP.
First goes Takahashi the creator of Yugioh and now this guy, the decline of Japan continues.
Shinzo abe, great prime minister Japan lost loved man....
This is so shocking!! 🇯🇵  almost feels unreal!!  condolences from  🇮🇳
Assassinated by C.... ... .. .... . ... operative.
Security? What security. As secure as a target at a shooting gallery.
This is so heartbreaking. Can't believe this incident is happened in such a peaceful country.
Legends never die, they remain in peoples heart. May his soul rest in peace☮️ During his tenure as Prime minister, Japan and India developed strong defence and cultural ties. He was a sincere and true leader. Respect from India 🇮🇳
Juh-pun.
He’s such a shitty leader
He knew certain things.
RIP
Nostradamus: when Luhansk falls,Boris and Abe falls.when Odessa falls,Biden and scholz falls.

It is very sad that these things happen to such good people. We are happy when this happens to the President and Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.🙏
I pray for your soul
He took a proactive stance toward the abductees, and his return to Japan, revitalizing the economy, and negotiating abroad were also wonderfully respectful. It is very sad that a prime minister was gunned down in a tragic incident
Dang what
RIP
Boris Johnson Just Cancels all his public speeches now!!! 👀
OMG, this should not happen. Shocking.
Aw man. Why would anyone want to kill him? Wasn't he rather humble? Even stepped down due to his concerns of his age.   And yes, very odd, you don't hear of things like this in Japan, let alone with a gun. Something's wrong...
