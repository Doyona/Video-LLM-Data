Amazing 🥰🥰🥰😂
Toyota Bronco Prado
If you're looking for an SUV that offers both power and style, the 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser is the perfect option. Built for the toughest terrains, it’s still efficient, safe, and incredibly spacious.
Bom desafiador de áreas difíceis de acesso
❤❤❤
The Land Cruiser is tough and ready for anything, but the bZ4X is a fantastic electric vehicle for everyday use, offering amazing range and all the benefits of going fully electric.
To be honest,the LC300 is the best looking Landcruiser in all models ,the car is a masterpiece best design ever
Bigger and more front engine.
Bruh the engine is just the same as the new Camry...
Is it going to be made in Mexico?
It's beautiful, but why would you want to put a 70k SUV through dirt roads, mud, rocks..I mean, I get the off-road  options, but when we go off road we take an older vehicle that I don't mind scratching the paint job, denting, etc.
Is there goanna be a 2 door 😮 it would look amazing i love it 😊
It seems america missed the generation of land cruisers before this one.
I feel like I’m watching a video for a new job orientation. Needs a more masculine voice
i hate design and shape of lc 250 series but lc 150 is good and antique my rating to lc 250 10/3
Funny to say this but if they have brought LC 300 to the US, all large SUV manufacturers would make almost zero car sale. Thus, the market is not free and protected by lobby cash.
Please come to Thailand
I want it 😭😭😭
Just got my 1958 and looking forward to having fun times. I had one question though which the dealership was not able to answer to my satisfaction. They asked me to reach out to Toyota. On the specs sheet difference between GVWR and Curb weight is 1687 Lb. On the sticker on the driver side, it says max payload is 1100 Lb. Why is there such a huge difference as the car was not optioned with anything other than cargo mats and edge guard.
I think should say on the front grill land cruiser, instead of toyota.
4 cylinder and no auxiliary but exterior amazing design
Now, this are called "features!!!".
Was gonna get this one but where is the third row seats and v6 engine?
Welcome back, Land Cruiser
Waiting for the 4.2 6L diesel engine!
I think the new designer is the past employee of the LandRover 😂
😳
Japan here you kill me i love this
Pity the Americans who think they're getting the real Land Cruiser, when all they get is a Prado.
Costco parking lots will be full of these soon!
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Nah
Toyota has the worst taste in brown interior shades.
Is it so powerful as LC of middle east or its nerfed one?
Completely ruined version there's no V6 and V8 also you removed the rear seat entertainment
Still want a V6
It should also offer the non-hybrid. Beside it does not comes with Lithium-ion batteries, nowadays all EV uses it but Toyota says nope. How unfortunate. It can cheaply build and sell then Lithium-ion batteries but expensive to replace them. When it’s faulty sure they will pay it to replace but if it wasn’t then you will pay it dearly.
😠 dont like prado 2024 please change 2025 please like me😁
Why no third row
No v8, UGH.  Yet another classic ruined.
TOYOTA ! Please ! bring us LC300 MODEL to the US
Glad to see the Land Cruiser Prado in the US as a Toyota and not just a Lexus GX. What are it's approach/departure angles?
6,000lb towing capacity!? How embarrassing to the Toyota brand
8.3" of ground clearance is embarrassing.
After seeing the new 4Runner I’m even more on board with this and the GX.
So exactly the same but with a worse engine.
So who else is here to compare this to the new 4Runner?
Ao the land cruiser and the 4runner have the same engine now?  No thankssss
This looks a million times better than Land Cruiser 2024 😍
I have three questions:  Is it possible to run only electric? What would the range of only electric be? Can the battery be charged externally?  Thanks Toyota
Kd o Brasil
Wish I could get one with leather, but NO hole in the roof.
Highly capable as always. Not knocking the boring interior BUT  5 outa 10 the front ,4 (yawn )for the side of it  , back or rear  is the worst part , looks  like a 2003 Cherokee chief. I know, I know these are bought for their go anywhere on any terrain but the design engineers do get a chance , roughly every 7 to 10 years to come up with a better effort than Toyota have now settled with till 2030 and beyond.  In fact the maps better pull their design socks up pronto , otherwise the likes of china.and Korea will consume their export market .
That looks terrible.  And just like a Nissan
🤮🤮
Whats the name of this Variant of land cruiser??😂😂
Hm
4 Cyl. why
Can't wait!
Best SUV ❤
with 2/3 seats its aprox close to 100.000usd, and if you want 5 seats its 180.000usd toyota norway.
This has what it takes to take some rich snob to the grocery store
You lost me at hybrid.
Is it bulletproof Though?
What is the price of this in America?
Trash go with the old V8.
Army green for this! Bring back the v6/v8!
Such a dream this vehicle is ...😮
That hybrid system is going to choke off road.
Looks like a cross between the 4Runner and the FJ cruiser.
the engine is quite small dont you think? how about a v6? or a v8?
Hoped  it reaches the philippine market
Just tired to buy one. 1st addition Toyota Dealership in Hackensack NJ tried to sell it to me for 20k over the 77k pricing. RIP OFF.
lc300 is 100% suv
Hopefully this car can come in exterior red color
Bring Back those old Japanese engineers please 😢
the bronco sport version of the LC.... mixed emotions
50k???? Maybe I'll afford a used one in 20 years 😂😂😂
Okay but WHEN do we get to get our hands on one??? Been waiting for this one!
I the  Toyota  is the best four  wheel  drive  second  to none
Ain't this suppose to have a center locker and a-trac also?
When do they start arriving?
Toyota gave big money to trumps re-election. I will never ever own another.
When will this be available? It's already 2024
Wait, did they say I need a subscription to start the car through the app?
6000 pounds of towing capacity for such a beast. It’s a shame that Toyota is more worried about fuel economy than quality anymore. Get rid of the turbo put an eight cylinder back in the truck in this thing is perfect. Unfortunately, especially in my state Toyota dealerships are terrible. I don’t want a vehicle that I can’t work on myself. I definitely do not pay the underpaid technicians to do their job better than I can.
I am waiting for price and configurator. Looks awesome but not sure if it's within my price range.  If its 4 runner territory I'll get it but if Sequoia that's too high for me.
Is not really amazing because defender more amazing😅.
HAD A TOYOTAT CAMRY LOVED IT
Why do cars these days have such ugly and distracting laptops on the dash?
It's back. 🥲
Give us the 4runner already
Please for the love of all things OffRoad offer a spec with a front locking diff, or a ARB spec or something!!! Please Please Please!!!
🤩
carbon neutral is such a cruel joke
Can’t wait for the +20% dealer markups
Why not put a naturally aspirated straight V6 engine instead?
This is an SUV, not like all those little things that car makers call SUVs.
You're headed in the wrong direction, Toyota. No to the crappy electric motor. Absolutely not. Why not a diesel option like you offer the rest of the world? And what happened to the hydrogen engine your president was stoked about?
It goes anywhere...and comes back. 👊
Trash hybrids. Bring back the V8s
My next vehicle!!!
I love when they put the name Toyota in the front and in steering wheel ❤ make the car really look great
This car is totally new, but it already looks vintage.
Give us diesel version
Can’t wait for the dealer mark ups ⬆️ wooooo 🎉
On my 3rd LC....   on way to St Pete Toyota to discuss this.....    looks exciting.
Mid January 2024 still not seeing them on the lots
4:06 Curious how 18-inch wheels put its "heritage front and center in the modern age." WTF does that even mean? None of them had 18s and no reputable off-road tires are made for 18s
1:56 2:22 2:37 Advice: You're Toyota. Invest in a couple drone shots instead of the dust wake of the camera car hitting your brand centerpiece shot
что за уродство? На дизайнеров денег не хватило
Look like a Lego car and I like.
Prefiero Land Cruiser Toyota o ya una 4runner le gana en eficiencia y confiabilidad 💪🏽💎
They copied the new Defender
So all of them are hybrids? I was so excited for these to come out.. I got upset when the 70 series will not be available in the US. And now I’m hearing that these are hybrids. Definitely going to pass on this. Can’t believe you people did this.
I just hope its priced right and interior space is good enough to match mini van space and comfort. Just match this two things and i will trade my odyssey for this one easy.
Can you compare it with the Hammer demon 🤔
2023 model is family+offroad car I think that is the best model in all landcruiser history
I dont think this car is family car anymore
No wonder land cruiser sales declining drastically in many countries. This car does not resemble land cruiser in any way. The outside is Toyota runner while the interior and the dash board is FJ cruiser. Toyota has gotten it totally wrong. You can't feel nor taste the Land cruiser feeling in all this latest technology packed together. It is not spacious too. 😢
It looks like a gimmick to me. If you want the next one above the base model it looks like you will be paying close to $80,000. This make the vehicle unaffordable and only affordable to the rich and high upper class.
With Toyota adapting into the off road style, I’d really really really love it if they could add removal doors or top or both like the other off road SUV competitors.
I think lc300 is better V6 twin turbo 3rd row  And looking a bit beautiful than the off roading style 🤔
Nice❤
Might as well call it turbo Rav4 2.4 Liter wannabe landcrusier
The front looks like a gundam
Beautiful car,  I wish to have the same vehicle, toyota land cruiser 2024
Not good looking
I love the focus on 4 to 5 comfortable seating positi9ns instead of adding a 3rd row. It looks very off road capable. If the price is mid 50s i may have to get one.
Is it a real one or baby cruiser. Where the market is there the supply¥ This could be a competition to bronco¿
garbage and ugly
Beautiful TOTOYA Land Cruiser model😊 wow....👍👍👍
All for the low cost of a house, a city apartment and 2 cars
Prease to bring back the round rights
Prado?
I'm guessing because Toyota can no longer lead the automobile industry, slacking way behind SUVs such as BYD U8 or Tesla Beast, so using "retro" and "rich history" to divert consumers' focus? Nothing excites nor surprises me as Toyota is still lost in their family design language and breakthrough technologies.
OK.
Wash without the third row......
Pathetic! Where's the V8? Where's the diesel? Just a crappy hybrid that will most likely spontaneously ignite and go up in flames. Toyota you should be ashamed. You are crapping all over the Landcruiser tradition.
( fyi   Toyota , the video at 5:30, the steering wheel,  has a error on the right side )
Excited for this to arrive...I just hope dealers stick to MSRP...I am sick of seeing all these market adjustments...
👍
Nice memories still fresh 🎉❤
Needs 3rd row
Now I want one! I think the new styling is great.
Too much tech. How long will that digital dash display last? What about that hybrid system? Will it last 20 years or 300,000km? I really was hoping for less tech, more old school like a wrangler but better as a daily driver. Oh well. I’m sure it will sell well though, it’s just not what I’m looking for.
Too bad it's not diesel.
@pentaxplus is getting some love and I’m all here for it.
I want one…..I can’t afford one, but I want one.
I wonder how much dealers going to charge for this.
I was thinking this would be a Toyota quality replacement for my WL Trailhawk, but it has less ground clearance than an Outback Wilderness, and not even close to 11.3” of my ride. Fingers crossed for the next 4Runner TRD Pro
A cruiser vith a 4banger? i'm sure they're going to be ever as reliable as the old model's reputation....  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Who is the bought this great stuff!?!?
I need it.
I want one!
I am so excited I want to purchase it.
Noooo!  A landcruiser should never be a Hybrid.  I have a 4Runner and an FJ.
Great car toyota land cruiser 2024" Thanks for sharing this video with us
Back to basics love it, now I'll have to fight my wife on who gets to drive it. The vehicle we have been pinning for, for years
best car for Worldtour is landcruiser but mileage is worst
bronco much better and if you can pay for nissan patrol its the real deal,today land cruiser is for sissy woke...
I have 2012 Tundra, and I love my Toyota.  I get it fixed when needed, and one day, when it’s time to retire it as a snow plow truck…I want this Land Cruiser or a Sequoia.  We live rural and I need a tough vehicle.  I love Toyotas.
Went to 3 Toyota dealerships today and nobody knew anything about when these are coming out 😢
Toyota is on the way to lose big market arround the world on their   land cruiser series seriosly 😢 Many Chinese and huge elictrification age is coming very soon 😢
2013 Lc better than this.
Latest tundra and sequoia just shows how fast Toyota went downhill. Way tooooooooo much cheap plasticky design. Turbo issues and no guts either. = 🤢 🤮 will stay with the v8 tundra and v6 4.0 tacoma. Even 3.5L tacoma is garbage. Their new land cruiser and most likely 4runner will be garbage. If anyone wants headache free vehicle, buy the last suv/truck that doesn’t have a turbo, either 4.0V6 or v8. On the flip side, still can’t beat TDI - power, MPG, And longevity wise. Toyota should just close their doors and go out of business, as they are sliding downhill, fast.
amazing in all ways possible!
If it's got a big 6, and not some crappy 4cyl turbo or useless hybrid, it could be interesting. Otherwise, hard pass. If I can't repair it in back country, I can't use it. I'm not an electrical engineer.
Personally I think its great but its a disaster for the thousands of desert safari companies and drivers accross the Middle East who use the 7 seat  LC200 as their workhorse. Without the luxury and room they will be forced to go towards the Nissan Patrol...
How much this land cruiser in the Philippines
I’m so happy to be working for Toyota!  It’s the best automobile company to work for.
"No more boring cars" is real
Replace the trails and rock with paved streets and kids going to soccer practice and that is how 95% of buyers will be using this 🤣
Hopefully they have more leg room than tacomas
One of the best desighns
i just wonder how come there is no DIESEL HYBRID cars,suv's,and trucks out there,is it because it would give extreme MPG's that someone does NOT want to happen hmmmm????!!!!!
At least make it a v6!
Nice vehicle, but a nope on the price $50k ? Oh hell no
Poor design of the front grill so open allowing for hwy rocks and debris to damage the radiator. Check other off road suv or trucks and see all have rocks defection by the grill  design. Poor design of the front grill
Where's the V8?
I need the 3rd row!!!!!
Toyotas are amazing. I only wish their bumpers would be as thick as the Jeep Wrangler’s though.
This new 'Land Cruiser' is symptomatic of all new vehicles: too many electronics, too expensive, no longevity, and complexity that defies belief. I will NEVER buy any new Toyota truck or car again. I have owned a 1996 80 Series, a 2003 100 Series, a 2006 100 Series, and a 2008 200 Series Land Cruisers. With the exception of the 200 Series, all of these trucks were made to last forever by simple maintenance. The 200 Series cost of maintenance skyrocketed compared to the earlier models, but still an amazing truck. The new 2024 model seen here is simply disgusting. Since I no longer car camp in remote off-road sections of CO, AZ, or UT, there is no need for a Land Cruiser. Based upon the new vehicles being made today, my 2011 Tundra will stay in my garage until taking my last breath. Thank you Toyota for building the best and most reliable vehicles, so sorry you were forced to build the complete junk seen in this video.
I cried every time he said “available”. But I still love it
Cute, but less clearance than a Tacoma, and it does not offer a manual transmission. Next??
The new Land Cruiser looks amazing. Hoping to get one soon. But what’s up with the names of those colors?  "Underground" (grey?), "meteor shower"(yellow?),  "ice cap" (white?)
4 cylinder turbo? Turbo motors are not reliable. Very problematic.
If only this Land Cruiser is like this in Malaysia. 😞
this is one of the few suv’s I respect. So many are just grocery getters, and the offroading capability comes second for them. But Land Cruiser’s are god tier vehicles for all conditions.
I love the styling but will have a hard time justifying a new one. If this was true to LC heritage, it would be powered by a big dumb NA 6 pack, straight or V, that is proven to run a million+ miles. You swallow the price for it's dependability, and I can't see this drive train lasting 30+ yrs.
But it is too big SUV
Land Cruiser does what Land Rover can't.
I hate it.
Count me in I was going to buy a new off-road vehicle when I came across this and I’m going purchase one for sure
I think, there should be a limited edition with the visual interior of a 70's FJ40.
Any updates about Fortuner 2024 model @ Toyotausa
Blom masuk indonesia toyota land cruiser terbaru untuk 2 model terbaru
Land cruiseri prado ilə qarışdırmayın!
If this ever comes as a PHEV it'll be an automatic buy
When it will come in India
Bring the HiLux back to the US
Me want
Everything is near perfect with this but the fact you dont even have an OPTION for a regular engine is not something I love
8.3” of ground clearance ☹️ the current aging 4Runner has 9.6”….
You lost me at 4cylinder turbo
❤
No V6 ?!?!? 😪
Planned obsolesence...Toyota admits the new 2024 Land Cruiser is a "light duty" off road vehicle. More like a Mall Crawler. Smh... Toyota has lost their history and therefore their future.
Even though Toyota quality not as used to be ,  but stil among rubbish competition one of the best.
how much per one? i want 10s
ok i will order one
Love this new look Finally a nice design, more than 20 years without an amazing and robust design,  ❤🎉 Congratulations to designers
Finally a nice design, more than 20 years without an amazing and robust design,  ❤🎉
There is absolutely no way that you were going to have a turbo charged engine that will be as reliable as a naturally aspirated engine. You have ruined the brand.
Copy of defender
People want the the 70 series NOT THIS. We already got the 4Runner
Why Toyota no uses that design for a truck
That back deck where the batteries are stored is too high. Makes it a no go for me and others. Too bad. Otherwise I love it.
i think my journy with land crusiser SUV will end with the LC300 i rather get the diffender than this  new look .. its cool but i dont like it
hell naw i will stick with the LC3002023
i am saving up now
The off road angles suck!! the Defender is still the best!
Hello Toyota. Is there going to be a 3 door version? Thank you.
4 cylinder engines??? Really???
It's pretty crazy that they were able to cram 320hp and over 450ftlbs of torque in a 4 cylinder.
These cars are a bit cheaper but once they hit the sales floor, you know they’re gonna double
2:10 😅   🍼👶🏾baby engine.
This looks amazing, really nice work toyota.
It looks like the FJ Cruiser...
Why do they call it full-time 4WD and not AWD? Is there no limited slipping or something? It's like my Rubicon on 4HI on the highway?
I can't believe that the drivetrain will have more than a fraction of the reliability Land Cruisers of the past have had.
Be nice with a 4.0 or V8
rav4もこういうデザインの方がいいよ。
Soon Jeep and ford Branco will be buy one get one free 😂
Perfect car for Connecticut’s roads. 😆
So its a four door FJ cruiser?
This is the New FJ Cruiser with 4 doors
That's a boxy FJ Cruiser
Has anyone from arab nation bought it in bulk???
4Cylinder? I dunno
Love the interior dash
really good looking
Please bring the 1958 edition also to Europe 🇪🇺 farmers, horse owners, hunters etc. will love it 🌾🐎🐗
okay, where are the V6 & the V8?
Bye bye Bronco
Can someone tell me why Subaru OBW has over a foot more of ground clearance than this? 8.3 vs 9.5
When God made Toyota he was showing off.
Brink back the FJ Cruiser ! 🙏
Huge credits on the dash and front seat organization
2024 toyota Land Cruiser 250 ( gazoo racing ) ?
I was all excited when I saw this video. it’s a beautiful vehicle, but then I found out it’s only offered in a hybrid. What a bummer.
No independent rear suspension 🥱
Please bring back the OG design. You could've just refined it a bit more, also I heard the there will be no v6. The hell are you thinking, bring it back.
hybrids suck - mic drop
Toyota you need to bring the Mini Landcruiser here, the one that looks like Suzuki Jimney, you need to bring more young people to Landcruiser.
It should look more like the 50 series land cruiser. And be BEV, that thing could have a massive battery. It would probably demolish Cybertruck sales. Go with the Primary color on the bottom and white on top and you would capture the over 50 market entirely.
Why is it only available in 4 cylinder
Toyota downsized land cruiser to a 4 runner?
This is why I love Toyota’s!!!!
I was all in........until it was disclosed this has a 4-cylinder turbo. Just nuked ability to tow with this thing, which is crucial for overlanders and those who have boats.
Consumers: Bring back the Jeep Cherokee XJ!! Jeep: .... Toyota: Hold my beer 🚙
Well, i found my next car
Why is the auto industry only introducing really expensive products . A company should focus on introducing lower priced options ?   Governments should subsidize more modest modes of vehicles .
At least give us a V6 engine option - no hybrid, no turbo
Super  monster truck Toyota landcruiser❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sht I thought this was a 30 seconds ad with this guys voice lol
Please Toyota have some good Color Options, So sick of White, Black, Blue Red and Grey colours.
When 4runner hybrid, please? It’ll be easier for me to make up my mind once I see the new 4runner. Btw, will the new 4runner also have NiMh battery? Lithium-ion seems too sensitive to temperature.
Copy of defender
You went from a V8 to a 4 cylinder?  😂😂 At least go V6 turbo, wow. Just killed the legend.  It you will have a bunch of earth “savers” clapping because they are use to Prius power.
I bought mine in April, but they called it the 4Runner
Why no 2.8 diesel in the US?
Taste's differ.
How bout informing ONE thing that that has not been covered by Everyone on the internet has not covered !!!!!
@ TOYOTA - could you please give us the actual Land Cruiser 300 too? Pretty pease? Everybody else in the world has it, why not those of us in the US? I thought we were your best customer, why are we being deprived from your best SUV. At least give us one edition of it, the GR SPORT. Oh and if you do decide to give us the Land Cruiser 300 GR Sport, please upgrade the rear end, the current one looks good everywhere except the rear end, it looks like a cargo van, give it a slanting rear end kind of like other Toyota SUV’s like the Sequoia, Highlander, Rav4, etc, to give it that sporty/luxury appearance instead of that boxy cargo van type of a look. Please give it the tundra hybrid engine and interior too bcuz the current interior looks doesn’t look very American. PLEASE Toyota.
Sweet ride, but I wish the LC200 was still available
what is not clear is whether this will be available to global markets or it's an America only line up 😕
It's a darn shame they didn't put the Powertrain from the Tundra/Sequoia into this model.  The offered powertrain is underwhelming.
I love the color! ❤
PLEASE hurry up and announce the new 4runner 😭😭
This is so clean. I want one
Steve Jobs must have done something right in 2007 while introducing the iPhone because Everybody has emulated that format. Long live Steve Jobs.  Thank you Toyota for having brought back the legendary Land Cruiser nameplate to US shores and beyond; just when I was considering a 2008 FJ cruiser . Well done, Toyoda san
Take my money 😂
Love the boxy shape❤❤ love Toyota
Price
Why did y'all not call this "4Runner", it looks like a 4runner inside in every way possible....
Wowwww 😮
How can I be a driver for Toyota?
🔥🔥🔥 Is this Land Cruiser designed for a 25 year service life? 🔥🔥🔥
Toyota! let us make a purchase through your site without all these dealerships just like Tesla. All these dealerships slaping us 5k- 20k markups
Это уже не внедорожник.
Well, after having a Nissan Patrol, a Land Rover Discovery, a Kia Sorento and in 2018 a Land Cruiser 150, it is the first time that I have changed the entire clutch in a car (with only 50,000 km). It seems that I am not the only one that has happened to him. The Toyota warranty looks the other way. I have been driving with a manual transmission for 40 years, I think it is not due to misuse. From buying the best vehicle, to being totally disappointed. I HOPE THEY HAVE SOLVED THIS PROBLEM.
Why would i buy this over a forerunner or vise-versa
4cylinder?
overpriced
defender cousin brother
Loved it until the no tailgate part.   Has to have a tailgate to be a true Land Cruiser!
I fear about engine in EU but since it's a hybrid maybe they keep that motor..
Degrading the NAME! 4-cylinder Hybrid and only tows 6000lbs...WTF! This is NOT a Land Cruiser! 70 years of heritage out the door! I'll keep my 100 series Land Cruiser!
Do not be fooled. This LAND CRUISER   iteration is only "looking and bluffing," mechanically speaking and performance wise it has less than a 4Runner. Very disappointed. Land Cruiser a 2.4 liter motor, boxed frame,  Are  you kidding me? Turbo ? This is a joke !! WHen you are in the wild, you need simple and rugged reliability, easy to repair stuff, not  coloring, electronics and BS stuff. Very,  disappointed.
Bro 200series  v8 5.7 best durable  Lc this literally a joke baby of beast if do regular  offroad this thing is gonna sleep soon.only thing impressed  me some interior detailing are appreciatable
I’m getting one
This is prado, isnt it?
Toyota; give us price breakdowns and open up the waitlist already!! :)
Thats a Prado , why are you calling it a Land Cruiser ?  The 200 series is a completely different veichle ... Cant believe I'm tellin that to Toyota USA 😅😅
I think the Landcruiser and 4Runner should stay with Normal Gas Engines. Specially if you’re off-roading in desert areas. It’s gonna be too hot for Batteries.
Do I question the longevity of the powertrains reliability, yes. Am I looking forward to tricking one of these out, for sure
It’s back!
Best you can get on 4
8.3” ground clearance seems a little low. Was expecting at least 9”
Land Cruiser or Bronco.  Toyota all day everyday!
Matthew 13:18-23 18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
めちゃカッコいい！ランドクルーザー迫力と安定感ある。
Hi, is this landcuriser redesign of Prado which is present in UAE etc?
The ugliest Land Cruiser since it was produced
Enthusiasts better buy it, or Toyota will become boring again
take my money already
Looks sweet, and I have a lot of confidence in Toyota. That said, high powered batteries are still a new frontier, especially as it relates to longevity and durability, areas where Toyota usually excels. I do wonder how long these batteries which powers a substantial amount of the vehicle’s motor
🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮
I don't know if I missed it but what is the towing capacity?
Why Toyota can't make foldable seats that are fully flat for people who use them for camp/sleep in a vehicle?
2door?????
Looks and feels like a Gshock square. Sick.
"Off road capabilities" like anyone is going to take it off-road, this car is going to be bought by middle-aged balding men for their stay at home trophy wife and it's going to be used to drive little Timmy to soccer practice and back.
Subscription cost to use car features? 👎
Shes ready to crawl those mall parking lots
4 cylinder??? Is this a joke??? 😂😂😂
Hate the new engine
W toyota
I love the look and chassis etc. but how are you gonna squeeze long term reliability/durability out of a small complicated turbo charged hybrid etc etc engine. Doesn’t sound like a recipe for long term
this is actually embarrassing. how does Toyota go from having powerful land cruisers that are used by diplomats and embassy's and drug lords... to a bs ugly bronco looking car? wtf? big L for toyota... and I guarantee you they going to lose millions on this one cause no middle Easterns [ #1 land cruiser buyers] going to buy this junk.
Introducing. . . The Land Loser
Japan is BACK. Godzilla is back!!
I think I like it!
0:37 powered exclusively by non-renewable fossil fuels and token amount of hybrid to tick emissions regulation … why not build an EV? This would *destroy* Rivian if they made it fully electric. ⚡️
Can we get a diesel in the states and the option to have a solid front axle
It’s crazy I work at the best dealership in the Northwest Vancouver toyota and we will probably see a dozen or so if we’re lucky in one year. But you could be that lucky one ask for Matthew Townsend. I would be extremely grateful to deliver one of these.
I really like the round headlights and low spec with manual seats
I want it so bad!!!!!
That’s right Mercedes and defender, watch out!!!😱❤
I hate it! I'll just keep the 4Runner as my pick
Couldn't believe such a reputable auto manufacturer has played a TRICK to fool the North American's with a Low grade Prado as a Land Cruiser! I my self have Four Toyota 4x4's and my fifth will Be a NISSAN ARMADA/Y62 Patrol. Bring LC 300 or rename the prado as a Prado.
It's so cool. I wish I could come to Korea. I will buy it no matter what
lost me at hybrid
Y’all ruined the Land Cruiser!! Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse…. It did. You made the opposite of what ACTUAL Land Cruiser overlanders want, yet made this trash affordable. Wow… pathetic
U guys will take a $60,000 or more vehicle off road 🤥
I think this model is replacing the FJ  and the Prado in one shot
Toyota bronco Land Cruiser 😂
If another adaptation of the novel Jurassic Park ever happens, I hope Toyota finally gets their chance to turn these into the park's tour vehicle.
From v8 to v4 rest in peace Land Cruiser
JLR defender left chat
Just take my money Toyota!!!!!
my dream❤❤❤❤😘😘😘
It's Bold, Muscular, and Iconic
1:17 8.3''' of ground clearance?? What?!?!?!!? A CX-50 and all Subarus have better GC than that...
My dream offroad car 😎
This is a joke and just goes to show how out-of-touch Toyota is with their suv customer base. People have been wanting a return of the FJ for years yet instead they bring back a vehicle nobody asked for. This literally just looks like 'another' Bronco. Zero aesthetic appeal and generic-looking af.
They need to shorten the hood by about 3 feet and put the electric battery under the vehicle. Then remove the 3rd row seeting and shorten the lenge of the rear by 3 feet. Then when you have something resembling the Gen 1 Scion Xb starting at $35,000 and getting 45mpg we can talk
Waiting for the FJ to be made again.
SWEET!
It is just a Prado. Name?game? So disappointed about nowadays Toyota.
You copy the real KING land rover defender
Why can’t we get the one they make in Australia   This looks like a Ford bronco sport the crappy version missed a huge opportunity with a a lot of buyers
I dont know why but these guys are making Landcruiser dead
Europe gets the small diesel only !! Wish I can have a diesel !! , for that reason I’m keeping my 2010 .
Wow Tundra https://youtube.com/shorts/1OxXG3v_l48?feature=share
Sooo where's the affordable sister of the land cruiser at? I'm talking about the 4runner.
My 2021 Toyota Avalon TRD's battery is dead. It's a brand new car from Toyota USA, with only 19,000 miles on it. Why did this have to happen, especially when you're trying to go to work and your car doesn't start in the morning? #toyotausa
Seems like copying from Land rover defender hahaha good job
It looks a bit like a LEGO car
After defender now all manufacturers will go for the old vibe in SUVs which is a good thing
Love it❤
Idk with all this electronics connected to the engine.
Glad to see Toyota is moving away from their weird looking bulldog grills. This car looks great!!!☺️
4 cylinders in land cruiser 😂 come on Toyota give us bigger engine
Toyota’s main bread and butter is Corolla and Camry plus all their other cars sell themselves. Toyota stopped making the main Land Cruiser for US, plus they have Lexus LX470, because they were too expensive (2022-2023 Heritage edition was/is like $100K!) and didn’t make enough sale on it or not sold as many compared to domestic like Chevy/GM or Ford, or so they introduced a little smaller version to compete with likes of Bronco, Wrangler, etc plus nowadays everyone mostly buys crossovers or suvs because they are popular and Toyota wanted that market share as well. I mean they don’t even make the FJ Cruiser anymore, but they are still expensive used! Looks like this one took the side mirrors from the FJ cruiser 😮.
why does it  look like a hammer 3?
GOOD JOB. Affordable and back to basics. Can't wait to see them on the road.
New TLC Prado for $60k
لقد عشقتها منذ النظره الأولى 😢
Everyone wants to be like a Ford.
Hi toyota, Toyota have to  built Gas paddle touch the floor not make your leg so tired❤❤
Is it land cruiser parado or v8?
Have they tested a few of them going through Rubicon? Like a Bronco did? Let's see what they look like after that
🌟🔥
Follow the lead of Ford and stop tolerating dealer markups. Send them  - and us - a message.  It's all over the internet already and is ruining the excitement for the new models. The brand is tarnished by dealer markups and behavior. The Land Cruiser is the dream vehicle for many of us and now the price is lowered - except it's not when you get to the dealers. Show us you can find a way to fix it and be the industry leader that you are!
Hopefully, the nex gen of Fortuner design will get inspiration from car. Retro design in modern car, good job TOYOTA 👍
#LegoCar
Stuff like this is why Toyota has become my favorite manufacturer. Solid work guys!
Does it come with rounded headlights and rectangular ones as well,like in this videos
I think this model will do well.  It looks like it belongs to this era.  Let's see how it does in the long term.  After the hype settles down.
Is that IForce Max engine reliable?
Dull boxy 90’s design 😢.  Toyota Dealer price gouging will reach new highs. 🤮  1958 edition available 2058. 😡
I never build all and all social frame me as destroying my points exams. They leave me for my dying after I try report database about all companies transport kind.
If Toyota decide to keep it affordable in range of CAN $59950.- I will consider
It looks more rugged, but the previous land cruiser had a much more luxurious exterior. The rear of this is like a decade old jeep or ford..
Didn’t they just come out with the current one? 😅
Hard pass until there's an EV model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhzKZ3w3tjU
How about a front grill color option for LC with the round headlights: White grill-bezel around the Toyota decal, and white around the headlights, with matching white roof.
Please give the Land Cruiser a manual too please for the love of god
A 6k pound vehicle with a 4 banger? Lol.... I bet that wont last 200k plus.
This is probably going to be the best SUV on the market
Holy shit its actually here!!!!!!!!!
Taco or Landcruiser?
Can you please ensure your dealers don’t mark these up???
Price?
Fantastic ❤❤❤
WHY DID YOU DO THIS? Keeping my 200 LC or I'll do the new GX. I absolutely haaaaate 4 cylinders.  The LX is too flashy. I can't believe you only brought the prado here. Please bring the full size 300.
👍💖👍Thank you!
I’ve always been a Jeep owner (7 wranglers, 1 KJ Liberty), but I want to buy this Land Cruiser and make it my trail guide filming vehicle. I’m just frustrated with the way Jeep as a company is heading.
Why would you make it this ugly?
Thinking range 85-125k for all the features
*No 3 windshield wipers?  EPIC FAIL!  Hard Pass!*
No vehicle will ever be carbon 0 until they come up with a new brake system 🤔💡
I like the shape. I don’t like how it appears to lack power for its size. Though Subaru does wild things with a 4-cylinder, so who knows. Now make a more capable sequoia for those of us that need a bigger vehicle
i love this new cruiser it looks boky just like the original
Next target of corrupt politician here in philippines😂
This one looks (blue) better than the other model.. lol i wish Toyota would do a better job with the wheels
OMG!!❤❤❤
This is absolutely the look how Offroad+ Luxury + Modern superpower vehicles should have. Absolutely stunning. Thanks Toyota for giving the legendary look and feel, back.
So nice! I can’t wait to get it.
Way to go Toyota , amazing vehicles as usual ❤
Toyota has launched two redesigns of gas powered motors with previously dismal gas mileage and now putting turbo 4cyl engines in these redesigned vehicles. Why no mention of estimated gas mileage? Is it because there is a minimal mileage improvement? I am not onboard with the engine choice for off-roading.  I think Toyota believes their vehicles only go to soccer practice and the mall.  I am awaiting to see how they water down the 4runner when announced.
legendary great machine. It will be successful
i hate it
Doesn't look like a land cruiser... Not recognizable... Toyota had FJ land cruiser...
...round headlights....
Love the new Land Cruiser but I wonder what the Toyota Prado will look like.
4 cylinder turbo hybrid. That’s a pass. Looks nice though.
Shut up and take my money
Yes I'd love one but life says no 😢
Land Rover Defender ki tarah lag rhi h😮
The design looks like it should have a standard V6 or V8 in it. I am worried with the hybrid setup, this new version won't be able to run forever like the old LC's.
Lost me on “exclusively hybrid”.
Thanks toyota
It looks like a Lego but that's really cool.
Trop d'électronique pourrait être un désavantage cependant j'espère être surpris
If the FJ, 4Runner and LC had a love child it might be the 2024 LC
I'm signing up.
What’s the interior room like? I’m tired of cramped Toyotas. I don’t see how anyone over 6 feet drives one.
I have a 1967 FJ45LV in the heritage blue with white roof. I am so excited to see Toyota going back to its roots. Just put my deposit in and now will have a beautiful pair of bookends.
Looks awesome! When is the new 4-Runner out with similar styling & design??
Me gusta land cruiser para toda la familia
Looking forward to this vehicle.   I just wish you had the back row seats as an add on option.
I need this
Looks like a Bronco
Looks like a 2024 Isuzu Trooper. Hopefully this drives down the price on the much more stylish 4runner!
not a huge suv fan but 1 this has actual off-road capabilities 2 it looks dope as hell
I dig it, but that appearance is inspired by the Ford Bronco
What will happen to landcruiser 300.. the one which was not available in us market...
What will happen to landcruiser 300.. the one which was not available in us market...
Don’t forget the +20% dealer markup!
This is incredible. My new dream truck. My favorite thing about it is the fact that it's gonna be totally unaffordable. Yay! I hate rich people.
Electric!?  No thanks!
Looks kinda jeepy on the back... I dont like it
Hybrid 😂😂😂😂
Looks like a lowkey cullinan
Bring the land cruiser lc300 in north america
Ugly AF
Am in love with a Toyota design for the first time🥹❤️its beautiful
Love boxy bodies but the front bumper needs a little work tho I’m probably just put a bull bar bumper on it.
Ford is gonna take notes from the gauge cluster making it look similar to this in there mid cycle refresh for the mustang
Omg...😱😱
Looks like the defender
best LC ever
So this is basically the new 4runner
何でハイブリッドは北米と中国だけなんだろ？日本にもマイルドハイブリッドだけじゃなくて普通のハイブリ入れて欲しいのに…こんな暑い日が続くし、もうガソリン車乗りたくないし、ハイブリッドかPHVだったら買うのにっていう日本人、多いと思うけどなぁ…
Remote start for a subscription service fee? Screw that. Y'all MFrs gotta stop milking your customers dry.
looks like a defender here and there
GOOD JOB TOYOTA!
The seven-seater is gone? SIgh!
Defender🫨
Are we sure that Toyota didn't mix up their marketing and this is actually supposed to be the 2024 4Runner instead of the Land Cruiser? Lol  I wonder what they'll do to the 4Runner since they look to be about the same size
I’m so happy right now. Im seeing some FJ Cruiser in this too, and I couldn’t be happier to see it again. You knocked this out of the park, Toyota. I’m at a loss for words. That’s how good this thing looks.
Wow new defender looks amazing 😂😂
I'm pretty bummed about the departure of the drop-down tailgate.
No electric motor for the rear wheels ?
Pricing?
But I Love TRJ150 more ❤
I will take the new sequoia all day every day over the ugly Land Cruiser 😂
Honestly if they mess up the next gen 4Runner like this with a hybrid engine and mandatory driver assist stuff, they deserve to go out of business.  I was super excited to see this launch but it's just a Hipster Highlander.  I was waiting to see what they did w/ this, but now I'd way rather have a Bronco or an Ineos Grenadier.  Give me a reason to buy a Toyota, don't screw up the 4Runner - gas engine, manual transmission option, no standard driver assist BS.  Come on...
😂😂😂Copy from Land rover defender 😂😂😂😂😂
The Land Cruiser I know is big and nice looking😔
Total crap.  Hybrid is the ONLY option and the robo-driving tech package is STANDARD???  All the old Landcruisers still going strong with their basic reliable parts are rolling over in their graves.  Why not just call this the Hipster Highlander, don't sully the name of an offroading legend with this hybrid techy crap.
Thank you to the great minds at Toyota! You really knocked it out of the park!
ABOUT THE TIME !!!
Large diameter wheels and low profile tires not intended for off road
The best part is it is NOT Three Row seating.
I dig boxy shaped SUV's (I have a 2010 FJ), but something about this design seems a little too much like a toy, and the back is kind of modern and ugly. I think the Bronco is a much more attractive vehicle, but I'm glad the Land Cruiser is back
They ruined it. There's not even a hint that it is a land cruiser  Its a completely different vehicle what they did to land cruiser  :/
Toyota Defender
Not appreciated
still no 360 deg camera?
I love the boxy look coming back. Jeep Patriot reboot!!!!
Good old fossil fuel burning monster right down my street.
Really nice, my 05 4Runner may be getting a friend.
I'm sorry...  But why bring the Land Cruiser Prado to America, and not the actual Land Cruiser?  Then again, the average person wouldn't know and / or care.  Either way, hopefully it sells well.
This looks great. How will this not cannibalize the 4Runner though?
what's this Bronco copy piece of shit?
V4 turbo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bummer that it’s only available with the hybrid turbo 4. I would have been interested if it had the turbo 6 at least, preferably non-hybrid.
In the US? Thought it was discontinued?
Well at least you didn't put an ugly ass mustache around the grill like you did on the Tundra. But that 2.4 turbo will generate so much extra heat and pressure that no one expects it to have longevity that was the main reason so many of us have bought Toyota.
So this is replacing the 4runner?
Hybrid 💩
starting at basemsrp of probably like $59,999 lets goooooooooooooooooooo
All new prado ❎  All new FJ cruiser ✅
Thats one messy engine bay though
wow it looks like every other car on the road wow, starting MSRP will be overpriced for literally nothing new wow
Please i beg you make a two door version 🙏
Thankyou Toyota for bringing this ICONIC Truck back! Thankyou!!!
Great technology. I’ll wait for the next design
hiding remote start behind a subscription is slimy.
This thing looks amazing, if I get tired of my 22 Camry Hybrid I would look at this....only problem is I love my camry.  Only negative point i see....That radio power button. what they hell were you guys thinking!!
I didn't watch the video after they said  it has a 2.4L engine.
Perfect off roader without cosmetics.
honestly I'm kinda tired of SUVs that are the size of an entire lane, harder to drive on both trails and on road
This looks really great. Will it be available in the UK?
OK Toyota but where is my COPACT CRUISER EV!!! The car looked amazing and seemed like something I would drive & buy on the spot (Because it's a rugged yet compact SUV)
What a joke one motor option and it’s only a 4 cylinder Toyota dropped the ball on this one
holy shit this is the most hyped ive been for a new vehicle in years
They just need to call it the Lexus Land Cruiser. Wayyyyy too expensive of an SUV for the average person nowadays. America needs affordable cars not luxury cars lmao.
Cheap Defender 😂
Love it! Cant afford it.
Looks like a Bronco
Why Toyota you don't bring these cars to india we are eagerly waiting
One word   GREAT
It’s to bad it’s the terribly bad reliable I force
The old school Toyotas developed a solid reputation as off road reliable legends, and it was well deserved, two solid axle, good approach, break over and departure angles, sure this is a nice suv, but nowhere close to the old school solid axle LC, the front suspension lacks suspension travel, im very disappointed, I’d like to see Toyota come out with a real off road version with two solid axles, disconnecting sway bars maximum 17” rims on 35” tires and a small diesel, then it would be competitive against the bronco or the Jeep rubicon, this is a nice soccer moms crossover with some off road capabilities, a step above a Subaru…sorry Toyota,  off road enthusiasts all share the opinion on how pathetic the front suspension on all Toyotas are, limited wheel travel is the biggest.
Love it but no NA engine option???????? Or any other option at all???? Missed the mark on that one
Is there anyone here thinking about the engine lack of option? Why only one option and 4 Cylinder ? I wish there was a full electric version or a 6 Cylinder.
front look kind of remind me of defender 💀💀💀
"Iconic....'Boxy Design....'Back'"
NO on the 4 cy Turbo!
I’m a Jeep guy… I just trust their off-road capabilities more than anyone, at the moment. However, here you get the reliability of Toyota. It also looks similar to the Australian models I love. I’m heavily interested in trading in for this.  My goodness, it’s awesome.
I'm a diehard FJ40 fan n owner, and i dissapointed in toyota in not going electric with all fleet including this new LC. 😢
I see a Land Rover Defender type of look
Why everyone is calling it Prado except for Toyota ?
rezamblance of ford bronco
Broncow?
Carversal op
Calling a 4Runner w/ FJ Cruiser styling cues a “Land Cruiser” is not the same thing as a the flag ship vehicle.  It doesn’t honor the heritage as it should.  Not knocking 4Runners or FJ Cruisers, they’re based on Land Cruiser Prado, which this is too; however, not selling the 300 Series LC in the states and encouraging would be buyers to get a Sequoia or this thing with “1958” or “First Edition” options is just sad.  It’s like Toyota is mocking its consumers.
This honestly comes off as damn near perfect for someone like me. I currently have a pretty decently built 08 FJ, but due to some health and overall time issues, I rarely make it to the trails/travel at this point. With it being my daily when I do get out, I’m fillin up far too often. Never been one huge on creature comforts but if they’re available, I won’t say no. Just a tad bit more interior space than I need for just me myself and the pup, but that means extra sleeping space. This pretty much does everything I need it to do while not needing too much after market work to spruce up. May have to start the process of selling my FJ while the market still loves ‘em.
Will this come available in manual transmission?
The blend of modern features with nods to the classic look, like the round headlights reminiscent of the FJ Cruiser, makes it a compelling choice for me :)
Wtv, it's hybrid.....
Is there a manual transmission option?
nah thanks, I stick with my Jeep Wrangler
Is it just me but does this car look old already just after a few days!
This look nice
Have always been a Land Cruiser fan (had 4 of them), HOWEVER, time has moved on, and Toyota has not.  This "new" Land Cruiser might have been fine 15-20 years ago.  Rivian is the one for me now.
Off road capabilities? Would love to see this Land Cruiser at the Borneo Safari International Off-Road Challenge. Bring your camera crew. Seems like Isuzu is way ahead on publicity
What is the cargo length in order to sleep in it please?
All gasoline please.
the most important thing is that they missed how is a small engine hybrid combo better than a big single engine? they should talk about that to convince buyers.
Looks like my FJ Cruiser just went up in value,  and my 2022 Nissan Armada (Patrol) is definitely the correct choice.
Bring back FJ CRUISER 🔥🔥
😍
defender
This will be me and my father’s next vehicle ❤🎉
Elegance is Gone  😑
Australian version is the best version.
That's a 300 or a forcemax?
Before they became Yuppie status wagons the Landcruiser was king.
This evokes the feeling of a souped-up 80 Series. Well done, Toyota for going back to off-roading roots!
couldn't get uglier than this!
The interior looks so cheap, I guess I'll just get a used land cruiser
FUEL ECONOMY???
This absolutely like shut up to consumers cry of rigid tough old land cruisers...😂 Welldone Toyota ❤😊
Should've been a seven seater with the flip-to-the-sides third row. I love that option.
looks similar to defender
It is a typical TOYOTA-style interior. looks cheap
You $300k after Market adjustments
It's an old style Jeep Cherokee.
Was expecting LC 300 series and all we got in US is wannabe defender. Not OK with this box Toyota, bring back the big rig.
Needs a true V6, not a 4cyl. Definitely a Prado and not really a Land Cruiser like we had, much smaller. I think we need a small FJ cruiser again that would sell in the 30s to 40k. The biggest problem is your lots are empty still 3 years after 2020 with no end in sight. I want to see Toyota ramp up production so we can actually walk into dealers and buy cars again at normal prices. Sorry but I'm not ordering a minivan and waiting months... nope.
Nailed it!
God, Why my life cannot afford a Land Cruiser 😢
😍
Wait, why it look different compare to latest gen Land Cruiser in my country?
Bronco follower
Does it make sense if you don’t ever plan to take it anywhere near off-road??
sell it directly to the customer, plz.  eliminate the vile "dealers!"
Can anyone speak to the likelihood of Toyota making a smaller LC-like vehicle? I love the boxy/rugged look, but have length restrictions. Any input would be appreciated!
I wanna see a Twin turbo V6
the new 2024 disappoimting  Lots of basic plastic everywhere, no wireless charger, smaller screens, manual cloth seats, no ventilated seats, no moonroof, missing 1 of those offroad buttons, hard plastic armrest, etc.
Knock off of Land rover defender!
Land cruiser is always my favourite
This is basically just the new 2024 Taco with an SUV body, How disappointing. This pays no homage to the legacy and subsequently fails. The hybrid system will be great for the urban dwellers, but will not be any good outside of that. I hope that the Land Cruiser pick up that was mentioned a few weeks ago comes into fruition for the real Toyota owners crowd. We alll know that there are buyers looking for less tech, more reliability, and long term ownership. This will be great running to Costco and the Starbucks. It will be miserable for any use other than that. Ill keep my 22 t4r trd and my 97 LC.
What a Beauty
Less box more curves and it would be the perfect SUV.
Never in my life have I said I wanted a Land Cruiser, until and saw this thing. Toyota’s lineup has never been so full of bangers. The Prius looks great as well 💪🏽
Is this replacing the 4Runner?
Bring it to Canada!
To confirm is there no 6 cylinder option?
The back looks like a gx but the front looks lile a classic lc
This thing can take a beating
This is Land Cruiser Prado, for people don’t know, classified as light wagon… It is NOT the station wagon Land Cruiser 300.
Toyota Land Cruiser used to be such a nice looking vehicle😔
To bad the idiots won't bring it to North America.
Toyota is no doubt number 1 vehicle manufacturer in the world. Amazing
Like it 👍,very Cool !
It sounds like a prius with suv body
Im utterly disappointed with this new design 😢, idk why but i dont like this design at all.
Only if it was a 2 door 😉
SHOOT IT! SHOOOT IT!  Bring back those great commercials
Just stupid to call it lc when it's actually called lc prado
This gonna be amazing…..😭😭😭😭 but it’s gonna be up there in price 😭😭😭
Will any dealership actually have any in stock? Will they have a $10,000 "market adjustment " added to the MSRP? How about all the other so-called "mandatory " fees the crooks are adding to the vehicle prices? NO THANKS.
@toyota.     Why are 8 minute ads being suggested to my algorithm. 🖕👎. Blocking this account immediately
8.3 inch ground clearance is not much. 4Runner and Jeep have 10.5. Am I missing something?
Rear looks too badly designed including lights
Is this the new Toyota Prado or the normal Land Cruiser?
I cant be the only one who thinks they removed the "status symbol" the landcruiser carried with its old design
that hump in the trunk is disappointing, costumers want a easy flat load floor, one that accommodates taller passengers in the second row in terms of legs room
This isn't the new land cruiser lmao, this is the new redesigned prado, so its smaller than the large land cruiser 200/300
At first glance, the front is similar to the Land Rover Defender 🙂
NICE RIG! WONDER HOW MANY LIQUOR STORES A GUY NEEDS TO ROB JUST TO REACH DOWN PAYMENT. BEST GO FOR BANKS OR DRUG DEALINGS. COULD JOIN TALIBAN OR ISIS; THEY SEEM TO PREFER TOYOTAS.
I wonder why Land Rover couldn't do this with the iconic Defender.
It's less ugly than the latest Taco and 4Runner so... uh ...bravo... I guess.
Wtf is that💀
A little disappointed it uses the same powertrain as Tacoma. But price much higher than Taco
This is a Prado
Ford Bronco?
has crab walk?
does the top come off??
Toyota, I was disappointed in the Tundra but you nailed this one. I love the boxy look and the big open wheel wells. But I want the Stout in a TRD off-road model. Please bring that to the USA.
Front looks like FJ cruiser
Maybe it’s just me but it would make more sense as a Land Cruiser if it had the manual from the new Tacoma since it shares the engine
I would to see it in Forest green color. Reminds me of they FJ4x proto type
2.4 l inline 4 ??? 💀
Mensos la runner es mejor
I’m going to buy one . My TRD pro tundra after 10 years drives like new 👍.  Much better than new trucks from ford, Chevy & Ram
Are V6’s & V8’s coming later?  I don’t want a hybrid car.
Mmm... what are these "tires"? Are you kidding me ?
I ❤ TOYOTA
4 cylinders??  really??  and electric motor?? really?? i looks like we won't be crossing any rivers. 💔
Brilliant. Fucking brilliant. Well done Toyota. These are gonna sale like hot buns 👌👌👌
bro wtf is this
Hybrid, nope….lost me there
I’ll be getting the 1958 as long as the greedy dealerships don’t mark up the price by $20,000 like they did with the Bronco.
I have the new 300 but may trade it in for the 250. Crazy cars that fit both in the city landscape and off-road
I live in Tanzania africa and well Land cruiser is the king of the road here...they say its easy to go in the forest but if you want to get out go with a land cruiser
100% home run. Amazing job Toyota
Hahaha, no one has mentioned PRICE yet.  With dealer makeup $100,000 PLUS!
wait.......need to be terrorist tested.
Oh land rover defender !?
I see that Toyota has decided not to make the Land Cruiser full of useless chrome parts according to the taste of Arabs!  I call this model the first Land Cruiser after the end of globalization!
This vehicle is going to be a major hit I predict. It will be the vehicle to own
Great modern-retro look. Would've been better if it had a V6 variant.  But you don't want Greta going "How dare yuuuu?!" Everytime you gas up. So Toyota chose a 4 cylinder hybrid instead. 😅
I don’t  drive any other vehicle that is not Toyota , you guys killed it with all the new generation vehicles.
Defender says hi 👋
Amazing, fantastic !!
Can’t wait to see the dealer markup on these 😢
can someone buy me one please 😢
But why a turbo engine on a off road vehicule... It reduces its life span... and it's maintenance. :/
Yes
All we get is a Prado? Still no diesel? Still no 70 series? Some of us do work for a living, and could use a working vehicle.
No 3 door version?
They make the LC contender to the Ford Bronco.
Love it but Toyota really needs to start getting these dealerships under control. All they have to do is threaten they're going to sale directly to consumer and the prices will drop 10k instantly. It's insane how much dealerships are marking up Toyotas
Toyota ❤
Buying the LC and the GX more excited about the LC tbh.
You have given 5 yrs old exterior design.
poor excuse of a land cruiser.
Disappointed in the engine.
Omg it’s ugly
Gorgeous and badass at the same time
70 years of heritage turns a car into a box?????
Between this and the Sequoia refresh, Toyota might as well pack it in.  1st and 2nd Gen Sequoia were perfect.  LC100/200 were perfect.  Why mess up a perfect thing when you could have just modernized the technology?  Go back to whomever was leading your company in the early 2000's and 2010's.
When I saw the thumbnail I honestly thought you guys made a car in partnership with LEGO
Toyota is no longer uncool!
Good luck finding one, especially not completely marked up. My Toyota dealerships have empty lots. Lol
It’ll be fun to see what the aftermarket community comes out with for this thing!
I will hold on the fj
Am i the only one thinking 3.5 lift, 35" k02's heavy bumpers and sliders?
No Toyota no don't do this to yourself
I hear these are coming to Europe and hopefully the UK. Already Land Rover are sweating as these will beat them in reliability standards. The current versions being sold already do that.
What a refresh!  Excellent!  I just wish there was a v6 and 3rd row option.  The GX550 is impressive, too, but it shouldn't be the only variant of this platform to offer both features.  If the camry and ES can successfully co-exist with a V6 option for the camry I think the same could work for the new LC.
Huge fan of Toyota but this kinda looks like a Hummer H3 from the side and the 1958 looks like a jeep renegade
That's awesome toyota is bringing back the landcruizer in the u.s. but really toyota you have to put a stupid four cylinder turbo in something the size of the landcruizer. Totally lame.
SELL A STRIPPED DOWN LOCKED AXLE VERSION !!!!!!! No Interior panels!!!!
This Land Cruiser is and Insult to my 80 Series, which will spank this Grocery Getter Soccer Mom Crap.
....I think I'll be keeping my 2020 Land Cruiser for sure. Nothing here inspires me to sell my LC.
4in lift, fat 33in tires, offset wheels from day 1. Instantly. What a beast
damn, I guess I will let go of my Tacoma.
Where is the 2 Door
Worthy opponent for Defender!
Like the new design for the most part. Not sure about the rear view though - I get kind of an older gen, Honda Pilot/Grand Cherokee love child vibe.
good luck getting one for msrp you already know dealerships are gonna upcharge a fortune for this just like all the new toyotas
This is a 2-purpose car, off-road and on-road. You have now taken its beauty and elegance and delivered a square box. This model is very ugly and selfish. Listen to your fans and do not destroy the beauty. Do not sacrifice beauty for money.
Why is there not a front locking differential
465 ft lb of torque? NIce! Is there an M240 mount option? Asking for a friend lol.
😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
Is it automatic or manual?What will be the price?
No third row!! Your going to cut your customer base in half!! The GX is almost the same rig and it has a third row.
I just want a turbo diesel 70 series in the states… I think most will agree with that.
Soooooo is the 4runner dead?
Nigeria politicians have give up on this car looking too fancy
It's just not enough give morer power shit damn wake up please Cape Town South Africa 🌍🌍
What don't you understand people need power and performance wake up damn you Toyota do y always want to play second fiddle to Ford damnit man Cape Town South Africa 🌍♥️
Toyota did an awesome job.
That land cruiser in sand colour makes me weak at the knees
Here in EU they destroyed all good & reliable cars due to "new" pollution norms, a lot of trash cars here with 1.0-1.2,  3 cyl engines 🤮🤮🤮
Im sorry but its agly
Land cruiser? Looks like a new FJ cruiser.
Looks great, too bad it will be starting at $80,000
Get a three door model NOW!
It’s just look like FJ 4Door Edition❤
This 4Runner re-design is awesome! ;)
Looks like the same iForce hybrid available for the new Tacomas. Great specs, hopefully it'll be as bombproof as the old iForce! It'll probably be about 15 years before I can afford one of these but excited about what Toyota's doing!
Probably will cost more than a g-wagen.
Funny how Toyota is fooling the USA, UK, and Europe with a rebadged Prado (elsewhere) as a Land Cruiser. Whats funnier is that Americans believe that Land Cruiser is back in the American market. Its NOT a Land Cruiser. Its a Prado, sold as Prado in the rest of the world including Japan.
If only they kept a natural aspirated version for old fashioned reliability, can't wait to see these showing up at the lot though. And kudos for throwing the Tacomas manual system in too👌
Hot
Boring product.
Really needs to be a v8
Sweet Ride! Sucks I can't afford it though!
Yes Toyota yes!!! You didn’t cave like LandRover has! You’ve done the absolute right thing with this new generation!!!
Dealers are destroying the Toyota brand with insane markups. Follow Tesla and sell direct
They made it look like a Jeep from the back
Step aside, Bronco!
V6 > v4 RELIABILITY > efficiency
Toyota!. you need 4.0 V6 naturally aspirated as one option. Some of us wanted reliability that get us 300k plus miles.We don't care about all these nonsense  EPA regulation that forcing people to buy hybrid and turbo.
Toyota what happen with the simpler cars used to make in the 80s and 90s extremely reliable , can I trust the new “Land Cruiser” is going to last at least 20 years without a major problem?
So ugly...but..it is toyota...
It's not a land cruiser? Land cruisers have turbo diesel engines and solid front and rear axles. This is a 4runner.
You can’t build a expedition car with electric motors!
Oversized Lego car lol
I never thought Toyota will do Chinese Copy....
A vehicle that embodies exactly how I want to live my life. Now I don’t have to restore an older one.
I might consider replacing my FJ with this.
Ugly
Another land-rover copy 😂
The old school rugged aesthetic looks fantastic.  Good job!
So blah. Epic fail
I really hope your dealers don't gauge us again - I had to back out of a Rav4 order last year because of a surprise 6k "market adjustment" on an ordered XLE.
Great destruction😢the failure of land cruiser started 2021😢Arab people's have embraced the Nissan patrol😮
飽きた
crying out for wider profile tyres...
Sorry to be that guy, but this should have been a full EV. The Hummer EV, F150 Lightning, Rivian, and more, have proven that Electric Trucks can work. Toyota has no excuse.
Please go back to making affordable reliable cars. Normal working class cant afford these things anymore.
Work on your vehicle supply! I doubt i will even get to see this in a dealership near me (OR)...
Nailed it 👌👌👌👌
Just give us a lower-spec 300 Series instead of the Prado!  I'm glad i have my 100 and 200!
Lame
Why the retro look? It looks like 1999 montero sport
We are going back to the time. When car makers spent a lot of time and money to investigate the aerodynamics of the car, nowadays they are making them boxy again just to « eat » the fuel or electricity and spend more time refueling or recharging that box.   What a clever idea!
insanely ugly and the back looks like a jeep patriot
Disappointed in the re-launch body looks 👀. Yota could have really knocked it out of the park with a 🔥 retro throwback body but no we get a smaller version of an iconic platform.
Very useless design
Now that, is a freakin Land Cruiser.
How much it is
cant even lie that thing clean
Way more beautiful than it's more expensive clone which is new Lexus.
The Bronco got Toyota’s attention. It’s even the same color! 😂
They brought back the legend and equipped it with a 4 cyl hybrid motor.   That's unfortunate.
It looks promising for sure. Will the price point be less than $90k? I doubt it.
i-Force Max Hybrid??? No thank you! Was really anticipating for a V6 engine or at least the option to have fully gas/diesel. I guess waiting for this car & the hype surrounding it (teaser images) wasn’t worth the wait at all. Very disappointed with Toyota but it is what it is!
2 Words ~ Looks Shit!!
Looks a bit thin be great if beefier look something like the bronco
Panoramic sunroof is missing
I want one 👍👍
Some of my best childhood memories were made in the backseat of the family Land Cruiser…looking forward to my kids feeling the same way I do about this car.
Looks like a updated fj cruiser
I LOVE TOYOTA ❤
Make a 7 seater available as an option
It is a beautiful vehicle. too bad, there is no regulation on dealership greedy markup on msrp price
Can it take 22 wheels?
Now I'm extra curious about what the next gen 4 Runner will be like.  Was really expecting a detuned version of the 6 cylinder from the GX in this new LC.
just imagine removing that fron lip and some nice AT tires
Instant hit, timeless boxy shape, absolutely love it, good job Toyota, long live Ice cars
Funny how they say standard fog lights , standard rock sliders lol, there is nothing standard about it , they already charged ur ass for it just included it in the crazy 100k price lol
It’s giving fj cruiser and I love it
Finally, a true 4x4 after ages
Ugly, until I saw the round headlights
Every time a marketing person uses the word "heritage" today, they should accompany it with, "Thanks, Boomers".
65-70k CAD. A little too expensive
Absolutely beautiful car ❤ Really liked the exterior for it's classic looks. Reminds me of the fj cruiser😇 Hope y'all will add a v6 engine for it.
Now can you build a 4 door FJ40
Thumbs up 👍
Congratulations Toyota you now have 2 4Runners
Why aren't you giving us the 3 row model in the US?!!!
bad car!
nothing says rugged iconic offroad Landcruiser heritage like a hybrid WTF even the guys voice is weak, couldn't even watch the whole thing and I'm a landcruisers fanboy.. just give us the 70 series and stop consulting US market dipsh-its, targeted feminine men who want to trade in thier rav 4's
If Bronco Sport and Defender had a child...why would someone buy this over a Telluride?
Looks good, might get one for my wife once my Bronco get built.
Toyota!❤
An excellent and timeless design. They know what an SUV should be like.
No engine options but a 4 cylinder hybrid, deleted the third row. Looks like a big miss hopefully the 2025s have more going for them.
So far I love everything about it. But saying it can go anywhere and it's hybrid? I own a 80 series and I'm not saying I drive through water every time I go out but I'd be very uncomfortable driving a hybrid near any Beach or river. Hopefully we'll see something exploring how water protected the battery and hybrid system is.
What a ugly ugly car.🤮🤮👎👎
Is this Land Cruiser or Land Cruiser Prado ? In GCC what would you name it ?
5:23 LMAO
Now thats what i call sexy ❤❤
No way this is a land cruiser, it's tiny!!  No, this is the Prado, misleading advertising
W😮😮😮WWWWWWWW,,,,😍😍😍
Lol that’s a baby landruiser, I’m from Australia and I’m pretty sure Americans want the 300series or a 70s series with the v8 turbo diesel
Amazing design
Mavey they will be worth the money now? However feel like a cheaper version on new defender
It's not an SUV muppet
In my humble opinion, Toyota should have named it as FJ Cruiser for Off-road segment and the previous model could evolve as Land Cruiser for Luxury Segment..
well done. love the design.
why did they make a fake land cruiser just for the US?
What about lc300?
Looks fuckin great actually!
It's a prado not a landcruiser
that exterior is not good best exterior is 2018
Lexus GX 550 looks much better & also provides more feature😊
A subscription for a digital key? Disgusting. Screams BMW but better. :/  At least apple car play and android auto come standard. I hope they never charge for that.
I'm so ready to seen dozens of these being pavement princesses
It looks like the real Land Cruiser is dead.
Looks great, can’t wait to start watching some reviews 👌🏼
8.3 inches of ground clearance? So less than a RAV4...4 cylinder motor from a Tacoma? Ok...same price as a sequoia? Who is this thing for? Swing and a miss here. It's a 55+k mall cruiser, for that money you can get a lot from the Germans...or LR....I also could get a GX that does everything better for similar money  I ask again, who the hell is this thing for? It's a soft roader with all the worst attributes of it's corporate siblings. What a sick thought to call this a land cruiser.
It looks so bad
Going retro back to Toyota's roots. Yes thanks!! Bring on the 79 series in Australia! ❤ 👏
I LOVE it! So glad that it seems like carmakers like Hyundai and now Toyota understood that the 80s/90s inspired cars are what a lot of people love. I really hope that there will be a few cars that are a bit simpler again in the future. I think the 90s and earliest 00s were the best car era for daily drivers: simple, reliable, comfortable but not too over engineered or packed with unnecessary beeps and “features” nobody needs.
This shit is ugly as hell must be a bunch of bots in the comment section. This is a defender/ bronco?
これはかっこいい
I’m sure if they bring the Land Cruiser pickup and jeeps they will sell better
///////////////////////.  Are they going to continue manufacturing them without third row seats ////////////////.
I just don't like the offroading clips on street tires...SMH
a version for the lgtvqia---
Make it simpler! Too much tech crap in it. It should be bare-boned and Spartan. Use a simple 4.7 L 2UZ-FE engine. I want nothing in it except heating and AC. Roll down windows. It should cost 35-38 K max.
Guys, take your thumbs up.
Can’t wait till this gets into the hands of the taliban
Face lifted Mitsubishi Pajero
Face lifted Mitsubishi pajerow
Shame it’s not coming to the UK
Defender copy at front…
why does the back look like a jeep.......
Please no hybrid
Wish they would’ve kept the tailgate.😢
Should have kept the FJ going - way cooler
Options/ alternatives that are needed: - A real Key for the Doors and Ignition. - A CD Player (yes, I'm serious). - An Engine/ Powertrain that isn't Hybrid.  Toyota had some excellent Engines that could handle anything, and we need y'all to go back to those. - Gauges/ Meters instead of a Digital Display Panel (same goes for a minimized Center Console System, those screens are beyond distracting) and no HUD. - 3rd row Seats or Ranger Seats. - Some palatable Paint color variants in the Earth-Tone realm (Overlander 101, plus the Brown Paint colors y'all had for the Pickups for only a few years were nice). - Steel front Rack/ Bar and rear Bumper, with a good Winch option.  All that plastic exterior trim is going to get thrashed off-roading and climbing and otherwise, should be scaled for better clearance over obstacles and hazardous terrain.  We used Light-skinned and Up-armored Land Cruisers overseas on and off for years, those could take a beating and just keep going.  I'm a bit concerned looking at this new package, all those "bells and whistles" are going to be problematic with heavy extended use in the field professionally (and with devout off-roaders).
The front Looks like Nissan Frontier truck
Take my money.. :)
Yo, Toyota ilyu guys but wtf is this? The new 2024 LC looks like if Previous Parado and Bronco had a baby... which is not a good thing... this doesnt look like a Toyota :(
The most sexiest car being born❤❤❤
Toyota plz lunch supra in india
I think this looks much better than the 300; the 250 has a sturdy build whereas the 300 looks like a city car even though we know its capable off road.
What a huge disappointment to hear this has some stupid  ass hybrid motor.
With boxy design, twill be easier to up armor he3
Let me guess, another Toyota truck that will get 18 miles to the gallon and roll over on off ramps ....can't wait
FJ cruiser
Just  stop playing and bring back the FJ Cruiser already.
Imagine paying $80k USD for this..
Most boring toyota yet. My guy. Your tuntldra looks like a gmc and this thing looks like an offroad beefy honda element. What happened to you? Bring the Hilux to the US and we will show you what we want in an offroad package.
Dealers salivating at the $20k markups
Will it last as long as a 4runner?
Please give me only one piece.. I'm almost 34 and still poor wizard child 🫠
Cool a car that looks 20 years old already
is it a plugin hybrid?
This one produce lower emissions than Tesla it's entire life
It looks outdated to me, wish the legacy companies would stop leaning so hard into nostalgia. The R1S looks better imo
Good design but I am little surprised why they didnt preserve the classic fender shape. Land rover defender designs are very modern but they still kept the classic fender shapes. This current boxy/octagonal fender shape from the land cruiser looks good also but I prefer the classic look of the 3 sided fenders.
4 cylinders are crappy and unreliable. (Also they sound really bad)
Looking powerful n compact ❤
Can’t wait to start seeing these in the wild ❤❤❤
Come on guys 4 cylinder and a Land cruiser those two do not go together😢 how complicated is this power train this is not going to last based on what I saw with the tundra problems I'm keeping my GX460 because I bet it's going to be more reliable than the new one and the new Land cruiser Prado😅
😍 🤩 BEAUTIFUL 😊
Why can’t we get the 70 series like the rest of the world ?
Everything is good except the hybrid part. The battery will eventually fail.
It looks disgusting.
Sheesh better then my tacoma 😅
No clamshell tailgate? Only 8.3 inches of ground clearance. Needed at least 9.0 to compete with Defender's 8.6-11.5 At least they provide a standard locking rear diff. Bring back the clamshell, please!!!
Yours for only 100k, good luck average joes…
I love it. Looks modern with appreciation to the classic look.
As soon as "4 cylinder" was mentioned I tuned out...  The New LC gets a THUMBS DOWN for being a 4 cylinder. 👎
Turbo 4? Yeah, nope🙄
I want this designers modernization/reimagination of the mr2
IT DOES LOOK LIKE LAND CRUISER 70 serries, which is a good think, i love the design
They should've brought the 300 series to America
4Runner v Land Cruiser specs? The LC looks small.
Need to make a pickup that looks like this rather than the hideous spaceships you have now
Ohhh you had me until you said hybrid.  If you will sell me a chassis almost complete without engine or electric crap I can fabricate in my own four cylinder diesel.
Come on Toyota.  Show us what it can do. My Subaru can take the trails you showed.
Yes!
Could be a Palisade killer in asia
It’s fire but no one can afford it
NO ONE WANT A HYBRID OVERLANDER.... We want the manual 70's series diesel land cruiser and hilux the rest of the world has. Bare bones functionality with no "modern features" that brake and are unreliable and expensive to fix.
Everybody is copying Jeep's styling eh?
I love the design, the looks, the less luxury, better fuel economy and big trunk Other than the 2.4l hybrid, will a diesel be brought to north america? (I hope so)
Isn’t the Land Cruiser supposed to be a practical version (less bling) of the LX600?
Looks absolutely horrible. Even worse, looks like a Jeep Liberty from the back.
But does the trunk lay flat across, when the seats are down?
Love it. Hopefully third row seating will be added on later models.
The FJ Cruiser is back!
I'll stick with my 2023 TAHOE
Get rid of that damn hybrid engine and throw in a V6 or V8 in and I’ll buy one!
Is this a joke? It’s basically a 4Runner now.  So underwhelming, it’s not even in the sand class as the prado that we can get in the GX550.
Digital key requires a subscription? Why, Toyota? Why?
Hybrids SUCK!!
I really like the normal edition more. Hopefully I can switch lights with bigger box light that I like.  1958 edition is Not attractive, for some reason something just isnt clicking with the design but only with the 1958 edition.
I absolutely love how full size SUVs are going back to a boxy look, that's how they should be
Will 2024 LC have any options of  convertible or sunroof option?
8.3 inches of ground clearance is pathetic
NO SPLIT TRUNK DOORS? YOU GUYS MESSED UP...
give us the damn 70 series you cowards
Gimme a manual. Why do y’all hate manuals?
Cars news sites say affordable. Idk how 50k is affordable
But a six banger in it.
Can they do a swb version ..
This looks so bad 🤮
OMG plastic everywhere!
I was waiting for this reveal and my first impressions…meh. I’m trying not to be disappointed, but would it have killed Toyota for a little more ground clearance? Plus, I’m good with the the hybrid and I actually prefer it, but with the space that battery is eating up in the back, this better get smoking gas mileage unlike the underwhelming gas mileage the Tundra  with the same engine tech. If not, it’s a deal breaker.
Dealer markups are gonna be insane
Man thats a rough cool look. Tactical. Love it
We need them available in Canada!
A FREEKIN 4 banger!!!!!! Why not just use the awesome new Sequoia/ tundra motor. Lame. Bring back the Paseo!!!!!!!! Please
Other countries get the Real Land Cruiser.  We get Land Cruiser Light!!
I clicked this faster than my dad leaving!😅
Дизель только для понимающих, остальные давитесь гибридом. Будем ездииь дальше на 80ке
Really disappointed this is only going to be a hybrid and won’t have a V8 option
Yay. But no stock and $20K markup awaits buyers.
Wait.. but the GX 550 is the same
But where is the original Diesel engine?
I'll consider it - when my FZJ80 needs replacing in 30 years.
GX 550
Please don’t be more than $60K
The only question I have is WILL IT RUB?
They had me, until the motor. I'm old school, you'll never beat a V8. Only thing a battery belongs in is a rc car
The interior looks very nice but the exterior is just plain goofy looking, especially those hideous wheels
Where’s the 3rd row? 😩 we were 100% ready to buy one.
Again another 4,700LBS+ Toyota SUV with a 4cyl I just can't understand why
Toyota has made their vehicles so small that everything is a 4runner. Zero options for a family of 5 that can also Offroad. No option but to go Ford or Chevy. The Sequoia was a huge fail for families.
Needs a V8
Prado?
Personally., i hate the shape. A Land Cruiser should ALWAYS stand out., This 1 REALLY does look an FJ Cruiser...
too damn small.
Looks like the defunct FJ, or a rebadged 4Runner
They should offer a deisel version with a six speed standard transmission.
But we need it in 8 seater
Does anyone want this turbo 4 cylinder hybrid? Looks like a decent tranny and the solid rear axle is a staple but why a turbo 4 cylinder hybrids? I guess we will see how well they are built and life expectancy. Why no third row? Really looked forward to the new land cruiser and it just didn’t do it for me. To much tech and not enough off road basics.
Best looking SUV on the market
Let blonde mermaid possess 1st throw out reality clench we're you on Mars yesterday memory shifts do entity pop up landscapes for what cosmic purpose emotions ect. Period they come in and rid all your bs you have to serve and they also let you see realms theres times of land scape pop ups from yours an there words they sort out methods rests forget any chewish oligarch earthy conform threat as something central concern stop ignoring the true calls period
One question... Is this built in Japan or the US?
thats a lot of duck tape on that pos
it's going to be hilarious to watch all the morons spend $100k+ on this SUV only for it to be worth $10,000 in 5-7 years.
I feel that the 4runner 2023 is the last one and this will be the replacment
So, does that mean no NEW 4Runners ?
I wish it was more base with a manual transmission and no hybrid also a deasel option would be nice.
A big miss to not offer this with 3 rows of seats.  A lot of people (me included) rule it out for that reason alone
I like it but it doesn't look like an $80-$100k vehicle which was the price point of the old one.
V8 was built like a tank, not sure about 4 cylinder hybrid thing. LC having identity crisis ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i want this
Dig it. Toyota seems to have the hybrid tech pretty well sorted out so this could be a great option.
4cyl 🤣
From Prius to Prado🔥🔥🔥👍💗💗💯
Whoever loves Toyota hits like and comment their favorite #Toyota car
You forgot one major upgrade....  The crotch chiller AC vent would have been a game changer.
The 2024 Land Cruiser returns with three distinct trims—a base model called the 1958, a mid-tier trim called Land Cruiser, and a top-of-the-line First Edition. Each trim gets unique looks, with different headlight designs, different wheel and tire options, and off-road accessories like a front skid plate. While the base model's cabin has an 8.0-inch touchscreen, pricier Land Cruisers upgrade to a 12.3-inch unit. 0:42 🙌🏻😉
Four cylinders?!?!?!? Wtf?
Cool now make a two door
no front lockers???
Lost me at 4 cylinder. Not enough displacement / reliability. Should have been the same engine as the GX 550.
This thing F$?ks!
New mall crawlers for the rich
Look at my boxy boi!!!
Okay cool suv but when stout
Yep... You lost me at 4 cylinder engine.
Toyota American version
I ❤ Toyota trucks
May it not have a seating position like the 4 runner. Unfortunately, we kept a 2022 4 runner for only 6 months. It killed my lower back.
It’s A BRONCO at front and a TOYOTA at the back..
Toyota,  make it prohibited to mark-up prices at dealerships
A manufacturer that makes a new vehicle smaller then the one it replaces...didn't think I'd live to see the day👏Thank you Toyota!
I dont think i dig the look to be fair.
Looks awesome hope it’s a massive success
Total flop Toyota. This is not a Land Cruiser but a Prado. It’s a GX with Toyota badging. The engine choice is flaccid as well; add armor, Bumpers and lift/tires and 💥. This thing is Junk. I’ll keep my 200 and buy another used 200 from Cali or AZ in 10 years or so
The design specially interiors appears similar to the Land rover & Range rover SUVs, not the regular conservative approach by Toyota and it looks good.
Beautiful SUV. Disappointed that they keep the old 2.8 engine…🫥🫥🫥
looks like a Jeep
Amazing style (above all the one with round front lights) but there are too many electronic gimmicks. It would be nice if Toyota USA sold a kind of spartan version with only the necessary safety features required by law. I would fit it with a simple radio, no electric windows, no tachometer, crank windows, manual side mirrors, no alloy wheels but a cap wheels, manual airconditioning , manual central locking. It would be a hit for many people living in the countryside or in areas where roads and climate conditions are harsh. It would be a hit also for public entities (post, emergency services, etc). Many people want just simple and plain vehicles.
Love the hybrid system!
Stop going down with the cylinders and adding turbos. You’re going against your roots!
Interior is crap !
Like everything except the high load floor.
Does anyone else think this looks like a Lego suv….?
OMG standard all 4 wheel and tires are standard.....what will they think of next?
The front of the blue one reminds me a bit of the Rolls Royce SUV ❤
Looks like a defender/lr4, good choice!
top notch !
Someone said: " TOYOTA COPY ROLL ROYCE "
What an odd looking hummer h3
What's the price.
RIP 4Runner
Bronco? :)
Probably a price tag of $1 million dollars 😮
We need third row option on this @toyota !!!!
That would look perfect beside my fj cruiser..  well done TOYOTA.
Off road heritage but only 8.3 inches of clearance come on should be at least 10 try again toyota.
Wish they would bring back the F40.....barebones
Disappointed there’s no 6-7 passenger option
デザインも無骨でカッコイイな😁
Bruh this is huge for the USA off landers
I’ll take 1 please
color selectable fog lights make it more offroad capable? Maybe for posing at the trail head. I'll keep my first gen tacoma. This thing is full of lard.
That's a really nice looking Jeep Commander!
❤ TOYOTA
Goodbye low end instant v8 torque, hello problematic 4 cylinder turbo lag
YES FINALLY
The landcruiser will never go out of style
It's a styling travesty. I don't know what band of drunk interns snuck this design identity crisis by, but shame on Toyota for not keeping a closer eye on them.  Move over Aztek, this monstrosity is the new King of the Ugly.
Toyota 📈
definitely isn't a land cruiser. not sure what that turd is. no way it actually lasts 250k plus miles like it's predecessors.
No straight axle, hybrid engine w turbo(lots of components). Toyota has sold out on the true off-road enthusiast.  What a joke of a 4X4.  Their newest products suck!!!!
A Subaru Outback has more ground clearance
Waiting for maruti suzuki land cruiser
If only they had a 2 door version…
Who else is glad it’s not fully electric?
This is confusing! Toyota has 2 land cruisers!?
Didn't you guys sign off 3 years ago?
It's really nice....love it...but it kinda gives FJ Cruiser vibes but maybe if i saw it in person. But love it...Bravo Toyota...
2021 design is better than 2024 design.2024 design is similar to land rover defender design
wht an absolute shame of a vehicle
The front and rear end reminds me of the 80 series Land cruiser, the best one in my opinion
Looks like a new Ford Bronco but with down sydrome. Itll probably fall apart and break down all the time like my corolla.
It will sell like cupcakes. Love it!
A standard smart key system makes this incredible machine easy to steal right out from people’s driveways***
Please ship one to me in Arizona for testing and evaluation, looking good!
Inspired by land rover Defender😂
Design is defender design
This LC looks a lot like recent 4runners, and the same powertrain as the upcoming Tacomas.  It will be interesting to see what they do with the next generation of 4runners.  And while I don't expect gas mileage to match that of the Sienna/Rav4/Highlander/Venza, it will be nice if they manage to get it close.  Terrible gas mileage on the current/recent 4runner/tacoma/tundra/land cruiser is the biggest thing that's kept me using a '92 4runner.  At 18-20mpg with the V6, it gets the same or better gas mileage than these vehicles that are more than 30 years newer.
Does it have rack n pinion? I need for taco thx
Design changes at all
only old LX 570 UNTILL THEY COLLAPSE
Previous model design was better
This looks like the ford bronco
My first car was a Scion XD and Toyota won my heart in 2008 with it. Currently driving my 2016 4runner which was my dream car. Love this car ever day. It never say no, always going places, never giving up. Toyota your new line up is awesome. From the start of the new Tundra/Sequoia design. Listening to customer and turning it up on the Tacoma. This Landcruiser play homage to the original poster hanging on my wall as a kid. Everyone at Toyota, please know you guys are awesome!
FJ Cruiser
@Toyota USA : Some comments from a cult-follower with a highly cared for and modified Toyota truck in my garage :  1. Too long, wide, low, and heavy for real off-road use in the West -- evidenced by all of your promos for this vehicle being done on improved roads (yes, everything you're driving on in these promos are graded and improved tourist roads) 2. No manual transmission is a killer for your real followers and those making your legend possible 3. Electronic everything, including start buttons, makes this car a front-country vehicle only  4. The aesthetic is great -- going back to a more utilitarian appearance - a must-do, given the fat, bloated prior models were basically minivans 5. The lack of a naturally aspirated V6 is insane. You should offer a base-base model with the 2GR-FE, a manual transmission, and front and rear lockers -- that's the only model of this LC that I would buy.  6. The pricing starting at $55k makes clear that Toyota is only gearing these to stay out of the hands of people making only $100k/year in the USA ... 7. No surprise here, but the lack of a solid front axle is a massive disappointment. IFS is great for highway use, terrible for exploration uses. It's a sign that natural spaces in the USA are done and domesticated, and the vehicle manufacturers know their users rarely to never step off improved roads. Sad day.    Overall, this is the closest return to the American market with a good utilitarian truck since the 80-Series, but it's still wildly off what your true enthusiasts were looking for -- I mean, the kind of devotees that travel just to see the Land Cruiser Museum. I hope you'll start focusing on us, rather than the market studies that target the average American user, who demonstrably only uses your vehicles to do urban driving.
This looks like a bronco.🤦‍♂️ Interior of a jeep. Not impressed at all. And then the ground clearance of a Subaru. Man toyota really missed the mark. You can tell its a new generation of toyota marketing running toyota. 🤦‍♂️
no way jose that’s sick
the body metal looks weird
Hey Toyota, I can't wait to pay over $100K for a base model at the dealer when this comes out.
NOOO ITS UGLY
Toyota knocked it out of the park! 💪Can't wait to see the new 4Runner when it arrives! 👍
It doesn't have q V8, or a straight-6, or a turbo-diesel..sorry. its not an LC.
When all that tech begins to fail out of warranty, yikes!
Love my Rubicon 4xe but this is a great change for the LC!
Bots, bots in the comments.
Dang yall, I love that 1958 trim 👌👍!!!
Annnnnd cancel the Defender...
Black
No V8 or even 6. NO sale. Next
Men i love this. Time to save up
I remember when Doug Demuro said he wished they based the FJ cruiser on the 2nd gen Land Cruiser I think he’ll love this
Looks like Defender 😅
lol, 4 cylinder turbos. What a joke. Have fun people, you gonna have a nice time taking these to fix.
Good Toyota USA 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser Reveal Ft Overview Good | Toyota Good Toyota USA 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser Reveal Ft Overview Good | Toyota
Perfection
Wow I love it!  Picked up what we loved in the FJ Cruiser and improved everything!  I'd love a 3 door option!!!  Bronco and Wrangler have a new player to compete with
❤️
Glad it's coming back, but am disappointed that it doesn't come with a V6.
I cant resist round headlights
Should have a v8 in it. Miss on this like they did the tundra.
I don’t get the point of large rims on off-road rigs. Give me more tire!
This is just a 4-Runner with a 4 banger, it's not a Land Cruiser.  We will see if they are used in country's that use Land Cruiser's as military vehicles.
Looks like Chinese car
LOVE it! Thank you Toyota!
Is this Toyota Prado?
Can we get a 4x4 cargo van comparable to a Mercedes sprinter?
You lost me with the Hybrid engine. I would need some real engine options.
Only Toyota Landcruiser and Nissan Patrol are the reliable global offroaders left for the public.
$50k plus a $20k mark up + tax title license = 80k.
One engine option 😅
This is exactly what the community wanted and I'm glad the manufacturer really listened to the consumer for once
This is not the flagship Landcruiser(LC300). This is a LC250 Landcruiser Prado
That thing is so ugly
Offer the 70 series in the us market as well
Cool but we the consumers dont want more in app purchase to use our sleds.
Everything is going to be a turbo 4 that lasts half as long as current models.  Yuck.
the ugliest unpolished product from toyota ive seen.
That’s all we needed was another station wagon how about some wrangler competition for going over passes
the old land cruisers just hit different, but this one missed  😂     this looks too much like a Kia Telluride
the engine ruins it
This looks very classy and Manly, unlike other girly design suvs are heading into
Beautiful truck but it should’ve been the new 4runner. We’re not getting the real Land Cruiser 300 series. This is the LC Prado. A turbo 4, really? It’s half the price of its predecessor and unfortunately half the truck as well
Just bought a 4Runner TRD pro bc I wanted the dinosaur design but this is making me rethink keeping it to 300+k
4 cyl?!!! SUCHHHH a downgrade
this feels like a nintendo direct and i’m here for it
Toyota should have given us American customers a V6, diesel engine, LC 70 or the LC 300 GR Sport series!
Its LC Prado 😂😂 US cant get the Lc300
When will it arrive at the dealer? i need this right now. Glad to see the return of the King.
Isn't this a new prado
Would love to see a refresh of the FJ40, maybe something of a mashup between the cruiser.
Digital Key should become free of charge. Like another brand.
That engine looks like a nightmare.   No thanks.  Simpler is better.
I don’t understand Toyota line up now. 4 runner, Highlander, hingander max version, sequoia now this Land Cruiser,
Nice!!! It kind of looks like my 1999 montero 2.5!
Slap a N/A V6 engine trim and you have a dealbreaker!
I am missing v8 engins😢😢😢
Will this be available in other countries like Canada and Australia?
This will be nice to have back in Toyota’s lineup but without a shadow of a doubt these new ones won’t be as long lived as the old ones with the V8. They should’ve at least given it a V6 for such a big vehicle.
The only good thing about it is the smaller size, who wants a hybrid for an offroad vehicle and how about a solid front axle? Also 8 inches of ground clearance seriously it that a joke? if it's not it should be. This could have been the best land cruiser ever and you made this, utterly disappointing.
Pure trash.. 55k at 950 a month and I get 100 percent plastic manual seats and a 4 cycle… stop the sillyness… these people smoking good drugs
It's the new Prado. I don't know why toyota don't call it Prado in us, and all over the world, it's Prado
For the first time. I am interested in a hybrid vehicle!
Is anyone else worried about the 4Runner? This is what the 4Runner should be, the Land Cruiser should be more. As a Land Cruiser, l’m not impressed, but it’s perfect as a 4Runner.
IFS sucks
This looks like what the Xterra should have become.
The new 70 Series is great
This thing is GORGEOUS!!! Damn 🥵🔥
Its beautiful u could get it with more luxury features too heated cold seats massage heated cold cup holders soft close doors heated steering wheel jbl surround sound system and more
Love the look not sure about the hybrid part …🤔
Available to order in 2023 for delivery in 2028 and only a 15k dealer markup!
Turbo i4?  All the engine power pulls from the turbo…there goes the long term Toyota reliability 🙄.
Sad. The rest of the world still gets the land cruiser 76 and we get this electrified piece of junk.
Looks like the new design incorporated aspects of the FJ Cruiser. Love it.
Looks like Lego
plase cone to india not in a 150K package
Hubrid ONLY?!?! That just defeats the whole point of a Land Cruiser
NEW PRADO !
If they redesigned the land cruiser why keep the 4runner around Can someone tell me the difference
dear toyota,  in an era where auto makers are packing all controls into touch screens, thanks for keeping physical buttons in all these new models 🙏🏻  you’re pretty much guaranteed to be the next vehicle i buy. now i gotta decide… taco? lc? gonna be tough! 😂 (or… the next 4runner?? 👀)
4 cylinder???
Yeah yeah..all commercial, nothing on lots. Just like the Tacoma
Thank you for bringing the boxi look back.  Everyone else  is racing to make the trucks look like optimus prime
All I ask is for a model with the spare tire on the back
The High Beam and Speed Limit icons in the Safety Sense 3.0 segment are backwards. Need switched.
Land cruiser is one of those legendary badges that's really hard to live up to. I wish them well on this one, I wonder if it is more capable than a 4 runner and how it compares to the 2022 GR land cruiser
this is going to wreck the bronco market lol
Getting Fj cruiser vibes.
Looks ugly as hell. I want a vehicle I can use on a trail and drive around in the city.  Seems like Toyota is going back (don’t get me wrong I love the nostalgia) and not innovating. Toyota is going down the marketing rabbit 🕳️ hole like GM and Ford. Just my two cents.
Give diesels in the United States please
Ugly
Is it a replacement of 4runner? Because this is LC200 not the bigger one we get in Middle east and asia
Great iconic look!
My 80 series doesn't need any of this.
I'm not convinced by the design at all... I was wondering what it reminds me... well it is reminds me Bronco with a spice of Jeep and not old Toyota. Definitely not impressed by the look, it is a step back!
But who wants that new Aussie Land Cruiser that looks like it’s from 2000? Amr?
The 2.4L instead of the 3.4L? Guess I'll have to get the GX instead.
I want a Landy so bad
who was in charge of grill design tho🤨
Next 2 years without any inventory availability.  They can't even supply Camry Hybrids.
Now make the Corrola cross with this look
No tail gate and a 4cyl, come on guys.
In my opinion, this vehicle looks great but I prefer the 2024 Lexus GX550. I’m glad Toyota bring the Land Cruiser back to the United States 🇺🇸 👏
So is this like the new prado?
Looks awesome, but yall lost me on the single hybrid engine option and the digital key. Hard pass on the digital key in particular. A lot of good features standard though and as stupid as it sounds, I loved seeing a lift gate without the electronic assist crap. I know new car prices are nuts and it's a lot better than the last gen, but still struggling to see $55k in the base truck.
Wow, you mean, I can finally afford one now?!
Parece una Jeep
this is so incradible mostly for the new design! love it welcome 2024 Toyota Land Rover
Is this vehicles direct competition the Ford Bronco Sport? My assumption based solely on LC now being a 4 cylinder.
I am actually sad. Toyota could have launched this model as land cruiser prado and the current GCC model as land cruiser and retained the 4 runner . 3 products in 1 market . Instead you have now 2 products
like,.......all we wanted was the 79 series...that's it.....just make it meet north american DOT standards, and sell bazillions...why is this hard?
Wen 2024 4runner?
Wonderful
Who makes these videos...
Atleast put a v6 not a 4 banger it aint a toyota hilux
Since Toyota isn’t offering a V6 or V8, I believe new LC would cost lesser 😏
The older Prado still looks better. The 2.8L Turbo Diesel was also a bulletproof engine
I really liked the exterior design. They did an amazing job.
Hybrid only? No thanks.
This might be the most underwhelming comeback story I have ever witnessed. Hey Toyota. Dont you folks like fun vehicles anymore?
Lost me at hybrid
The Landcruiser nobody wanted. I’ll keep my 4runner
Great looks, sounds amazing and all but, I think is another car that will be useless in 20-30 years whean all that sensors and electronics fails, and no one knows how to fixit (or is incredible expensive). But thats the world we live in now i guess.
Not a " TRUE" Landcruiser, more like the return of the FJ Cruiser.
Old school but... It's beautiful
My mini cld drive these roads.
front grill seems like farming shelter grill lack of design seems Grace of land cruiser is fully ignore by designer. back lights are trash as well seems downgraded
This Land Cruiser actually reminds me of the fj40 Land Cruisers. Gotta love retro futurism!
Damn toyota is killing it this year, the sequoia, 4runner, lexus gx, now this! Cant wait to get one
What have they done to the front end of the poor man's land cruiser? Looks like an ugly Defender.
Still waiting for the 4Runner to be updated/modernized. Looks old as heck.
how smaller is this from the Land Crusier 2021 US edition?
Engine bay is a bowl of spaghetti
Thank You Toyota
Cooool
Bummer, jump seats went bye bye
Bronco contender!
Worst ever design for a legendary body on frame suv. 😡 who the hell approve these type of worst ever designs. utterly poor design. 👎👎👎
OH! I thought this was being discontinued! That's amazing!
That engine bay looks fun to work on.
Welcome back Land Cruiser
FJ cruiser's vibes😁 I like
Put the v8 in it
2.4 hybrid... mhhh I don't know about that.
Delivery in 2030
Not a landcruiser
that`s awesome, the best Toyota ever
❤❤❤❤❤Send some to Portugal!!!!, 🇵🇹
Giving me Lexus GX vybz.
So no more 4Runner?
Part of what made Land Rovers so good, and Toyota in general (Tacoma, 4Runner), for overlanding and off-roading where you'll be spending lots of $$$ for modifications and therefore intending to keep the vehicle for a LONG time, was that rugged bulletproof reliability.  By making this a HYBRID ONLY, you're putting an artificial shelf-life on your vehicle unless you plan on spending big bucks to get the battery replaced so you can keep it going.  They say it's only every 150k miles but realistically you're seeing a decline in capacity far sooner than that.  Also, hybrids require more meticulous maintenance in order to keep them running for such a long time.  No more nearly maintenance free but still gets 1 million miles type of vehicles.  I know, people will disagree... "BUT THE BRAKES DON'T NEED REPLACED!"  It's just a simple matter of fact.  They have limitations that don't play very well with overlanding at all.  To top it all off, they're now using a 4 cylinder engine with a turbocharger.  It's a heavier vehicle and people will be adding all kinds of weight in gear and roof top tents.  There's more strain on that system and it will inherently be susceptible to wear sooner.  Cool vehicle, extremely doubtful it'll be anywhere near as reliable as the older Land Cruisers or 5th generation 4Runners... which was always kind of the point of buying a Toyota.
It’s like the ford bronco but reliable
Great for Indian roads...
Its ugly snd its a prado. Not a toyota hater. I have an 80 series
Looks much like the 4Runner, cant wait to see this in person.
Send some to Mexico !
The black trim on the rear looks like an escalade. They should’ve added “Toyota”
So its dumping the luxo look to go back to its offroad rugged looks?
This is really a Toyota Prado. Will be bad if they price it like how they would an original land cruiser
Let's see what 4xoverland say about it
Would look even better with a 3” lift and 35’s
I threw up in my mouth when I saw this- a 2017 LC owner
اسطورة
As a lover of Land Cruiser brand I'm very sorry for what Toyota has done to this legendary off-roader ! First the whole front design is similar to an old Mitsubishi Pajero model. Second: The car has become a bit smaller, shorter and narrower and that's not cool. The rear design is ugly as hell and is similar to an old Jeep Chirokee model. The whole thing is like a disguised FJ cruiser to me. Toyota wants to control the American SUV market whatever it takes
Damn 🔥🔥
Compared to the 79 series.....it looks like a Toy😢....I Really hope that Toyota does Not discontinue the Real Land Cruiser. 4.5v8 TDI  Look at what happened to Land Rover, with their modern vehicle 😢😢...it sucks....to Many electronics.
over 460lb-ft of torque out of a 2.4L hybrid system. Toyota is the GOAT
Do not need it, just want it!
honestly the looks is more rugged and nice for its built purpose..  but it's way different from its predecessors, well done Toyota, its still a Land Crusier even with changes made 😉..still robust 💪
Liftup tailgate... Now I can get a Prado!!!
Looks remind me of the first generation RAV4
Look like new gen of 4runner. Where's the 4runner?
8.3 inches of ground clearance 😂😂😂😂 what a joke. This is a Toyota version of the bronco sport. Toyota once again failed to compete with Bronco and Wrangler. Its nice but hitting the mall crawler market is toyotas focus I guess. Hard pass.
😂😂😂 it looks like an fj cruiser. I like it though 😅
Toyota prado is back to glory.. LC300 Small brother
I would love to drive a Toyota if dealers didn’t charge an additional $8k in fees. Dealerships are the shadiest and scummiest people.
Honestly not liking these new lc they look like plastic toys trying to take advantage of the older designs but just fails
I think people are going to love towing a giant boat with all your family and still getting 40mpg 👏
This is the real Landcruiser(Sahara)! This is the smaller, Landcruiser Prado. Two very different vehicles. While the Prado is a very capable off roader, it does not even come close to the legendary status of the land cruiser Sahara. A Landcruiser Prado is basically a poor man's Landcruiser Sahara.
I don’t care anything at all about the Land Cruiser’s carbon neutrality. Save that for those government environmentalist idiots.
did j just hear "subscription"?????
I think the look is more appealing than the Lexus GX! The front grille should not be broken into that many pieces it should look less cluttered  so it will look cleaner like the Land Rover or the Ford Bronco!
Imagine being in the middle of nowhere and relying on a hybrid AND turbo engine. 🤦 Let me just pull out my hybrid tools to get us going again....
Is this "John Daub" doing the Voiceover ??!!
I'd love to do a comparison between this and the new Lexus GX since they're basically the same vehicle
1. disappointed no v6 2. where are the toyo at3s like on the gx 3. first edition will be mine
Seems cheaply made. For the similar price, give me a reason not buying the Chevy Colorado zr2
The huge size was the reason i couldnt get the LC200. So im really stoked for this one
+ $10k for Market Adjustments  Kill the dealership model.
Sh*ty Look & car &... Anything. Toyota I think you need to change it and go back to the older version of a land cruiser and make it more futuristic in the interior  It's look like an f*cking Indian cheapest car ever made.
is Thad next generation of lc 300 or next gen of prado
Personally, the off-roaders can have this one, but I do like the new look of the land cruiser. Toyota makes the greatest vehicles of all-time. Thank you Prius for introducing this technology to the world and evolving it. Adding  hybrid technology in all of it's vehicles is a genius move from Toyota. 日本が大好きです!!!!
dawg Toyota is about to kill the bronco lol
Will there be a gas version? I'd rather not have my home electric bill jump due to charging and don't  want to worry about taking it off road and running out of battery.
Very nice. Didn't want to go into retirement with a LC payment but if anything could, this would be it. Still digging my 1997 80 Series but we'll see.
A few other changes would have made it a real winner. The ground clearance sucks, angle of departure is not very good and not easily fixed, and only offering a V4 when die hard offroaders would love a V8 or at least a V6. Those days are long gone. But, that's why 1960s and '70s Land cruisers sell for $60,000 or more restored.
I smashed the like button
Got to move the Land Cruiser name plate on the back hatch door top left corner to the lower left corner to line up with the iforcemax on the right lower corner in order to look symmetrical.
is there going to be a 3 door version for Europe?
No V6 diesel option?
Does it mean Toyota will ditch 4runner?
In Malaysia, this will cost around 200k-300k USD
We need a non-hybrid version...
Everyones happy with a 4 cylinder? Seriouslu? Is this comment section all bots?
No front solid axle 🥱
Looks great but 4 banger turbo. Not a fan..
I need to know are we getting a Toyota scout for 2024
fj vibes
So now its land rover
This looks like a new refreshed prado. I mean it’s smaller than the LC300 government officials drive here in my country Uganda. And it also looks different a little. This means that prado will be amazing. Can’t wait to see.
everyone.. calm down.. this may look like brand spanking all new.. but we all know.. deep down, it's still the same thing, still the same recipe
better asian,middleeast lc300..pure v6 diesel n gasoline powertrain...
LC 300 was so much better though . Luxury and offroading . This is a good  offroading car
For a 2024 SUV, where we're not used for Toyota using others models and being creative, why and why does the rear end and tails look like a jeep compass from old generations 🤦🏻‍♂️
The whole 8.3 inches of clearance??? 👏 👏 👏 🎉🎉🎉
Lol, this is the new prado land cruiser not new land cruiser... this is the smaller platform based on the hilux not the 300
this is the model only in the us right?
Looks, lost between Bronco, Land Rover, and Jeep...
i live in saudi arabia, where you can't live if you dont own a land cruiser. lemme just say, most saudis aint gonna be happy about the small size
The back of not good. The front is iconic
hm... so what's gonna separate this from the 4Runner? 4Runner having less power and non-hybrid only?
Is this the new land cruiser prado
When Toyota copies China with a GMC Tank 300 lookalike 😂 Oh dear…
That just looks like the new Defender lmao
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Stop making “capable off-roaders” hybrids, people aren’t going to want to buy a vehicle which are centered around off-roading but have a hybrid motor keep your reliable gas powered options, give people the option to not have a hybrid
YOU LOST ME AT HYBRID....not a single penny of my hard earned $$$$ will EVER go to any car powered by EV tech. Not one F*CKING PENNY! You guys can take your government tyranny and stick up your backside. Plus the last thing I need out in the wilderness is an EV explosion and fire. Forced Tech in the form of INFERIOR PRODUCTS is never gonna work guys. Never. The customers just won't stand for it.
Lc x Fj
It’s not a Landcruiser it’s a Prado
It looks very ugly! 🤮
Love the boxy look
…. HOW DID WE LOSE GROUND CLEARANCE!? Make it make sense to me!!
Nice prototype.
The most ugly car ive ever seen. What is wrong with Toyota?
2GD?
❤❤❤
Why is everyone copying defender
Semakin gagah .mantap jiwa mempesona
Looks great.  Just a shame the engine very small.
日本はジムニー5ドアは必要なし！いらん！ 新型ランクルが欲しい！ トヨタありがとう！❤❤❤❤❤❤
Toyota is killing it off late.  This is so cool.
Don't mess with the USDM custoners' mindset, Toyota USA.  Why take the 250-series (Prado) and assume it as the real LC?  This is just dishonest marketing and customers know it.  Just bring back the J300 to NA and in its most potent trim (GR-S) so that prospective customers can choose what's the best for them for their offroad activities......
Why does it look like a defender ?
8.3 inches of ground clearance? A reduction of 1.3 inches from the 2023 4Runner. LMAO
Looks like how an off-roader should
Good job LC, now they should offer more engine options.
Can we just agree that most of these won't get off the tarmac?
Toyota was lack of handsome cars, hi tech information
Not hating on it.... But it it looks like a Lego car
Вони прекрасні😍🤤
Land Cruiser is back? Yay!  Another hybrid lineup? Pass.
Looks like generic junk
Disappointing in ground clearance when the RAV4 has more than a Land Cruiser
Dealerships markup dreams.
I guess my question is, is this almost the same size as the 4Runner? And if it is, wouldn’t it make 4Runner irrelevant?
Not having a 3rd row is a big miss, it would be perfect with the return of that 3rd row flip up seats.
This land cruiser really reminds me of old land cruisers and really new cars are not my favorite but Toyota never disappoints good job Toyota
So they decided to drop the "Prado" suffix. Now we have to remember Land cruiser LC300 and Land cruiser 2024. Damn 😂
The legend is back👊
A Land Cruiser used to be known for luxury and off-road capability but now it just look less attractive and it's based now only for off-roading ☹️☹️no luxury needed said @Toyota
It looks like Land Cruiser J70 & FJ cruiser
it looks pretty good and beautiful the design in reminds us of a fj cruiser and some land cruiser 70 series because there's nothing wrong with a land cruiser it's very solid like a tank and bulletproof 😊💖☺️😍
Between this and the new Tundra and in general a lot of newer vehicles, I'm really not a fan of the direction we're going as far as exterior design in vehicles. Some have weird angles and others are boring as hell
No third row no purchase
Bring back the FJ CRUISER too
Well hopefully I'll buy one this year
This is the Prado? So it's not the real Land Cruiser ?
Wish we in the U.S. could get a real one.  sigh
already 1 year is waiting lol
Hahaha. Toyota made a turn around style of designing of land cruiser. Is this move is just to take fisrt to show a vehicle to media against the race of incoming HYUNDAI STA FE  ?  Which is highly apreciated by car lover?
Please make a TRD PRO with the Turbo V6.
i will stick to my old one
MSRP?
Dear Playground Games,   Please add this beautiful vehicle to forza.  thanks  Toyota fans
Looks like an old car from the 90's. Not a big fan at all, plus they stole a GMC steering wheel
For 1/2 a second, I saw the rivian r1s
How can they call the GX chasis the land cruiser, its supposed to be prado 😢 and the LX600 chasis should be the landcruiser (which is LC300 in other countries)
This looks almost identical to the 2024 lexus GX
Design copy from haval dargo nothing special about it such an ugly car
.
Looks like the engineers got bored. I Don't like the design. The 70 series looks much better with a diesel engine + 130 L tank.
No no no no no, dont call the prado the lc in the usa, bring the lc300. Dumbass americans will think its the landcruiser.
5 hours since it was uploaded, and it already has 85K views. Toyota has made a great decision. I'm loving all these new and redesigned toyotas!
Toyota the best 🎉
if this is a dream don't wake me up
where is the manual transmission
Personally the looks aren't so pleasing to me but good car
Does the way the new lander cruiser looks is giving FJ cruiser vibes or is just me, cause I’m loving it!
I think this is the new Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, smaller and cheaper than the full size LC. The Prado wasn't available in the US as Toyota, but is  the same Lexus GX series platform, the Prado/GX also shared a lot with the 4Runners. I'm really happy to finally see this model available in the US 😃
Idk why they can’t just call this a Land Cruiser Prado, they really think Americans are stupid.
Rather have the Toyota Inline 6 cylinder for durability. Best Toyota engine I ever had in Cressida or Land Cruiser
ياليتهم استخاروا
I think you should make the 4 runner above this model and offer 7 seater, with More power like the GX, and maybe up the power of the GX for the future. I think the GX needs to be more premium than both model LC and 4runner. 4runner need to be built in Japan, not mexico
So, folks, turns out this replaces the smaller Land Cruiser Prado, which wasn't sold in the US. It was the Toyota version of the Lexus GX. Now it makes sense. This isn't replacing the big Land Cruiser 200 or the new 300. People are confused because the Prado wasn't available in the US.
This look like tank 300 GWM
Will there be 7 seater version?
Nice water puddle. Now shoe it half way up the doors. What happens to your unsealed hybrid max system then? The icon has been turned into a highway princess
This is the land cruiser prado. Not the mighty Land Cruiser 300. That one the US isnt getting.
I love it, but I still want a new FJ
Nissan/Pathfinder has left the chat😂😅
خايس 😢
Very bad design 😢 copy from ford bronco n you ppl also ruined the design of 70 series as well
Yeah this is great, but when are you bringing out a new FJ Cruiser to compete with the Ford Bronco. This would be a huge cash cow, and you’d have my order day one.
This is the new land cruiser PRADO
I like the design.. but are they trying to mimic the land rover design ? 😂
I'm a bit confused. Is this gonna be the new Prado for other countries? Or is this the normal land cruiser for only the American market because 300 series wasn't available for USA?  Looks so good btw
Wow 😮 that’s all I have to say ! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love it, only one problem not everything needs to be freaking hybrid.
The reliable Land Rover we always wanted 🥲
Lion become Hyena!😢
Looks like a Lego suv 😂
Thats a prado not a landcruiser... thats the poor mans landcruiser. Smaller, less powerful and less cool than a true landcruiser
Historically low ground clearance 🤔
Aftermarket manufacturers will have a field day with this one. Great platform.
ALEX FUERTES ESTUVO AQUÍ, siendo testigo de la historia de este vehículo.
so someone finally makes a car for me a real SUV that's boxy and has reliability aswell!
No more silly Dubai chrome grill and fixtures. Looks the business
hard to believe it has the 2.4L iForceMax engine. I was expecting at least the 3.5L V6 on that's on the Tundra
Wow. Not impressed. What a disappointment. Must do better Toyota.
FJ and 4Runner had a baby.  I think the better part the baby slid down the 4Runner's crack and stained the garage floor.
Yeah nah, id rather spend my money on a GWM Tank 300, which no doubt will be less than half the price of this thing and more mod cons
toyota is back doing what we all wanted them to be doing. feel blessed to have this beauty lineup
It's really a shame TOYOTA never listens to its customers, never a survey to find out what they want in their next models: it should never come with such small wheels, it should come with 33" or 35" wheels similar to the Ford Bronco. It doesn't even allow you to put larger tires than the ones it comes from stock.
Nop
Really wish it had the V6 diesel 😢
Why are the front lights different, one is circular and the other is rectangular?
We want all the international models of Toyota available in India. Ready to pay...........................
What’s the mpg?
This monster looking like an FJ cruiser! Nice SUV!
Wow. Gotta get me one of these.
I hope they offer a better choice than a 2.4 Litre motor in New Zealand?? We need these vehicles for towing and this motor is too small. All very well throwing in an electric motor but it's all extra weight for the small ICE to lug around hilly country roads. Looks like I'm sticking with my old trusy 4 Litre Prado for towing or upgrading to a Ute.
I like it a lot but it disappoints me with this small engine 2.4 V4 is not enough at all at lease V6 4.0
NICE LANDCRUISER 😎👍 PERFECT JOB TOYOTA
That is absolutely outstanding, love it👍
So this land cruiser and land cruiser GR sports are different cars?
bronco and jeep are going to sleep.
the Prado is back
I'm just not understanding the engine choice at this price point.  It's based on the GX, just put the GX's engine in it.  This truck with the GX's engine, I'm buying one to replace my built 2018 4Runner and offroading it here in Colorado.  Follow me around with a camera, I'm a living commercial for your brand and your products.  But with this engine, for this much money?  And knowing that the 4Runner will only get the 4-cylinder turbo, because it won't be allowed to compete with the Land Cruiser?  I was a Land Cruiser buyer, now I'm 99% buying the GX.
The only thing missing is the rear suicide doors
nice...but only seats five...no bueno
4 cylinder turbo 👎  Underpowered and overrated. What a downgrade.
55k for an all plastic and cloth turbo 4 cylinder? Fail.
bet 50 bucks gonna cost more then a caddy escalade lmfaoooo
How much?
Its official they killed the 4runner leaving Fortuner the new successor
I have to admit that the front grill looks like my chicken wire fence
Will there be a manual version?
Really hope they are joking about paying a subscription fee to remote start your car
Awesom​e
v6 please
Not a real land cruiser it’s not full size
I'll keep my 80 and / or 100 Series over this. but cool concept Toyota
Love the old school looks❤
One of the biggest reasons the Land Cruiser failed besides cost was a lack of marketing! Toyota needs to market this vehicle to the common joe ,most Americans dont even know what a Land Cruiser is.
The Toyota Landcruiser is now perfecter and that steering wheel 🦾 with the 360 strong strengthy appearance exterior and Interior amd STEERING❤  is magnificent for off-road cruiser modernity. Well done Toyota! Add Memory seat + Small Moonroof + Roofcargo +soft  ambient lighting ✨✨✨ can tell it'll booming Toyota's now
Cool car!
Land cruiser have become a Lego car
I can appreciate the focus on off road but the styling looks a little cheap and “hybrid 4-cylinder”??? I think Toyota downgraded this model and not in a good way.
will it be available in germany?
Base model for 80k at dealers near you.
Toyota has to partner up with Falken or Toyo for All Terrain Tires to keep it Japanese
❤ I’m in love with car but   They Should brought the new 4 cylinder diesel engine that they put on the 70 series , on the other side of the world 😢
I was hoping you bring a smaller engine version and get it around 40g, like the bronco sport. Get more people to landcruiser with lower engine, maybe around 250HP or 270HP. The bronco sport sells very well because of this price point. Love the new design.
Only 65% dealership markup and you can't actually get one!!!
No third row!!?? What shame
It better have a good price because none of this numbers are really better than the competition… yet dealers will charge $50k over sticker and dumb people will pay it
Well done! Toyota should have done this since 10 years ago!!! Toyota shall bring special trim for off road enthusiasts love to modify their 2024 Landcrusier. Especially, with larger wheels arch just like Jeep Wrangler  and removable roof just like Bronco
Great to see Toyota designing their cars in collaboration with Lego technic😃
The incredible shrinking car.
looks great, i like the base 1958 version and the "first edition" trim (would be my choice), but honestly, i still just wish we could get the 70 series in north america- those are still the coolest and most reliable. i appreciate the rugged and sort of throwback styling of this new one, as well as the tech, but honestly would still take the outgoing 200 series. i will probably grab one in a few years after everything's been time-tested, proven, and fully dialled in. until then will keep enjoy my '22 4runner (and wishing for a 76).
This has to be the hottest mall crawler any soccer mom could want!!! I mean who wouldn't want all of the whopping 8" clearance when you're driving over the parking lot dividers? And a roaring 4 cylinder engine combined with a Prius electric engine? Who could ask for more??? The Australians must be laughing their behinds off about this "off roading rig". I'm glad I got my 5th gen 4Runner before Toyota started making these soccer mom rigs. I'll drive my 4Runner until its last gasp, and then I'll probably get a Jeep. It really is sad that Toyota doesn't understand the "overlanding" market. People want PLATFORMS that can be built out. You want to put 38" tires on a Jeep? No problem, you don't have to do any body chopping. Everything on the Jeep platform is made to be built out. You want a fat diesel engine with some serious torque? Jeep offers one. Toyota? No, a 4 cylinder engine with life support from an electric one. Few overlanders/off-roaders will want stock rock sliders/suspension/roof rack/lights/bumpers/tires/wheels. What I wish Toyota would do is to offer a bare bones "next to unbreakable" beast of an off road machine that is made for being built out. I want the option of a Cummins diesel, or a fat V8 with torque for days, I want to be able to put HUGE tires on without a body chop. Make modular frame mounts for a variety of 3rd party rock sliders, offer modular junction boxes that makes adding lighting, etc a breeze. Buying something like the new Cruiser is not really an option. I'd be paying through my nose for useless stuff that I'd be replacing the first month. Super disappointing.
I like the design on the lexus more.
You’d think they would be able to have more than 8 shots to keep showing over and over again 🙄
Thank You Toyota,  and Thank You for NOT having that UGLY front Grill  !!!  ( please stop doing the huge Ugly Lexus huge alien mouth grill and huge bottom fish feeder mouth on the Toyota grills )
It’s a hybrid, so not really built for off-roading
Man is kinda sad that y'all didn't get the 3.5 V6 LC300 😭😢
You guys are seriously going to charge a subscription for remote start?
Only way I would buy one is with a normal engine and no computer components...🤫
So it's a reskinned 4Runner
This is really cool, but it feels like it's replacing the 4Runner.  It feels like an offroad midsize, and that's what I always felt the 4Runner was.  Still really cool, though.
Very nice, looking forward seeing and driving one. I've owned 6 land cruiser the last 25 years and will always drive one. Nothing like a #landcruiser
I love Toyota but come on this looks like a ford bronco, rav4 or many other brands out there today...
looks like a 4 runner just boxier not really a fan i like the old landcruisers :(
I was hoping it would have the twin turbo V6 😕
Anybody else thinks this looks bad?
Geeat vehicle, to bad Prado is no longer available. This is too big to be called Prado and will not fit many rural roads, especially in Japan.  I do not understand why Toyota keeps growing their models leaving customers who drive on narrow roads behind.
I wish it was how it is in other countries 😞 and it’s not big enough!
For those saying how small it is it's like a GX blah blah blah. Its only 1.2 inches less in length than the 200 series.  (it's actually 1.5 inches longer than a 100 series, half an inch taller, and 1.5 inches wider) Wheel base is the same. Width is the same. Ground clearance is the same. It's not even an inch shorter but thats because it doesn't have a roof rack. Compared to the current GX it's 1.5 inches longer. ITS 4 INCHES WIDER and a hair shorter in height. Wheelbase is 1.4" longer too. SO REALLY THAT MEANS THE NEW GX IS CLOSER TO THE LAND CRUISER NOW AND NOT THE OTHERWAY AROUND.
Gas mileage?
It would be real cool if you could make the 70 series available in the United States instead of having the 4Runner/GX/Parado... 3 versions of the same basic SUV. I know this will fall on deaf ears, but we would like a real, economically priced Land Crustier in the United States. Please, no more of all these Gucci versions of the same basic Toyotas.
It looks nice, but I am not a fan of a hybrid 4 cylinder engine with less hp and towing capacity than previous models. Where is the front locker, the true all terrain tires, no air compressor and previous models had everything standard and now there are a lot of accessories that you have to purchase. I do like the smaller overall size.
очередной брак😅🤣😂
Wish it was 6 cylinders
rip 4runner
I want one !!!
No third row? People with 4 kids like to off road too. It’s the only reason I bought a 4runner.
This presentation is mouth watering.
Range rover front and jeep Cherokee back looks.
I'd be disappointed of this Landcruiser goes through alot of quality and saftey recalls which could have been avoided.
Hybrid? Yeah no thanks lol
Will EU customers also get it?
Why not the tundra TT V6 tho?
i wonder when you can pre order this Toyota Land Cruiser dose any one know what the just in ev mode what the range is hopefully we can pre order them
Looks are a let down when this body shape will be used for 10+ years. I’m sure the capability will remain high though.
That all good but my real opinion..it looks like a lego car
Thank you Toyota,I've been waiting year long for these,finally I made up my mind that I'm gonna own one.Thank you for listening to customers and modernized the one and only LANDCRUISER.! ❤❤
I’ll keep my Hemi powered V8 Wagoneer. Cute car though…
No 3rd row seats?
I think the LC just got screwed.
Love it
can they make it low tech stupid land cruiser? id prefer that.
Hybrid systems and Offroading don't mix.. I know many 4xe owners who've experienced massive system failure when it's pouring rain or when there's a lot of water/mud off road...
So the boxy design is now in and coming back, Btw that's a beautiful design toyota🤍🤍
This is not a landcruiser. Its a prado
Toyota has just been killing it. Bring on the new 4 Runner & Stout
Is every designer at Toyota taking hits of amphetamine before work? Their killing it!
What a disservice to the Land Cruiser name
New Toyota Land Cruiser Prado Is Beautiful
Love the design, chonky! 💪💖
Stop putting in a turbo engine!
Did you just make the Prado - The new land cruiser? What is the future of the LC300? This is the Toyota version of Lexus GX... Lexus LX used to be the equivalent of Land cruisers right?
Land Cruiser Prado if you know you know 😉
Toyota never disappoints ❤
What about 4runner ?
Subscription services for a key…
Beautiful ❤
In the rest of the World Is called Land Cruiser Prado. Is the layout for the Lexus GX. And they got Diesel engine. Mid Size SUV  The rest of the World got Land Cruiser 300, Lexus LX in the US. Full Size SUV.  You need some hybrid J70.
Sorry US, the rest of the world will get it as a Prado with a turbo diesel engine which lasts forever hehehe. Sweet car indeed
No subscription services built into cars. Say it with me.
interesting. would be curious to see what tires and lifts this can handle
I’m a bit disappointed. The new GX looks better. I’d rather have an LC 200.
Was hoping that Toyota would turn the Land Cruiser into a soft top Bronco/Wrangler fighter
I-force max but not the V6 one, so is the sequoia bigger than the land cruiser?
the new design of the land cruser just sucks  nothing to do with legend, I can see marketers have worked out for the  US market, it looks like a ford
That ain't a land cruiser lmfao that's a fj cruiser with a downgrade engine. Disappointing!
Does it run on regular gas?
Look like fully built for off road
Is the voice AI?
This is just a downgrade from the real Land Cruiser we get a v6 with 3.3L and 700nm for torque with 304 horsepower
*Toyota Land Cruiser Prado 2024 Not Toyota Land Cruiser 300 2024*
This is great but why do we need the 4Runner now??
Best looking land cruiser by far👍😍😍😍
This new toyota looks more like Chinese car but not Japanese...😢
8.3 inches of ground clearance????
Bring this to India and it will sell good, people are buying even the toyota fortuner for 70000US$ like crazy.
The new generation of Land Cruiser does like 4 runner and Fj Cruiser :)😂
THE PERFECT DESIGN FOR MY MIND. 🥰
I love it this incoming generation , but was disappointed and shocked there was no tailgate…guess it beats the barndoor from the gx460.
Toyota, Please also bring the full size LC300 to the US. This baby LC is nice, but it's too small.
Needs more tire sidewall. Offering 17s wouldn't be out of place for the segment.
Just modern FJ cruiser to fit LCD screen styling - I'm out.
This is a 4 Runner that Toyota instead of pricing it as such decided to take it up market and call it a Land Cruiser Light. That is why the pricing is cheaper, it's a more expensive, what was supposed to be the 4 Runner pricing. Look at the placement of the hoists, Fog lights, the suspension, the gate opening up, the tonneau cover, they are exactly in the same place as the current 4 Runner. The suspension it's exactly the same too. The tires are the same too. Heck it's only 1 inch longer because it comes from where the current 4 Runner used to come, the Land Cruiser Prado. Again pricing, is ridiculously expensive for cloth seats and less tech, the 1958b would have been the 4 Runner SR5. Everyone say goodbye to the 4 Runner.
Toyota should introduce a Land Cruiser mini - 5 seats, back seat on adjustable rails (more space on boot or leg space),back foldable flat for sleeper mode, All WD
Hahaha yes it’s back,  For sure there will be arabs will put r26 and 2jz in this one for sand terrain racing 😂 just like they doing in the old ones. So cool!
dealer mark ups gonna go crazyy.
Some of the styling is ok, I just don’t know why most manufacturers go for the huge front grill area. I would have done back flips for something like the 70 series.
The best feature is the front sway bar disconnect!! But too many other sensors. Go the Prado!
I call Toyota every time I buy a new Wrangler and let them know they lost another sale I want a 4 door FJ40
First of all I'm a huge Toyota fan and own 7 of them, 2 are Land Cruisers, a 1969 FJ55 wagon and a 1967 FJ40. This new Land Cruiser will obviously appeal to the new generation of buyers that don't know or care about the real heritage of what Land Cruiser is: Simplicity, ruggedness, off-road capability without electronic doodads, a manual transmission and a removable top. Us old school types that would be ecstatic over these things are left out here in North America. Toyota will sell some of these, but will still miss out on sales to Bronco and Jeep. Toyota has a waiting list on the 79 series Land Cruiser in Australia. A waiting list. It's a basic off-roader with manual trans, manual roll up windows, cloth and vinyl, etc. Those 2 Land Cruisers I mentioned at the beginning of this reply? Toyota had both of them in the lineup at the same time. Yes, a removable top short-wheelbase truck and a 4-door station wagon. Why can't we have both here in the U.S? Jeep does it.
I fucking love this thing
So disappointed it’s not a 4 door FJ40
8.3 ground clearance? 👎
4 cylinder Hybrid?? I'm so disappointed toyota. Goodbye reliability. Have fun trying to tow with that😂
Inside of these new Toyotas look cheap and plasticky. You bring this junk back but won’t bring the FJ , what literally everyone wants
well done!
Trash
2.4?? 😢
Wish the FJ Cruiser would make a return, that’s the last Toyota I ever bought. :(
The whole world is talking GREEN and you are making a big SUV putting more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere!
It has a battery, that's a hard no. When that battery goes south, good luck.
Well, I haven't been this excited for a vehicle in a long time. I have been looking at a 2 door Land Cruiser to leave at our (soon to be) place in Italy. I was just talking to my wife about how it sucks that there is no Longer a Land Cruiser here. I have literally been online for several hours today looking at Wranglers and Broncos. Now I run across this? I had no idea this was coming, but I can tell you that this is for sure my next vehicle for here in the states! I love the heritage look of the round headlights. Thank you Toyota, looks like Ill be at the dealership soon!
4 cyl…and for that reason…I’m out.
The way the video basically implies the 300 series doesn’t exist
I want the 79 series land cruiser🛻💨🤭
So disappointing….   I will just keep my 97  ….   Please send over 300 series diesel or 70 series!
4 cylinder hybrid land cruiser does not sound right. Toyota killed land cruiser name.
PLEASE PLEASE COME TO KOREA!!!!!
Dear Toyota, will there be a 6th gen 4runner?
A serious competitor to the bronco
Designe copied from land rover defender
Love this!!
So… no front locker?
No tailgate!?
Doug DeMuro was right!
Will you actually produce these or will they become unicorns like all your other vehicles?
At first glance I thought it was an FJ Cruiser
I was hopeful it was gonna be a diesel
For the mid 50k price, i feel like people might go with this over new 4runner
Only the driver can change the volume level lol I like it.
Needs 17" wheels and 35" tires in a 2 door configuration to excite me. All the tech actually is a turn off... as that's more things I cannot fix in the field when things go wrong (which they will).
$50k base price and no electric seat………..it’s meh for me. Only LC I ever liked was the 200 though so it’s not a thing for me. I prefer the second gen sequoia.
With the Landcruiser shrinking to GX-size, maybe the new forerunner will be more of a Jeep/Bronco competitor?
WE WANT A DAMN HYBRID 4 RUNNER
Yes! I was hoping there’s be a new model that would struggle to make inventory requirements and have a marked up msrp of $55k for a base model…
Toyota sequia is much more powerful💪💪
Aww, for my birthday? Shouldn't have!
Hoho.. Love it..
Why!!!!! Why a turbo 4 cylinder…. Looks great! It just needs a naturally aspirated v6.
Knocking it out of the park! Especially with the price point!
Is the 4 runner being scratched off for 2024?
In 20 years all be able to afford the 2024. Maybe. 😢
Not a Land Cruiser should have called it FJ Cruiser i hope they do not ruin the new 4RUNNER.
Hoping and praying that we get something similar with the new LC Prado here in Aus. And that blue colour, wow!
I about time!! Thanks You.
Instead of 3 models, wish they offered 3 different engine options. 4, 6 and 8 cylinders
This is exactly what the community wanted, I’m enamored that a manufacturer actually listened to their consumers for once, I mean look at that base model interior, it’s shaped modern but looks like it’s from the 90s, wow I’m buying one
Glad to see the Land Cruiser got a good bit smaller, and I adore the boxy styling, circular headlights, and the gray tweed cloth interior on the base model!
I'm not digging the grill it's not that aggressive looking and the back exterior looks too plain. I like the boxy design though and the side profile.
Is this the prado tho?
only if toyota does something against the dealer mark ups! the markups are tarnishing toyota's image... dealer greed is atrociously high.
GOODBYE RELIABILITY
I may be in the minority but I hate this, it looks like a defender and a Kia soul.  No clue why they dropped the ground clearance.  I was hoping for something more utilitarian but cloth seats are not it.  Such a disappointment
Dealers can’t wait to mark these up! 😂
Is this a newer version of Prado or the LC 300 2024 ? I am confused?
This is a backwards step for landcruiser. Less power, less internal room, less towing capacity, less ground clearance, less departure angle, and the rear door is rubbish!
Toyota will shoot itself in the foot since it will allow dealers to mark it up beyond MSRP, followed by potentially low sales then go "why isn't the LC selling? time to cancel again."
Hell yeah subscription for digital key!
Where's the Turbo Diesel V8??  Nice 4Runner.
Amazing, but it looks more like the next 4Runner than the Landcruiser. Where does this leave the Runner?
Does the first edition around lights or are they rectangle?
It looks like the FJ cruiser
A 4 cylinder engine 😢
Same as the new GX in its own way and I love them both equally! Makes me wonder where the new 4Runner will fit in.
6000 lbs is a bit on the low side
Can it fit 35s without trimming?
Really, hybrid motor only? What a way to ruin a great platform! No v8, no thanks!
Really awesome
Finally, the 70 series diesel land cruiser we've all been waiting for......
Looks like a defender from Toyota. Was it the same designer? they destroyed the iconic look of Crown too. Could have given a different name to the newer model and kept the old lineup
Please add V6 in the future. I’m sure myself and others don’t want to spend an arm and leg for the Lexus to obtain the towing capacity desired.
This WITH a Diesel engine.  I doubt my comment will be noticed... But can you imagine if it were granted?
Mfkers recycled the fj cruiser side mirrors and copied the styling lol
no 3rd row?
I can see it already.   1958 in white,  2” lift, 33” at tires, arb front bumper, rack, rear bumper mounted spare, white steelies and the right driver to appreciate its capabilities.   Nice job Toyota.
Yeah, well make one with a solid front axle again for those of us that go seriously off road (not just on dirt/forest roads) and I'd consider it.  #TiresOnTheGroundMatter  #WeDontNeedNoSteenkingBrokenTieRods
I wish we had a release with a 100% ICE rather than a hybrid and a V8 to compensate for the toque loss from the 2.4L I4.
Kinda reminds me of the FJ...too bad its out of reach for us normal people
Toyota needs to bring back the FJ cruiser
Imagine building a small compact suv like this. It would definitely sell like hotcakes, especially here in Philippines.
Darn. Would love to buy this. Too bad it's out of reach for anyone but the 1%
so is this a 300 series or a prado ??
Ughhhhhhhhh when a FJ cruiser has a 3 way with a Bronco and land Rover this is what you get
Okay....how much will this set me back?
Still no front locker.  Whats with toyota.  No front locker on new tacoma and no locker on this thing.
LOTS of electronics to crap out on you. Plus no way a hybrid powertrain is as reliable and easy to field maintain as a standard non turbo boosted powertrain. There will be lots of these cruising the mall and Whole Foods parking lots, but will it be bulletproof off road in the wild? I doubt it.
The driver totally looked like they were going to understeer off the hill @0:36
This is awesome. I just wonder how they’re going to differentiate it from the 4runner
>Low 50's starting  So $110's starting with unchecked dealer markup?
so its teh toyotas bronco?
no wonder they stopped producing FJCruisers
Pros: lots of heritage cues; so much so that the silhouette is that of an 80, the overall two tone and blockiness is that of an FJ cruiser.  The LC 1958 will be somewhat affordable in the 50k range, which is 30k cheaper than the previous 200.  Cons: 4 banger, no third row, smaller than 200 but slightly bigger than 4runner, departure angle and clearance. I’m forgetting something…  GX 550 was impressive at debut.  The new LC…. I’ll need some time to digest.  Once I see one blacked out, lifted, pushing 35’s at freeway speeds.  Maybe then will I be won over.
Nice, another car nobody can afford! Can't wait to see the 96 month loans on these bad boys!
Toyota a symbol of reliability>
The only thing I'm worried about is if there may be an overlaping of toyota SUVs since the new Land Cruiser is a significantly smaller than its prior models and assuming  the announcement of the redesigned 4runner coming next year. otherwise, I absolutely  love the design of this new New Land Cruiser, Though it has gotten a little smaller, it will be more affordable for toyota Land Cruiser enthusiast.
Is it 2024 Prado????
Toyota is the #1 funder of congress persons who supported the insurrection by objecting to the 2020 US Presidential election.  Maybe it is time to switch to Chevy or Ford.  LINCOLN PROJECT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed8HFawtEIE
😍😍😍
Ford Bronco and Jeep shakin in they boots rn
What’s the Mpg?  Lol.  If it’s less the 35mpg then, I prefer the last Gen.
Impressive but NOT a fan of subscription needed for things like remote start or heated seats. I live in Minnesota those things should come standard without perpetually paying extra for them.
Amazing car
Why so many turbo engines though :(
Looks a little boring imo
I was really hoping itd be a toyota equivalent of the new GX550. Instead what we got was a more expensive 4runner. Over 50k with bare bones no options..... 4runner starts at 40k and has more offroad capability. Pretty disappointed.
toyota nailed it with this one
Oh yeah. Time to save
No 3rd row😮
Hope they comes with 360 camera!
Now, we need the all new 4runner.
Doug Demuro is going to go crazy
Bring back the MATRIX and CELICA! Corolla hatch doesn't do it as well as the Matrix did...
Terrible, a four cylinder, no thank you.
Tailgate? Hatch? Barn door?
How is this going to affect the next 4runner? Seems like it’s a direct competitor?
I really impressed by this new land cruiser cannot wait to get one soon 👌
nice  ,this is what we want,  low price ,low spec  no to heavy  basic utilitarian  wagon ....nice to see grey steel rims and white top on the 1958 ,  the dealers  will mark them up and resale  dealers will try to buy them up to flip and reservation holders will try to flip   them  on ebay motors  before  they have the keys
Best looking Land Cruiser after J60,J80 series ❤❤❤
After watching video looks nice at first hated it
See a lot of dirt road, I mean "off road" video footage. Buy no "real" offroad footage
No more 4Runner?
I wish the V6 is available or there could be one down the road?
I’ve been looking forward to the release of this car and it lived up to everything I hoped for!   Super excited to start seeing this out on the roads, can’t wait to see what happens with the new 4Runner!
Looks like a Lego. Better reliability than Land Rover tho.
4 banger in this isnt right... this thing is way overpriced for a whiney engine.
LETS GOOO
Toyota FTW 🤘🏻 🙌🏻
They went back 20 years for the design
I wonder if this is the new T4R and the 4 runner of today will disappear. It was said that it would be next after the new Tacoma
I wish for a 2-door.
FOUR CYLINDERS!?! Hard pass.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗
I don’t care how much debt I’ll get into. I want it
I will never buy a 4 cylinder. Hope it was worth that esg score.
Looks plain and boring. Doesn’t look mean or hard. Looks like a pussmobile. Looks like any other non-off-road suv on the road. Looks more like a mall crawler.
Esperaba con ansias la vuelta de la land cruiser!
nahh it's not it.
It’s foot pounds of torque. Not pound feet. Like horse power. Not power horse.
真的帥na
This looks hella ugly compared to the 2023 version ngl...
This is Toyota's response to the success of the new Bronco.
Why no 7 seaters
Well ford bronco, you had a good run
Not much incentive to buy one of these over a 4Runner, which would be cheaper for similar capabilities. Should have brought the solid front axle back.
AYOOOO THIS IS FIRE
Strange looking ford bronco
Sooo dos ethos replace the 4Runner ?
I'm buying the GX 550, but thanks ☺️
Powered by a bowl of noodles 🍜
Owww Nice Cars ❤😢
Toyota only knows how to make some of the BEST looking cars.
Bring back the FJ40. This is another boring box for the burbs.
Wow I like it!
Incredibles I'm amazing I love amazing know movie Agent 4: The Movie! Congratulations 1,000,00 million subscribers🎉, Celebrating Toyota 100th Years Anniversary😍❤🤗😊!
Does anyone else think the back just looks like a Jeep Patriot? I think the rest of the design looks pretty decent.
love at first sight ❤
Please make a V6 model
That new two tone blue looks so cool. It looks like the fj cruiser
It looks nice but i feel like this should be the 4runner and toyota should bring the lc 300 from overseas
With more power generation capability than ever, Land Cruiser technicals now support lasers and rail guns.
Toyota once again trying to copy Land Rover with the more square design, obvious copy of the new Defender. The Land Cruiser name itself was a copy of Land Rover.
Hello Toyota USA
Seating for 5? What happened to 7? Weak
Hell yeah comes under powered like all the previous ones.
Any love for Canada?
Definitely getting one when my 2003 GX470 dies in 20 years.
This is a nice one. I hope to have one in the next 10 years.
do u bringing ivory interior or you love back interior , this is BS  interior is boring and out dated , its not iconic ..
8.3 inches of ground clearance. LOL
Reliability? But has a hybrid turbo lol
LMAO it's an overpriced RAV4. That's NOT a Land Cruiser. No one is gonna want that POS.
No third row. Looks like a larger version of a bronco sport. 4 banger hybrid. Pass.
Only 5 seats?
The ultimate SUV.
A subscription to use a feature is ridiculous Toyota!! Get with the rest of the industry and make it standard!
1. There going to sell A lot of these things 2. Way to water down the land cruiser name Toyota! 🤬 3. LoL at this thing having this high tech hybrid system but than still using a NiMH battery😂😂😂😂
هل سيأتي السعودية ؟
Too much electric nonsense. Hybrid.  Comon now
Does it come in manual?
square design that honors its past and also to stay as far away from Chinese designs
Looks beautiful but if its starting at mid $50,000s the 4runner is much more appealing!
No TT V6, no 3rd row seat and only 6k pound tow capacity? Sad. Cancelling my deposit.
Isn’t full time 4wd just called AWD?
Nobody ever said “we want a prado in the US”
if this is the land cruiser, is the 4runner gonna be a ford escape?????
Yawn. Show us the redesigned 4Runner already….
Not a big fan of the rear. Everything looks great, but the rear feels like it wasn’t given much love as the front. Reminds me of a Jeep compass or something. Just my opinion.
Engine sucks!!!
Welp there you go dealerships gon be marking this bad boy up
Cannot wait to own one, thank you for bringing her back! ❤
Y’all really released a new body on frame vehicle for off-roading with just 8.3 inches of ground clearance and 18 inch wheels? SMH
❤ 👏
y'all they brought back the fj
fuck yeeee
no V6 = L
Well done 👏👏🤝
Lexus GX550 for the win IMO going to start around 60 grand
msrp??
i want one !
The 4cyl Land Rover Defender cost about 65-70k with 1 or 2 small options. This will be close. I guess I will have to keep waiting for the 4Runner.  Won’t be much different.
Make it all electric.
This is basically a 4 cyl fj Cruiser definitely not a Land Cruiser.  I’m disappointed to be honest. It should’ve had a 6 cyl option at the very least.  What are they gonna do next put a 3 cyl in a 4Runner?
Not feeling the 4 cylinder.
Wow. What a beauty. Toyota is really pushing their design prowess with Rav4, Prius, and now LC. Reminiscent of the FJ Cruiser...
OMFG I love it! It went back to it's off road roots that made it the amazing beast it became, maybe in 25 years I could afford this one. I love the styling cues of the FJ62 which is most favorite of all Land Cruisers. GREAT JOB TYOTA!
2 rows only?!
so,how about the 4runner😅
The dealer markups on theses are going insane!!!
So it's exactly like the 4runner but with a different badge?
Looks like something from Cyberpunk 2077
$80k-$100k
The Best get BETTER, Legends never disappear, TOYOTA always No. 1 (QDR) never goes out of Style, watching from Philippines
This is a pure disappointment for Land Cruiser enthusiasts. I can’t believe you slab the Land Cruiser badge on this vehicle!! I own and owned multiple Land Cruisers and I know what they look like. Why would you use piano black on the ext for a rugged vehicle? Where’s the interior Land Cruiser feel?
😂 4 banger. Basically a Japanese bronco sport with one more cylinder
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo that shit is sooooooo ugly
Incredible!!!
Beautiful car.
Incredible off roading capabilities + boxy design = perfection
Sad that we need to pay for a Lexus GX550 to get a 6 cylinder...this LC sounds like it'll be the same power train as 4runner and Tacoma. Even the FJ 40 and FJ Cruiser had 6 cylinder power plants. Good looking rig with the right capabilities, but shame on you for not consider Land Cruiser owners real interests!
One day I will upgrade my rav4 to this. Absolutely beautiful!
Looks great obviously. I’m going with the Lexus GX tho. I like the look better and added luxury touches.
Aku mau satu
Wonder what the 4runner will be like?
Like it
Looks pretty cool.  Can't wait!
How much will replacing the hybrid battery cost?
Please offer standard 6 cylinder. Not liking the higher cargo space for the battery.
It’s a Prado, it’s the light duty Land Cruiser. I wonder why they ditch the Prado name here in America.  Edit: let me refrase that. I wonder why they didn’t use the Prado name like everywhere else in the world.
Prepping my kidney now.
Hybrid system is a major L. The GX is a better buy and is just a lexus version with better motor
Hybrid? I’m sure that will help when you’re 1,000 miles away from a service center
The beast is back
Nissan: “we didn’t listen well enough and made the new Nismo automatic only”.            Toyota: “have another icon brought to the market, because America has wanted an actual Land Cruiser for years now”
I'll  probably wait for a trd off road or pro edition 🤔

Sweet❤
Looks like shit! I was expecting more out this! Especially on the look’s department
Only $25,000 dealer markup
The Land Cruiser is dead, long live the Land Cruiser.
I like it but they could of did so much more
Dude people are stunned. This looks SICK!  Great job, Toyota!
How many oxygen sensors does it have? Lol
About damn time
Why are car manufacturers turboing everything? 😅
Does take some time to digest all of this. But i do appreciate toyota for making it look different
Please sell direct to consumer…. I don’t want to deal with shitty Toyota sales people!
I can smell 1,000,000 miles on that baby.. as long as the frame doesn’t get rusty ❤
Lexus Gx550 for the win 🥇
Want
It’s already obsolete unless it has a j1772 port at least?! What is the all electric range?
Lol its 4 cylinder
TLC 💪🏼🇯🇵
70 YEARS IN THE MAKING This is just so NICE! ❤❤❤
🎉Awesome, I’m looking forward to a test drive
Woooow!
Toyota is killing it!
