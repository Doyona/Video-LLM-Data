Sailed through this trial to the inevitable annoyance of the lefty producers
They don't want him in charge because they'll never get him out!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 nigel for prime minister!!!!
Nigel is a god. But itv will try to demonise him. When will they realise there lies and spin don't work anymore. Just like the BBC.  Another sinking ship. 😂
Nigel rocks :)
Bro, was almost enjoying it. lmao but they've put worse thing s on a pizza I'm sure.
Farage is the man. Good British endurance right there.
Farage is scouting for things to feed the illegals.
Can't stand both of them. Hope they are out soon.
He's smashing it! Well done Nigel!
He should be pm and lee anderson is right hand man what a country we would have 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Just by reading the comments here is reason enough why politicians shouldn't be on these kinds of shows. Wouldn't even consider politicians celebrities.🤢
He is brilliant what a legend
Vote big Nigel
Hes my winner honestly.. I dont get the hate, when you had the country suddenly and ashamedly forget about Matt Hancock and his antics last year! Making him 3rd place.. peoples family members were dying alone whilst he had his tongue down that womans throat behind his wifes back and amongst other monsterous things from him and his pals in government ...the public are very thickle here in the UK, its quite unbelievable actually! Nigel to win!
FROGY FRED NEEDS TO GO HE TALKS ABOUT IMMIGRATION HE COMES FROM A COUNTRY WHO IS KICKING THOUSANDS OF ILLEGALS OUT & WONT TAKE IN EASTERN EUROPEANS  IF HE DON'T LIKE BRITAIN MOVE BACK TO FRANCE FRANCE IS TWICE THE SIZE WITH LESS POPULATION   Farage isn't liked because he wanted Brexit to stop another 5.7 million Eastern Europeans flooding in 4 billion in benefits, thousands in jail, illegals the English import thousands a month, and Farage wants to stop this, so they hate him. The English want to be run by Islam, India, and blacks. more immigration is needed right? I only know 3 in the Jungle I hope Nigal ask the non celewbrity black girl why this culture commits the most crimes & shouts racism daily
Imagine actually trying to boycott a show because you don't like one person that is on it... what sad little individuals, I feel for their children who are brought up by these bigots.
I don't watch the program. But I love the fact that he winds up all the Soppy Wokes and Virtue signaling middle class lefties
I love the way Nella calls him Farage Farage 😂😂😂. Happy to see So Much Love for Nigel 💜 or as Nella calls him Farage 🤣
At least Nigel got guts would you eat that
Nigel for the win
Is that a Wig Decs wearing?
Good lad Nige 😂🎉 smashed it! No trial tomo thou, can hear the anguished remoaners demanding a recount 😂😂😂
Not nella again tomorrow i just carnt... 😒
As expected, Nigel just dominates the trial with no hesitation. Here's hoping he wins.
The opportunist little man who ruined this country and flared racism. Shame on ITV. Losing faith in karma😔
Nigel we love you.❤
Who does Fred think he is, questioning farage on brexit when the British people voted in favour of brexit and he is French. Go back to France then pal.
Farage fans want him to stay to win, anti Faragers want him to stay and be forced through the trials. He'll probably finish second 🥈
No messing best attitude well done Nigel
Nigel to win 🎉🎉
Nigel Get It Down Ya Farage PMSL X
He might be a few things but at least he hasn't got a criminal record like Ant.
What a joke Nella or whatever her name is you can't tell that she's playing up to the cameras can you she still think she's recording on YouTube what a joke 😂😂😂😂
He sounds like George Takay🙈
hahah 🤣 MARGATEETA
Farage has definitely won this year. 💪🏻🔥🇬🇧
That's young fillys wife..  Proper dirty fing
well done nige
Wild how they took digs at him.. if he was really that bad he'd prove it himself.
No blog for this like on the bbc. ITV know there’d be too much criticism
Let’s be real we all were expecting Nigel to do the eating trials 😂
Nigel pretending he didn't take us out the biggest economic market in the world and shrank our economy
Nigel be hosting this morning alongside josie by january at this point 😂😂😂
Well done Nigel. Not a man to be broken no matter what is thrown at him. This celeb is going to be a good one with Nigel in it 💪💪💪
The comments here are key examples of why ITV have failed us as a country, letting a far-right racist appear on this show. Shame on you ITV.
Nige just getting on with it and nor phased one bit. Well done Nige 👍
So, all you snowflakes paying to vote for Nigel, why didn’t you get off your lazy arses to vote against his Brexit strategy…you make me laugh.  I voted for brexit…let’s see how many like this comment gets
Nigel could win this
I don't think the people that hate him realise that the more they put him through the trials, the more airtime he gets and the more people are going to warm to him.
She's already getting on my nerves
No surprise the launch show is down 2 million viewers on 2022. Its the boycott effect. In the end, Farage may not prove to be worth the 1.5million ITV have pissed away. 😂
Nigel is the only one i know and definitely the only one who has ever worked a hard day
Nigel is true tropper
That’s udderly horrible Nigel having to down that…muck…unspeakable muck..😂😂🇦🇺🇦🇺
She doing my head in already 🤣
I love the eating trials can’t wait for tonight 😂🔥🔥👏🏻
One would think he’s eaten this stuff before, he’s so glib and nonchalant about it. He’s a tough cookie.
It doesn’t matter what they throw at Nigel, he’ll always give it his all! Well done & I hope he goes all the way! 👏❤
Well done Nigel a true trooper… Far better than rishi the billionaire
Well done Nigel 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
I feel sorry for Nigel having to do this trial with nella, her screaming was way OTT yesterday, she is annoying Nigel or frankie dettori to win
Love to watch the eating trials there  so funny 😂 how they stomach  that  stuff is beyond  me🤮
When are they going to show full clips of the structure hanging off the side of a building, the skydive, and Temple of Doom?
hey yall
I love Nella  rose
