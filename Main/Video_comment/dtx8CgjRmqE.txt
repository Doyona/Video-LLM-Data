Fearless by Guapdad 4000, Valentino Khan
she so bad 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
My favourite agent reveal I love this song and I love Neon
why is the starting part of the video so choppy
Sage cameo is best
0:40 why do I hear Korean people screaming
i cry to this video every time i get off valorant now
The best agent
Valorant
Mi vieja w
overpowered agent
NEON!!! Still such an amazing agent release trailer!
upin ipin
Mommy neon❤
Nerf
Best agent so far 🔵🟡⚡
The ylona garcia song.. woah
I LOVE HER I WANT TO DATE WITH HER
0:46 “nah, imma do my own thing” ahh pose
love the fact that this animatied part is something near 12 fps, i understand it like you have to play  the video faster to watch it at neon's speed
THIS RELEASED 3 YEARS AGO????
Neon be rocking the Gabe Norwood Jersey she has in the background of her character trailer. 🇵🇭
Hot take: this and Gekko were peak Valorant
dawn of the devil
0:38 what does she say?
Olala wow neon so beautiful
why does this feel nostolgic now
When i made my Yt name, i didn't realize there was already a Neon agent 😭
*la insemina*
if only they used this as the advertisement instead of the gekko one, this got half the views but double the likes lmao
And then, Temet was born.
she looks cool 💀🥵
Nostalgia
Neon is so cute no cap
Looks like zeri
I can understand what she says! :D <3
My love
Y does sage look off😂
Finally they  nerfed Sonic girl.
So uhm. Single ka ba?.
Take me backk
Finally neon getting nerfed
They nerfed neon and made it worst character 🥲
2:05 i dont have words for this So beautiful!!
İts me
Worst agent indeed
delete please
NOW THATS THE WORST AGENT IN THIS GAME
Fact: she's fan of Ylona Garcia, if u notice the poster
Riot tried to make neon like octane😂
Delete this agent please !
SHE DIDN’T TAKW OFF HER SHOES BEFORE GOING TO BED OR GOING IN ROOM😢NOT ACCURATE
2 years from now i wish Neon had a voiceline saying Putangina mo gagi papatayin kita
why is this category blood and violance , when its game not real life (that's why views are stuck) and it is disrespectful to Neon as caracter to be in that category. Cincirely me :D
The chair she has doesnt loose its momentum after her adding things to the room show how fast she can be
79974 Destinee Highway
Just realized the reason the Turkish translation of "Disruption" is displayed first at the end instead of the English one. Is a hint that the next agent will be coming from Turkey, which was Fade
peak valorant
Thompson George Allen Paul Martinez Daniel
Neons ultimate is awesome
WALIS TAMBO AT THE BACK
This Agent trailer is soooo good. The music and the animation are top top tier!
Bro apparently Kingdom is so rich they have their own Ipads
.
PEG ME MOMMY 🥱🥱😍😍😍
I'm just sure that Neon probably likes Sabrina Carpenter man.
neon will always be a baddie
Only inaccuracy is that she's wearing shoes in doors
Neon was 2years ago?💀🫂✨️
i love valorant thanks for you created the game
I like her sneakers
She makes me regret being Sigma🗿
She is so breedable. ZAMN!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
filipino with blue hair
this, Chamber, and Gekko’s trailer videos will always be my favorite
UYYYY PHILIPPINES
best character in the entire game
Filipinas can just do this
the slow orb comment got me cracking up
te amo neon te amo mucho sabias
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
fingerguns as ult is kinda hillarious
AYY PILIPINO 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I like her :)
2 years later and i think this is still the best agent trailer riot made
Shes hot
What a great representation 🫶🏻
Voice line: Herry Go!!! 💙💙💙🇵🇭
Thank you riot music valorant inc VNG đã tạo ra những sản phẩm để đời
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Arti 😂
Its nice that they kept the filipino gene which is Big calves and she runs which is really good and fits
The singer for this song is also Filipina!
Ah yes another nerf to the chamber trip. Riot can’t help themselves
i love this one
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
those thighs tho, the are not like chunli's thighs BUT THOSE THIGHS THO
1:10  wait the circle thing in the newest episode is on her desk
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
God i love her aesthetics, dude is amazing.
when you realize they kill off poor Omen and Sova 3 seperate times in this trailer
Fix to make it a valorant character not a league of legends hero
Why is Sage always planting the Spike? Lol
Walmart flash
oy oy balımm
Who's here after Clove trailer release??, idk but back in the days agent songs were kinda cool. It feels like Clove's music  don't have that vibe idk if it's me but idk I can't feel the dopamine hit like i reel for this song haha
Sage : “race you there?” Neon : activating her speed Sage : Slows orb
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Vanille!!!!!!
That dumptruck tho 😩
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Neon is the zeri of valorant haha
Fun fact: at the resurrection scene neon is saying she‘ll control it referring to the electricity when she ults
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Gekos trailer is Better
neon is op, but the people using it are litteral 6 yr olds who doesnt know how to play
Incredibile
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
NEEEEEEEEEEONNNNNNNNNNNN
who put octane and conduit in valorant bruh😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this song made it so nostalgic fr
this is probably the best agent trailer
I love how she said 'hay buhay'
Happy Birthday Neon🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I still don't get how to use her slide AND shoot since sliding reduces accuracy lmao
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The most memorable agent reveal.
lmao that booty
First ever filipino to be added in an fps game
😤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Me gusta el trailer
I NEED to know who the artist is who made the model, its gotta be the same team who made Arcane
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Perfect representation of a typical Pinay girl🎉 well done.❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"lumoloban ako" "at kontrolado lang ito!"
This character is perfect for me. The sarcastic personality, the impossible-to-miss flashy appearance, the most fun abilities in the game to me, coupled with her evidently great taste in music. All lines up for me. Not to mention this trailer being fantastic. I know I'm late to saying this, but, well done, and thank you :)
Holly molly🥶
kaya pala mahal yung kuryente ngayon
the ugh is moaning lmao
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i tink this is the best trailer of an agent
Lintik Kayo
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
gracias por darme un main
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Valorant, the game for children and brown people
That end man.... goes hard
orospucocujklarının oynadığı karakter
NO.1 crush 🖤
The song Entertain Me is mixed better here than the official release of the song. My 2 cents only.
Sage will use slow orbs
best agent trailer
Valorant was much more fun back then, anyone feel that way?
1 yıl geçmiş ulan dün gibi
riot pls stop sexaualizing goood characters like neon , i know its for cummers but it hurts normal guys who judge by personality not looks pls stop it its crin ge
sage loves being so confident lmao she might always block neon when trying to race its so funny, but against this me and neon literally have so  much in common its not funny
neon is mommy
Kon.. kkkon....Kontrolado ko to!, Hayyy buhayy.. 😂❤🇵🇭
neons literally me bro
I gyatt to practice neon
If you want a new agent in valorant I would totally recommend neon I got my first ace using only her ult
Even after Gekko and Harbour trailers , I gotta say , this is the best trailer with the best catchy song I have seen and heard , became a fan of Ylona too
smash
Nerf chamber 😢
I LOVE YOU NEONNNNNNNNNNNN
the music is fire
I was expecting an UwU voice
I oh I..... I still remember seeing the trailer and I haven't played this game since she was released and it still gives me gooosebumps. I thank Riot games from the bottom of my heart for giving me so many memories. I love you riot ❤
Still cant believe this was a year ago
pilipenes really its phillipenes
Smash, next question
Neon is just so cool
Okay I just learned that Neon is from the PH and I'm just here to be proud 🇵🇭 ❤
Sage said race you their so confidently because she was going to use slow orb on her
"Hay Buhay!" ??? i was expecting more like " Putang inang Buhay to" hahaha
Omg
it the framed picture of her dog for me 🤧
Neon took race you there so seriously😂
it's ironic that electricity is her ability, all the while power outages in the Philippines happen very often.
nah man me as an octane player is going to abuse the speed
I HECKIN LOVE NEON
the taser from payday 2 watching this Well least I'm still the original spark man
I can't believe that it's been a year
your ranked is trash now
worst game
i want a valorant movie
i love how neon just sings with a toothbrush
man i wish i was neon i can recharge my phone instantly
4.8k嫌い？ (╯︵╰,)
Salamat Riot games :)
Neon is filipino and bhopping montages with her are cool, she is instantly my favorite. I am going to learn her and get good
1:48
I rewatch for the song
I LOVE THAT SHES FILIPINA <33
Kenapa saya tidak dapat mengunduh valorant di hp saya?
And shotgun play was born
I love neon ❤️
lol I just noticed the walis tambo now
mid
This agent should be banned in this game.
best trailer
The old time (:    :(
Everyone: she's so cool Me: she has a big cake
As a Filipino, I feel honored when Riot made this and made me play this game again after 2 years...
Am i the only one who has fallen to neon?
Sage is going to slow her with ability to win the race
Bro SHE HAS HER OWN GAMING CHAIR BROOOOO
MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS PILIPINAS LNG MALAKAS!
HAPPY ONE YEAR MAIN

benim kız
Bro they changed the video thumbnail recently ☠️ Edit: they changed it back lets go!
Lada poto poto

HAPPY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY
EYYYYY
i played valorant on its first days, didnt like it and still dont but i cant keep myself from watching the cinematics also neon is so cute
This has to be THE BEST agent trailer so far!
Очень сильно похоже на зери из Лиго оф легендс только у зери были зелёные волосы
my main <3
Voice actors can bring characters to life
"stand still before shotting" -riot
Riot makes pretty good games as for being a music company
DON'T TELL ME THIS WAS YEAR AGO. How fast....
Love of my life,Neon ......
Pinay cheeks hit diff
They should have named her Jumper. Because that is how Filipinos get  electricity.
sage: I see you have made a few changes insert neon change the whole room
my favorite agent 💜🖤❣️
1 YEAR NA AGAD TO BILIS
Short comings are by our given right to live Life living beings
She is a Filipino
best girlllllllllllllllllllllllllllll ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
🥰🥰
Dayumn, this is really nice. Riot makes good esports games. You can't compare CSGO to Valorant when it comes to productivity and game updates.
AHHHHHHHHH WHY IS THIS VIDEO IN MY RECOMMENDED   So I watched this video after hearing about Neon in my Facebook feed and after that the only thing I knew is she's a Filipino woman with blue hair, so I called her "Blue Hair Filiwaifu". I later started simping for that character and I saw the cosplays and art of that character and there are also body pillows of that character too! I also bought a sticker of her in some cosplay event. And one fact is, I still can't stop simping for that character after many days and idk why! After watching this video my recommended is flooded with Valorant stuff. Anyways I need to touch grass  Edit: No offense, I am also Filipino and I found that in some unfunny RGB News post. I also saw this on many social sites when she got trending. Also one day if I would meet-and-greet Vanille Velasquez (the voice actress of Neon, she's so cool tho) in some event, I would introduce her to TSTB Studios and she'll become interested.
W NEON W PHILIPPINES W PINOY PRIDE
FILIPINO REP BAYBEYYYYYYYYY 💕💕
3 things i fear in valorant  Neon's lazer Raze's bombs And Reyna for no reason 🥶
goosebumps - 1:29 to 1:49
BROOOO
Are we not gonna talk about how big neons head is?
Why is sage planting the spike, I thought the good guys are supposed to defend sites.
neon is hot
Still the best trailer to date
Love to the gayest agent in the game
The most unrealisting thing in this video is WHY THE SHOES??? IN THE BEDROOM??? ON THE BED???? Bro 😭😭
It could be good if like neon had a dash ability i mean she already has but it would be better if faster like she would dissapear in a trail of electricity in a medium distance
i can understand neon's singing on a toothbrush but can we appreciate the sage's skill with the wall once?🙌
i lost
Apart the fact that this video is at like litterally 3 fps, its a pretty good trailer
2 frames per second?
Imagine glowong hair
why doies 1:25 lock so cursed lol
Sage planted the spike xD
time flies 💔
its such a perfect trailer :(( they have a filipina character, voiced by a filipina, even the song “entertain me” is by ylona !! one of our filipina treasures that is signed by 88rising 💜 i love the representation it makes me proud
bruh singing neon just got me butterflies aaagh XD
Sage: Race you there? Neon: Heh, Please you know im gonna win right? Sage: *casually walls, blocking neon* Neon: you gotta be kidding me
Filipino agent
Sage: Race you there? It was at this moment that she realized, she messed up.
I WISH I'VE SEEN THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME AGAIN THIS IS THE BEST AGENT TRAILER WITH A GREAT MUSIC
"Hay buhay"
lucky neon she don't need to charge her phone 😊😊😊
IM SOOO PROUD OF MAKING PILIPINNO AGENT BECAUSE IM A PILIPINO MABUHAYYYY!!!!
like harbour is alright but when this came out it was so hype
This trailer still gives me goosbumps whenver she uses her ult
most balanced agent in the whole game
"Я побежала"
Dito napupunta yung sinisingil ng meralco kay neon
Dam
So bed graphics
put so much effort and animation into chamber compared to chamber introduction this is nothing lol
cs:go better
why is it like 30 fps
Im actually happy that filipinos even got noticed by valorant and made an agent :) im rly happy cause im filipino
I hate her in game, but this is the best agent trailer I've seen
i love this trailer so much! neon <3
the most fun ive had in valorant was when neon released. I instantly bought her contract and was one of the few people that had her day 1 and it was SOOO fun being the only neon. She is my main till this day.
notice the poster in the back of neons room said ylona garcia
heyyyy
hiiii
its AMAZİNNGGGG
<3
valorant i lost my account and when i do my return of account idk my g mail where i put it in my account can u help me?
LETS GO FAIRY LIGHT GROUP!!!! NEON LOVES FAIRY LIGHTS SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
My stinger don’t do that???
OMG the walis tambo hahahahahaha
the montage is neon dreaming
The walis tambo FTW
Youve summoned the filipinos
Cheeked up OML 🧨🎇

Beautifull!!!!!!

neon<3
i'am want play with this sage revive and save you from raze and heal best sage

Ok but valorant trailers have evolved so much like
Worst agent

Split Aware
honestly the love of my life
shes so op i literally got my ace with her im so glad they buffed her
Definitely zeri
I love this agent and this song!
2:05
Me to my temper: "controlado ko to"
Did she said " hay buhay " ?!
my most hated agent changed after neon made it into this game.
That "Hay Buhay" hit so hard.
I’m late but you know what? I wanna get into this game. I ain’t really a “proud pinoy” but hey this makes me proud though. Welp let’s go.
I just noticed Neon wears shoes right but the bottom is rubber, rubber can limit the transfer of electricity. hmmm someone explain
Raze ult needs a buff, riot if you care about raze mains do something
Pls nerf this garbage 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
who thinks this was the coolest trailer in valorant yet. fade could be nice but i like neon's trailer more
worst agent just delete it
🖤
First when neon was scanning and then sage come over why doesn't she scan
no one saw the teaser from the screen
Running gun with bulldog
W Gaming
Sage say race you there so confedently bcz she was going to block neon
I meed more of sage tbh
Sage: Race you there? Neon: activates E Sage: *WALL RAISED*
Zeri: who are you?  Neon: I’m you but with more guns
of course the phillipino person is singing 🤣
Neon doesn’t need to charge her phone
Bro I don’t even play this game and I really like neon I play apex 💀
My friend from philippines says at 1:40 min Said you can control it
Precise Gunplay character
she got them powers from using a fork to touch a charger socket lol
Guys I just wanted to say that Neon is a fast blue electric teenager B)
Filipino's love basketball and the Basketball ring on her room proves that riot actually doesn't leave a detail
Fast af
Zeri it's that you?
HAYY BUHAYYY!!!
neon is 100% related to hiro hamada
somebody : how many times have you watched this ? me : y e s
2 kinds of neon players: 1: *RUNS* *MISSES THE ZAP* *THINKS SLIDING MAKES HIM INVULNERABLE* 2: *Apex movement MF* *HERE WE GO, URAAAAAAAAAAAA (ACE)*
My dad play this game my dad lose and hes said a bad word
i hope we get a viet agent one day or smth bc i think that’d bc cool
ptm me enamore de Neon KJAHSDAKJHD
im simping to neon.
The ringlight!!! Thats so Philippine lmao
My favorite trailer so far :D because of the related feelings and the song
sheeeeeesh
why is she so cute
Now I really would like a Singaporean Valorant character, it will be so cool, because we don't get alot of Representation in Media
I am sage
1:11 ylona's poster on the wallT.T
A filipino agent...... Shoes on the bed....
Love it!! I’m so glad there’s finally some Pinoy representation this is awesome
I feel like they wanted us to know neon was Philippine because if we saw when she was making her room she had a jersey that said “Philippine”
NEON MY BELOVED
2:06 pretty
At the time of typing this comment, I realized that while the events of the Warm Up cinematic are going on, Neon is in her room personalizing it and unpacking her stuff.  That's what the video playing on her wall is.   Edit:  After having some time to think about it, I have realized that the video she plays on the wall could have just been something like a highlights video.
I realized that in the same time episode 4 happened neon just join the valorant team that's why what she watch on tv was from episode 4 lol
2:06 that look, pretty
The animation isn't as smooth as the others though
The cgi in the recent cinematic trailer looks so dull compared to this.
pinoy 🤢🤢🤢🤢  thailand 4ever💪💪💪💪😎😎🇹🇭🇹🇭🏳️‍⚧️🇹🇭🇹🇭
Cute pinoy waifu.  We do all belong here!
Gayrant
not the shoes on the bed T-T
The most inaccurate part is an Asian lying down on a bed with shoes on
oo nga neon eh ay buhay hahah
Uhhhh how you did n t. To valorant? The lore.?
This is a Sage appreciation video. The fact that she used the wall to block that Showstopper is clutch. I felt that was more badass than Neon zapping everyone.
People are saying the chamber trailer is the best but I think Neon has the better trailer
Hayyy buhay
very cute person <3
my favorite trailer agent so far
Kabayan Gang where y'all at?
I'm convinced riot made valorant just so they can make it a tv show years later.
Yoo..can i be the vaccum cleaner
oh neon is a filipino yess me to im a filipino
Riot is trying hard to convince us that stinger isn't useless
shes real *YLONA GARCIA*
Stop playing with me, I WANT A WATER CONTROLLING AGENT! PLEASE * Wall that bounces off surfaces and causes stum when crossing it * TP where the character dives and emerges from one puddle of water to another * Water "Smoke/Orb" with slight transparency and distortion for those who are close * The ULT could be a circular area (like BRIMSTONE's), but instead of a beam that deals damage or death, it would be a water geizer causing long duration STUN and shield vulnerability. An option could also be to create two high waves like the Neon runner, and when crossing the proposed STUN and Vulnerability penalties are applied.
Neon gotta go fast
Shit game smurfs every fucking game makes it impossible to get off of bronze and iron wasting your time and money they don’t do actuall maintenance to the game just update the idea shot yes they are cool but when your getting shit on by someone who is suppose to be playing against gold or dimond the skins don’t matter I give this game a -1000000
they should add one line for each agent singing their theme song
She filipino!!!
This design is very filipino
best agent
kontrolado ko to 😂🤣
Only just now did I see Neon’s poster of Ylona. Very cool detail :)
gago HAAHHAA
best trailleeeeeer for me
race you there? walling and slow orb intensifies
So she's from Philipinas cool!
Bro that sage needs a medal. Rezzed and blocked off raze ult, what a legend
Fade's trailer better
I absolutely Love the hype behind this but I can't play the game due to the fact that my Pc runs on a GTX 260
Bro I'm in love
60fps
Ok
neon neft
I love how Neon is listening to her voice actress’s song
My fav agent
I love Sage's voice
wheres indian versian of it
Man, I love that body 😳❤
Haha singing with toothbrush
risking their lives and their tv isn't even a square
She is Italian 🇮🇹 by the way ❤💯🍑
Died On her first mission lmao🤣
The most fun agent to play after Raze and maybe Chamber 🔥💪
This is how I wished I played neon
I didn’t expect Riot to release a new agent 3 months after Neon
proud to be a filipino
The clip with Neon and Sniper brings me happiness, as as a neon main with stupidly good accuracy, I love pissing off my duo partner by playing neon and purely sniping
Neon for me is pretty
Neon out here with her PSH PSHH PSHHH PSHH running.
1:30 this hits different literally one of the best trailers for an agent in valorant period
why is even the gameplay in like 15 FPS
gah Dayumm
Glad shes pilipina
😅🤣🤣
Did anybody notice the Ylo poster in her room?
I'm happy that neon is filipino from manila im also filipino
This is, and probably always will be the best agent trailer
2:15  Laki ng walis tambo amp!
I just realize that some of the scenes are familiar to sonic movie
❤❤❤
Best agent lul
Hey valorant cloud you pls. Make a Indian agent  :-)
i love neon so much she is so cool his voice got me addicted and here it is "AYOS!!!!"
Thicc😳😳
smash
Jebać neon i waszą poprawność polityczną
Riot: you have to not move while shooting since if you move it can make u inaccurate. Also neons ult: h a l l o p o
1:08 she charges her ring light and laptop with her radiant powers lol
Anyone else notice the spoiler for their next cinematic WARM UP at 0:35 ?
When is the czech agent?
if i saw this trailer when  i am a adult it will be so nostalgia
YES
2:31 Thats a Turkish word according to Google. I guess Fade was being teased a while ago
Hi Zeri, how are you?
very fitting for filipinos to play in 5 frames per second
Zeri is that you why are you in valorant
in Chamber trailer you can hear Neon voice
OMG  she's Pinay?
Do you mind watching my glaive 2009 valorant montage i just uploaded ? 🥺
She is the only Duelist I confident to use
Oköööö
Must be nice being the battery of your phone You never run out of juice
wow she is pretty
Me to people who knows neon is a Filipino: 😁😁 Me to people who knows neon is not a Filipino and a American: 😂👉🚪
But the fact that she had to leave her dog to do all this😭😭
This trailer makes me wanna dance so bad
sage : race you there , Also sage (barrier created)
Mfks out here be pulling hit and runs with Neon
Mulheres muito lindas
Another song
imagine valorant adds kkk philipine agent its like a wrath agent and cool
NERF. NOW.           No but seriously, nerf her pls (The trailer is amazing)
why is it so laggy
buff skill neon and nerf ultimate
Best Agent Trailer ever hahahaha
The filipino Agent!!!
honestly such a lovely character she slays
bet that dogs name is dudoy
Ι αΜ ιΝ α ΒατΗΓΟοΜ ΙΝ ςΓΕΤΕ, 9ΓΕΕςΕ
I love her
Lag ba
When riot runs out of agent ideas: No, this isn’t sonic. She’s a girl and a human and her name is neon idiot.
This Philippines make me scream. Also me like: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*SLAM x30*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *inhales*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*SLAMS THE ASSHOLE*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH--
Love the "Kontrolado ko to"
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
she is soo sexy and ELECTRIC!
1:23 no crosshair marshal headshot
horrible agent
Tracer
Since you will have apex prowler in the game, add pathfinder too. Since you have yoru mirage/wraith. It's not copying, everyone enjoys zipline to a wall or something alike.
When she is geting revive we will hear some filipino words like kayahin ko ito kotrolen ko ito
jett ult: requires aim reyna ult: requires the ability to actually play the game sova ult: requires position of the enemy neon ult: POWER, UNLIMITED POWER !11!!!11
OMG I LOVE SHE IS FILIPINO
Ah yes the open field res just like in the simulations
Id bang Neon  And I can legally say that  17 Yo here
I like how they decided to include how Neon is good at singing. Us Filipinos get a lot of compliments off singing so that’s cool.
This is still the best trailer
this is literally zeri
OI,I'm PISSED!
0:37
0:37 can anyone tell me what she says here?
سبحان اللّٰه وبحمده سبحان اللّٰه العظيم اللّٰهم صل و سلم و بارك على نبينا محمد عليه الصلاة والسلام
No one:  Neon: Go, go, go... 🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀
She's totally a filipino e sport because she said "hayyy buhay"
jett: no one is faster than me! neon appears jett: excluding her
Neon's Ultimate: Unlimited Power
NICE
Bro this is EPIC
when did zeri dye her hair?
i like how the neon playing in this video is the most annoying kind of playstyle, run and gun with the judge and the vandal
Sigorado ubosan ka ng Valentino mukang mahal tyaka ang sexy!
ANG GALING NOONG TRAILER AT TYAKA NOONG PINA KITA NA PANG MABILISAN LANG YAN BOI!TYAKA PANG PRO!
wish they added replay
SHE CAN'T BE FILIPINO IF SHE'S PUTTING HER SHOES ON THE BED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The alluring geometry consquentially fax because whip delightfully entertain off a calm sister-in-law. fine, silent committee
Kinuha power ni Meralco :D
Riot please listen to the requests of your customers all over the world -  1) enable the 4-man queue in compitatitve . 2) allow us to purchase what so ever skins we want in store.  Because no one wants unnecessary skins which always comes  3) if you can ( allow us to choose our own map )
i dont know if its just me or is that i want to see all the agents rooms 🤧✨
QUWEEEN
Oh wow zeri
She's fast but most importantly, she's thicc.
I love how we get to see and learn so much about the character's personality with just the little clips at the end
Did he say"hay buhay"
I loved neon so bad hehehe when I'm about to say "galing mo sage" to my teammate she said it first hahahaha before I do didn't know she has that voice line
How nice of them
zeri
The laughable daniel macroscopically shave because eye alarmingly surround during a wild bottle. friendly, anxious pyramid
come on at least make her speak in our carabao English accent
1:22 hat it not been sova's recon, Neon had no chance
Sage just saved neon twice in same round.. And my sage doesn't even give heal.......
Say neon hay buhay
1:12 she got a Philippines jersey i am happy
at 1:10 theres a ylona garcia poster on her wall
She is GOREGOUS
かわいい
This trailer already has a Filipino vibe, I love it 💙💛
Yas Filipina gurl slay!!
haha all she does is run, lmao. What a shitty game
The fact that the stuffed octopus is canonical named squish squish is adorable and I love it to piecesXD
*proud pinoy intensifies*
sage has such a beautiful heart but i believe she has gone through a lot than most others
She's so cute 🥰
Isn't this Zeri?  a new champion in league of legends? Look so similar !
This trailer is perfect 😻 i love this so much 😍😍 great work 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This trailer will never get old
The only thing that i hate bout this trailer is WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU AMERICANS ALOWING GUNS BUT NEED TO CENSUR THE WORD SHIT IN A SONG which one of these harms more
Parabéns pra ilustradora que fez um trabalho EXCEPCIONAL!
I just want to wonder, how many takes did it take to make that no scope marshal scene
need to know which language is used for sage's revive at 1:45-1:47 if anyone knows, tyvm
cypher died.... again..
coloca valorant no ps4
Was she singing with a toothbrush?
@VALORANT can you do a thai agent please
ı love her
Idk y noone appreciates the music it's a masterpiece
Sage: Race you there? (in a jokingly manner)  Neon: 👀🏃 🏃 🏃
Please give viper one i beg i beg
yo i forgor who said they made this game so that you have to use gunskill to kill
Daym she thicc
Omen got buffed :) my main
the sage wall blocking raze ult is cracked.
Yo she got a crush on phoenix? :O
Neon taga Quiapo
NO WAY, they compiled the entire female fanbase of this game into one character
Everyone else noticed about how Neon watched Phoenix as if She's in love? Just me?
"ay buhay" got me haha
Neon's enemy:sova,omen,raze,yoru,cypher,jett
0:56 “nothin’ that —— don’t faze me” Meanwhile Breach “Omen! That scared the shit out of me!”
So it's literally just Zeri from League.
Nice intro. Love it
I don't play Valorant, but Im here for the music. Very lit ngl.
go go go!!!
Lakad matatag! Pilipinas we made it 👌🏼
Am I the only one who realized neon is singing with a toothbrush
I like how she says "hayyy buhayy"
I love it when she disrespects Kayo’s manhood. “Little dick Kayo” 😂😏
neon is such a fun character. you just slide in and tase the shit out of enemys
League : Zeri Valorant : Neon
"Jett easily outmaneuvers all other agents..." Neon: *ok*
Can’t tell if they’re promoting new legend or new music… disgrace
the drift agent
Astig
The first thing I noticed and am excited about while watching Neon trailer: "OMG, NEON IS CANONICALLY THICC"  "Brimstone...I'm trying to sneak around, but I'm dummy thicc, and the clap of my asscheeks keep alerting the enemies!"
nice zeri
1:03 rip Cypher 🙏
I was surprised she wasn't pissed
eh eh FILIPINOSS U MIGHT WANNA SEE HER BASKET BALL JERSEYYY SHE FROM PHILIPPINES!!!!
i will repeat this again, valorant is a goddamn community. a fucking family. i feel goosebumps every time i see a valorant video
song title: Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia
Everyone gangsta till an agent knows how to run
Zeri and Neon: Spiderman meme
SHE THICC BOY
this sage is the kind of teammate I want in my ranked games, walls to defend you from raze ult
PLEASE can someone tell me what she said at 1:42 i think its lore important!!!
riot: bleeps the word shit from the song Also riot: Jett- "there you are you little shit"
Simping on her
AAAA KONTROLADO KO TO OMGGG
anh em việt nam có ai để ý neon ko có lông nách ko :)))
1:04 Cypher has once again been slain
Just unlocked her today. Can't wait to test her someday!
Zeri in val
so this is what they meant when they said accurate and precise gameplay
She is slow 😃(＠_＠;)
bet her dog's name is brownie or some shi lol
She is very cute..
Run an gun more like run and stun and gun
neon is hot
I swear I still hate the low fps style animations in some videos. I'd rather watch play dough animate.
Di ka pinoy pag di ka sumibat na parang Neon
Neon is so powerful and brave
oh she just got an ult just for cleaning a bedroom, i wish i have that power
this music is a vibe. a good one
the walis was a paid actor HAHA
Nice agent tho,I hope valorant make an Indonesian agent
Hayyyy... buhay
If you ever feel stupid, remember that Sage challenged Neon to a race.
theres pilipinas omg im from pilipinas :)
Oh look its zeri
ANG LUPIT!!!!
I must say she is .....
Neon is the cutest agent
Idk why so many people says "YoU cAn'T pLaY nEoN wHeN yOuR nOt FiLiPiNo", So for example, Japanese players can only play sage?  (btw you cant be angry at me because I'm filipino too)
No one gonna talk about the sage that resurrected her.
Damn that sova revive was legend
How dare she kill my sova while he ultimate that's illegal
sage will keep making walls to block neon from running
trailer: run into the enemy team using your signature, get 5 kills  reality: run and miss all shots then get shot from all sides
porco dio
Number pilipinas number 5, sino kaya yun?
the four asian counrtys are now here
drawing her rn
Neons ult is to powerful
Neon main here
1:12 ah yes pilipinas Philippines
Neon when she gets an ace:Natatawa ako sayo abahahahahahah
Plot twist sage took a secret shortcut and reached there before neon
TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I just have 1 question, why is this trailer 10 fps
If Jeff and Yoru had a kid:
sage being the sidekick and the mom
Nice
They showed the angles right 🐬🐬🐬🐬
This song is made by a Filipina actor
Neon is really a filipino
1:46 Volta in valorant
1:30 when the drop meter hits 0 in kingdom hearts DDD
It's kinda cool how she's a filipino with electric abilities, and there's also Azure Defiant from Pacific Rim, it's a filipino jeager, which also have electric powered abilities paired with arnis skills
Shit was epic and for the character it deserves the hype, DAMNNN.
Neon is like tokio from money heist (la casa de papel) Because of how cool she is
the fps is like my computer's
Easily one of the best trailer animation for the agent but also the agent that easily has the worst select animation
Did she actually said " Hay Buhay"?
is it just me or the animation is laggy af
broken
bruh when neon brought out a pic of her dog at 0:59 i fucking BAWLED
May jersey ng Pilipinas!!!!!!
Omen needs a buff, just saying. Maybe paranoiding enemies in his smoke and decreasing telwport time?
Bunny hops gonna be sick while playing her
god damn they made neon dummy thicc
Sage is always there to guide you, help you and even revive you. She values her team more than her life.
Why the hell does she speak in filipino accent when she’s alone then suddenly turn into an american accent when speaking to someone else 😭😭🤣🤣
Jolyne Cujoh
op asf
Buff phoenix bruh
Is sage her mom or something
Can u see the mysterious agent on the top off killjoy ???…is not astra right…?? Then who ???
Neon > viper 😳
when will siege have filipino operators?
I want this for every agent TT  btw Im Cypher main
i love neon voice actor
when will odin be nerfed
urhgg pls Riottttt I Want my acc back Unbanned i not cheating or toxic well 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭☹
I love how she's singing with a toothbrush lol
YLONAAAAA
SHE IS FILIPINO!?!?!?! YOOOO
eletros
.
As a Filipino, I am grateful for RIOT to have our very own representative: Neon and Zeri. It's truly overwhelming. I appreciate it so much! Also, Ylona's voice is daaaaamn ugh. I love it so much! Am proud of her achievements. Well deserved!
Fun fact: at 0:38 the word "buhay" meant life
sage is always there for u ❤️
PINASSSSSS
Kontrolado ko to !!!
She looks a lot like Vela from Jet Force Gemini.
enjijopjay game sangan endula
"Race u there?"  Sage: *uses slow orb*
so nobody is gonna talk about how sage used res on neo without putting wall
RIOT released another op agent wtf
Hahaha pilipino pala yan si neon eh sabi 'hay buhay'
This song gives me trauma because of trashtrip
I'm not fan of VALORANT but when i heard the 'Controlado ko to' wow they used the filipino voice love it  🥰
Zeri is looking good!
Wow
Let me guess. Her dog in the picture is named Brownie.
Zeri but in Valo
Every filipino like this. Comment if you are filipino.
so trecer?
Music name? Someone?
something going on between neon and phoenix
I wish i had neon's room :(
Zeri? It's you??
neon r34
she caking tho
"HAAAAY BUHAY"
neon is filipino!
typical manila snatcher be like XD
She is literally sombra from Overwatch from hand movements to speed.
Me a Proud Neon main re watching this :)
1:13 PILIPINAS jersey on the wall
race you there wtf u on bout sage
poor Omen :(
what`s music name is that?
So Zeri from league of legends but with blue hair neat aha
It reminds me of someone but I dont think its that OBVIOUS
Easter egg: Philippines and China are actually friends.
the legendary walis in her room 😩😩😩
song?
1:28 when the boof stats kicking in you
I'm not Filipino, its feels amazing to be the synthetic one.
thats zeri...
Is her name spark?
Dude... i miss the spotify playlists for agents :/
Agent - 8/10 Trailer - CRINGE/10
worst champ ever created
oh my god its zeri from the hit game league of legends
2:05 simp moment
That was absolutely insane
Está buena la minita
Is she said "hay buhay" 😳
i love this video
Never really played Valorant for more than a few matches when I want to give it a chance again before dropping it for who knows how many months. I'm just too addicted to Apex movement I guess. Upon seeing this champion, though, I was immediately interested enough to look up her trailer and see what she's all about. Lo and behold, she can sprint *and* slide?  Still nowhere near the level of freedom I get in Apex, sure, but at least I know what character I'm gonna be trying the next time I pick this game up.  Edit: I'm also half Filipino so that's a pretty cool coincidence.
1:27 There is an op in ct, dont peek! Every Duelist:
I really like playing her uwu
damn this update on fire
call of duty players- yes finally something we can enjoy in valorant  *SLIDE 100* *SPRINT 100* *PERFECTION 100*
Sonhia ng Pinas 🥳💯 Congrats 🎉🥳 Teh  Ylona 💖
The fastest snatcher in the Philippines, hailing from Manila. XD
Filipino character! Yayy.
This is dope
Sage said "race you there" so confidently because she was going to use wall to block Neon
Shut up everyone about run and gun shit, lets talk about that dog picture :)
Zeri: What if
Make this a Show. Thank you for you time.
W trailer
its a zeri skin
The camera man : SHESSSSHHHHHHHHHHH
and then we have a speedrunner
Riot u need to fix her ult man
0:45
this agent is for all of you.....apex player
change my mind the dog's name is sparky.
wow what a trailer. cant wait to play her :D
God this fake stop motion crap always looked and will always look awful.   Just render your stuff properly and don't try to be artsy by making it look like your FPS is constantly tanking due to the GPU shortage.
I'm here from/for Ylona
Cringe of trailer
Pinoy pero walang pinoy name kasi taena corny
Kaya pala batak sa saksakan lore nya taga tundo ee hahaja
Ah yes ... video game trailers, the only place where women can compete with men
gaming
Sooooo….. zeri from lol has a sister with the same powers??
Pangit Ng voicelines kulang. Di nag sasabi ng "TANGINAAA" pag namamatay.
hope you can create agent all around world.. thank you valorant team.
And that's what got me into Valorant.
lol those players who think the voicelines are cringe and the character is bad well... shes still too op.. roast her but you cannot roast her skills
Octane x neon?
Why does she walk like that lol
Came here not for the game, I don't play valorant. Instead came here for Ylona G.
YO SHES FILIPINO?! LETS GOOOOO
🌀
I wish it was that easy 1:47
YOOOOO we got a runner and gunner. I might actually return to Valorant if this means I don’t have to move like a sloth… 😑
Wait a min ! This Neon was dreaming about the scenario in which she and sage were capturing site A at Fracture. Does that mean this Neon is from Earth 2 ?
15 fps ZAMN!!!!!!!!!!
As a Filipino, I can't stand listening to her in game. It all just sounds so forced
Time traveler moves a chair  Emperor Palpatine : 1:54
other characters: hush, don't make. sound  Neon: fast as f*ck boi
Valorant already has a run and gun issue. Now riot has specifically made an agent for that.
Damn
Neon ensures such equality of abilities...that its use should only be done in Replication mode....5 Neons vs 5 Neons...If u know what I mean...
I thought only the tiktok vids used "entertain me", so ph rlly becoming internationally known country
ahhh yes the natural, 100% accurasy while sliding, running and jumping
Riot: This game is founded upon precise gunplay Also Riot: So we decided to add a new Agent in collaboration with the ground breaking FPS title:  *”Quake”*
Fellow Filipino! 🤩
Ulti nya Neon sekarang dah berasa kayak di nerf wkwkwk
Salamat sa riot nag add ng filipinoo agent
she is too op
Animating in 8fps saves money eh
Where are my FFXIV MEMES? THIS IS THE WRONG NEON!!!!
mid
wtf zeri doin in valorant???
Im faster
Dont buff or change her pls she is perfect for a philipine Agent
Can we have a moment to be glad riot didn’t call her “spark”
if neon is in her 20s shed be a perfect ship with sage AHAHA
why 10 fps trailer
I love Zeri except she is underpower has hell and needs buffs
:)
this song fits
Nice zeri
SHE IS SOOO OP!
Trash agent with trash voicelines
Zeri but blue hair
Ok lang Yan maganda
just realized but the tv on her room was basically a peek on the current cinematic
isnt this character familier i think it is same as zeri in lol
the art direction feel like there trying to channel arcane but it has the jerky movement of a stop motion film
Haaaaay Buhaaaay hahahaha bet ko yun hahahaha aylabeeet
Weeb won.
zeri shiny
No matter how good your taste in music is....Riot's Taste in music is superior.
Fearless by Guapdad 4000, Valentino Khan
Palpatine would be proud.
This is just a suggestion, but perhaps for a new agent, the character height is short like a midget. That way, it'll spice things up with where to aim and makes things a little bit challenging for enemies.
the game is still shit
did sage just challanging neon to race?
mmmm strange...
hay buhay 🇵🇭😍❤️😁 love YlonaG . gonna play Valorant nah. 😍
this is legit just zeri fro;m league lmao
They added finger guns
spark in valorant seems like zeri in league and both of them are new champions, why not made 1 character that appears in both games? they're so similair already.
I don't know how many time I watching this video. It's so well done, and I like Neon so much
only riot games can do interesting character presentation
mommy sage mommy sage mommy sage mommy sage
Наконец-то Украину добавили в валорант
Did you see a basketball shirt says pilipinas 5
1:13 she's from the Philipinese?
is she speaking tagalog? because i knew what tagalog accents are
is that Zeri?
1:37  Kontrolado ko to! I can control this/it!
trailer is cool, but game is just a cheap copy to cs go
Its always girls with cool powers this is why i never buy boys people in valo
Valorant: Hey can I copy your homework?  League: Yeah, just don't make it too obvious Valorant:
Proud pinoys
Just both zeri from lol and neon in here Filipino made of...  Same actual characters
Is this fortnite
This champ is so generic and i totally saw this coming when they introduced her to league of legends. Its the downfall boys gg.
It might be also Ylona voice acting to this
Tudo duro
catJAM
Cypher dies at 1:03
Meralco at Snatcher pinag sama hahaha
Did Neon spoke a Filipino language?
i was here
Benim dana bundn hızlı kosuyor (messi) 👍
2:21 see the shirt says Bonifacio on the back that's prolly her surname
cant believe neon is in meta
We deadass just playing quake now
Every Filipino in existence has their blood running with serotonin, because I myself am Filipino. And I watched this with my Filipino cousins.
I love that riot is the only dev studio that doesnt play like complete dogshit
I just realized there's a poster of Ylona Garcia on the walls. 2:21
Zeri?
Never regreted paying for this game <3
Nice pictures
*Isn't this literally Zeri?*
Why FPS is Drop?
new main go brr
attitude si neon😂😂😂😂😂😂
need a nerf for this character immediately
So, Tracer...
Am i the only who saw the walis?
Moaning in the first 15sec, a fat ass in the first 5 ✊ hit the like button already
Zeri?
why is this on 5fps?
Neon always dies in a flash.
valorant in ps4 plissss
Ta potente
I love the diversity and inclusion, the name equivalent to each language of each country it represents.
Love the trailer so much! She's badass and cute 💙💙
0:34 that's from the latest lore cinematic (Warm up) ;-)
1:30 When that first sip of McDonald's Sprite kicks in
literally gets changed by a life-changing event created by radianite, to learn how to run
Bro 5 aces in one match with neon broken
She's giving me 2NE1 MINJI vibes
lets go a filipino voice over on neon
for short they added a jedi in valorant
Wooaah Zeri looks so cool
I love how neon's holding a toothbrush instead of a microphone in the singing parts
Wow ylona
i love Neon
What stinger is that lol
No one:- Literally No one:- NEON:- I'm Fast as fuck boi!!!
The fact na di tinanggal yung sapatos before humiga makes me doubt kung pinoy nga ba si neon hmmmm 🤔
Did i just saw Sombra of ow, or just characters from valorant reminiscing ow of different verse!?
Fast as the speed of a Quiapo snatcher
Salamat thanks..
this game is a lot more fun in the trailers
Grabe Goosebumps! This trailer is just awesome :*
Honestly to me the "stop motion" effect of low fps is just jarring with this style of CG
If jett is the wind and neon is the electricity, who's the windmill?
isnt this, zeri?
Valorant never fail to impress me with their trailers
OMgawd it's ZERI.............. 's Sister
zeri?
since when was her “fireplace” a teaser for the cinematic  smooth move riot
stupid ass game
I'm so happy shes FILIPINO :D Shes from Manila and her Bio, music, voice actress, weapons (her melee)  All phillipines baby YEAAAA
Slide cancelling update pog?
10 fps
It's Zeri :)
Valorant should make a series
I think I'm going to switch to this game hehehe
Tangina May vacuum cleaner kana nag walis pa haha
What’s with the band across Neon’s nose? Is it covering a scar or something?
Lithing is my type I think this is gonna be my new fav
niker
That's  Zeri 100%
I fucking love this game dood.
she's kinda like Sonic👀
1:46 "KONTROLADO KO TO! ''
0:37 hayyyy buhay?
PINOY PRIDE YAN !!!!!
Perfection
2 weeks later and they release the same character in league xD
When is the mongolian agent will come out
mhh looks a lot like the new league of legends champ
My new waifu
"Hay buhay" 🤣
May Walis pa WHAHAHAHA
Hay buhay
Riot is adding lots of electric characters now!
Now the big question Neon or Jett 🤔🤔🤔
This is what every montage wish they could be😂
Just ace with Neno! she was fun to play
sage is a pure asian too. imagine she revive neon before putting a wall :<
riot over here recycling agents into league champs
All the weebs having wet dreams over this one
У меня вышел ролик про неон, если кому-то интересно будет посмотреть, то добро пожаловать!
Is zeri .-.
I'd like to think that they made the Filipino agent have a skill that runs fast because thieves in Manila run very fast 😂
a new jet skin?
Good Job.
1:29 Sova OP!!!
We get it. There are no straight white male characters.
NERF
when neon was "controlado ko to" SHOUTOUT SA MGA PINOOOOOOYS
Honestly I think, devs should start making these animated series. Atleast they can do better animations compared to optimising their games
Where reyna
OMG SHES FILIPINOOOO AHHHGG
Time stamp 1:12
Neon is stupidly OP, that's why Imma use her every time
WHY AM I CRYING RN. the music, the details, everything fits so well. OMG I LOVE THIS TRAILERS SO MUCH
wow pinas
Sounds like my tita when she speaks filipina
the thumbnail reminded me of yoruichi lol
Inaccurate, Neon's Lola would be mad af cuz she has her shoes on in bed. Take off your damn shoes!
Music So Beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍
THE NEON IS TO OP STOP IT
I like the trailer very much! Looking for more animations with the new agent👍
0:37 AND 1:35 uhhh did she just say "hay... buhay" and "kontrolado ko to!" ???
plantita ka pala
Lets go flilipino rep
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
imagine going for a jog and you see valorant players doing the neon sprint beside you, this happened to me before HAHAHHA
Hoooly SHIIIIIIIIII SHES BEAUTIFUL
Introducing the first ever Filipino agent
0:29 thats the voice of BMO lol
YLONAAAAAAAA😭😭😭😭❤️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️
is she just a better phoenix??
isn't she literally Zeri?
I'm fast as fuck boi
THE SCREEN OF THE GAME IS NOT FOR FIGHTING ITS HER RACING SAGE AND EVERYONE BEING SURPRISED LOL
HAYYY BUHAYYY  lessgoo pinoy sya
Neon: Gets released Every filipino player: Who dares summon me!
Did I see Pilipinas? 😮😮 Let's go!!! 😎😎😎
fire but kinda cringe
Tried this champion shes hard to use x.x
neon is trash agent she need buff xd
Peter Parker became spider man because of radioactive spider, Neon on the other hand got bit by Meralco lol
how could you do something in my mind (expect for the gender but really HOW?!?!)
Maganda talaga maka kita ng Filipino sa mga games na katulad dito
Filipino OP
🇵🇭
valorant's version of tracer?
Entertain Me - Ylona Garcia 😊
As a console player and seeing this trailer, it makes me want to play the game. But it's not on console. I know there are no future plans for it but it would be cool
I get Mirrors Edge vibes when playing Neon.
darth sidius gaming
didnt they just release a version of her on LOL, too? xD same hair and lightning fingers, different colors and stature
20fps?
the fact that she’s Filipino is amazing and I am too :D
Wzup! Cool Video. I really liked it. If you can check me out!
Kaka proud
Kahit sa Valorant, nag o-online class padin si neon huhuhu
Team Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Cool Zeri is in Valorant
Guys it's Zeri but for valorant
Is zery blue
This character is perfect for me cause the only kills I ever make are while walking💀
FIREEE
Valorant help me i cant login I click on stay signed in but it doesn't
i hope u umm remove or fix the run and gun cuz its toooooo op its not fun anymore
God bless you.
oh the trailer is so cool!! i like her already. cool character design and just the vibes in general -- also, something about said vibes makes me think that she and jett would be best friends lol
First filipino character ☺🇵🇭
What is the song name?
It's literally tracer
Omaygadisthatapilipinasjersey?!

Aynı ben beyler
We've been summoned by the valorant 😂😂😂,let's go Edit: Any Filipino's here
that bind map right?
"Kidlat"
FILIPINO TIME LET'S GO!
am i the only one that noticed that they sort of leaked a video of theirs in this video because when you see pheonix on the tv its a clip of their video called "warm up"
Riot should make a series of film or a movie about valorant
When she said “Hay buhay..”  I felt that.
Literal finger guns
This is just Zeri from LoL wtf??
suupeer
is this neon character trailer or actually a bop music video lol
02:16 - yung walis Neon, mygad!
ÇOKSELSİN
Neon is wearing shoes inside the room? dafuq...
1:54 “Abilities create tactical opportunities”
She's going to mess with your frame-rate as well. Look at that!
i love valorant
new waifu <33
Riots new champ and agent look so similar lmao
Я и не знал, что Валорант подписал контракт с Дорой  0:47
CodeMiko?
She so much beautiful
Now i feel like Filipinos are less visible now that we have representations. Thank you!!
Alright, yes, Riot confirmed that Neon and Zeri were made *alongside* each other. They’re not the same person. Y’all can stop asking now.
One meaning one word PERFECTION
we actually needa jett vs neon speed race cinematic
Damn this trailer for zeri looks sick asf
They really don't want to animate like this video have probably 10-12 fps!
Literally Zeri but Blue. I love it.
THICC ASF
What does she say at 1:45?
another ow character in val riot never seem to make anything creative
So she's the running guy from til tok
KONTROLADO KO 'TO!! YAS QUEEN
There's a PILIPINAS JERSEY NUMBER 5 omg thank you ate Ylona congratsss
Neon from Philippines?
She is lit dangg
NEON IS FILIPINO? LESGOOOOOOOOO She just said "HAYYY BUHAYYY"
nice copy paste from the new champion in league of legends , you're too obvious ,  stupid industries who care for greed only.
dapat voiceline nya "vovo"
never thought she can kill somebody while sprinting
This is one of the best agent trailer and the track is soooooo catchy
I wish I was her dog      If you know what I'm talking about 😉
Bruh apex legend. Don't add slide.
I'm just watching this again cuz of the song
why do they keep doing these shorts in 20fps
this song fits jer so well😍
everyone : 😰👍sneaking while neon : use her full speed 🤩
Why'd they make Neon so cool!! She has a cool character design, and she's absolutely broken. She's so perfect ⚡  Edit: Thanks for the likes gangy
first of all, that's a man
to powerful
So Zeri is here too?
Fr need a series of valorant bruh
Zeri? what are you doing here?
What a beautifully animated trailer.
Her ultimate is too OP 🥲🥲
new sonic movie looks great
FILIPINO REPRESENTATION! WE"VE MADE IT TO THE BIG LEAGUES, BOYS!!!
Well it's about time we had a Filipino character in some sort of video game. Valorant delivered 💯
Parece que ya quieren forzar más agentes
da da super dadad
"Haaay buhaaay"   Cute 😂❤️
Jesus Loves all of you guys <3
it's literally zeri from league
Lesson 1 - clean your room ..be smart
"precise gunplay first person shooter game" what a joke
I don't need your petty company! 😎
Nerf ares
cuando RIOT tiene pereza de crear personajes y crea el mismo para sus dos juegos solo le cambia el nombre el color y alguna habilidad y listo salio, te doy copia pero cambiale algo XD
cool there was a philipinas jersy in the background
She looks like bella poarch and it works since bella is filipino
Neon is to op
1:39 yun natatae ka na pero kakasakay mo lang sa jeep
I'm down bad
Nerf it now the alt that is
She cool and... very OP
FINNALY it came true my friend sed the new agent Neon is almost at valorant
I'm in love
i just realized what neon was watching on 0:35 was part of the cinematic called "warm up"
my friend face also the same like neon
Uff she is lit 💥 and sage ❤️😍
I think, Chamber’s trailer was better
OMGOMGOMG
Is it me or she looks like Zeri? The new champ of league?
Jett : Who Are You?
Lest go pilipino charet yes I'm pilipino ilove this valo thank-you
Neon: Hay buhay!
FINALLY SOME FILIPINO REPRESENTATION IN POPULAR GAMES
wow filipino agent
I thought sage was korean , why does she have a Japanese accent ?
Go on and entertain her
Nah chamber’s better
what if i CRIED
did they just made zeri twice?
Holy shit this was so sick T_T and her listening to Ylona Garcia fuck this is magical 🇵🇭🇺🇸
Apex Legends movement
What's the voice saying at 1:30 when she's all electrified?
LOW TIER GODDESS
"Kontrolado ko to" means "I have this under control"
I just noticed. Only Neon character trailer has choppy animation unlike Chamber and other old Agents that are smooth. Also the thumbnail is different from the others.
no father xD eveyrone!
she got thunder thighs :0
of course nagkkaraoke sya sa trailer
Hay,buhay Kontrolado ko to Is that what i hear
Why do the cinematic for valorant kook so damn choppy, are they the same animators for the league cinimatics? Cuz if they are it's pretty bad
The one thing riot have done well with is the sneaker design. Most games kind of avoid them, but I love the fact that most agents are wearing sneakers. just makes them seem chilled and laid back
Omggggg Pilipinassss!! I saw it in her wall!!!!
Neon is not fair at all nerf pls🤣
nerf ares
I’d like to see her giving birth plz
Go Volta! Charizzzz
Woah I have seen a lot of Filipino reference
What about an Indian agent next Act
Filipino's: So you have called us?  *puntangina intensifies*
Proud to be Philippines here🇵🇭✨
Filipino agent? 🇵🇭
it would be better to add sng servers
I ONLY PLAY CSGO. DONT SEE MY PROFILE OR ELSE
wait, it's that female sonic ?
fr fr
I just noticed that the video she's putting on the wall is the Episode 4 video ! Such a good trailer Riot !!
That "hay buhay" be hitting different doh
😃😃
Zeri  leave chat...
Philippine Pride🇵🇭 ... mabuhay ka Neon.....hangga't gusto mo!!😁
Me as a Cod player see sliding : >:)
Neon's real name is Ylona Garcia coz she looks like her and she posted a poster of her name in her room
So proud to ylona garcia
i knew it. This game is going wrong
HAY, BUHAY!
Does she have crush on Pheonix or something.
She said hay buhay
Um is it me or does it fell like they used 2 voice actors? 1 for the filipino catchphrases and 1 for the english lines? I mean i know the filipino accent is neutral but it is still audible.
"IM PISSED"
whoever animates these valorant trailers should animate something cooler than video game trailers cuz their skills are next level
Dumpy tho 🥴🥴
Cool
So her superpower is run and gun?
“Precise gunplay” “tactical shooter” run and gun complains = Jett 2.0 (jet knifes but automatic and faster than the flash, slide like its cod bc what precised gun game doesn’t have that by now
sooooo....Zeri: SPARK of Zaun? man Riot is so shitty and uninspired they just basically release the same character in this and LoL under a different name xD  fuck you RIOT! imma still play your game but fuck you nonetheless.
this is just max from brawl stars
but wait how did riot literally just make the same character for two of their games and release them at the same time and no one is talking abt it lmaoo
My favorite part of neon is that she Filipino
Wait, is zErI???
I don't play valorant, only here for the animation
this gonna be a shit
Yep Rule 34 is now filled with Neon
these clips are better than me :|
zeri look quite different today
Valorant make next agent from Indonesia
OMGG neon is a filipino??
Hell Yeah!
She's from Philippines!?
OMGG NEONNN IS HERE.
ayo anybody notice neon is a filipino?
Neon sounds like jet in this trailer
Someone's character design wound up on two desks
bruh hay buhay
this is one of the cringiest  trailers I have ever seen
The Walis looool
Why did Riot add Zeri in both LoL and Valorant?
*Hay buhay*                      -Neon 2022
Zeri is that you?
Neon supremacy🛐🛐🛐
Did Riot just Pinoy bait?
When will you put it on PS4😢😢😢
Release it for the mobile please
I know she's part of Runeterra but if you play League of Legends, she  feels alot like the new champ coming out in League named Zeri, look her  up.
Zeri?
That vacuum was from when aisian use cultrual broom sticks
mommy
isnt she just zeri
best agent trailer by far :D
is this Valorant or Fortnite ?
The song is was soo good
What's the name of this song?
Sage's Famous Last Words....
She's cute, hot and relatable. And there seems to be a lot of lore hidden in all the little items in her room.  First impression: Good stuff.
I don't want to be that one guy... but...  Where's the potangina?
too op valorant 🤣
I feel as though valorant could be a lot more enjoyable as a game if it were to not be a csgo type game..
Just a better close range Jett?
was that Ylona Garcia singing? Damn!
zeri its spark but on anthoer world lol
The song is so stupid.
"Standing still makes you aim better." Neon : *Damn I kinda don't care*
Sage the forgetten the agent cant damage any agents
I can’t be the only one who can see Kai’sa on the poster at 2:21  right?
imagine having a malaysian or indonesian agent, "oi bodoh, get the spike"
NO CAP valorant should make their own Show/anime
any Indian character? in future
1:39 what does she say in the background something like lado coto idk can someone care to elaborate plz
Angas
Wow
Neon: Spark of Zoan
Its new Zeri's skin in LOL?
Her design is awesome
As an apex player, this is gonna be fun
Let's go PHILIPPINES!! MABUHAY!!
Ilong palang eh! hahaha
Bro all I got is that neons music taste is garbage
Zeri sis? ⚡
Name and abilities make me think of Fetch (Abigail Walker)
Im so happy as filipino because they add some tagalog language LETZ GOOWW 💜🇵🇭
I like how the songs they pick for each agent all sound like songs they would all listen to in real life.
I don’t even play valorant or even have a pc but this is cool as hell and I know this would be my favourite character
gonna be honest here, still not as good as chamber's trailer. idk y but that trailer just hits different. maybe cuz of the hype?
DEAD GAME OMEGALUL
Zeri with blue hair
awsome agent trailer <3
She do be kinda bad doe
Almost all the val characters was based in Asia
ngl neon looks kinda cute
Philippines Agent, Voice Actress from Philippines, background music by Philippines Singer! Cool Philippines 🤝
Please give us an Indian character🥲
Bring an indian one next huge request from India❤️
I started playing Valorant for like, I say less than a month and this is so much fun! Can’t wait to see what comes in the future!
I wish it will have map of pH and the ppl names are marites
u put a filipino gurl
Team pH lez gooooooooooooooo may new hero na ph
She kinds reminds me of Jett 🙃
Welcome to cod
So Riot creates a female char that have the neon raver street style, shoots energy out of her fingers and skates arpund on static for both Valo and LoL
T H I C C
don't get 'em mixed up  Ylona Garcia = Christina Milian  Vanille Velasquez = Christy Carlson Romano  1 sings the theme song of neon (kim possible), while the other voices the character  HOWEVER, the voice of the character ALSO sings     OPncb_N5JQs
Wait they teased the warm up cinematic here damn
Goosebumps
Proud pinoys assemble🇵🇭
jajpa no les carga bien la pc
*YLONA DESTINED FOR THIS8 .
best agent trailer so far
Philippines?!?!?!?!
Ні,ну Слава Україні!
Filipino nmbawan
she fineeeeee
Thanks for making me play Valorant once again. I am glad the new character is a Girl SPECIALLY from Manila!
Meaning a streat dog
Aso caley
Üf göte bak
Neon hails from the philippines?
Sage really decided to revive in an open obvious op kill BEFORE using her wall lol
Actually re both vanille and ylona portraying neon I thought of a Kim possible analogy re Christina milian and Christy Carlson Romano   OPncb_N5JQs
1:12 Eyyyyy Gilas Pilipinas Number 5 Jersey and Basketball Ring
I love Zeri- I mean spark!
M❤️mmy ❤️
She looks like zeri, the new character  from lol
holy crap this makes me wanna play valorant again! The editing is just on another level!
Oh it’s almost the exact same character that they’re adding to league, neat
Neon is fine tho :0
league and valorant both came up with the same concept character.
the song, singer, and also the new character all is dope!! big proud to philippines
Hello zeri 2
Tracer but slower
Overwatch + pubg + csgo = neon
"Neon"-  Spark of Zaun.....
Ayoooo shi a filipina lesgo
goosebumps ❤️
is Neon a Filipina ?
a voice line should be bastos
Why is this heteronormative?  Instead of what kind of girl do you take me for how about who do you take me for?  Or maybe this is ok but what about...  Instead of entertain me boy why not entertain me baby?  Kinda like Sam Smith. It works for from a male to either a male or a female.
Did you realize that Phoenix’s clip was the same clip on WARM UP Cinematic? I guess Sage met Neon first before catch up with the other agents
Hm. New waifu?
Comunity : fix run and gun Valorent : 👍 done
Jett :  *u look stupid*
I feel so bad for cypher…
So shes from philipines right?
Bro everyone getting sliding in their games
Fake Pinay cuz she's wearing her shoes while she's on the bed
Hinde to Pinoy walang face shield eh
Emperor Palpatine in Valorant Lmao
0:37 she will end up loving phoenxi too like sage Jett and Viper lol 2:20 love that Sage and Brim became the leaders of the team btw lol but yeah Neons face reminds me a lot of Jetts
hair be like 🇺🇦
1:43 Hanggang Laban Koto Letss Go!!!

WHAT KIND OF STINGER IS SHE USING CUZ THAT AINT IN THE GAME
Holy shit is that zeri from league of legends
valorant with the music recommendations ok
Can we just appreciate the sage walling the raze ult.
Gotta go fast.
Is this trailer as 15 fps???
the song in this video is so good i cant get it out of my head now
I think the video needs a new video card, this frame rate sucks
She a filipino?
Ass a filipino im gratefull that riot made a filipino character
Lots of ass shots.
Ah yes "presice gunplay"
Broken ability
hey
I bet there is already people making pron out of this xd
NIce try, zeri
filipino gang rise up
Pls.pray the rosary and devine mercy chaplet to free all countries from war, diseases, calamities, hunger, corruption, drugs, prostitution, abortion,homosexuality,pornography,euthanasia, divorce, child abuse,terrorism,slavery, corruption, communism and all evils.pls pray for peace and joy in all families and home . .
omg shes from my country im so happy lmao
lol looks Zeki the new champ from League of Legends lmao
The fact that they made Ylona canon on valorant lore bc there’s a poster on the wall and she’s listening to her ✨
Absolute cringe
When the new hero in PH inspire... Nice marketing strategy RIOT.. 👍🏼👍🏼
me clutch with neon ult:  PUTANG INA SI OPTIMUM PRIDE
Man I've tried making fake Omen yoru voice. Now, hearing Neon's voice just make me wanna do hers just by saying but I can only say zap pew pew. Can't wait to earn XP's and play this champ. Looks sick
she likes phoniex does she
The fact that this got more views than the actual entertain me song 🤣🤣🤣
Ung PILIPINAS na jersey sa likod :)
ANG ANGAS TALAGA TROPA!!!
Basically just zenitsu and aqua mixed together but filipino
That transition when Sage revives Neon give me goosebumps ♥️
that was a good trailer ngl
nicoooo
Riot time to buff up old characters or they will  become useless soon
Ok ma boi cypher got killed again.
Tracer
Neon vs phoenix. Who win?
i haven't been in touch with valorant since chamber's release and now this pops in my youtube
Omg she Filipino?!?!! (♥ω♥*) i really want to play with this game so badly!!!!!
When will she come to eu
Bruh this agent gonna be overpowered as hell 💀💀💀
валорант как будто не от риот, что за отвратительные промо ролики? стыдно даже
Riot, love the filipino representation but the "kontrolado koto" line and her voicelines in-game  are a bit cringe, it feels like copy pasted from google translate, just imo tho.
broken remove this champion
Why i just feel that sage is the mother of the team
bruh I got her the first day she came out
Let's goooooo!
shes quite litearlly the exact same character as zeri in league, even down to the powesr, voice and hairstyle. not gonna say its lazy but common
wooaaahhh
Hamon
Did she said "Hay buhay" ??
Not the walis tambo 😂😭
Face a series of Valorant, enter an arcane
Raiton!!
Guys I just uploaded a new valorant montage . Can u just check it out pls?
Niceee
Finally they added Octane in Valorant

E
filipinos/filipina be like : potang ina nag add sila ng filipina na character
another 200 years of gamedesign thx rito
wow grape 🍇🍇
0:52 insert Cloudy with a chance of meatballs meme
NOT CAPPING but shes a cool agent but sheeshhh she needs a big nerf already...just watch... ps Riot dont forget its a FPS game like csgo... its not overwatch. You shouldnt kill a good game faster than blizzard LMAO
At 1:45 she says controlado koto or im in control or i can control this
Next if a Indian 🇮🇳🇵🇭Please
imagine playing on a 24fps match... LOL
Dude nobody see neon watch pheonix training and that's mean neon decorate her room and the restt of team training later they go and probably neon trailer and cinematic happend same time sage said to neon come team is waiting and in cinematic brim and sage came and they went
Kakashi's sis 😂
Damn, Neon looks good
Oh hey it’s zeri from league of legends
letsgoooo peenoiiiiseee
trash
this is the first agent that makes the game not look like a snail fight, poggers.
🇺🇦👍🏻
Philippines
She's kinda cute ngl.
chalo chalo gogo
Never would i have thought.... Riot would be able to be crazy enoungh to add emperor palpatine
She said " *sigh* buhay" means "*sigh* life"
Cringe music, bad game.
a Filipino in valorant. I have a feeling its gonna be great
Very nice to see some Filipina representation Rito :)
why tf would you race her
@riotgames Instead of getting Neon get Jinx and Vi in Valorant!!!
Oh boy zeri from league and neon from valorant. Never can these two find the difference
I saw at least she doesn’t have pinoy accent so can still play her without ripping my ears off
I've noticed that the voice actors actually look like the agents themselves. The fact Valorant puts so much effort into it and hires from a diverse background to reflect the agents is pretty awesome. That's diversity done right.
I've seen Erin Esurance commercials with more FPS
Kontrolado koto
Laser Beam
Isn't it implied that a character who can use electricity, should be able to teleport as well?
the fact that shes a pilipina is just amazing cus im pilipino
*Wow that's so cool.* She can't die
Me who just hear the first word ohh yeah Filipino accent
i kinda imagine neon vs jett going like....       neon: You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring.    in response to jett's:   Are you kidding ??? What the **** are you talking about man ? You are a biggest looser i ever seen in my life ! You was doing PIPI in your pampers when i was beating players much more stronger then you! You are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and congratulate opponents, you are like a girl crying after i beat you! Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good blitz player, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And "w"esley "s"o is nobody for me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about Firouzja ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my chess carrier, I am Officially inviting you to OTB blitz match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all!    I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in 2016 and 2017 Blitz World championships, and that should be enough... No need to listen for every crying babe, Tigran Petrosyan is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about me like that, we will meet in Court! God bless with true! True will never die ! Liers will kicked off...    or    neon: You got yourself a deal girl. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring.   in response to jett's:   Are you kidding ??? What the **** are you talking about girl ? You are a biggest looser i ever seen in my life ! You was doing PIPI in your pampers when i was beating players much more stronger then you!

Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good valorant duelist, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And "n"e "o"n is nobody for me, just a duelist who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about Reyna ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my valorant carrier, I am Officially inviting you to 1v1 valorant match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000 creds and winner takes it all!    I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in 2020 and 2021 valorant World championships, and that should be enough...

True will never die ! Liers will kicked off...
i can see Pilipinas in the background 1:13
Pls.pray the rosary and devine mercy chaplet to free all countries from war, diseases, calamities, hunger, corruption, drugs, prostitution, abortion,homosexuality,pornography,euthanasia, divorce, child abuse,terrorism,slavery, corruption, communism and all evils.pls pray for peace and joy in all families and home. ...

Proud to be pinoy
2:28 low tier god
Finally a Filipino Agent
OMGGGG!!! YEAAZZZZZZ I AM SOO PROUDDDDDDDD!!! LALO NA KAY YLONA GARCIAAA HUHUHUHU!
0:43
The dog, what happened?
Her saying " Hay buhay" fills the void in my heart
nice pilipinas version
IF NEON IS THE 19th AGENT WHOS THE 18TH ????
Neon and Zeri are basically parallel versions of each other across League and Valorant. Kinda like that!
Thicc.
this is bad ass.. lol
man, this game sucks ass
she can sprint and slide meanwhile omen can teleport and die… :(
In 0:38 when she said "hay, Buhay" I feel that too 🥲😔
"kontrolado ko to"
she looks like zeri? on lol?
NAI SỪ AE!!!!
Im waiting for Agents from other SEA countries
VAMOOOOO FELIPINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
yall just never miss
tracer and echo like overwatch xD?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
slide cancelling in Valorant the fuck is this Cod?
Pilipinas no. 5 she is a filipina right?
isnt this... zeri?
This is my pers defenetly, i love it
Zeri? Xd
where have i seen a very similar character?... hmmmmm i wonder
That ultimate, I’m going to be so good I love moves like that
Riot, you made a charachter that shoots lasers out of their fingers with full accuracy while boolin' through the map at 100 mph. What were you thinking?
kocham cie ylonka
1:29 there’s no way you pick a op with a sheriff
what's the name of the music?
Nerf her
If Jett and Phoneic had a kid:
OHMYGAHD SHE IS FROM MANILA SHES FILIPINO I LUV HER
valorant for playstation pleeaseee
What she says when she ult?
We really need the dislike button back
proud filipino moment
If i dont hear a single filipino curse word imma be sad
Something interesting that I saw in this video, they tezzed the "Warm up" cinematic 2 days before it's release in this video, at 0:35. Very cool riot, but please solve this delayed comment thing because it's annoying as hell writing something and then it appearing after 2 rounds or at thr end of the game.
Zeri? Is that you?
Riot Games simply dominates the trailer art. Congrats, i've been watching a master piece right now!!
Me everytime there is new agent "This is my agent, no one gonna use it"
riot games impresses everybody with trailers but dissapoint with game play and mecanics  on all games
Jett vs Spark Who is faster?!
That's a good tier sage gameplay right there!
is this zzzz...zeri's sis?
Jett: Looks like we have a competition.
ok.
0:53 Flint lockwood!
canım kızmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
That double wall just outperforms phoenix by 10 times
If her aunt is there she'll Whooped her ass bcuz shes in bed with her shoes.
They made rhe same charactor in two games and no one noticed?
Zeri looks so good on Valorant!! 😍 (I'm just being ironic, lmao)
I RUN AND KILL PEOPLE 😂 OPPONENT: REPORTED REASON GUN AND RUN  RIOT: OHH THIS IS A NICE IDEA  SMURF LVL 100: CREATE NEW ACC FOR NEON  LOL 😂
jetts still better
I can't wait to play with palpatine
This was really whack but I’m excited for the agent yk 😭😂
seems going to be op
i like the how she is placing WALLS in her way.
Guess they adding Wheelchair Agents to the Game now.
oh yes it feels good , i just want to yolo and get rid of that 0 fun coward precise gunplay . My time and my main has come
Riot copied their own homework bc of the design xD *points at Zeri*
que riko
Dayum she filipino
What if Sonic was a human and a girl.
What is the song name PLEASE
Are u working on valorant mobile??
I found my third main.
KONTROLADO KO TO! OMG! LEZGOOOOO!
call of valorant
hmmm yes, swedish Zeri
Yeah, "Filipinix"
Those skills looks similar to Overwatch, Apex Legends, Paladins etc, but it’s not bad so their good. Least it’s not like Fortnite.
0:34 I just realized that the clip of phoenix fighting was sort of like a teaser for the Warmup cinematic
so lord papltine
League of legends: Zeri Valorant: Neon
this will be overpowerd because that slide we will not be able to aim that fast unless were plats
aaaaaaaaaaaaa
A race vs Jett and Neon would be EPIC
The walis in the corner
0:54 how can she run like that? The character animation ingame is just cringe
0:08 neon got cake
wow they put her into league of legends
I think I have found my new main…
That's the most chinese looking philipino I've ever seen. Why do philipinos wish they were Hans?
the moment she said buhay its filipino nonetheless
This new champ looks exactly the same as zeri in LOL (if I remember correctly)
Để xem con này nó mạnh như nào
She kinda reminds me the new lol champion with her appearance
ohh shit yooo fire drop
The next unbalanced op character that will ruin matches even more than Chamber yay can't wait
Zeri but valorant
She looks dope
jett ? ;-;
Looks like the Jett mains get a new agent to main
Hayyyy buhay  Me: take a break before you get into battle
LABAS MGA PINOY!!!🤘🏽🤘🏽
14 fps
She basically said: hay buhay At 2:45 She's a Filipina😯 And said kontrolado ko to at the end
Wow. Even Valorant is Filipino baiting now. LOL
Okay so this happened at the same time as the Episode 4 trailer huh. Noiceee
Nice Zeri tho.
It's basically Zeri from League. :v
I can say Neon is hotter than Jett now can I?
Finally, agent for my fav tactic - rush and die like a little bitch
This thumbnail has changed a million times but other than that this animation is just *chefs kiss
I just noticed the footage of Phoenix fighting showing in Neon's room is from the newest trailer, which means Cinematic episode 4 happens before Neon joined the team.
Hay buhay
Why this is so similar to zeri
LOVE THAT SONG ❣️❣️ Ylona's new song huhu.
I noticed he was mentioned and could be compared to Reyna. That her ulti is equal to Reyna's invisibility. This can be said by the one who is not familiar with the Valorant. Reyna when she takes invisibility no one around her can kill her, Neon can be killed. When Reyna takes the ult and invisibility, you can't see or kill her, Neon can be killed and seen in which direction she went. So I ask everyone to think a little and then comment.Thank you
First of all, I see that the comments below are not very thoughtful. First of all, it is not faster than a Jett. When you press E, it automatically moves forward or left, but you hold both keys at the same time. Or in the fastest case, click and go forward. It takes you less than 1 second or one second. With this new one, you have 1.5 to 2 seconds to press Ability and press to go forward. There is also a difference in distance. Jett is a better starter, which makes it faster than Neon. The Jett literally flies a certain distance as Neon walks to cross the same. So I would beg everyone before they comment to delve a little better into the abilits
neons ulti is basically finger blasting
they teased the new cinematic in here and none of us realised it
1:42 what's she saying?
Wait.... The scene in 0:35 was WARMUp cinematic. I thought it was Phoenix and Jett chasing in DUELIST. *DAMN*
As excited as i am for this, its gonna be such a shit show
Rep 👏 re 👏 sen 👏 ta 👏 tion. Good job!
Litterally a copy of Zeri upcoming league champ.. Riot actually Made a good champ and then lacked originality so just gave the same thing to VALORANT
COD players can feel right at home with her now lmao. Riot be stealing players from every fps game out there
Sage: Race you there?  Neon: Lol your mistake for asking
Is this Zeri of lol?
Indonesian agent when?
An compilation of jett and phoenix?
Came back here after watching Warmup. While Phoenix and the gang were fighting max bot at 0:34, Neon was busy moving stuff into her room.
what a fresh trailer boys, rly liked it
Pilipino character
Btw Cypher dies again in a trailer wtf
When are you guys going to let mobile players play too??
This freaking chick is awesome. Love the design and her abilities. Awesome trailer!
How many times have you watched it? Yes
Valorant Zeri doesn't exist, she can't hurt you. Valorant Zeri:
cant wait for the r34 on this one
is it relesed
Neon watching the Warm-Up in realtime
Oh, fudge, I, don't, wanna, play, please, don't, let, me. 🥺💖
Please stop forcing new agents just to force new agents.
When sage revives her,she said,Kontrolado koto!!
IM MORE SUR PRISED BECAUSE SHES FROM THE PHILLIPINES
Malaysia agent next?
just realized she uses a vacuum cleaner on 1:11 and then they show a broom at 2:15
ight first off LET'S FUCKING GO FILIPINO VALORANT AGENT  second why does she look a lot like caitlyn from league of legends??
precise gunplay
Walis tambo hehehe
A filipino voice character ?? So impressive !
Hmmmm so balanced thanks riot for this character and yeah I'm not kidding we really Greatful.
she's thicc!!! dummy THICC!!
Its ZERI not Spark... XD
i just dont like how i didnt play valorant yet while thge banger is still here
34 😁
1:13 The jersey in the wall is an LA Tenorio jersey (Gilas Pilipinas)
the fact that she said a filipino word give me goosebumps
Other games copying Riot Meanwhile: Riot copying riot
ahh shes prettyyyyy shes aslo pilipinaaa ahhhh so amazing new
Riot really went with lightning champions this months xd
She's almost THICCER than viper
Oh she's gonna be annoying in game o-o
League of Legends: Introducing Zeri, a character whose abilities revolve around static electricity.  Valorant: Introducing Neon. A character whose abilities revolve around static electricity.  This really feels like the same guy pitching the same character concept to both Valorant and League smh.
I guess it's another champ, which fits my agressive playstyle well, but I will probably never be able to play her, because she will get instalocked everytime, like Jett for 100%.. I mean honestly, after the Beta and Episode 1 Act 1 I stopped playing, but started again in the middle of Episode 3 Act 3 and in that time, like in 80 matches, Jett got instalocked 60 times.. And from this 60 times, like 30-40 times, it was a horrible Jett :D
Phoenix has never felt so open to being discriminated
why i having tracer vibe
Hey guys, did anyone noticed that, the new WARMUP EPISODE 4 is already being played on room's big display???
this kinda looks like fortnitee lol
Nice catch to that comment who saw a clip of Warmup on Neon's screen
Woooaaaahhh, we literally just got Chamber 😭 Thank you Riot
They should stop adding these ridiculously crazy agents. I don't wanna see valorant becoming a circus
valorant is the best game with neon as the best agent
The music is so good! Especially the chord progressions!
1:17  When manager said you have 15 seconds to animate this scene
VALORANT VALORANT VALORANT!!! When y'all going to make NFTs! Let us invest and have fun at the same time! cmon cmon cmon
Neon's Trailer and Ep.4 Trailer Warm Up are on the same time, if you notice neon watching phoenix fighting maxbot. Sage came to neon's room and said the team is waiting.
Great looks like were going down the league of legends path LMFAO this agent gonna be broken but still looks really cool
nashe
while neon was decorating her room yoru was getting richer by the second
A PILIPINA AGENT WOO LEZZGOOO💪💪🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
2:27 sage got some humor
2:45 Tenorio or Norwood?
lowkey mid
Rito: This is not Zeri
1:13 bruh she's filipina
Gj riot destroy the game just like league of legends
Valorant Snatcher
Hermana de ZERI LoL. xD
Just realized that the footage she put up on the screen is from the new cinematic
This is gonna be sick!
1:06 - 1:12 You can see the lighting on her back moving along. So this doesn't mean some time has passed while she was decorating, she just moved very fast and we're watching in real time.
Putang ina she THICC!!!
I knew from the design she was Filipina
1:01 cypher dies
So essentially Wattson and Lućio have fused
WARM UP CINEMATIC AND THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME
xD 2 of the same charachter with Zeri and Neon releasing at the same time.
Where are all my pinoys and pinays?
phoneix ;(
YOU KNOW the second Neon sprint, sage is going to block her like when sage walled 'Maxbot' to the ceilling
Neon Palpatine over here
Her aspiiiinn <3
When you realize she was watching the training from Warm Up animation
we need an interaction between neon and jett!!! aaAaAaAaa
I just realized, that video (w/ phoenix) is actually the trailer for Episode 4 cinematic. Valorant team never fails to surprise us!
Zeri? Is that you
Ok as a raze main I think i gonna love her lol
first valorent crush?
The Filipino accent is so good.
when will realease in the valoant
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Outstanding investment for this year?
RAN on the ASX. 99% down. Outstanding investment for this year?
YOOO SHES FILIPINA!!!!!
0:55 preside gameplay btw
delete this shit
So glad they went back to the cinematic stuff
so neon watches live phoenix on fighting MAXBOT I see, very clever valorant...
Ayy the tv for neon is the trailer for the cinematic of episode 4
i can imagine COD player that use this character will think about slide cancel lmao
why does her Q ability look like Japan's rising sun flag?
as a filipino guy IM EXITED ANOUT NEON LETS GOOOOOO
I admit, this trailer is actually cringe.
Yoooo she was watching Phoenix's maxbot practice, what an easter egg HAAHHAHAHA
Ummm so Riot just copy and pasting characters from one game to another?
y’all notice she’s watching the battle with the bot cinematic that was released today
ATTENTION! ⚠️ the singer of the song  just released their *MUSIC VIDEO in 88rising* ^^ CHECK IT OUT!!!
she looks like the sister of zeri
a run n gun agent? what could possibly go wron-
NEON is Philipines broo
omgggggggggggg
Wow what a trailer I'm really impressed. PD: well done with the soundtrack it is really catchy and it makes you want to play that character very very strongly just because of the trailler. Wow!
Finally some fucking representation🇵🇭
that moment when comment section thinks NEON is OP when they see the clip at 1:00.... Y'all gotta be smoking on some heavy trees with that Cypher and Jett for real man or play with your monitor off or something like that.
when i tried that he tagalog ;-;
yessss
Damn, she THICC!!!!
I have watched this video more times than the ones that I am willing to admit
jett : race to the spike sight! neon : *my name is barry allen and i'm the fastest man alive*
OMG
This is sick! My friends are going crazy and always speaking about Neon.
Was not expecting to hear tagalog.
Kontrolado koto!
Goosebumpsss!!
Hello and welcome to another episode of: is the Valorant meta going to change significantly because of this random women who can do everything everyone else can, 20x better? Stay tuned to find out
Did she just say, "Hay, buhay..."?  Edit: She's actually speaking Tagalog :0
1:29 where she said "kontrolado ko to" means I can control this I think
the perfect music for this character
yall still play this game?
They got Zeri in both league and valorant now lmfao
Galingggggg 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
AAAAH GOOSEBUMPS AAAHHAHAH
Not complaining, but, she looks similar to the upcoming champion in lol, Zeri
Realizing that Neon and I have that same asian broom
is this philipino or mexico because the description says its in manila like in philipines but neon is speaking in english
so who launched first? Zeri or Neon?
another cinematic were cypher dies, not surprised
Lmao I love how they made her sing with a toothbrush
holy shit a filipino agent
Neon = Sonic!! Next agent = Pikachu!!
dababy is cracked
ah blue Tracer joins Valorant
0:39 that was the clip from the new trailer when phnx and the others was warming up
I stopped playing valorant, but at this point I'm too scared to start again.
Ah yes let's put Phoenix's wall onto a  retirement home
nice pinoy character
a zeri
Ylona Garcia singing??? Perfection👏👏👏
Plot twist shes a filipina hahaha just saying
🇵🇭
She's just a blue version of Zeri
Is sage a leader of valorant? Or is she still under brimstone
el mismo personaje para lol y valorant
So they copy pasted their idea for Zeri from league and put it in their other game with a different hair colour. Rito Gaemz everyone…
purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I mean I don’t really care for this game that much back in September I got banned for an entire year for leaving a game
Zeri and Neon: Era of the Electric Slide baby!
It's confirmed LoL and Valorant have secret hero meetings
Just saw that the phoenix clip in this video is the same as the new Chapter 4 trailer. Nice little easter egg
İLK TÜRKİYE ÇIKIYOR LANNN !!!! TÜRKİYE #1 #1 #1 TÜRTKİYE TÜRKİYE TÜRKİYE TYÜRKİE NUMBER ONE TÜRKİYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 🇹🇷 🇹🇷 🇹🇷
Isn't she just like killua ! ⚡
Yeeeeeeeey Static Shock is in the game now! Let's gooooooooo!
Ight so are the designers just handing each other their hw or is it the same person?
i just realized that the first video on 0:35 is the new Training Bot Video...
Look! It's phoenix training against max bot in the new Warm Up Cinematic trailer at 0:35.
whoever makes these is a legend. the animating style is so good and this song <3
She is Fast and cute
Zeri impact
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Aimbot???
0:33 So she was watching the EP4 cinematic
Persise Gunplay I guess
PILIPINAS 🇵🇭
cutie
its an okay game csgo better
Riot releases Zeri in league and Spark in valorant. Pretty similar if you ask me
Hmmm, looks a lot like that new league character....
Woah the little clip of Phoenix in the beginning is from the EP 4 cinematic
that is not me
So this is a zeri chroma or what?
Just the blue version of Zeri
Zeri universe
1:00 pov:he is nasus
😳
Zeri from league
dead ass, hers is chiseled anyone with funny ideas, just know you might break sumthin
She’s over powered
my fave version of sonic
Всё норм, у риот просто скрытый калаб с фиксиками
Zeri
Pls.pray the rosary and devine mercy chaplet to free all countries from war, diseases, calamities, hunger, corruption, drugs, prostitution, abortion,homosexuality,pornography,euthanasia, divorce, child abuse,terrorism,slavery, corruption, communism and all evils.pls pray for peace and joy in all families and home. . . . . . .. . ...
Run fast hit fast win fast
I wanna hear a kill voice line for when neon kills brim and she says "Hm, mga inglesyero." Lol
lmao riot pretty much cloned there newest league chapion.
So, the video that Neon puts up of Pheonix, I believe that is the gun fight against Maxbot in Warm Up. That would explain why there is more footage of Pheonix in a gunfight, which wasn't previously released news by Valorants Media.
Holy, I`m in love tho
Neon has a crush on phoenix??
PROD gonna have a field day with this
it s this Zeri?
Jett mains are crying rn
Zeri? Yoru? Both?
Players: the game is basically a run and gun by now Riot games: you said run and gun? Here's a new hero that can do that.....
love how they putting the same character in league and valorant. genius design riot 200 years
Overwatch??
"tatic fps"
Did she just actually said "hay Buhay". Also she say "controlado ko to" Then ig she's Filipino
Watching this after Act 4 cinematic dropped and the video of phoenix is of him going against the buff vacuum.
So since this is such a popular video game  on pc , seems like from a distance ,  why can’t they finally bring this to reality for consoles players who Might want to check it out , including myself but gotta find a gaming pc instead right now ?
Project A
octane rip off
so she is Zeri in Valorant universe
2:10
tiene parecido a la nueva campeona de lol
amas é a zeri KKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Nice 2fps trailer
Fuck spectre run and gun gonna change to slide and gun real quick😂
Ok sonic
Zeri?
bonita mi main :V
That us just Zeri from League but recolored
Riot was inspired by the new Sonic movie trailer i see.
Looks sick !! Good work riot❤️
Ah yes The valorant games
Zeri 2.0 be like
Zeri in valo !
Manila is my favourite flavour of clam!
OHH!! when she was watching the footage of phoenix it was from the newest cinematic!! thats so cool
hom sweat hom
İlk türkçe çıktı cCc
i don't understand the ultimate utility... . Next character Ylona Garcia after NEON. (Spoiler on the poster)
So weird hearing Tagalog in a Valorant champ. Hope she doesn't talk like this in-game cause that's hella distracting.
So they put Zeri in Valorant too, huh?
eyo they leaked the new cinematic in the video she watches, nice hidden touch
We need to have a Valorant TV Show at some point, cause seeing these cutscenes and the voice acting was epic. It needs to be turned into a TV Show or a streaming show like Arcane
And nobody s gonna talk about the fact t she looks like Zeri? The next champ of lol?
the scene in 0:34 is actually from the new trailer.
get ready to lose every game to Noen's trying to dash with shotguns.
FILIPINO HERE
run and gun even in trailer XD
Damn, they even hinted their next vid in this trailer. What a detail!
She is watching the new valorant cinematic in the beginning. The attention to detail!
So she's the Zeri  of League of legends  ☺️
you are copying league of legends!
Apex and Overwatch had a child
15 fps trailer
This is broken
Its a good thing that Riot picked a filipina whos not famous and streamer.   Maraming sikat na streamers or sumisikat na streamers para mapakita cleavage nila. Tas insta sikat pero wala dudumi rin imahe
So thats where the Phoenix video from
Neon is Zeri from League of Legends with chroma xD
Whaaaaatt a FILI damn son wow
They foreshadowed the warm up cinematic. Fucking genius
Wow! So the footage of Phoenix here is from the "Warm Up" video, which might happening when Neon arrived.
zeri del valorant
I WANT IT
this totally won’t be abused.🤣😂
why does this look so cringe..
Nice Easter egg riot pre loading the new video
Riot: Abilities don't kill  Also Riot: Introduces Neon Ult
Good😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I think i've never seen such a perfect trailer, the song and the trailer match so perfectly, can't stop watching it and listening to this song!
THHHICCC
Titanfall pilot gaming!
Nice 5 fps
Are she and Zeri from LOL sisters?
60hz players are gonna have a bad time playing against her
POV: u play CoD in Valo
She's the only one that matches the ingame look with the trailer.
Rito getting lazy with character design
Bah non c'est pas bien car ewann warnier n'a pas assez dev dessus
Dammmmmmn
she's cute
I started playing Val this act Boy now I understand what the Hype was about
2:22 so is her family name Bonifacio or wut
repace the song whit the old super idol it fits perfecly👌🙂
In the beginning i heard *sigh* buhay before when she's about to jump in the bed some people didn't hear it and also buhay means life:)
not intrested
Xd
Hello!!!Now!! YOU IN OVERWATCH!!
New champ lol  multiverse
We got e-girls on valo now....... Yey
GARIT DEWANA!!!!
bro 5 fps
Did she just say "hay buhay?" Hahaha
No one blames Sage for ressurecting then walling rather than walling then ressurecting?
S
Cupcake?
i think the song just made this character even more fun hahaha
Nice skin for zeri
League players “every new champion has 6 dashes, a shield, and passives that do 3 completely unrelated things.  Valorant Players “Oh no it’s spreading”
Ok.....now Wattson from Apex legends??? Seriously??? And this neon got Ash's ultimate (speed movement??) Seriously valorant??🙄🙄
Isn't the agent like code miko??
Fuck it i cant stop playing the song😭. Its just too good👌
Omen be like:welp better get me buffed or i die and make my chooser (who chose omen) Quit
Lol I though it's nayeon.
0:43
PELEPENO PRAYD
Valorant Zeri is shockingly cool!
Zeri...
does jett still thinks shes the fastest😏
Les gooo
Now i know why she runs fast. If you’re born in manila better walk or run rather than be stuck in traffic 😂
k0ntrolado ko toh !! BANG!! Ay p0ta!
Bruh she climbed on her bed without taking off her shoes. How cruel
Haven't played since the last 3 characters, it's insane how many new agents are coming in
hvm moment
Ylona Garciaaaaa
Neon's physique somehow resembles Hidilyn Diaz
where is the skin i cant find and do i need to update the game?asking btw
better than Reyna?
Где фпсы?
as a filipino, I find the dialogue so cringe sorry xD
Bruh, why did I start tearing up when I heard her talk in Filipino
Why does she look kinda like Zeri
@valorant you didn't used Hindi language
OMG it was made in 10FPS. So jittery
gooooooooooooooo
what a cool agent
oh. my. god.
bro she gonna be my new fav agent...
Weeew
Valorants lore keeps on getting better
Neon... The agent where you can rush your enemies and call it tactic.
The way she says, “Kontrolado ko to.” Meaning, “I can control this.” Shows some story about her lore as well!
that will be really OP
This character is pretty lame it looks like the new Champion that's coming out in League of Legends and why does riot always make female champions there's nothing but female artist at riot the sexual abuse claims at the company really got them in a jam lol this is just a copy and paste characters
Lex from paladins: *sweating intensifies* ....the... *cough* weather.... is great...today
"Filipino Time"  being oblivious of being late. Accurately Filipino
Proud to be Pilipino pero bata pasaway 🤣
i can wait for the mobile version of this game dudes
ok riot why the fuck is this spark blue here on valo but yellow on league
Even League of legend got a sparkly girl from Zaun .
Filipino and power of electricity... Very strange cuz the typhoon in Philippines cause a 3 month brown out and that has something to do with electricity Philippines😳😳😳😳😳😳
hello valorant, i have a little problem. The problem is: my laptop which i upgraded to windows 11 can't play valorant, do you have a solution?
Shes a filipino!!!Mabuhay!!!!
Atleast one agent from India .... please valorant you have mumbai surver why not one agent from india
can t wait for the game to be broken
lessgooo
I should practice so I can get better at a tittle that is really frustrating but makes you feel like good when you do it right
Was surprised when she said "Hay Buhay" (*sigh* life..) at the start, turns out its an actual filipino champion lol
almost the same design as zery the new legue champ
straight up copied quake mechanics now.. come on riot...
solide le montage :)
Riot never fails to entertain me
සිංහලෙනුත් දාපන් බන්
Please at least do 24 FPS animations.
Wow Riot is getting lazy huh, this is just Zeri from LoL aswell
Zeri's twin from League of Legends?
Same champion on valorant and lol
Riot did it again
controlado ko to! omg ang ganda exited na ko
Michael Reeves = Neon Full of energy ✓ Tases people ✓ Filippino ✓
she will be MINE
I just hope she's not OP and autolocked all the time like reyna and jett
IM SO HYPED
sieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Spark and zeri be like, Hey can I copy your homework? sure but don't make it to obvious lmao, still neat tho
jett's long lost sister
Is this a Zeri?
So... it's an uwu Octane?
Fuck is this
cool
damn, she hot. I don't play Valorant anymore, but interesting to see this is same char as in LoL
this gave me the biggest goosebumps ever!!!
Does she actually can sprint and slide cause hell thats how i play
wangy wangy
They trying to make these characters more and more OP yikes
Beautifully designed agent, even tho it just seem like a mix of Tracer and Echo from Overwatch LOL
I Like her :)
is this snatcher speed ng Pinas girl version?
ra yleobaa
that last sprint transition to 2d is dope..
I might Re-download Valorant now.
Pilipinas meralco character
I don't have neon
Everyone is talking about neon but nobody is mentioning how cypher died in a trailer AGAIN :(
YESSSS I LOVE TO RUN AND GUN LETT GOOO
Anyone else got confused at 1:56?
Nice we have sonic now 1:39
where the red
1:41 Does anyone know what that echo means?
valorant im a pilipino im so exited the agent  im pretty sure she s has filipino voiceline
Its like zeri
It is certain that Sage will become the first Valorant goddess
🇵🇭 Raise your flag!
Sage buff pls, thanks.
Every new Valorant video makes me feel like buying a proper gaming pc and start a channel
Baka pati to ibalita nnaman sa gma🤦
trailer felt cringe
She's filipino
Warframe veterans smirking right now
PUTANIA SHES FILLAPINO

Ylonaaaa voice

this is a certified filipino pride moment
thicc
YAHOOOOO!
Sonic?

did she say '' hayy buhay''?
Valorant: wie op wollt ihr den neuen Champ haben? Valorant:Ja
Trash
So it's basically Zeri but with blue hair? Really original Riot well done 🤦🏻‍♂️
The only Filipino I’ve seen represented in games
dis bad
1:13 who is Pilipinas #5?
finally an agent with blue hair and pronouns ❤️🏳️‍🌈
PS5 🤔
can't wait to try out this new agent that you can make montages out of c:
At 2:21 you can see a poster that says Ylona garcia. She an Australian-Filipino singer maybe thats an easter egg
Sauce of song?
wow this game is so cool game name pls what is game name available on play store??
*TAHO!* "Be right back"
"Uy umuulan na naman, bye bahay"
sick
imagine run and gun with this
Really wish I could play this on PlayStation

Z..Ze..Zeri

Whats the name of the song?

this is going to be overpowered
"hay buhay" classic
LETS GOO
Tsundere Character letso
When overwatch echo and Valorant phoenix have a baby
MY GOODNESS THIS IS SO COOOOOL!!!!!!!! i CANT WAIT
I love how both Neon and Zeri are electric zappy fast girls with choppy pigtails and bobs
Why does this look exactly like zeri from LoL?
Rito Games: "We need a new Valorant Agent to keep the game fresh and interesting" Valorant Development Team: "We need at least two more months then planned, we cant think of a good character with fun abilities and unique design" Rito Games: "Just take inspiration from somewhere" Valorant Development Team: Hippety hoppety new league champ is now my property (proceeds to strg c strg v Zeri) also Neon is probably the least unique name you can think of (no hate it is just nothing nowhere creative)
nerfed the 2nd week she's out.
thicc
Neon before she lied down on her bed "ay, buhay" lol (loosely translated it's ah, life)
Cheguei a jogar algumas semanas. Comunidade Tóxica, nojenta, podre!!!!! 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
We want any turkish agent
1000 fps
FANARTS WHERE YOU AT?
Zeri?
sage is so sweet aww
My guy omen have a idin, And she have a marshal. 🤣
What is the name of this song
new agent from indonesia please riott
For a moment i was thinking it was a Fortnite skin
Hay buhay
Didn't they just release this champion in League as well lmfao?????? xD
Mobility is a thing with Riot games apparently
Neon..Zeri...hmmm..🤔
ohcome on i just took a break now theres another agent well i cant blame the game \
riot: you have to stand still to aim and not move Also riot: we're adding a character that can kill you while sprinting
I swear I am not gae
"haaay buhay..." I know..
hay buhay hahahahahaha
Ready na ako!  Handa na kayo!
FINALLY A FILIPINO AGENT
No one talking about Riot releases 2 characters that have electricity powers and run fast, in both League and Valorant, at the same time? Bruh they even have the same hairstyle.
continuing the saga where cypher always gets killed first<3 poor cypher mains
Oh boy, I sure love a game revolving around precise gunplay and proper executes to be tossed in the garbage by literally turning the game into Vanguard. Fuckin lovely job Riot, turned one of the most competitive games into another useless COD clone
I CANT FREAKING WAIT! I’ve got the creds ready to buy uer
Console players be crying now.
Zeri from LoL looks awesome ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Дiвчинка Україночка
0:38 her saying buhay made me question if i truly heard it. i had to replay a couple of times
Не нажимай "читать дальше"     Ладно,если нажал то здоровье тебе,и твоим близким❤️🤝💜 Буду рад видеть тебя на канале в числе подписчиков!
Unplayable dead game
xantares would love this
LAZER FINGERS POGGERS
POG ZERI
I watched this trailer so many times man it's crazy
zeri?
nice
when is it going to come out  i am so exited !!!!!!!!!
Hay buhay ❤️❤️❤️
bruh, time to throw some slow orbs
What’s up with valorant and league making electro gals? There something I’m missing?
i love her already <3
Great gameplay and design.  But the idea and dialogue probably came from the pits of wattpad.
Bruh if I know one thing from the internet is that the r34 is already uploaded somewhere
To this day I have still not played a single game of Valorant
OMFG THIS IS CO COOL
Mommy?sorry mommy?sorry.mommy?
bra
Welcome to family baby monkey
wtf oppppppp wow
Jokes on her, Sage already put slow fields all over the facility, aint know way she's winning that race
Bruh, and I was making jokes how the valorant department switched with the league one to design Zeri
Is this the philipinx character? Cool!
She looks just like Zeri……
🤢
The low FPS style here looks like shit, like someone saw Spiderverse, but has no idea how to make it look that good.
oh she HELLA THICCCCC
Se viene nerf a la semana
She looks like Zeri !
POV: you come her everyday cause now you are simping for Neon
Neon = Zeri
riot gave us Zeri for league, yall got Spark LMFAO
looklike zeri
Two years ago they wanted to reduce running and gunning, they once said abilities don't kill.   Riot, you've done an amazing job!
He look like the new champ in lol wtf
so they intodruce spark from val and zeri from league... very similar indeed....
Cool
pov: out of ideas
She is a creation of Yoru and Jett
Not only does she promote run and gun, she also has to sing to grab all the dweeb and stan culture
So,she's like Tracer
THANK YOU RIOT GOOD START TO THE NEW YEAR 2022!
Free fire is better
I love it!
How song
sage has a shot against neon in the race? or perhaps is that the joke?  anyway  You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring. You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring. You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring. You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring. You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring. You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring. You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring. You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring.
Nice
What's her hair color?
zeri?
Kind of funny how Neon looks VERY similar to Zeri...
IT HAS PRECISE GAMEPLAY
Boring.
Needs to be balenced
man can we talk about that dual fire wall
KAR-MASA KAR= CAR MASA=MASS
way to OP   we'll juts gonna have to wait and find out ig
This is the miles morales of valorant
i’m so happy because ive never seen a filipina character in a game
Why do I feel like people would simp on her like lol
nem um pouco roubada kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
RIOT GAMES LOL and VALORANT are both trending in Top10 in Philippines
1:13 Ayoo Gilas Pilipinas jersey
Rushers incoming
I love her playstyle, like can we emulate the infamous SPO2 Ricardo Dalisay-con-John Wick run & gun with it.
AHHH SHES SO FUCKING COOL
Yup this is precise gunplay
OMG
Imagine playing valorant lmao
The day i'll be bored of riot's works will NEVER COME 🤷🏻‍♂️
Neon is filipino, the person who sang the song here is filipino, and also neon's va is filipino that's so cool and also in 0:38 she said "hay buhay"
So, basically VALORANT'S Zeri
Ay buhay 🇵🇭
Find 10 differences between her and Zeri from League.
Only valprant players whoah this looks awesome and unique , players who play both valo and league is this zeri?! At least she would fit in valo .
Nonsense
this girl literally be like electro
lol the champion just revealed for league is the same girl
MABUHAY mga pinoy, lits go
this character looks fun
Zeri?
Zeri?
Who else kinda feels that this vid has low fps, after watching lol 2022 season vid?
If she doesn't have a voice line where she screams "LINTIK!!!" I'll be very disappointed.
One of the best character reveal trailers I have ever seen!  I love this so much
this trailer is so trash compared to chamber's.. why the fuck is it 20fps
Surely they wouldn't have a new val and lol character near the same time and they're both electric themed
Hello everyone! I was here.
The new jet
neon next level
ITS LITERALLY OVERWATCH'S TRACER AND ECHO COMBINED
Zeri?
Why she run like the T-1000
AYO IT'S THE LEGENDARY WALIS
zeri the heck you doing here HAHA  yes i know im not dumb so dont come at me
let a turkish character come to the game now
let a turkish character come to the game now
let a turkish character come to the game now
Удивило) Что в конце написали "Разделение"
Now Where’s The PS5 Port?
wow, she almost looks like zeri can you belive that?
KEREEEEEENN BNGETTT
YOU SHOULD PUT 1 ACCOUNT 1 PHONE NUMBER POLICY IN YOUR GAME. SO SMURFS ACCOUNT WONT RUIN OTHER RANKS.
Ye
Thick
Zeri?
i keep forgetting this is riot games
i bet shes swedish
Hmmm, Zeri, is you?
NEONNNN
Bruh 20 fps hurt my eyes
Remember when “abilities shouldn’t kill” lmao I’m not mad tho she seems awesome
Why is the video laggy???
Хуета
Drop it on console for the lovecof god
Best trailer I've ever seen for a video game. I think the agent is broken and promotes run and gun which I think is bad.
Esta es Neon o es Zeri? prácticamente son lo mismo
sage: race you there? neon: Ulted sage: walled door.....sike that's the wrong number
...zeri?
Test on the Widow was passed.
Thats the beest agent so far
She looks sick do
What is the music pls?
They just need to make a Val series already. Would totally watch that
Finally another character with movement ability 💕
Look's amazing val can't wait to play
Its Xantares as a woman with that peeks :D
I vibe with this song so much
I'm so sad I just can't try all of these my valor ant is not opening reinstalled 3 times. :( I haven't even played the fracture map :((( valorant is literally closed for 3 other can anyone help me?
Nice Fake from zeri League of Legends
bat my tambo hahahaahah
You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring.  Now that I found out about Neon I want to say the above line as much as possible.  You got yourself a deal man. Anytime, anywhere as long as there is proctoring.
At least cypher didn't die first He's only the second to die now :)
I see a PILIPINAS T SHIRT LETS GO!
I don't even play Valorant but I'm down bad for Neon
Valorant never fail to impress me with their trailers
NOW LAUNCH AN INDIAN AGENT 😍
Mabuhay🇵🇭
I feel like these agents are being made to remind people that Kay/O exists
overwatch reference.
P0
Basically Palpatine
Same champ like zeri from lol
Zeri
Active: Jax enters Evasion, a defensive stance, for up to 2 seconds, causing all basic attacks against him to miss. Jax also takes 25% reduced damage from all area of effect abilities. After 1 second, Jax can reactivate to end it immediately.  At the end of the duration, Jax   stuns all nearby enemies for 1 second and deals physical damage to them, increased by 20% for each attack dodged, up to a 100% increase.
She is really cute, i got to be honest.
Ommmggg Zera😍😍😍 I love you❤
I LOVE SAGE FOR BEING NEON'S BEST FRIEND BRO
R.I.P everyone will run and gun rn
Wait zeri sister's  ?
ngl this needs a buff
I cannot wait omg so cool

30 fps video nice........
เชี่ยยยยยยย ค่ดเท่ อมกกกก ละเพลงก็ค่ดดี ตายๆๆๆๆๆ
i'm obsessed w/ the song in the background. sry not sry
Go

When it's legit Zeri reimagined for Valorant as Neon. Riot was like "Well it's 2 in 1 Character Design"
BROOO I LOVE THE DIVERSITY YALL ARE COMING UP WITH THESE NEW AGENTS
Yolu ara trying to remember stinger
She's like a Pikachu
"Hay, buhay". ♥️♥️
Mommy sageeeeee

Hay buhay, palaging talo
Lol & Valorant: Shock

HARAM

Cypher didn't die in this trailer how is that possible?
BRO WHY CANT I MAKE AN ACCOUNT IT SAYS "We're working hard to catch up. Please try again later. "
2:17 The iconic Walis Tambo left of Neon. Guaranteed to whack you by your mother, cousin to Walis Tingting that she uses outside. Also, on the right the tribal weavings of Philippines 🇵🇭😍💜
B-RUSH it is ...
*Pinoy reference exists...*         *pinoys summoned*
Plot twist : sage won the race
Riot : Releases Zeri and spark in the same period
Zeri sister
This agent is going to ruin valorant for a lot of people. Phoenix mains are essentially irrelevant now thanks to there being a duelist who has TWO walls that go double the distance (yes, Phoenix can heal with his wall but it’s still not balanced enough), breach will probably be less used due to a new stun grenade that hits two spots incredibly fast and has pretty much infinite range, and I think I speak for a lot of the community when I say we don’t want an agent that promotes run and gun (it’s a tactical shooter, come on). Anyway sorry if this comment sounds super negative I just wanted to voice why i don’t think this concept wil be good for valorant :(
cntrl+c cntrl+v
RIP Jett
Ngl,chamber trailer better than this shxt
Neon x zeri 🤝
ruining  the game ngl
Man thats so cool and awesome i love Zeri from Valorant
I Like this trailer but the problem is the 20 FPS…
SONIC!?!?!?!?!?!!?
BLUE HAIR ZERI????
For those who are wondering what is she saying when she got @1:45,  she says " Kontrolado koto!" meaning " I can control this" this shows how she controls her powers and how is she getting used to it.  PS: you might noticed it earlier but in @0:09 she did not noticed her powers was used in the room fingerprint thingy. showing how she still have a long way to go, she's a hella good of an agent though <3.
Interesting that Riot made essentially the same character for both League and Valorant.
Mmmm nerf is coming
Zeri in Valorant
I'm super excited for neon! Cannot wait, she looks amazing
Zeri?
rng XD
r34 artists OMG LESSS GOOOOOO
She''s mad cute wtf
bruh that ulti is op
Riot has shown Neon's room... Now they need to show the other agents' room :)))
1:30 I spy with my little eye a FUCKING WALIS TAMBO FUCK YEAAAA
You'll give a busted pull out time for her but not Yoru. He can't even insta TP and Chamber can. Love Riot, hope this Yoru rework is good, been waiting, since he came out. But glad you guys know how make good agents sucks you don't know how to fix them.
why are we getting new agent instead of making old agents good lmao
"kontrolado ko to"
same champ as league xD
Rip Phoenix
Any rule 34 artists here?
Waaaw zeri glow up
a gift to us filipinos
By Far the best Agent added to this Game, cant wait.
wow 🤩
This agent reminds me of Palpatine  from star wars
Atlas may pilipino na na agent!!!
I see no one has mentioned it so-  Riot just introduced an electrical champion to League of Legends named Zeri. Riot just introduced an electrical agent to Valorant code-named Neon.  Ironically, they both have the same hairstyle.
imma simp ntgl
Yep, That's Zeri.
e
NO CYPHER WAS KILLED IN MAKING OF THIS VIDEO
philippines voice please <3
Same character different game
Does anyone know what she’s saying in another language? Especially the echo heard when she gets knocked out for a moment before showing her ult.
why is this animated at like 5 fps it's not even stylistic it's just making my eyes bleed
Neon and the new champion, Zeri from League of Legends are kinda alike with their electro powers and dashing. Not to mention, pew pew pew~
Without looking at the Agent or abilities, I‘d just like to say that this trailer is beautiful! Well done guys!
YES THE WALIS TAMBO!!! THE GREAT SINGING ABILITY!!! THE REPRESENTATIOOONN!!! AHHHCCKK I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
Filipinos sometimes we are Late to do or go somewhere that's in our culture now but the fact they made Neon Lightning Fash is Funny    Edit:Ye like this comment it's late
Zeri?????
POTA SHE'S PINOOOYY!!
Roit: We patched Run and Gun  F*cking first game play Clip: 0:48  Neon Running down Sova with bulldog...
How is nobody talking how Riot is adding the same character to Valorant and League?
zeri and her looks kinda same
another finger gun character from riot
Give us a netflix series on all the lores!!!
Remember the sova dart glitch me neither
Ehm. Thats the same thing as the new lol champ 🤣 they are running out of ideas at riot games
LOL , She will easily trap in Cypher's Tripwire if SHE GO FAST .
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
it looks like apex
I like this Zeri skin
BIJJJ THIS SLAPS 😭✨
Kid will tilt and rage so hard😱🤣🤣
did she just say hayyyyyyyy buhay or other? Iz she filipino
neon should have a voiceline that says "lamok"
star finger!
why the fuck this trailer feels so clunky and underwhelming
omg my balls turned into halls! this so cool and shocking!
op!!!!!
Looks legit pinay 👍
That "hay buhay" i felt it
Man I should really try out valorant..
Love itttttt Let goooo
i heard they speaking tagalog hay buhay in 0.39 ahahaha
the definition of run a gun
This agent is kinda op
Leeeeeeerooooy Jaaaankiins
夭壽，現在的遊戲角色影片都搞得跟電影一樣，你們讓那動畫業怎麼混啊
Damn boi🥳
yoru vs neon sprint
w8ting 4 mobile
An agent that can sprint, slide, turn into a super saiyan blue, shoot lasers from her fingertips, glow eyes, make energy walls, and can sing is gonna be amazing!!!
what nationality is she?
i like omen
This is gonna be my favorite agent by far in valorant
pls make some ninja agents
sage is the real goat for saving neon from the raze ult
I think im going to play this game again.. cuz i feel like i found my play style… not run n gun… its “skill baiter”
Riot released to League Of Legends Zeri Also riot releases Zeri on valorant too but changes her a bit
this is legit Zeri from League of Legends but in valorant?... hello? anyone?
finally some use for tracking balls
YES REPRESENT 🇵🇭 (If u don’t know what I’m talking about look in the background at 1:13)
This is proof that Riot cannot innovate, but only follow the trends. Valorant was first heavily influenced by CS and Overwatch, and now that Riot sees the popularity of fast paced shooters like Apex, of course they wanna try and jump on that train too, to try to appeal for every single customerbase there is.
Jelo cruz is ung tomboy n mataba
Ходят Легенды, что он всё ещё ищет русский комментарий и никак не может найти
Look like zeri new champion in Leauge of legend lol
AHHAHAHAHA WTF?!
This becoming Apex Legends mechanics now
I see there the wali's tambo basic weapon for filipino moms
This song is heat
I like how she looks also her hair color I think it represents the philippine flagl
this is insane
make a movie!!
1 year ago  I TOLD there GONA BE an AGENT with LIGHTING BOLT !!!! Valorant message me I'l give you more great idieas for next agents
Riot using basic movement mechanics as abilities
Nerfed week one
Riot being bad at game design: Season 5, episode 2
Nobody really noticin' the basketball jersey of Ella Fajardo in the background. 1:13
1:03 cypher 🗿
This is the new champ of lol ?
We need KDA in Valorant! Stan Neon 🤣
ay buhay
les gooooo filipino agent
I'ts the same champion from League of Legends!!!! NO way I'ts Zeri...

So finally a Trailer from Riot without the Death of Cypher Feels good as Cypher Main
Is she filipino?!?!
i love the way she said "HAY BUHAY" lakas maka PINOY PRIDE🇵🇭
Zues x27 as a character hahaha
EIN
Can't wait to start seeing instalock Neon's in my games!

She * HAY BUHAY PH language tho😍🇵🇭
TIME TO RUN AND GUN BITTCCHESSS

NEVER BEEN SO ATTREACTED TO A CARTOON CHARACTER LETS GOOOOOOOO
I wish they made the transition @1:29 perfect. It’s a small detail but I’m a little triggered hahahahaha
when does she come out?
OMGGGG I wanna play valorant now hahaha hopefully electricity will be back in my place tho😕
my computer will make sparks fly with all of the chinese spyware installed on it from this game
IS THAT A FORTNITE SKIN??
Now many people Instalocking Neon instead of jett
Wow!!
The amount of Neon r34 that are about to come out with her using her ult in them is gonna be........................crazy
god damn, these Devs clearly put in work for a really polished product. Especially considering the state of most of the industry
I want this game in Hindi as well.
I think she is the first step into showing the agents and grand abilities Riot wants to implement to Valorant
Valorant's Zeri but blue and slightly older.
This character looks way cooler here than the one from LOL wished they did someting more like this than the official  one but shes still cool 😎,  def like NEON better tho
In a different Multiverse, her name is Zeri.
actually cool
is that the champion in lol :O ... a filipina? , so zaun is the lol's counterpart of philippines confirm?
DUDE! She's finger-gunning people! That's so fuckin awesome and fun! XD
Who cares where she was born? People are obsessed with race and diversity quotas in things that arent even real now. smh
Thor's new girlfriend
Very nice!
Zeri but in valorant
cypher : she's gonna outrun my tripwire isn't she?
I can already see people coming up with lineups for Relay Bolt  Neon's Slide = Jett, Wall = Phoenix/Viper/Astra, Shock thingy = Breach/Sova, Ult = Chamber
sage voice was so satisfying!
SHE'S A FILIPINO!🇵🇭
1:36 why did it look like my mom waking me up for school?
IS THIS REFERENCE FROM BELLA POARCH?????????? ISNT IT
Bet first week, this gonna be nerfed
Everybody gangsta till she pulls a Cardo Dalisay mid game
Everybody gangsta till she pulls a Cardo Dalisay mid game
Isn't she also gonna be release in lol
POTA THATS JUST JETT, PHOENIX, AND YORU'S SPEED COMBINED.
Tracer vibes
SHE LOOKS AMAZING BUT OMG SHE'S GONNA BE OP
Killua but it's valorant
Ah yes Glitch pop skin
Dang girl. She brought her Mom's broom.
Please make a Valorant series
Me, a Filipino that loves Killua: *LET'S FREAKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!*
Movies make it seem so normal but if you use the remote and then throw it across the room before laying down you might be an actual psychopath
Yo is that the new league of legends champ looks sick I like the part where she runs over walls and shit and shoots finger guns with auto attack. Let’s not forget that electrical effects of hers.
VOLTA!!!!!!!!!!
It so...amazing
Is She speaking TAGALOG?
Let's gooo! Salamat Valorant
Moira?
Is she canonically related to Zeri? If this doesn't confirm some sort of universe continuity then it's a real missed opportunity.
bruhh i love ylona since pbb days
Neon and Zeri… My new mains on both games???
i can feed so fast now
now they just need their own servers in PH lol, internet there is already slow so please Riot <3
i think she’s a duelist
Tayo ay Pilipino Kahit anong kulay ng balat isasapuso Mapa-tagalog bisaya o ilokano Walang tatalo sa bagsik ng ating dugo Isigaw ng malakas ang ating panalo Wag nang pagusapan ang mga negatibong Pangyayari san mang panig ka nasa mundo Kinabukasan na natin to
When Riot games do a better Spotify ads than Spotify
Toothbrush karaoke. Yup, she's Pinay lul
Didn't realize Ylona Garcia sang this song 🥺
The multiverse is real 🗿
I shouldn't have used my free recruitment... she's gonna be sick!!!
Mabuhay Ka Agent NEON, Go Go Go 🇵🇭
Mabuhay Ka Agent-19 "NEON" Go Go Go 🇵🇭
How is this dead game still active?
Oh but it's Zer.. Ah yeah another name for the same champ.. Nice Riot :D !
The best trailer so far ✨✨
i predicted an agent able to run faster than the other ones last year. lets goooooooooooo
she looks like a buggy character
She's a Filipino!!!!!!!!!
So cool.  why the update is not now??. But cool agent.
Damn the filipino voice lines. Ugh ❤️
the walis tambo!!!!
Is she zeri’s sister?
Blue Zeri
“Hayy buhay” girl same
Everyone: slowly walking so they won't be notice by the enemy  Meanwhile neon:🏃 🏃 🏃
So Valorant used the Filipino card lol
Is it weird to say I have a crush on her '-'
I like music.
Let's Go Ylona Garcia!!!!
sheesh that look sick:0
5,317,604 3 days
spectacular cod player in valorant
All the character designs are unoriginal and crige
Valorant players: Great agent Me: Great song
why hello zeri chroma
0:37 hayy buhayy
Kids always like this agent
anyone one else thought of tracer from overwatch
Jett mains are salivating right now
SHES SO FRICKEN CUTE!
finally a decent agent
I am not sure if this is just Filipino baiting but i am loving it. Representation really matters! And I love the fact that Riot’s Neon isn’t playing the stereotype Filipino character.
This agent is truly for asian playstyle run n gun
This is literally CoD but better
See is sage sister or friend
She's speaking Tagalog
Shes Tagalog
*Gets shot  "Pisteng Yawa."
"hay buhay" .. (sigh* life)
zeri looking good
Zeri chan? 😳
she is hot
I'm so happy that Ylona is doing great abroad but I miss her acting tho.
Burger pedas 1
i was gay before this
rito loves to massacre my boi Cypher
Sweet I’ll be able to die even faster with that sprint tactical!!
yo i would love to see a story about the characters on a show kinda like arcan just in valorant  story line
Riot:  run and gun not scary Neon in trailer:.....
eyy ylona garcia for the bg music
YOOOOOOOO
Is she jetts sister??
it's so perfect
Zeri and Neon are like twins
HOW MANY ABILITIES DOES SHE HAVE??😱😱
THIS SHIT GONNA BE CRAAAAZYYY
Honestly i don't play valorant but i always Amazed by how beautiful those character trailers, looks so fun
Yoru *Can move fast while being invincible* Reyna *Can move pretty quick while being invincible* Neon *Can move fast with no gun or defense*
oooohh the twin walls are interesting.
The Ylona Garcia's poster on the wall at  2:21 looks like Kai'sa ALL OUT outfit
Okay i see a pattern here Fast and Electric Champion with green hair for league Fast and Electric Agent with blue hair for Valorant (and good music on the side)  and they both look like billie eilish
Nerf neon
Oh nooooooo no no no
Yay filipina agent finally
Neon main
Please stop supporting this game Riot, I have a friend suffering from addiction because of your game. He cannot delete the game off his system, and I think at this point its affecting his mental health and his pH levels. I appreciate the co sideration, if no action is taken, I will have to get involved. Have a great summer.
I was kind of reminded about my childhood favorite Filipino Animated Movie "RPG Metanoia" as the animation style is similar to this trailer.
shity ass game lol )
Filipina
mommy
the sparks remind me of arcane
Most characters: either a merc or some space dude Neon: pikachu
O PISÃO NO CHAMBER QUE NÃO É NADA SEM O ROSTINHO BONITO DELE
LA Tenorio Jersey for the Win!!!!!!!!!!
NEOOOOOOOOOOOOON
May pililinas sa poster ni neon baka pilipino si neon
she finna be a duelist?
im only here for song
OH YOU KNOW THEY MAD WHEN THEY START TALKING IN TAGALOG WHEN SHE HAD HER ULT SHE SPAT THEM BARS
Ah yes Neon, the spark of Zaun. Wait wait wait wrong character.
was wondering why the new league champ looked like something out of valorant and then this video pops up
main material
Is she faster than skyes wolves
Why does she run like Flint Lockwood?
OMG THIS TRAILER IS SICK
Is this the same champ as LoL?
S i m p s  a r e  c r e a m i n g
The blue seraphine x)
Chimi is WILDING
I use to be good then I stopped to focus on school, I only start back playing for the new agents then stop again.
Zeri 2.0
lookin awfully like Zeri.......
Bruh, i love this so much haha
props to sage w the res :) so excited for this agent!
i've never cringed so hard at a trailer before.
She so fucking fast even my FPS wont be able to keep up xd
at exactly 2:05 a wink would have made the most cute agent in the game
ok is there some multiverse shenanigans goin on in riot games now cause Zeri and Spark are just the same color swapped character
uhhh here comes the power creep i guess... She seems to occupy a few extra niches, and overall better utility in walling off shots.  Not sure if her run and gun is a passive, or only for ultimate.
Can we talk about this music tho ❤️❤️
didn't they just come out with some new dude recently? I haven't touched this game in ages.
Unlimited powaaa
NEW SHIPP SAGE X NEON
theyre getting lazy? xd
dose she have a slide like u can do in epex?
My new wife yes?
The walis tambo tho haha
Neon = Zeri
zeri and soark both look the same and have the same kind of power  sus
Its Zeri on Valorant. Riot games really just copy and pasted their own work xd
My type of agent!
Looks like 20FPS
So.... She's a female flash then?
finally a movement character
Kinda looks like Zeri from League of Legends...
we are trying to make everything equal     also makes this
I like how league and Val are just releasing identical champs
Hyped 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
tiene como 5 habilidades
Fav agent only because of the dog
You actually showed the Turkish name of the episode first. Sick.
Probably the most interesting trailer
Wait isn't she just a color swap of that new league champion?
Salamino piccantissimo SIUUUUUUM
is this budget Zeri from league?
Nice new champion But I would call it Zeri
tracer? are you there?
this is so sick
Echo beam
Riot releasing two Philippines characters in the space of a month? Seems like a theme. Neon in Vanguard, and Zeri in League.
I’m About to main her
Wow, Zeri-- I mean Neon looks so cool! 😍
boi i aint gonna lie this shit do be kinda cringy tho
INSANE i am so Happy to test here
Riot releasing 2 female characters with the same hairstyle at the same time with facial bandages. Truly the laziest low effort company XD
What if Neon and Zeri are related? a confirmation that Val's world is within Runeterra?
👀i think im in love....LOVE AT 1ST SIGHT 😍
She not thick enough pls buff
R34
you know i am rushing when this agent comes out
Zeri?? Oh sorry Neon.
Uu zeri 's new skin 😏
sooooooo...they took riots new character and put her inside Valorant too??????
Neon is my new main after Jett
fix vanguard cpu usage on the next patch or its hard to do????????????
im one tricking cause this is my spirit element
I didn’t know azula uses guns
Her ultimate which i assume is the hand zap thingy seems to be fun to use and her other abilities seems fun as well
dont add her
Not real Filipina. She's wearing her shoes in her room. Grew up around and even dated some of them. First thing I noticed. 😂😂😂
Oh ? A new hero ? As an Overwatch player, I can't relate.
Looks broken tbh
You made 4 mistakes in the name Zeri
Wtf Wtf female scout from tf2
Zeri is better
lmao i forgot this dead game existed
can riot just add a indonesian characte😂
Our first filipino agent eeeee mabuhay
Mark my words! This is gonna be the most viewed video in this account soon...
Same designer that made Zeri in league? Yeah, I think so.
Get Minzy from 2NE1 vibes and I love it!
dude she's cracked
As soon as i seen riot games i said ok I’m sold. Solely for arcane i will gladly give riot games my money
Art is amazing as always!
Ah a Filipino agent… makes me pretty happy 🇵🇭
That trailer was chilling and so she’s basically the flash and can kill you with speed noice
So zeri got a release in two games pretty dope
So basically VALORANT's version of Zeri
why is this video in like 7 FPS
And there goes half my online identity
she is so op
We gonna talk about the copy pasta from Riot's league champ Zeri ??
currently installing Valorant because of Neon! Hope I learn the game soon!
Sick
Thanks, from every movement player ever
That fire ability look op
Me watching this while haven’t play since Yoru came out
who steal my fps
2022 neon gun meta
Valorant: Yo lemme copy your homework League of Legends: Okay but try not to make it too obvious Valorant: I gotchu
This islike 50% zeri
Finger guns
Waiting for an Indian agent now.....
Its the sneaks for me
Wow this zeri league skin is insane !
ayo Sage and Neon fr
lapu lapu in ML😭😭😭
League and Valoriant release 2 electric powered female characters is the same week. Riot might ve running out of ideas
valorant should have an anime or movie frfr
What's Zeri doing here?
Zeri looks different
0:50 off the perc
dead game😜
Riot: a 5v5 character-based tactical FPS with precise gunplay. Also riot:
Hey look it's zer- i mean lightning spark neon that doesn't have a twin in another dimension.
GET THIS SONG OUT OF MY HEAD BoOoOoOoOoOoYy!!!! 🤪
*I’m fast as fuck boi*
She looks exactly like the new champion in league of legends 😲😲😲
why is it like 30fps on the cinematic
Electricity-based new character… huh it reminds me to someone…
It's the electric wizard from clash royale XD
Hello zeri
a esto le llamamos aprovechar tu contenido xD
Def gonna reinstall after seeing Neon
Yoo nice Zeri skin, when it's out Rito?
One day valorant made all overwatch heroes with his style,like this(they are st0l1ng)
Me getting through watching the Zeri trailer and then watching this: *but if you close your eyes, does it seem like nothing has changed at all*
When Jett and phoenix have child
LOL: Zaun Valorant: Spark
Looks like a fortnite character lel
Zeri and Neon ? this company know their timing
Find it ironic that they release Zeri and Neon which are incredibly thematically similar at the same time
YOOO THEY ADDED USAIN BOLT TO VALORANT
porque siento que el personaje de pelo verde y el de pelo azul son el mismo personaje   eso significa que de alguna forma estan conectados el lol y valorant mas alla de la compañia y dando mas contexto a que en algun momento los personajes del valorant tendran mas contacto con los del lol o algo asi    ademas de reciclar el mismo personaje
Is the Pilipinas jersey a nod to Filipinos everywhere 🇵🇭? I don’t play the game but the character looks awesome
at 0:57 it looks like her eyes are red, was she crying?
Is it just me or is this very very very similar to character design and theme they are doing with the new champ coming to league of legends?
I would
Doing the electric slide I see
Broken
wow wow wow 🤩🤩😮😮😮
Zeri. _ .
Jett + yoru = Neon
It is Zery From League of legends...
gonna need nerfed so hard
Rad
Wait.. Did they just... Put a champ in LoL and an Agent in Valorant which are basically the same character? Weird.
HEY VALORANT HUB CAN YOU SENT ME WHEN NEON RELEASES DATE
When wipl u release valo on console
se parece al personaje adc del lol jasjasjs
MIRIP MOCO DI EPEP
Wait she’s Filipino
Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭 ❤❤❤❤❤
0:47 Miles anyone?
Boquita papá!!
she just seems like fast pheonix. i'm down
I first watched Zeri a new champion coming to League I was like cool a chick with puffy hairstyle and electric powers. I see this character I’m like bruh her hair is the same. I see her with electric powers and I’m like BRUH
Happy to know that riot still has balancing issues with new characters.
0:13 Ahegao 😍
yoooo cant wait!
FPS drop.
I want an explanation on why valorant and league of legends are coming out with almost the exact same champion. Neon and zeri not only have the same electric powers but they look almost the same definitely hair wise not much facially but they could pass up as sisters or multiversal counterparts very easily.
OMGNGNGNG GONNA CRY SO COOL SJWJAJDBW
R.I.P omen sova is a monster
Riot released the same character in both League and Valorant.
Lest go neon i like neon mu favorite charecter :}
R and G let's goo
damn... she looks boring asf lol
is zeri of lol
Hay buhayy
yall had no reason making her this fine bro im tryna marry her ong
im so glad to see new agent
Riot acha legal fazer champion quebrado, faz o nerf logo pelamor!
same ideas for lol and valorant with Zeri and Spark hahahaha
Sayang walang "PISTI" na line HAHAHAHA
" Kontrolado kotoh " man that hits different cause that means that neon has some power issues with her electricity and sometimes she cant control her power just wow
Zeri sister
finally a worth main
I’ve never seen a better put together trailer in my life. Onto my Spotify plaulist
I don't play this game but I remember this was advertised to be slow and precise.  Now it's looking like apex
"Precise gunplay"
0:52 "Flint Lockwood!"
Nice character for hackers!
Abilities don't kill by the way.
Literally a fucking goddess
Plot twist: She is alternative version of Zeri
I LOVED LOVED LOVEDDDDD THE EDIT AND HOW THE NEW CHARACTER LOOKS BEAUTIFUL GREAT WORK
I mean this is amazing but isn't VALOTANT a first person tactical shooter? wtf is this running sliding not very "tactical" run and gun OP agent xd?
Man I love this trailer so much😭❤
this was so good
first pinoy agent 😍
hay buhay
Is there a 60fps version of this trailer? Its so good and id love to see it smoother.
its zeri
This things are the sole purpose i keep coming back to this game The connection it creates is just unbreakable
I am getting bricked up.
I don’t have a pc but i wanna play her so bad because my name is neon
Aye Buhai! lol
she is literally playing cod in valorant
did she said ''kontrolado ko to''?? wtf
Best part is shes Filipino 🇵🇭
Sage win that run  Wall and slow
Cypher dies in every video why :(
Zeri are you?
That’s right gentlemen, Call of duty in a game like Valorant is now possible
Oh so now we have more boosted Tracer from Overwatch
Hey Valorant/Riot. Why is it that you keep hiring rich people to do your music, VO, and other third party work? There's a shit ton of poor people who would love the chance and opportunity to get a gig with ya'll, but you guys and girls keep on making the rich and elite, richer. I get that you love rich celebrities and hate the average pleb, but come on... it's time for change.  Do better.
the way she says boys tho..........................daam
New main
Riot Valoran : Hey can i copy your homework? Riot Lol : Yeah just dont make it to obvious
She looks exactly like the new league champ just with a modernized skin for valorant lmao
0:37 “Ayyy buhay..” Same Neon, same.
Fun fact : at 1:46 you can hear Tagalog dialogue "Controlado koto" means i can control this or i got this controlled.
Eyyy Philiphines#1
Song here sounds better somehow than the ylona garcia uploaded video
Every trailer of this games makes it looks nicier than really is, because there's cool character design and gameplay mechanics, but in reality the game is not so fun as it seems, the maps are claustrophobic, movement is a crap, too slow, agent classes are most arbitrary than logical, sound design of the guns are annoying (classic burns my ears, damn), there's no way to run with the gun, you need to change to knife in order to run faster, that's ridiculous. Man, I just remembered why I uninstalled this game, Valorant is terrible, it's dangerous to your brain, do not play this shit.
So it's literally Zeri's variant? lol
She looks like Zeri from League 😯
This could be the 'Entertain Me' Official Music Video:)
Alright, so League Of Legends crossover with Zeri into the Valorant universe with a different color scheme and new wardrobe getup? I'm down for it.
Literally sage is the heroine here.
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssttttttttttttt go\
Shit she got some cake
I want a Sage in my team who will save me from Showstopper like @ 1:48 :)
Sepong sepong
2:21 Ylona Gracia's poster ❤
She ran so fast at the end that she ended in League of Legends
The fact that she's listening to Ylona Garcia. I hope she's not always late on the battlefield. 😂 Filipino time
seriously????? IS THIS ZERI?
Team's waiting? Ah yes, she's late.
Let's go Philippines 🇵🇭
it's apex vs valorant all over again
Bro this is so coollllll!!!!!!!!
"Hay Buhay"
Para cuando la versión para consolas?
wangy😍
Copy-Paste Zeri....
"Hoy grab the spike!" "Lintik kayo" - Neon
She could have been an Overwatch hero... A Filipino hero in Valorant is unexpected, but as an Overwatch hero, it would have been expected! The Omnic invasion STARTED in the Philippines, in Manila! But noooooo... we need to wait until Overwatch 2 to get new heroes... Blizzard is useless now.
Memanwhile jett sweating
Pilipinas numbah one!!!
Nah she’s OP
Oh yeah, I can't wait for high-level smurfs to start new accs to quickly unlock and try out Neon and ruin the casual games for others <3  Fix the smurfing problem :c
Sage is cute 🥰
Can’t wait to go to r34
First time watching a Valorant trailer and honestly it gave me goosebumps!!! They are soo soo goooood! The graphic animation and music are lit af! Kudos to the teams!! 😍😍 Might try it after saying bye to League :)
1:13 ooo she's Filipino
*"Coming in like a storm"*
trailers should be in 4k
2:10
why is this video in 15 fps? is it really too expensive to render a damn video in 60 fps?
GIRL BOSS
XD NEON copied two of Phoenix's skills, the wall and the molly, seems like Phoenix has a harem now :))
This is literally Surge from the X-Men
nice ill for sure use the character
Riot 2020: "We're trying to reduce the amount of running and gunning" "Abilities don't kill"  Riot 2022: "Screw it"
Am i the only when getting mad sonic vibes when i saw this? XD
I feel like she's similar to tracer overwath but less attractive !!
The way she said "kontrolado ko to" damn it fires me up too🔥
Imagine Riot making original characters across their games.
A jetthole like character
Wow zeri but not zeri also
Zeri for league and now.... for Valorant!
zeri???
Amazing spiderman 2 has electroman Meanwhile Valorant finally got electrowoman
REBIBE ME JETT!!
We want less run and gun  Meanwhile.
dude she's so fucking cool
lol it's the walis tambo for me
HELL YEAH!!!!
I think I'm in love ❤
this vid felt so wholesome for some reason- lmao
Mid + cope + ratio + ur white + dont care
Check nyo rin sa LOL SI ZERI FILIPINO DIN
As a Filipino, it is always nice to see my country represented in popular media like movies and games, even better when it's done right. It gives us a sense of pride in the thought that we are acknowledged especially in the international community (or at least that's how I see it). I only hope that these instances will not be the only times where we show that we are proud of our identity, and I believe that we Filipinos have a long way to go in the road to truly embracing our nation and culture.  For the knowledge and convenience of any foreigner that may stumble into this comments section, here are the Filipino vocabulary used in the trailer.  "Hay, buhay..." - "Oh, life..."/ "Ugh, life..." (commonly a sigh of bliss, exasperation or disappointment, depending on the context.) "Kontrolado ko 'to!" - "I can control this!"/ "I can handle this!"/ "I got this!" (colloquial form of "Kontrolado ko ito!")  Mabuhay! (Long live!)
Ahh i see   We have the demon in Valorant and LoL
2:27 sage: race u there? neon: *proceed to run* sage: *preprare to slow*
YOOOO... THE SONG REALLY FITS THE CLIP!!! GREAT VIDEO!
can't wait to play her in bronze
ferrari peek gonna be   l i t
So, no one is going to say anything about this being extremely similarly to the new LoL champion, Zeri?
1:13 Rise up filipinos!!!
sliding ? rly ?
So they ported Spark from Valorant into League and renamed her Zeri. Ok rito.
Broken she has movement while others move like turtles
zeri?
Fun fact shes from the Philippines bcs she said hay buhay which means sigh life i dont know how to sentence it in tagalog and she said kontrolado koto which mean i can control this
her ult is op it resets every kill
oh its tracer from overwatch
Valorant kids: damn she thick
Umm didn't league just announce a twintailed, unnatural color haired, electricity wielding, fingergun pointing character
I'm hyped, being a filipino.! I will probably main this agent when it comes out all the time. Hindi ako makapaghintay!
Hot and Thicc! Love it.
Hey Octane!
jett²
She's not Filipino cuz she entered her room with her shoes on.
zeri?
zeri ?
Riot entertainment=))
valorant is the new COD, devs dont give a fuck about game or making a good comp shooter.. just making cringe skins with the worst gun models in any game ever created plus game been out for 2 years and same boring shit maps and mm and elo system literally all garbage thats why all the money goes straight into overpriced new skins every two week and the rest into promotion so sad
not broken btw
like a wraith
recycling designs for valorant from league
damn the new agent is dope
Jerry is here!
So they weren't kidding about the leaked map on that's located on Manila?
tangina may walis
Its interesting how League’s newly revealed champion Zeri and Valorant’s new agent Neon has the same electrokinesis type abilities...  And how they both are voiced by the same Filipina voice actress...
Yes new update, finally.  ApexLegend chara
waiting
HAY BUHAY
"hay buhay" HAHAHAHAYA
niceeeee Agent ❤❤🔥
Pilipinas?
Sage wants to race what is she going to do grim wall to the end
did sage just ask the fastest agent to race her
les fk gooooooooooooooooooooo!
Yess a filipino character as a pinoy myself   Also 1:13 if you pause here you see pilipinas
I dont play val, but this trailer is really just great all around.
yoo a Filipino agent
ufff what a good character the truth
I think this is the only trailer that'll make me play valorant, not a single one has made feel like that
mga Pinoy MAGINGAYYYY!!!!!
wtf its literally zeri ._.
relly why is it not in ralorant
the real mvp is sage
yo valorant is now considered a sus
I never read the description of the video and I thought I was crazy hearing her say " Kontrolado ko to" which means I can control it, I immediately knew she was a Filipino which is quite pog!
After watching this now i feel R6 is doing great job than this. THORN rocks.
Omg i cant wait💞💞
design inspired by today's onlyfans e-thots
Anyone realized she's singing with a toothbrush? lol
but my aim is suck :(
Right can’t get enough of watching this again and again and again and again 😍🔥
VALORANT IM BEGGING PLEASE FIX THE TPM 2.0 ISSUE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PLAY VALORANT SINCE A MONTH AND IF I DIDN'T TRY NEON I WILL CRY
Voice line ideas (reply your edits or own ideas):   (1) I want her to have a line that she uses to mock/tease Jett. As a filipino, social media is quite strong in the society so:   "Hala Jett, wala si Sage ah. °laughs° rebibe me Jett, Rebibe me!!" (Oh my/oh no Jett, Sage isn't here. Ahahahhaa revive me Jett, revive me!)   (2) At the beginning of the round, she teases Jett a bit:   "Jett, anong sa 'yo~? °laughs° Joke lang~ I 진짜 love Korea!! Been studying a bit--" "Wait, 너 언니야? 씨--" (Jett, what's yours? ["Anong sa 'yo" sounds like Annyeonghaseyo] *laughs* I'm just joking~ I really love Korea!! Been studying a bit--" "Wait, You're older than me? Fuc---" [Unnie is either a woman's older sister or any female--other than mom, aunt, or grandma--that is older than said woman]   (3) It would be nice for her to talk about Pulbos/pulbo (means baby powder; very famous in the PH).   "Does anyone have pulbos? I'm starting to sweat after carrying all of you guys." (A Neon vers. of Jett's "my back's aching")   (4) another agent interaction: Neon and Chamber Knowing that the 2 are really close, it would be nice for Neon to see Chamber as an older brother, which in Filipino is Kuya.   "Kuya, have you seen the parols na? They're better than last year's! Maybe mr. Barangay kapitan is stepping up his game? Whatever it is, I'm so for it." [Barangay kapitan is a district/village chief; not a formal title, more playful version]   "Chame, can I call you Chame? Yah, I'll just call you Chame. Ah! How about Ber-ber! °laughs° Ang cute!~" [Idk but for me, I like making 1-syllable nicknames] ("Ang cute" means How cute)   (4) Someone said something about Neon singing and then telling herself to get back to work. Please let her sing the SM song~   (mumbles/hums) ☆come on in, look at what we've got There's so much more--☆ "Wooop--- back to work....~" (Belts) "We've got it all for you!"
She cute
its going faraway from being a shooting game day by day
So basically, Chidori-girl.  Cool.
Прекольно, в лмгу лигенд добавили нового адк а в валорант рекалор на него
Time to grab a shovel and dig out my account from it's grave  (haven't played since September 2021)
Did she say contolado ko to
Dalagang Pilipina Neon.
I just unistalled , because of study.. 🙂🙂but watching on yt
When valorant go on playstation?
Literally Zeri with dyed hair
Wait is she agent 19 or is she someone else
Are they really releasing rhe same character in both valorant and league....? Lazy ass Riot Games
another day rewatching this again and again❤
i cant play  valorant becuse i need version 2.0 and i can t update what do i do
PINAY HERO?
Why is the new league champ here?
Sayonara jett
NEW CHARACTERS PH LETS GO!?!?🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍
Valorant being Apex Legends
el multiverso de riot se expande con zeri y neon
Ang astig naman, wow.
When riot are losing ideas so they release a champion and an agent that is similar. The spark of zaun!
Valorant: *Neon* LOL: *Zeri* *Same VA* Similar Release date Has Electricity as their base Riot is on HIGH
Im pretty sure this agent gonna be nerves after a week
The actual agents will be the soraka, amumu and ashe of league of legends, useless by new mechanics
Is that Phoenix sister !?😆
When it is coming?
Cringed hard
she'll probably be the opest agent
Her sprint really be: "NIGERUNDAAAYOOOOOOO" i love it
literally a palette swap of zeri  from lol they even have the same hair style cool i guess
For anyone curious: 0:37 "Haaaay buhay" is an expression that literally translates to "Uuuuugh, life" but is more in line with "Maaaaaaan..."  1:42 "Kontrolado ko to"  literally translates to "I can control this" and expressed as "I got this" like she's trying to convince herself that she can control it.
R34 artist : here we go again
Next up: An Indian Character🙂🇮🇳
This looked like hot garbage lmao. They should invest in more than 2 frames per second
1:29 My favourite part and the reverb makes her voice more heavenly❤️✨
Voice character is lifeless 😩
Sage: "Race you there?"  Neon: "Do you have any idea how fast i am? I'm fast as f*ck, boi!"
FILIPINO TIME TO PLAY AGAIN
This was the lamest trailer
this character looks so fucking ass idek what yall doing with the game anymore
its real?
IM SOO HYPED!!! 🥳🥳🥳
I think kz tandingan sing the song
Pilipino agent
That's fuxking Zeri
Is she a Filipino character or the video is just translated?
1:51 CHIDORIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
finally someone for people to braindead for jett, like me
This character finna be popular asf
SHESH
I've always wanted a cod version of csgo with sliding and run and gunning
pinay agent lessszgoooo
Zeri in valorant style, nice
Now judge and bucky are milion times more usefull
riot kills it right now
tactical shooter btw
Where my fellow Pinoys at! 🇵🇭💞
at least she doesn't have a flash lmao
That's zeri from an alternate universe I guess, kinda cool that league did this
LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY GOOD AGENTS ARE THE ORIGINAL ONES THEY MADE WHEN THEY RELEASED THE GAME .... EVER SINCE THE DUDES THAT MADE THE RANKING SYSTEM LEFT, RIOT MADE CRAP MAPS AND CRAP AGENTS, AND THIS IS ANOTHER CRAP AGENT , F U RIOT
Once the walis tambo was hung against the wall that room became a home
Riot: releases Neon Yoru: I guess I'm already gone here…
I like how you build up the world of valorant, makes it very accessible
ANOTHER BORING AGENT .... THE LAST AGENTS THEY MADE ARE SO USELESS ( YORU, SKY , ASTRA , KAYO )
THEY WILL NEVER MAKE A REAL AGENT ANYMORE ... SOMEONE LIKE JETT OR RAZE, A DYNAMIC AGENT THAT ACTUALLY TAKES EFFORT TO MAKE, AND NOT JUST AGENTS WITH FLASHES
VALORANT STOPPED MAKING GOOD AGENTS SINCE KILLJOY... THEY GOT LAZY
FEMALE YORU... ANOTHER USELESS AGENT
OCTANEE
cake
I hope Overwatch also gets a Filipino representation, I am just envious now of this game. But hearing a voice line in Filipino is really music to my ears.
I want a "Jett rebabyb me jett" line
r34 artist: heheh boooooooooooooooooi
Yoru and jett had a baby
ECO FROM OVERWATCH IS JUST CRYING
Neon looks like LoL's new champ Zeri
good to see both league and valorant are getting the same exact character
hay buhay
wtf
Oke this from Philippine what next ?
hello octane
so who copied who? or are they related?
its not in valorant
new wifu nice
Co to za gowno
I think she is a healer
She got a tazer for her ult
Valorant pls create name is ice pro
The CoD agent is here!
I see riot i see...           Hahahahahahaahahahahah im losing it wtf is this haahhahaahahahah
precise gunplay
Probably Call of duty player: it's time
Pinoy Vibeeeeeeeeee! " Hay Buhay" and "Kontrolado ko to" gives me a goosebumps. eyyyy . angassss
MABUHAY PHILIPPINESSSSSS
Wow Nag tagalog Talaga XD
Thankfull that I'm an Apex player
hay buhay
League of Legends: Zeri Valorant: Spark..... i like it
She's so similar to Zeri btw
Okay, i wanna play Val now
Zeri = Neon Neon = Zeri
I am Filipino I pledge my allegiance To the flag of the Philippines And to the country it represents With honor, justice and freedom Put in motion by one Nation for God, People, Nature and Count  - this is the Philippine pledge of allegiance in English  Ako ay Pilipino Buong katapatang nanunumpa Sa watawat ng Pilipinas At sa bansang kanyang sinasagisag Na may dangal, katarungan at kalayaan Na pinakikilos ng sambayanang Maka-Diyos, Maka-tao, at Makabansa.[3]  - This is the Tagalog verison....  FILIPINX DOES NOT EXIST IN OUR NATIONAL CREED OR LANGUAGE. WE ARE NOT FILIPINX... PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIVE IN OUR COUNTRY  DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE WHAT WE CALL OURSELVES. SHAME ON VALORANT DEVELOPERS!
Now we can officially rng (run & gun) 😂😂
Looks like Riot Games are working ;) and the funny part is even League of Legends will have a character who dashes and strikes with electricity, seems like Valiant and League are working together ;D
Waiting riot to add some Car, Bike  agents. The game would be more fun. Don't you agree? 🤣
Sage: Race You There?  Neon: So you have chosen death?
Oh the running and gunning gonna make ranked fun af. Forget jett
Zeri is also in valorant now
thicc¡¡¡
she looks like jinx
WHAT DOES SHE SAY BEFORE HER ULT?
The only thing with that run animation I can hear is a loud “FLINT LOCKWOOD”
My octane self is asking me back
so basically they're releasing the same character in both Valorant and League
Lol. The agent for run and gunners Hahahah
Wag Kang bastos girl version
Shazam:finally a worthy opponent
So we have a Pinay Agent. Mabuhay! Always nice to have a little more representation in the gaming media.
Tracer!
If Valorant ever make a malaysian agent with sarong(kain pelikat)...i will buy more skins to support riot 🤣🤣🤣
That WALIS TAMBO in the room , lol, looks like every Filipino household.
Zeri???
did I just hear her speaking Filipino?
SHE IS GORGEOUS TO ME
KONTROLADO KO TO!!
Give's off a concert in the shower vibe definitely a filipino
Hear me out: 1 hp, no paid abilities, run and gun perfect accuracy with double jump
She's filipino??????!!!!!
when is this agent gonna be released???
Who thinks she is better than chamber????
Honestly Riot!?! Fix run and gun shooting!?! Not that.. Maybe give the game another agent that will take the " tatical " out of it... Big L here, this character belongs in Overwatch or Apex.. This is terrible for the current state of the game, instead of making the game feel for slow and tatical you throw there a girl with zap in his hands, a soldier 76 run, dash, double walls... So fck annoying..
How can I play neon in early acess
Wait is she zeri
Powerd by Meralco HAHAHAHAHA
my new main=
Finally my best play style rng
FINALLY MORE WAIFUS GAMERS
💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙
NSFW artist: it's free real estate
She's TAGALOG???? CRINGGEEEE
finally a trailer where cypher dosent die
What a cool agent!!! New favourite! My only wish is that her voice lines be re-recorded. It seems monotonous and flat. I’m sure the VA is amazing! She can easily be directed anyways.
finally an agent that can run n gun
kool
Did valorant change the thumbnail of this video 3 time? Or am i trippin
brutal
so precise gunplay was a joke
This new agent is something familiar to the cod war zone game play😜
This zeri
This is just Zeri from League. So fucking lazy
Ah another dashing champ. Why is this game centered around Pheonix? Ihave soo many questions.
Zari look like neon lol Imagine sering valorant x League of legends
Riot games cut scenes and animation is next gen..😘😘😍😍🤩🤩
apex players gonna have a field day getting to slide in valorant with her
they should have made her short and stumpy.
Can't wait to run and gun and nobody can yell at me for it
What's with her look ..lol And did they stick thermocol or something on her heads.  C'mon that's non appealing
Mdrrr Forest Gump 0:54
Hay buhay 😂
Phoenix:i can make one walls made of fire with limited range Neon:i can make two walls that seem to have infinite range
LAZY DESIGN ZZZ
A kingdom affiliated radianite agent?
Zeri seems pretty cool.. oh no, wait.. hmmm
As someone who doesn’t play valorant, the character looks sick, riots doing a great job
zeri but chroma
YOO THIS IS SICK, SHE EVEN GOT THE PHILIPINAS JERSEY
REPRESENT!!!!!!!!!
then we know sage have a friend..
So Riot just decided to copy and paste the same design for both their agents and champs and give her a different hair color.
“kontrolado ko ‘to!”
Dude... Make her jump up on some boxes .. If we press  space and right click on her sprint mode😍
AHHHH THIS IS AMAZING LIKE THE MUSIC WAS GOING SO GOOD WITH THE VIDEO I LOVE IT CAN'T WAIT FOR HER
Maybe….she too overpowered.
I love sage's voice
In all honesty this seems terrible for the state of the game as a tac shooter and might completely ruin its integrity
10 fps vid :(
stupid ass haircut💀
Pinay? She said "Haay buhay"
That's so cool
Zeri
PILIPINO PRAYDDDD
1:32 hey its Zeri from league!
IS SHE PINOY I SWORE I HEARD SHE SAID KONTROLADO KO TO
This looks like the most infuriating thing to play against
Sorry talaga kahit anong gawin nyo, ang cringe talaga ng tagalog na dub. Maski anime pa yan o valorant. ANG CRINGE! Pero galing kumanta ng voice actress!
Oh she sings! Yup, she's a Filipino
Other than gameplay, she's probably thicker than viper... Jokes aside, valorant is slowly turning into a 5v5 tactical arena shooter
They're just beating Yoru's dead body at this point
now i want to see her interection with jett
Looks extremely broken
im so hyped
Thats one of the worst cinematics I've seen in years
Give her a wall run! And double jump! And a huge robot.
Riot, doesn't this character concept seem familiar....
If you guys didnt know, neon is a filipina. Inspired in phillipines fastest snatchers 💀🇵🇭
Kontrolado ko to CRINGEEEE
Jerry's sis
SHE CAN SPRINT???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
yo holy crap its Zeri from league of- hey wait a minute
this just looks like zeri
She is gonna be the new thicc agent no cap
RUN AND GUN
How many times you guys want to change the thumbnail!?
What happened to your animations Riot? This trailer's animation was not even close to your cinematics before. Disappointed from the animation but the new agent seems interesting tho.
first of all this is not a broken character
bro no one says those filipino words
Арт лучше
0:53 NEON Precise gun play Project A
Looks like Barry has a new challenge
Woah a Filipino champ..made me interested of playing this game!!
WHY DO I HAVE A BONERR!!!
goated wall by sage
Es igual q zeri xd
valorant's tracer
FILIPINOS RISE UP💪
Just sharing but Omen died 3 times in this vid :(
Neon and Zeri
It's like Jett's and Reyna's sister.
Me :  **seeing this trailer**  Talim from Soul Calibur : _finally a worthy opponent_  Josie Rizal from Tekken 7 : _our battle would be legendary!_
THE WAY SHE SAY  *KONTROLADO KO TO*
Zeri, sal de ahí esa no es tu familia XD.
these new agents are dropping fast as lightning
now, you say they don't mess ideas with each other?
i thought this game was a tactical shooter
Oh, so this is the Zaunite.
ayy new agent, similar to jet but might even be better
omfg... a filipino character. games hardly have filipino chars, this is dope
So, she has Kayo's grenades, dobule pheonix wall, dash, and aimbot ult? Too overpowered?
Xantares would love this
SO COOL
did she just say tagalog words?
umagahhbbhh buhh vubbubvoh
Woah. Hay Buhay plus Ylona Garcia on music. PINOY VIBES!!!!~ and Team Secret. Proud Pinoy Here
The ultimate looks like a electric gun from Quake lol
letssgooo!! Ingat!!!
One thing I like about games like Overwatch and Valorant, that they have people from all over the world. Allows for multiple cultures to shine and people to feel proud that they're represented in agents. Hope to see more diverse agents from all around the globe.
i like like 👀
"Kontrolado ko to"
How in the world is this lore
SHES FROM THE PHILIPPINES LETS GOOO
so... There is a Zeri in Valorant? is this a multiverse?
Riot is so damn lazy that they launch the same champ on 2 games with the same skills (referring to ZERI from league)
The way she say kontrolado koto! OMG im gonna past out!
🇵🇭 wohoo
kontrolado ko to
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
so excited for her
Eyy yoo filipino gang
Hayy buhay
Dat thicc ,👁️👄👁️
Solo vengo a decir que es preciosa ayuda, y la canción también, hay un 99,99% de que la mainee.
New agent but what about 😢For low end pc valorant is totally unoptimize after so many updates 😞
Chamber was right
There basically making run and gunning more annoying lmao
the philippine snatcher
Zeri in Valorant XDDD
Xd
Aha she runs like Octane
so cooooooolllllllllll
SHE CAN SPRINT ! That's all I want. Finally an agent I really want to play other than Sova.
Very Filipinaaaa🥰
Looks like the new champion of LoL
As someone who left VALORANT because of it's mostly slow paced agents, I might reconsider coming back
bruh valorant sucks u guys wonder why ur game dying? its cause of reasonless bans
I LOVE THE Hay BUHAY PART
Sage - race u there ? neon- ult  also sage - wall door 😂😂😂
Bosis palang pilipina na
ez nerf
Sonic less gooo
Jett is that you
Jett 2.O
so...jet? but she's got some other avatar power
So she's basically like a female phoenix ?
Someone at Riot has a thing for electric girls with pom-pom hair this week.
Finally i can say "Get fingered" without getting ban.
She got the nose
She is so much cooler than Zeri :(  Why cant League get Neon and Valorant gets the budget version..
damn my second favorite agent is prob gonna be this
Apex? 👀👀👀
2:04 why is this so cringe
Neon Pilipinas 1:13 ?
Oh gee, I always want to justify my run-n-gunning. Thanks Riot!
Neon with a spectre is going to be wild
Wait did she just speak tagalog? Wtf. 😂
Zeri gone valorant
Is Ylona Garcia also gonna be a new agent sooner?
Zeri 2
So is this Zeri from League of Legends?
Oh boy, they’re showing us how to run and gun now
So we combined phenoix, jet and yozu and made him into a new agent. Oh jeez boy it's league all over again
niggas added Yameii to valorant
So weird that she use the vacuum cleaner instead of the Walis Tambo(broom), anue yan palamuti?😂
Not sure I like anything I just saw.
So Riot was so lazy that they made the same character for League and Valo 🤣
So the used the same model for the new league champ
With that ult, its clear she’s got mad finger skills 😏
OMG THIS VIDEO JUST WOOOWWWWW SO WEL DONE
woooouuuu!!
i love the new agent but if there is a new agent right thenn will there be a new map?
"sigh" "loads odin with melicios intent"
his is finna be my new main
whens the rule 34 drop
She looks like a kind of person who would fight a priest that wants to reset the universe and save his half dead father in cryostasis.
1:40 plato ko to??!
when is this agent gonna actually be in the game?
LETS GOOO SHES PILIPINA!!!
Neon love
I got as exited for this as I do for new apex characters and I don't even play this game
Did Riot games just make Zeri and put her in both League of Legends and Valorant? Hmmmmmmmmm...
Gameplay trailer just looks like someone has bad FPS
Now that... that's tactical!
I wish she had a thicker Filipino accent
I have rewatched this more than I like to admit
finally another girl agent with eletric
So Cool!!!!! cant wait
Wait, is this LOL import or Valorant export
if jett and pheonix had a baby
How about a Manila server?! Hahhaa. Would love that haha
literal fortnite skin built look azz
ENTERTAIN ME MONTAGE (valorant)
0:08 best scene no cap
Ah yees, another waifu
can i say "The Cavalry's Here!" :v
Its bootiful
lawd have mercy, im boutta bust
I love thowse songs from riot it sends shivers down my spine
Neon/Zeri are the same person, not similar people. And yes that implies certain things about the worlds she's "native" to.
NICE
she seems rlly cool cant wait
we need a valorant series like league of legends has
Joder la quiero respetar 😡😡😡
Octane vibes check
Comunidad: se queja del Run and Gun .  Rito Games: Chicos tengo una idea
Take your shoes off in bed jesus
It so cool
Riot : We dont want people to run and gun Also Riot :
Oh ny gosh representations
yung kulay ng buhok ni Neon ka kulay ng costume ni Kidlat ..😅
This is a nice 12 fps trailer.
So riot made this lady then ran out of ideas and just slapped her in league with a different hair color😂
is it just me or has the thumbnail changed at least 5 times ever since this trailer came out.
OMGGGGGG
Zeri's twin sister
Where's the Pu+@🤬🤬 ina??
That double wall might be when the Philippines is in traffic. The running ability is like hit and run. Then the bomb/flash ability is like a reference to the amount of bombs that has been blowing up. And then there is her ulti.
Really?the same champion?
Why is the animation so choppy?
Chammber's trailer was so much better , i really don't like her design and animation feels janky and feels like it was made in the source filmmaker
Zero looks nice
Riot is a really good game developer for a music company
phoenix: -_-
Oh sweet, a shiny Zeri 👀
Yuro's sister
valorant only got money for 20 fps? Not quite lol cinematic
She's from Manila, of course she's a runner
Riotverse confirmed
Bruh still, Philipinx
Dude she is like the new leauge champ but in valorant wtf riot
1:12 i wish she used walis tambo instead of vacuum cleaner.😂 A little bit sad😌
yooo fire
Philippines ❤️
me when someone else instalocks neon before I do: hay buhay....
the slide tho reminds me of fortnite and the save the world sarah from fortnite had  the same thing with jett?
Thats cool she’s Filipino
soy torta
I really do hope there won't be any scandals about neon thats similar to the  José Rizal from Tekken Series
God we need a Valorant series like Arcane
HOLY FUCKING Shit this shit INSANSE AWDAD ASAKSKASK
SHES SO FUCKING PRETTYYY
Serí?
An electric girl with colored pigtails...is this zeri?
well at least new phoenix wall is next generation. love it <3
the first character to able to meme about a certain line... FAST AS frick BOYS!
players: Riot please stop run&gun gameplay :( riot: haha neon go brr
i feel like adding more characters is super needed, adding more variablility is what makes most games fun for me
Speed Agent?
Instead of saying shit, neon should say "yawa"
If Riot is going to release similar ability champions/agents to both of their games. I'm looking forward to what you guys do with the monster creatures!
Sorry Reyna :-;
I am uninstalling the game 💀
Ayo PILIPINAS MABUHAY
Jett in 2020 and 2021: I'm the fastest on the team, nobody dashes like me! 2022 - Neon: Hold my electric phone.
SHES FILIPINA ASWELL???
PROD in a nutshell
I LOVE IT! Iheard some Filipino voice lines too
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I see where zeri came from
0:42
A agent truly suited for my play style run and fun with Odin
INSANE NEW AGENT!!!!
This character defies the valorant idea of not run and gunning
better than jett ?
thats insane
Riot be like "we put  Zeri, the Spark of Zaun into league"  "now put her into Valorant too" just change her a bit.
straight ruining the game..
Yeah.. she’s def my favorite
MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS!!! ALL FILIPINOS TAP IN!!
She looks super fun
why does she move in 10 fps
oh yes my octane
Why does she have Sage on her computer screen?  LOL
Sanic
fortnite is better!!
Riot: "This is a precise gunplay game" Also Riot: "Promotes run and gun with Neon"
zeri is that you   ONLY league of legends players will understand
HOLY SHIT HOW COOL!
FILIPINOS UNITE
just gonna ask valorant is yoru rework still coming?
Hay buhay
Inspired by Meralco haha
YO MY GIRL A FILIPINA
XD
So she can enter avatar state and bend lightning, but also has super speed? Nice
Absolutely its a same champ in LoL,Lmao
Wtf is this wizard shit man
And here is a good reason to stop playing Valorant, introducing more run&gun, and then starting to just give upgraded variants of old abilities (pheonix wall). Why
1.44
Zeri????????????????
i havent played valorant im just here to hyperventilate over that sweet character design and concept art.
Shes a baddie
Zeri champion spotlight lookin fresh yo
12fps animation XD
Ukrainian hair XD
this feels nostalgic even tho I never saw this before.
PHILIPPINES LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The clips are gonna be insane!
If I am somehow afraid of neon  Am I also supposed to be afraid of astra?
Zeri version but in valorant xD wtf
can we trade her for keri. i swear keri is good and not annoyingly designed.
hacks
Bruh, this is legit just zeri. Couldn't be bothered, huh Riot?
СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ
Let’s get tactical!
cs:go surf players be like
FILIPINO REP BABY
hooooooo!
What an amazing character, man this game keeps getting better and better. I think I’ve got a new main now!
Jojo Reference ?
you can shoot lazers!
So excited to try neon. When is she coming to the game?
🇵🇭💪
I like the unique playstyle
Kontrolado koto.
gay gay agaya gayahay ahg
Player: I want OP Jett Riot: We already have OP Jett at home! OP Jett at home:
looks like an overwatch character
me being a filipino ´´Let's ducking gooooooooo´´
me watching this video: "oh it's more like Sombra and Echo in Overwatch" 😉
"I must find the avatar to restore my honor." - Azula
I see you showing the Philippines some love with your characters. Just shut up and take my money already.
Discount tracer
Zeri (new LOL champion) has the same symbol in her back that Neon has in her arms, and basically the same powers. I love them, I can't wait to try them!
when is she coming
Is it OP ?
real question is why did sage wall after she resed
I don't play Valorant but this trailer is amazing!
she is beautiful
Is her Zeri from lol?
Y’all copy and pasted your new league character bruh, just changed the color pallet
The song alone makes this trailer soo good
Phonix is crying because of that wall
Sonic : FAST !!!
topsom!!!
LETS GO PINOY PRIIIIDDEEEE
The guy rendering this must've had a potato for a PC. The LEGO Movie had smoother animation.
Why its on 26fps?
Tracer 2.0
FUCK YEAH A FILIPINO AGENT! I'M SO STOKED! MIGHT BE BAD AT THE GAME BUT I'M GOING BACK JUST TO TRY HER!
The whole time I was watching this all I'm thinking is "She a runner she a track star"
looks like a Naruto game character
League has Zeri, Valorant has Spark. same theme - electricity. Wow
finally, a dualist to rival jett.
This is just Zeri wtf?
Hayyy Buhay 🤣 so cute
I see the new agent and Lol's new champ are designed by the same person.
Really why!!!!!!!!! Like she could fire wall and she has speed boost why valorant !!!!!!!!!!!! You just turn valorant into Apex legends like wtf you made it more hard fuck this shit I'm out
She is gonna be a great agent for sure
PILIPINAS SIGAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
GYATTTTTT
MY PEOPLE
zeri
Where are Yoru reworks???
Kinda wack to see them deviate this far away from the original vision of the game this quick. Starting to look like overwatch 2.5
Lol they should all make a cartoon 🤣out of valorant or a movie
thicc
so shes kinda like tracer from overwatch
what a perfect song
xd es el mismo champ que el de lol
she actually does a finger gun to kill people as an ult
Tattoos like Reyna's, the lower part of the body (pants/belt) like Raze, the around the eyes like Jett, the blue of the fire barrier (like phoenix) . But she’s a cool hero👊🏻
We want new agent from nepal also riot can you😁🥺❤️
Thank you valorant to make to agent  for 🤣
I sense a increase movement speed  passive
LESSS GO A FILIPINO CHARATCER
Funny. League just launched the same character.
riot literally just put run and gun in their trailer
ABILITYS SHOULD NOT KILL
I want a game where you can design your room like this as a side thing (and it has to be in this style like the Valorant is) or maybe a Valorant game mode itself?
shes a yoga mom
Sage <3
I love that she's Filipino, is a singer, has a double wall and Force Lightning for an ult..... but it will have all been for nothing if she doesn't have a voice line that says "TANGINAAA"
Why league and valor at got the same new character
omg those posters !!! reynas little sister ? easter eggs on point
Wait this isn’t the Zeri Trailer
omg is Zeri from league of legends
too op bro i dont care what you say this is too op for like iron players bc she is so fast they wont even be able to hit her
Finally, i can do csgo Ferrari peeks properly in Valorant.
Idea: you can do a indian or italian agent that has something to do with water
Riot's version of Octain from Apex Legends
let me think sage lost the race
nice pinay
cringy af
overpowered
this music is stuck in mu head!! 😍😍🔥
Oh wow look at that, yet another duelist cuz we definetly don't have more than enough of those also she looks like a mix of raze and jett
Is this shaft from quake on ult?
Why does she have 5 abilities....I thought it was 4
op
I miss this game Haven't played since that new zipline map dropped  I can't even remember the name
This is by far my favorite trailer. I love the design of this character and the trailer music was great. Cant believe they got Ylona Garcia from 88rising
damn neon's so fine she finna make me act up 😏💦
Yesss
this agent is insaaaaaaaaaaaane!! I'm gon' have a lotta toxic red messages
Yo another Zeri trailer LETS GOOO!!!
lul 16 yo teenager coming in unistalled valo bye dogs
shit dude we just got chamber i fell so loved
Neon's a W
Sooo they rly add same champ on lol and valorant hah.... They are rly out of ideas
Ah yes a filippino character in valorant and i m a fan lol
legit my new main now
YO IMMMA HAV A NEW MAIN
This character look so badass 😎
I say 2 more years before riot completly fucks up the game.
24 fps.
kabayan kabayan 👀❤️🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Wait now they are releasing same champs in League AND Valorant
so basiccally riot released the same character for league and valorant? how creative! cmon man she also looks broken in valorant, not so much in league
Her and the league champ are the same character
Yahhhhh a Filipino character! Let’s gooooooo
i just love Neon ,
Cod players be like
This is tracer copy lol.
Did I hear Tagalog?
Damn Valorant gets future Zeri, that is cool as hell ngl
multiverso ta dando dinheiro né riot
Sooo why does she look almost exactly like Zari the new League champion!? Riot are u gettin a bit lazy with character design?
Riot destroying every Blizzard games the only step left is an big new very good MMORPG and Blizzard will delete themselves quietly.
omg gfs
AWESOME!
why does this look like the new league champ and vice versa
Tf is this 😂😂😂
so, its jett but on ground??
I don't like it specially the ultimate 😕
I do like her way more then I thought I was gonna, gj, and nice to see a Philipine char !
bruh Neon looks like Zeri from lol
Is this an initiator?
Neon and Zeri (new league champ) have similar electric themed kits. The finger zaps, sliding/dashing over walls. And aoe burst/revive
So she's a blue version of Zeri
Sage: "Race you there?" Also Sage: **Throws slow orbs and walls off Neon**
jett 2
Oh gawd, a gunner runner, i love it
Nice!!!!! now i can die fast :/
Zeri? Originalidad dónde?? Jajajajaa
this is amazing
اخيرا عميلة و فقراوية بعد 💙💛
Haven't played since the last 3 characters, it's insane how many new agents are coming in
electric powers and high speed movement, my all time favorite element and mechanic
valorant has excepted run and gun as part of the game
Neon Zeri *Spiderman pointing meme*
They should have made it so that istead of just creating walls from thin air she dashed really fast straightfoward leaving behind the walls as if those were her trail due to the speed
Yes Zeri is coming to Valorant
new Lol hero and new valorant hero is same
There’s no way like NO possible way you can tell me that Riot didn’t make her in Zeri’s image. She’s is Zeri’s great great great granddaughter or something
tactical shooter
Finally a video where cypher is'nt harmed😇😇
So ye we get to Electro champs in both league and Valorant damn ok
Neon in valorant  Zeri in league of legends
did she just say " hay.. buhay.."?
She said "Kontrolado ko ito." It means "I can control this" in Filipino. Wow. 😊
its too good
so she is the exact same character from the new lol champ zeri , only the color of the hair change
pot0
Shes not filipino. She brought her shoes into her room and then proceeded to lay in bed with her shoes still on.
Shocking
Valorant's flash 🥺
Why does she and league of legends champion look similar tho
oh thank god im a rule 34 artists
I am waiting😍😍😍
Kurwa prze kosior
Neon looks yummy
shes so... fast
Riot, I’m in silver 2. Why the fudge am I being put up against Gold 1 in my games?!? I’m not even good at the game. Like I’m not terrible but how tf am I going up against people like that. And I’m losing 22-25?!? The hell??? When I win I only get like 13-15 only once have I gotten 24. Fix your shit MMR. I just had to rant sorry
wtf that is Zeri
hayyyy buhay
It's nice seeing cypher isn't in this massacre
Valorant releases new Filipino agent  Filipinos: you have summoned us
Haaaaay! buhay.
Everyone gangsta up seeing her running like a maniac
Riot setting up their own multiverse with multiple version of Zeri
run and gun btw
Giving me killua type shi
Hmm, I feel like I've seen this character before.... OH yeah! She was announced as a League champion just a day or two ago! This is a good looking skin for Zeri! :)
To be clear, in Project A, shooting matters. You don’t kill with abilities. Abilities create tactical opportunities to take the right shot. Characters have abilities that augment their gunplay, instead of fighting directly with their abilities.
Seeing her two flame walls, alongside vipers buffed wall, makes phoenix's wall even less and less useful
Nice 👍
Another character to fuck up the meta
Sage busts out the skates and slow orbs* (I win)
does it have the accuracy in shooting while running 😭
No cap best trailer so far
Neon  *"Ang Snatcher sa Quiapo"*
I know it's a stylistic choice but the framerate is killing my eyes.
So... Did LOL and Valorant gang up to make the same character for both of their games?
she is cute but i prefer mann
I can't wait to have a VALORANT animated series.
best Agent Trailer wıth 10 fps
APEX  hahaha
jogo nunca foi bom, mais pioraram
I guessed the exact abilities lmao
Jett 2.0 😍😍
Oh my god I can't wait for "Putang ina, the spike" and "huli kita bobo"
Main ko sya ☺️
Man! this charecter is gonna be op...like if you agree.
The most accurate thing Riot captured is that she's late and everyone's waiting for her. Truly a Filipino.
new league champ trailer.
YouTube: How many times you want to change the thumbnail? Valorant: Yes
This is the 4th time they change the thumbnail if you guys ever noticed or was it only me who did?
Now This is how you make a trailer !
WAFAFWAFWFAFWAFFFF
1:45 "kontrolado ko to" = "I control this" (Self morale) ( You can also add "can" but it has a different wording "kaya ko tong kontrolin= I can control this"   0:36" Hay Buhay" = "Haixxt Life" (She is annoyed at her life)  1:00 Picture of Aso (dog) and Bangka (boat) usually used by fisherman.  1:13 It's a basketball jersey (usually used in Liga "Little basketball competition in barangays") It has number 5 + The Filipino version of Philippines.  1:17 and 1:23 Pilipino loves to use brushes as a microphone when singing randomly especially when taking a shower.
her ult will be so useless... without the slide people will one tap her be4 she can do anything...
shes filipina?? 😳😳😳 NICEEEEEEEEEE
I love this
finger gun
is this the new champion in League of Legends ?
balanced
zarii
so no ones mentioning that shes zeri in blue?
how many times will they change the thumbnail
entry fraggers going to smash low-elo big time
A competition to VIPER
So this is Zeri yes?
The trailer has a nice story but the framerate was brutal. 12 fps isn't enough.
What does it translate to when she gets shot by the OP before reviving?
Why in the first 3 seconds we get a picture of her a__
taga tondo to. yawa
Hay buhay
Wait was phoenix sliding too?
Literally got chills watching this ugh
RNG is now legitimised by riot through spark🤣
Ive decided i am a neon main dont even have to play her to know
She looks like zeri’s sister
Nice. Isn't her wall just strictly powercreep to Phoenix though? XD
BRUH THIS IS LITERALLY ZERI BUT IN VALORANT! DO YOU GUYS EVEN KNOW HOW TO CREATE CHARACTERS???
When will you let valorsnt be 100% compatible with windows 11
OCTANE of VAlORANT
2:31 CCC
Why does sage sound so cold/serious and friendly at the same time. When she said “it looks beautiful”, it kinda felt like she was just trying to make her feel good instead of genuinely liking her room. Just me?   Ok
I guess they're releasing Zeri for League _and_ Valorant
STOP CHANGING THE THUMBNAIL!!!
AAAAAAAAAA THAT WAS SO AMAZING
Love the power creep with this character.
Its so cool he also speak tagalog tagalog
Sooo is she a Filipina Tracer?
How many times will you change the thumbnail
riot: lets make it green for our other game
So what happened to the precise gunplay?
Run and gun the agent
This agent really make for player who press "W" Very hard
More power to RNG 🔥🔥
so she's literally just valorant octane
Boooom looks like raze sister lol,waiting for her ❤️
Woah this Philippines shirt! 😍
slide ??? really??? first cod then fort and now u ?
Is it coincidence that this agent and League's new champion has similar power and skills? riot is messing with us *Edit : also same hairstyle
So valorant is in league confirmed cause thats just zeri
Zeri into the Zeriverse
Take hindi language in valo
This trailer alone is hype as f***  And I'm a couch casual noob lol but I want to play her now!
“Hay buhay…” is definitely a mood.
A FILIPINO AGENT? HELL YEAH
Hahaha sage with the plant
She can slide? riot nooo
Banner:Snatcher ng Pinas
a esos fps juego
Frostblade Irelia
interesting choice of weapon - still wont use the stinger
she do be fingering people tho
Her ult is just so cool
Zeri*
op
Zenitsu is taht you?
this just phoinex and jett mixed
Sa va pourrir le jeu un perso comme sa c comme chamber, sa va encore accélère le jeu, à la fin on pourra plus suivre
Riot: we need a new agent and champion this month.  Riot employee: why not just make one? They will never notice  Riot: your a fucking genius
Broooooo!!!!! Did he just speak Tagalog that's insane!!!!!!
So it's basically Flash or sth
She’s going to be op
Zeri twin
1:13 Pinoy?? TALAGA???? I barely play valorant at all but I like the game and I'm really excited :D
omg look it's zeri
The shoes on the bed tho 😅
Now i like to believe that this Neon girl is the Zeri of League of legends given how their kits are almost the same.
why is this in 10 fps
0:37   "hay Buhay"
Thankyou, Riot! Let's go PH!🇵🇭🔥
This is by far my favorite trailer. I love the design of this character and the trailer music was great. Cant believe they got Ylona Garcia from 88rising
ff di nakatsinelas, hanger, tapos videoke
so jett+phoenix+electro wizard? :")
noob game valo
when will she be in Valorant?
i dont think sage has a chance to win to a race vs neon
Is it just me or is she the spitting image of Caitlyn from Arcane?
Pog
Is that League-crossover thing?
Lightning hand guns look a little familiar to some character also in there company name.
Her and Zeri related🧐
Ilong pa lang pinay na pinay na
I like that after raising the wall it will reveal the enemy's nice 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️
riot, bro , this is the same thing as the lol champ
someone tell me why they’re entertaining and gun😭
guys I played a match with devs actually they were checking the bugs and they told that neon gonna be broken
why dose her and zeri (new lol champ) look so mush like other?
FPS -90
Agent rodriguez from Marvels Agents of shield made it  into Valorant.
Now that's a real hand gun you gotta hand it to riot for making such an  awesome agent give them a hand of applause folks XD
Music Industry: "let's make a young singer that is not popular inmesibly popular world wide in a month"  Riot: "hold my beer"
another jett
Finally Cypher didn't die first for the first time and its sova that dies first.
Are we gonna have Filipino neon?
looks like jett has a best friend
Controlado ko to hahaha
Imagine at the end instead of Sage asking to race her it was Jett or Raze… you know characters that can actually move quickly
Oh look it's blue zeri  Edit: I ended up liking Neon a lot, unlike Zeri where she ended up being kinda boring.
Reyna : Finally a worthy opponent.   If you know you know :)
HI Sonic !!!
me waiting for agent from SEA
Hay buhay :/
Wait here’s a theory: this character is literally the new champ from lol (Zeri), so is this a future version of her? Is the valorant story gonna link with the league universe in the future? 🤔
Pisteng Yawa ba Oiiii Ka Gwapa Ani niyaaa YAWAAAA Nawad an akong kinabuhi sa ka Gwapa niyaaa!!!? yawaaaaa
This trailer is epiiic!!! Omg, I really would like to know her story
There’s going to be a love triangle between Spark, Jett, and Phoenix and I love it
ZERI 2.0 League of Legend RITOOO Come on :p
Nice let's go more broken shit to deal with
Hi Zeri
HER HAIRRRR
SHE LOOK LIKE QUICK SILVER IN MARVEL
Bro she looks sick
Oh.. my.. gosh.. this is amazing, very much looking forward to it. Great job Riot Games
I knew it, she's filipina
Bonifacio!
Yooooooo Me and the Filipino community are proud to see a lot of our culture shown in the trailer, from the fishing boat to the "Walis" Filipino broom🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
hay buhay talaga

Turning this game to Overwatch and League at this point
Oh cool another duelist…. Meanwhile I have 1 legitimate smoke agent to play. Thanks Val.

Riot: Nerfs Run N Gun Also Riot: Creates an agent meant for Run N Gun       Goddammit RITO!!
They made a league champion literally the same as the valorant champion
LETS GO?! PHILIPINO VALORANT CHARACTER?!-
COD+Valorant be like
Time to run n gun more
Welcome back to RNG meta
Ahh the voice of sage is THE best in the game. No Cap
Trailer makes me think she's a run and gun character.
Well the song is of Ylona Garcia, but I suppose if even the character is also based on her face itself???!!!!
Hello Zeri
SAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!
So is Prod switching to neon?
SHES GONNA BE BESTIES WITH JETT IM SO EXCITED 😂😂💚
2:30
finally, a trailer for Sage too!   Neon, the one real-ally-in-real-time with Sage!
looks better than zeri
dog agent nuub rito
They weren't kidding when they said they copied and pasted for league of legends new summoner and valorent Lol.
"Valorant is not a run and gun" Neon: *slides and (probably) dashes through all the map*
I wonder if her CV too is a Filipina that would so awesome dude 😍❤️
LESSGO
And now League has Zeri !
That Omen with the Odin standing on boxes is too real
Wann kommt sie?
well she is my new main now
Hell yeah! I can't wait to play Zeri! I mean Neon...
RUN AND GUN!!! Hell yeeaaaahhhh
Shes a filipinaaaa wahhhh
10 second trailer. 7 seconds ass.  Riot knows how to get ppl hyped for new characters !
Love how the poster of Ylona Garcia is in the background in Neon's room, next to the bed
🤩
"Hay, buhay!" Waaaaah! NEON!
Kayo:cs go player Neon: cod player
Ayo Filipino players where u at? Is it just me or I heard her say "HAY BUHAY😴"
TANG INA WTF IS THIS? LOL
wow. i like agent

The moment people realise they just bringing out almost the same character in two of Riot's games. Riot hitting the bottom for me rn lmao.
FINALLYYYY
Philippines
Sonic was so cool they made him a girl and added him to Valorant
SHE SAID FILIPINO WORDS, LETS GOOOOO
Need a Momo Woods video Soon!!
Idk why but when i started the game i was interested about families like brim is the father of and others and dont you think she look like reyna with her lines on her body and what she wear like the gloves
Lidl fps
Am I going crazy or did they also put her in League of Legends...?
Valorant had to make her thicc
Is it just me or somehow I heard the character saying a Filipino word/catch phrase like, "Kontrolado ko 'to!" ("I can control it") 🤔🤔
LITERALLY SUPER PEOPLE X VALORANT WHAT IS THAT SUPER SLIDE LMAO
Did Valorant just add slide cancelling?
Damnnnn, good shit man!!
1:03 NOO CYPHER
bro wtf this isn't the new league champ?
zeri god
Alright hear me out...
aaaaaa "kontrolado ko to" is the best!!!!
I CANNOT WAIT BROOOOOOOOOOO NEON TRAILER IS SICK!
this char seems op, but i think i like the design
background song name pls
Ulimited POWERRRR !!!!
Are we all just gonna ignore the strange similarities between her and the new league of legends champion Zeri? Lol, who copied who first?!?
"Kontrolado ko to" daaaaaaaaamnnnn!
Pog
Love ylona 😘😘
I hope Zeri and Neon might be twin sisters in a multiverse. Valorant x League would be so cool.
The trailer is shitty but i'm excited to play this one
Zeri y Neon son literalmente la misma, el modelo 3d es el maldito mismo, e incluso las habilidades son parecidas, lo único que las diferencia es el color del pelo lol
So you gonna make valorant like overwatch and make neon can shoot from her finger ?? okaayyy
When is she gonna come outtttttt
Hay buhay 😑 Same Neon same
Im maining her directly
She speaking tagalog! She's  a Filipina girl. Filipinos we have been summoned
yoru: hi guys is my cousin , take care about her xd

1:04 Neon, 1. Jett, 0
Hype Hype! <3
rule34 artist need to busy now
shes not power crept its fine
Really love this agent i hope riot releases an indian agent soon
I can already see all the rule34 coming lmao
Zeri?
I like how agents are godly in their own trailers but dogwater in others
Aren't we being a bit overwatch that much?
Philippine representation.. Thank U so Much Valorant❤️
Wow spark and zeri (league of legends) has same powers and almost released the same time
Another waifu thanks roit 😂
Can we get a tv show purely based around valorant please! I know arcane was league of legends based but I would love to see one for valo!
Oh dan
Excellent
I LOVE it
What?! The New Agent is Using Spark (Lightning)? But, league of Legends do have a New Champion/Character. Which is Uses the Same Element, "Lightning". (Coincidence?)  And Wait.. Pinoy Dub? Pinoy yung bagong Agent? Or Dub lang?... Anyway... Let's Goooooo!!!!!
so she's basically electro wizard...
bruhy, this is sick
excited for neon  WE need AN Animated series for valorant
great another seraphine
Mommy Sage always there for the newcomers
A ito ba dahilan bat walang kuryente sa visayas for 2-3 weeks now?
Zeri?

Thanks to add some Pikachu in game
Rush B my friend, no stop!
Riot, has lots of complaints about run and gun, also riot, releases a LITERAL run and gun character, nice
Riot doing what riot does. Running out of ideas and making Jett 2.0
New York Knicks 🥰🥰🥰
buena copia de pikachu pogggggg
It's just change valorant to overwatch
SHE IS FILIPINO IM FILIPINO
Anybody else notice that they've changed the thumbnail like 4 times
This game gets better everyday 💯
1:21 NEW CHARACTER : PROTPHET MOSES
Electric Jett nice
neon = rushing = me
The first agent that have a theme song
95% will go incognito after seeing this
Pls tell what is the new map
Dude the fps lags, the chill music, paired with her chilling to the music in bed. It's such a spider-verse vibe
Pilipinas jersey 🥰🥰
No please NOOOOOOO
Seems entertaining.
1:48 the sage teammate we all want but never get
That songs slaps hard and finally I got an excuse for run and gun
Incoming Neon Instalock Bottom Frag
bisa ajah riot, ngeluarin agen sama campion lol bareu yang sekillnya sama.  I like this
Precise gunplay
man i really wish this game wasnt a tactical snoozer. looks so cool but i just cant with the boring CS cloned gameplay
Nice Tracer
zeri ?:)?
Spark and Zeri, same character diferent universe. Multiverse of Riot?
Another duelist probably

Duelist 100%
Riot trying to make Stinger look good by using aimbot in their videos lmao

JUST REALIZED SHE FILIPINO 🐱
Best character trailer so far. "Entertain Me" was perfect for this.
Its the most craziest shit i have ever seen in valorant
VALORANT HAS BEN UPDATE
Glad to see yung walis ni nanay nandun sa gilid :)
Nothing like asset flipping yourself eh riot, maybe bring kogmaw in valorant as well when you are at it, 1:1
I think she's filipino because of the pilipinas jersey in the background  Smart choice riot, now you have baited so much fish to play the game now 😂😂😂
zeri is a nice champ!
Woah. Cool trailer. Laser lightning wow
Angas pre mukhang magiging main HAHAHAHAH
Is she related to Zeri ? or is Riot like, fukk it we will make the same character for both our games ?
Phoenix X Jett = Neon
Wait, Like Zeri in LoL, waw... That's awesome
At 0:38 did she say oh bhai
She sounds cringey😖😖😖
noiceeeeeeeeeeeee she is also filipino like me, im so  exited when we get to play her
Was that a double Phoenix wall?? Rip flame kid.
FILIPINOS REPRESENT
Philippines WOOOOW🥳
i think she have the most powerful ult
nerf miner
Cringe
Am I the only one who thinks she looks like if project melody dressed up like a skater?
Wellcome to Apex Legends! Sprint, slide, ziplines. What's next shield batteries?
It's ironic Neon is a Filipina agent with electric powers meanwhile in the Philippines always having blackouts
sheeeeeesh
She,s beautiful i cant wait
RIOT sure likes thic xd
Time to main stinger
Aceu is typing...
This game so trash and y the animation look like it’s 2fps
Uh, was this done by the same team over at LoL?
Let's go where my Filipinos at mabuhay
a character that mixes apex and CoD?
Im on my 5th rewatch... Is it healthy ?
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Philippine Valorant players is so proud of our country because there is a Filipino Agent now in Valorant  Thank you Riot Games
If she dont yell punyeta at least once i'll be so disappointed
Wait   zeri and neon are same¿
So good!
daym
I'd hit.
Seems to me like she would be a perfect nemesis of Jett
Cypher died in this trailer too at 1:02 like in every trailer
Built like zevi-
getting worse
Meralllcoooo
Riot 2020: "We're trying to reduce the amount of running and gunning" "Abilities don't kill"  Riot 2022: "Screw it"
She looks very similar to Zeri, the new champion in league.
did they just copy paste the character design ?????
Watched this trailer more than once 😀
they say sage is still trying to race neon but keeps loseing...
I was thinking....   Is she? Is she is filipino? I just heard some filipino words in 1:40
This is such a good video and I was here thinking die for you was there limit !
0:53 me omw installing valorant again
Leaked..
Octane?
Valorant: can I copy your homework?  LoL: SURE!!!  🇵🇭
Zeri?😂
Tagalog translations:  0:37 Hay, buhay. (Oh, life.) 1:43 Kontrolado ko 'to! (I am in control of this!)
cant wait for the new agent ......
Bruh are they using Zeri's model, its literally a cameo
Damn this is a nice champion spotlight for zeri.
I dont give a s*** about the agnet, just give me the song
they spelled Filipina wrong
Hell yeah! Here goes full speed brrrt! On your face and booyah! Your dead.  Bbye for turtle players haha...slow players will rant and blast Riot to nerf her haha...
LESS GOOOOWW
UUF7TFUUFYDYD
"hay buhay"! Hahahaha
i think she is filipina because she said Philippine word
Lets go speedhacks xD
so Zeri and Neon are basically the same
When she will release?
new fortnite ability knee dash haha thank me later
I really hate players who run while shooting
so cool
Purple Zeri
kinda surprised cause of the name cause literally my irl name and + i'm a filipino xd
Neon THICC we got another thicc agent XD
Neon 🤝 Sage Philippines 🤝 China
Riot: sees people Ferrari peeking as a problem Also Riot: adds a new agent made for Lightning peeking
WHEN....??!?!?!??!
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life4
The true art of run and gun
Neon,pride of pinoy!!
Gonna be to much op nerf this before its gettings out
Would be cool to see some jett v neon interactions in game on "who's faster"
sheshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
So you're telling me that her trailer being released the same moment Zeri's trailer got released is a coincidence...?
Tracer's bri'ish
pretty sick trailer, id say!  i also like how it shows all different translation at the end.
there is a flash in dc there is a quicksilver in marvel theres a neon in riot game
Im getting arcane vibes from this trailer and I LOVE ITTT
this is so cool
Sage sooo cute "race u there?"
I want an INDIAN 🇮🇳  one too ✌️
Precise Gunplay...
i am not just a Healer 😂😂😂😂
im fast asf boiiii...
No one fucking says "kontrolado ko 'to" lol
The run and gun
her ultimate ability looks so funny 😂
This low frame rate animation looks fantastic, reminds me of Into the Spider-verse
PILIPINAS MAGINGAY! 🔥🔥🔥
Reduce reuse recycle
Zeri?
Peeggnooyyyy priudeee!!!
“Precise Gunplay”
Hay Buhay baka pilipina yan
Dibs on maining her
I don't think her Ult is gonna be that op at all... seems like you have to be in close quarter to use it or you'll miss the shots, feels like playing with spectre but with higher precision
Jinx?
zeri
2:21 If you see the poster at the back, that's ylona garcia... ... CANON
what a run  n gun.....like this game
I have to pause and check if I clicked on an fanmade video when I heard the character talked in Filipino XD
My internet got really crappy recently, I can't play valorant anymore :(
Release the Valorant webseries at this point guys. Common how much are you going to make us love you already 💕
Back to back electric champion and an agent in league and val ok!  but why did they have to basically say "If you're a phoenix main... good luck"
When is she coming out
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
i hope the mini voice lines is not tagalog that would be hella scary
wait is that Zeri from Zaun ?
I can't tell if her abilities are overpowered or underpowered but I'm excited to find out
Zeri and Neon two very original character's who are not copied and pasted from each-other who are not broken Good job RIOT👍  200 years
that smoke path should be an ult
Bonecão para patinar viu
"Raised in a large working-class family, Zeri grew up surrounded by warmth, care, and many strong opinions. They were no strangers to hardship, having lost —"...oh sorry...wrong video...
AMAZING SHE CAN USE 2 WALL
hm..nice agent
Riot pls change the opening KAYO wallpaper screen...its been long since that character was launched...the new one can be in this new color that we see in he end
When y'all gonna give us an Indian agent?
And i want her to be salty at Jett
YO THIS IS SICK!!!!!!!!
She has a double wall wtf
Jett little sister?
Minecraft better
electro from the amazing spiderman?
New main
Never played Valorant before but this is   cool af!
cool snipe
shes from where tasnee magbag is from
filipino
Dekalidad talaga pag tatak pinoy HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
great sliding should note it
cute dog xx
Bakit may dala siyang walis tambo sa maleta? 🤣
1:22 noob omen camper and spammer
Who's here 2022
Does this not look like octane?!!
Just the new league adc with blue hair
It's an overwatch agent crossover
found my new main
Can someone explain what is she sayng at 1:43? I suppose is filippino words, right?
I m starting to ship Neon and Sage from now on. Because, clearly, Neon has a crush on Sage
lets take a minute to thank that sage
Filipino representation nice!!!! We need more of these!!!
Singer name is Ylona Garcia, music is Entertain Me. Also Neon put some posters of her in her room. It's a nice touch from Riot to her to put feedback of her on the video itself.
edi lupet
wtf valorant ban me  tf third party software
Time to make another new account to unlock it
0:40 When she was on the bed gave me spiderman into the spider verse vibes with the music in the background.
"In-game purchases"  ...good day, sir.
Zeri from the future
riot was so lazy they made one new model for 2 different games and call it a day lmao
ONE OF THE BEST TRAILERS SO FAR I SWEAR
Finally valorant embracing the Running gunning part of the game. If u can't defeat them, be their allies. (Definitely not how the saying goes)
മിന്നൽ മുരളി ♥️
내챔
I just realized this girl is filipino like me. I was amazed cause the filipinos are not that famous around the world.
finaly a flipino agent i think
new main
After Neon release Jett mains to jett : *i don't even know who you are.*
does phoenix an african then?
great video. But am I the only one that feels the video is lagging? Like it's 12 FPS or something??
But can she be faster than Jett?
Best Valo Trailer so far. Perfectly balanced with the song...
Ang bagong ahente ay isang Pilipina? Ipakita ang kagandahan ng kababaihan at kulturang pilipino! Gustong-gustong makakita ng mga tradisyonal na kasuotan para sa mga balat sa hinaharap :)))
Oh shiittt My Beautiful Neon ☺️♥️
Hello, I have something important to tell you:  The bible makes it clear that God is holy. This holy God holds a perfect moral standard. Sadly, we have all fallen very short of that standard(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin/imperfection is Hell(Revelation 21:8)  Thankfully the bible also says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent His perfect Son to die on a cross to save us from our sin. You and I broke God's law, but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death! (John 3:16-18)   "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8)    “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” (Romans 10:9-10)
ayo thats the short circuit from tf2 kekw
Hai buhay-Neon
Every detail is so nice, Good job. Congratulations Riot, on the other side please fix that running and gunning. I hope Neon's skills dont tilt due to running and gunning
wow zeri looks great
Let’s see this guy if he’s funny
Fits valorant way better than league
Is this agent going to turn valorant into CoD
Soooo octane?
op
Outra idéia ,um agente que cria ilusão ou imagens de si mesmo ,como se fosse o renascer do phinix  ou o teleporte do youru, mais que tal personagem podesse ir    onde está sua miragem ou voltasse se receber algum dano.Another idea, an agent that creates illusion or images of itself, as if it were the rebirth of the phinix or the teleportation of youru, more that such a character could go where his mirage is or come back if he
Bout time the Philippines Get Some Recognition.
They look EXACTLY THE SAME.
When you reales Yoru changes?
oh lord why just why... this game is about skill not 0 skill bullshit... seriously oh look Symmetra in now in valorant fucking riot are so brain dead its mind blowing....
Wait a second, why are the new League and Valorant Champion and Agent looking the same 😂😂😂
I introduce all Sony channels on my channel
the fact she is so cute!!!!!!!!!!😊
She's Filipino? And why does she looks zeri in league of legends? Riot must be playing dirty 👹
Im so proud that "Đột Phá" from my homecountry We Vietnamese promise to bring a healthy and desireful Valorant community to the game From VN with love❤❤❤
Whoa, cool character and music! Might have to wear a grounding suit around her though. I might have to check this game out.
Una locura pero como q esta muy buffeada
The fug? Why is she broken...and thicc at the same time
release when?
Zeri looks like a fun champion. Why is Sage in League tho
Just tondo things
I just realized that she is more balanced than I thought. When she sprints it's more of a Apex Legends thing, that you don't have a gun in hand when sprinting. But sprinting yeah kinda OP but aim spread a thing and accuracy so maybe not too OP.
Lv you neon❤️
she just makes Phoenix useless...
Literal es una fusion de jett,phoenix el del arco etc
Zeri
They adding Zeri to Valorant
An idea for a new character, skill with plants, imagine a barrier of leaves, roses or flowers exploding like a grenade, an ult that is a flower or leaf that shoots like a bazooka,
Karmaşa, kurbanın olurum.
Zeri copy
Why is the framerate so weird? its like the video is laggy or claymation
VRAI TRAILER PTN
BACKGROUND'S DOPE THO.......BEST TRAILER FOR A CHARACTER......
Can we get an Indian agent any time soon....it would be soo cool!
SHES SO PRETTTYYYYY
I kinda feel unfair for the other agents lol. Looking forward to play with this agent.
GAME FEELS SLOW? INJECT MORE JETT+KPOP+TRACER GAME GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
At last, they finally added a Filipina character to the game. I hope we will see other agents resembling their country.
she faster then jett lol.
Filipino here and let me just say... This just gave a whole new meaning to run and gun... Poor riot I'm guessing they will patching smg this time around
We already have spectre now you add run n gun agent? Cmon..
one  more waifu hehe
Lesssgooooo
1:13
está chiquita
PROD gonna have a field day with this agent
im absolutely in love with her
So beautiful Zeri
this agent is fireeeeeeeeeee
Jett: finaly a worthy opponent */ smurk
1:20 ABSOLUTE CHILLS🤩
so nice trailer guys! I love it
20 fps, in FPS!
If Apex Legends was a person (This is a joke. Clarifying cuz I can already see some if y'all pissing your pants over this.)
😍
It's literally Zeri or vice versa either way Riots creative design is going down hill fast. What a joke lol
hm i wish i can play with a 100+ fps
“Hayyy buhay” HAHAHHA LETSGO
i think we are not playin csgo now it feels like overwatch now with this agent
Wow, that was horrible.
"KONTROLADO KO'TO" OMG💗
R34 will have a field day with this!
DEADDDDD ECITEDDDDDDSFDSF
buff omen 👀👀
yep thats zeri but blue
oh shit filipino agent les gooooooooooo
The "kotrolado ko to" part is kinda awkward, like its been google translated
Im gonna uninstall the game.
awesome trailer!
how csn i update vslorant?
Zuri the new LOL character having similar looks and electricity based abilities.... "Now that's just lazy writing"
new thocc agent
That Sage Wall to block Raze's ult was dope asf.
Bruh have not anyone notice she speaks FILIPINO MANNN!! MY GHOD MY INNER PATRIOTIC SELF IS LEAKING OUTT!!! MABUHAY!!
My new main
Neon: Can sprint and slide, and even has Lightning Gun Sova: SHAKT DART
Then: "they could've use guns instead of magic" -harry potter Now: "They could've use their powers instead of guns" -valorant
YEAH BOIIIIIIIIIIII
i am gonna be neon main
Imagine making the same character twice
Perfect definition of Run & Gun
Tracer.
Isn't this just zeri from lol
That's is I'm playing Valorant again
She seems like she's the agent most people need ,especially for montages.Or an agent players like me would main.
Life is hard, i think I will break up with Jett
Yoru , Phoenix, Astra 2.0
No. Who it's gerl? Realy. No one dont see  ? Well. I hope i mistake. But. Crosover cherekter... it,s can be so nice. Sorry for mistakes. I not such good know lenguij.
plz more fps next time, nice trailer
Anyone else getting jinx vibes?
Ok but like. The only thing I'm hyped about is that she's Filipino.
I feel like sova and neon will be a good duo. Sova revealing an area, neon shoots all the enemy through the double wall.
Lol new role
Well hello zeri from league of legends
P R E C I S E   G U N P L A Y
Cool!!
so riot releasing 2 static type character at the same time in different game.  In lol Zery and in valorant Neon.😹
slowest snatcher of Quiapo
Why was this soooo coool
Epic
Amazing
2:05 so cuteeeeee
when?
Skills don't do damage anyways
hay buhay kontrolado ko to tssk...
I dont play Valorant, but this is good. Cool and funky music.
well, this is how this games starts to die, it was a decent ride everyone
Guys I finally know how to counter NEON completely. Just use KAY/O and no more NEON running around with some stupid walls and lightning.
*neon ults "Kontrolado ko to"
Wooowww
Judge and shorty users be like: so anyway, i started blasting
Pls add an agent from india
she is sooooooooooooo cool
peenoy fried!
Omg layserrrrrrrr!? Lets gooooo
Sheesh!!!
yung walis tambo 😂
You want run and gun? You've got it! With the brand new Quake Lightning gun u have no issues running and gunning people down :)
this is super similar to the new league champ design-wise.....riot be double dipping into the idea pool
Please stop releasing agents like it's league of legends, more maps over bloating of agents, thank you.
They are going to nerf the shit out of her lol
nerf neon
低ランク帯終わるだろこんなんｗ
Haven't played since the last 3 characters, it's insane how many new agents are coming in
1:01 We have an agent for Cod players which is weird
So.. Zeus daughter finally showed up..
Valorant is getting closer to COD
What is she saying at 1:40
AGEN SEON NIH BOSS
I wanna do specter  run and gun with this agent😭
Whats the most Valorant's youtube work, Change the thumbnail everyday until it fits it bruh, not even 1% missmatch, always 100% match of everything, IF U CAN DO THIS THEN WHY CANT YOU FIX THE BUGS OF THE GAME.....
this looks op
sana nagtatagalog din pagnakapatay b*b* mo para pinoy tlga
They didn't kill cypher in this one
i love it
jett rebibe mi jett
Zeri with blue hair :O
That walis tambo sa gilid made me want to play this game. Agaaaaane.
Looks like jet is gonna loose her job
It's kind of sad, and discouraging to release two upcoming characters for 2 different game of yours, both shooting lightning out of their hands. Oh well.
Neon and Bilis are completely different agent? I'm confused. I thought we got 'Bilis' the next agent.
Ngl, the "Kontrolado ko toh" sounded like a line from a bad GMA show
LoL: Zeri Valorant: Neon  ok? ok.
me who haven't unlocked kayo yet..
Omen spammer 😄
sad the last thing was not in hindi
SHEEEEEESH!!!
Ah yes.. run and gun agent
Must be a slow day at Riot. Someone changed the thumbnail of this video at least 4 times.  EDIT: 5 times now. Someone must be really bored at the office...
Overproud pinoy labas
Why the fuck does cypher always die.
Mouse sen after update: x10 times V:
MY GODDDD
YO THATS LIKE A COMBANATION OF JETT AND PHOINEX YEY!
oh no jett clone 2.0
So this waifu is a meralco girl
ZERIIII
Valorant Zeri is going to get me to start playing valorant again.
Zeri :)???
Love how they captured the filipino urge to sing whenever and however lol
haha Sage is now the Grandmother
I like how my family look with a despizing gaze to people from the Philippines and now there's a Philippine voice actor doing this kind of work. Well done. It proves my family wrong.
so Neon is basically an asian? Philippines?
anyone know when shes gonna get released?
Mga pilipino mag ingay!!!!!!!
I thought music was Alessia Cara - I’m Yours
🔥🔥
BOOOOOOOYYYy
So she is like phoenix, brimstone, reyna and chamber with speed... cool
Okay so her and Zeri are sisters, yeah!? Riot releasing same but different champs in their titles now? hmmm
Pinoy na pinoy, may walis tambo.
i love the new coluor valorant
I'm gonna main her
wow nice agent
Fianlly Got An Agent To Main
Finally. Some movement
finally i can push quickly
Aww. The double wall looks like some waves in a sea. So cool😍
yoowww
if valorant didn't look like an incomplete game I would actually be tempted to play it.
NEON IS BASICALLY ZERI LOOOOOOOOOOL
Isn't she a champion of LoL ? I'm confused now.
Neon users 📈📈 shotgunner users 📈📈
the run and gun agent
you can tell riot gets lazy when they release the same character design for league and valorant same day lmfao
I've been watching this over and over again and I've been noticing that Riot keeps changing the thumbnail of the video lmao.  From the Reveal character art to her ulting at the end of the video to her now lying down on her bed.  The reasoning for them changing it is by refreshing the audience with something new to look at. When you see something new, I'll click on it immediately. In this case, I don't mind it as much cause I know what video this is and I'm still enjoying every bit of it!
So basically octane for valorant
The "kontrolado ko to" at 1:42 🤩. Welcome to valorant NEON!!!
What i saw Ability 1: sprint, go into a mode wher you can sprint and move faster than normal, can also slide and i think i saw a small shift/dash might be the slide again idk   Ability 2: double wall, throw 2 walls in a foward direction, kinda like phoenixs wall, creating a tunnel to go through   Ability 3: bouncing stun, throw a  orb that will bounce off of walls like yorus flash, it will then drop like a sage orb and stun anyone near the explosion   Ability 4: zap fingers, fingers go brrrrrrrrr    I explain stuff very dumb, as shown here^
I have schoolmate she’s a girl and she sounds like neon
Me : **Sees description** MY brain : "I know what you about to say, don't you dare say it!!" Me : ... My brain : "No.." Me : ... Me : "PUTANG INA, SI NEO-..." MY brain "NOOOOOOO!!!"
Gago snatcher lang to sa Quiapo, ngayon agent na dafuq 😂😂😂
I thought she Zeri for a second there 😅
She is op
My apex gaming sense is tingling
I love it, but I cant be the only one to see the similarities with Neon and the new champ in league
She has a trace rifle….
SHES PRETRYYAHDHS
League: Can I yoink this homework  Valo: Sure I guess
as a sova main, gotta find a way to tame her. speed is one of the archenemies of the hunters.
run n sliding Pog
Am I the only one who thinks riot added the flash female version
Jett 2.0 xD
ty riot
An agent made for PR0D
seems over powered
This character is literally everything everyone hates most about the game. "Hey everyone dislikes Jett and we can't balance her properly and everyone despises her movement, lets do it again" like good luck riot... god knows your gonna need it balancing this one.... The trailer and design is cool but from a gameplay perspective this seems like a disaster waiting to happen. I wish YT still had dislikes so we could see what people really think
Sheeesh
Marvel fans playing valo be like ‘dream come true bitch’
Not that much cool lets see what they got this time every time they hiped it always disappointed me
she is so cool i think i have just found my main
Godly song choice... I'm making my return to playing Valorant 😍😍😍
one of the coolest agent in valorant
Tactical shooter character xd
Couldn't be a worse agent for Comp. That ultimate was just so well thought out like lets just give someone an ult that is basically an smg with full accuracy while running
I mean if that ain't zeri...
Idk man but the V acting cringes me
I hope that double fire lane move isn't basically twice of Pheonix's move. That part I don't really get. Other than that, I hope Valorant comes to mobile soon so I can play as the agent that represents my country.
controlado koto?
I only come to the trailers to watch cypher die :)
The song is ass but cool character
Hay buhay!
New Waifu
dumb agent again
OCTANE sister!
glad im a csgo chad
this new zaunite champion looks insane! Oh wait..
Ultimate: "Putang ina!"  People: si optimum pride
So um spectre run n gunning vibes here anyone?
sheesh looks like I need to play Valorant again.
new duelist?
So its a duelists are sentinels ??
Valorant... now Mongolian agent???
FINALLY A FILIPINO AGENT!!!!!!!!! BEEN WAITING FOR ONE! but i am still a fan of keo though :D
ARE......ARE WE BEING SUMMONED?????? kung alam mona, a l a m  m o n a *wink wink*
SHEESH
Chinese Sage tapos Pinoy Neon. Magkakasundo?
dope bro dope !!!! i loved this and chamber's reveal vid ((especially the music xd ))
Can she said PUTANG INA?
Lessssgooooooo pilipinos proud to be pilipino
YEAH BOI!!!!!!
For anyone wondering  At 1:39 she is saying i can control  it in tagalog
Riot games is out of ideas. Releases the same champion/agent in both valorant and league of legends at the same time.
NEON IS FILIPINO LOOK BEHIND HER  1:13
Honor sage, she saved her life twice
the name should be KIDLAT... Sounds cool and literally the meaning of lightning in TAGALOg.
*NERF BEFORE SHE EVEN GETS IN THE GAME*
Riot be like. Just release the same character design for both league & valorant. Just change the hair 1 green and 1 blue
what in the reyna jett pheonix is this
Zeri's sister?
korean jett will fold her in a second
wts zeri and irelia doin here
in 1:45 my neck crawls whenever I play it
Wait shes Filipino??
Zeri: Hey can I copy your homework? Neon: Sure but make it different so no one can realize. The homework:
She's filipino too, that's cool!
ANOTHER minority lmao val is really pushing the buck on this one it's crazy
finally an agent for my ideal playstyle: Rush A when my team is B
Roit bring neon but Yoru crying in corner saying where is my buff 😭😭
Inspired by Philippines yeh
Shes filo so she should be op
Wow such a beautiful trailer and a beautiful agent!!
No one :  Neon and Zeri : AAYYY
where is hindi
Well i need that slide
No dislikes must be good
Zerriiii and neonn!!
waiting for an Indian agent
how games contribute to valorant apex legends: valorant agents copy apex legends legends csgo: the spike  valorant: it’s own lore and other ideas
Zeri is Neon.
you sure we aren't playing overwatch?
NEON is a pilipino.. hahahhaha..
Neon + spectre + run&gun = GG's
ultimate no aim
Wait... so she's literally Zeri? i'm so confused.
that double fire wall its beat phoenix haha...
bahaha
So cool
So cool
run and spray
correr y disparar el juego
PLEASE make this your staple agent release style. The soundtrack, the animation, the FULL personality Is IMMACULATE. By far the best character launch I have seen in a game in all of my years of gaming! Keep it up! 💕
can we have anit phoenix with ice power someone  from  Greenland  agent someone very cold
ooo sheis my type :)
The coolest skills in valorant
riot makes a rush b character lol  nice one riot
Yes yes......  Now when filipino voice lines?
Neon and zeri are like skins to each other haha
5 abilities?😂
Ok this wasn't a joke, it's literally the same character than zeri Xd
The song is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Filipino agent????
Knaifu 2?
Want a Valorant Movie.....
On my channel you will find the sounds of nature, they will help you relax and sleep
She soo thicc😍
woah
YESSIR
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yessssss
Proper representation. 🇵🇭 Unlike **cough cough** Soul Calibur's Talim, Tekken's Josie Rizal, and Halo's Nicole-458,
shotgun sage users: finally, a worthy opponent. our battle will be legendary!
song entertain me
Uhh is it just me seeing this cause the hair just reminds me of Sonic
mala su wea
anyone got translation for what she says?
ну хз.. как всегда них.. не понятно
"Hay buhay" 👁👄👁
Well I don't like FPS games but for her I would play Valorant. The marketing got me so baddddd kudos to the team
Sinatraa's movement+neon :)
Neon trailer is like a sicker one
Hi overwatch
Welp the spectres buffed lol
She'll work great on dodging the boombot
Pilipina agent less goooo
Nice. I Filipino agent, she said "ay, buhay" which means "ay, life"
fun fact: Filipinos love karaoke
@VALORANT  i hope u made malaysian agent next
Loved how they made her say '' ay Buhay '' it means ugh life as a Pilipino I really liked how they made her say that and it really shows that Riot didn't just make a Filipino agent but made her language from her country Language and I really approve their efforts into making these kinds of small details
I gotta give it to Riot. They are great at their cinematics
Rule 34 artists: Here we go baby!!!
Before: Autolock Jett Now: ......
OOHHH YESSS A MOBILITY AGENT
Finally a Filipina character in Valorant 😮😮💨💨
Zeri of valorant, they are similar in everything even the powers!
Reminds me of Jinx
Yes confirm neon and zeri are philippine characters
Jett 2.0
Snatcher vibes❤️
Next time agent indonesia, use rich brian or niki
peak level of tactical shooting game
Damn, cannot way to play Killua.
Riot KINDA OWNED WITH THIS ONE SHIT BRO
Meganon!, Hay buhay
Oh fk seems like i cant play this agent with my intregrated uhd intel gpu laptop fk.. RIP
I don't fear anything except run and gun operator 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hindi?
low fps video great
Zeri of League? Good job Riot
It's not stealing if you steal from yourself
when its coming ?
yup, im maining her
pinoys represent 💪
FINALLY, SOMEONE I CAN FINALLY MAIN. MABUHAY INDEED.
LET'S GO PHILIPPINES 🇵🇭 THANKS RIOT! THANKS VALO TEAM FOR GIVING US A FILIPINO PLAYABLE CHARACTER! 💯
is this a new call of duty trailer?
If she hang out with Jett, we'd get a lightning storm
she is overpowered holy
Neon is from Philippines
sage really just asked if she wanted to race neon
YO MAMA NEON IS HERE
I have watched this for the 5th time so far.
kamoka neya se yluna
Sage: race you there  Neon: yea lol  Sage: Wall Raised
Everyone talking about Neon but that god wall from the sage tho saved Neon from Raze Ult. XD
SHE BETTER SAY "REBIBE ME, JETT!!"
Zeri League of Legends :) / Neon Valorant :) alright :)
Woooh pinoy prideeee!
when she is coming out..?
I wish of that agent speak Tagalog
Hmmm i wonder if they will add a walis tingting as a melee weapon
whem we will be able to play with this agent..?
Is ah Filipina agent  let's go pH 🎉🎉🎉
Snatcher talaga e HAHAHAH
That’s what you call finger guns
YALL HEARD THAT MY FELLOW FILIPINOS? “hay buhay”
when is it released?
NEON COOL
the song 🔥🤌🏼
the videos has more views than subscribers
Wtf, this character looks like Zeri, So, Riot just changed his hair color he?
Can we get rock benders and water benders next we have wind and fire so
like yoru when she running
Yo is this valorant or overwatch
Interesting agent ⚡ with amazing background music
Im exited yo!! !!!
A new valo agent related to electricity and a new league champ related to electricity? Coincidence? Seems not
One of the best character trailers I've ever seen, the music really made it!
NO WAY MY NAME IN VALORANT IS XDNEON
Omg she looks so cool definitely going to unlock her
Op
Sage nerfed in front of her lol😂😂
Ay buhay😂😂
omyomyy
neon is filipino wtf its cool
Omg this new agent is really funny and cool i wanna play with this agent
GG END
OH NO, RUN AND GUNNNNNNNN
Came for agent stayed for music
it seems Valorant adding More agent from asia
Definitely giving me Tera from teen titans vibes. Shy but looks like she has something to hide? Attitude and looking like she thinks she doesn’t belong? Trouble controlling her power?  I’m all for it 😩
She was a Filipino agent! and what she said in 0:38 "Hay buhay..." was a common sigh in Philippines.
IM EXCITED! a Pinay agent would be so cool!
Looking Forward
So did riot just made another neon in league
And then she will be abused and nerfed after few days of her release, sadly
i am about to slide cancel around the map
Suuuuiiiii
Wtf
Ok, but why does she have looks and abilities similar to Zeri from League?
The run and gun play is going to be insane 🤣🔥
this looks like a whole anime awakening ...  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE FOUND MY NEW MAIN
Lesgooo
Did she just speak filipino?
Lesgooooo cod baby
please tell me i'm not the only one who sees the similarities between Neon and Zeri (the new league champion)?
she looks so pretty at 2:03
Run and Gun Intensifies
It will forever blow my mind that she's a Filipino character. I think this might be the first one in any video game ever too.
Lol a Filipino Character that's money!
Zeri, is that you???
Hay buhay!
I love how Riot is so creatively bankrupt that the new league champ and the new valorant agent look identical. It’s literally just a palate swap.
Once again Riot put more work and passion in Valorant than in League
This agent is like a raze style but jett skills yk she looks just hype like raze
There is no way, valorant really catering to the apex players, I can’t wait to play her
oh my gosh!! she's Filipino! that is so cuteee, proud Filipino here ;))
This video made me cry 🥲😭
Neon and Zeri (League of legends) really looks almost the same. 🤔🤔
kontrolado ko 'to!!!
we can just talk about how the music goes so well and tells her personality abit 😭❤️
why doesn't her waist moves at all like could u fix that it looks weird.
COD & Apex veteran : our time has come 😂
Finally,Riot doing making something that made the run and gun nerf pointless.
Can you make episode 4 animation please
when indonesian aggent?
COVID 19 IS ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED FOR ECONOMIC RESET.  SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR CURENCY YOUR FAMILIAR. GOING DIGITAL CURRENCY. THIS IS BIBLE PROPHECY IN THE MAKING. SEEK JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR HEART.
Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ to be saved from hell
Cypher is killed again
This is for sure Zeri from LOL
Hi Zeri
wow zeris gay sister
Goosebumps
Krinj
When she said "Hay Buhay" hahahah so lame
is she y'know
Hype
Emperor palpatine?
What so ever agent may come ... but jett will be jett and she will dominate in the score board .... it is the truth ... jett is still be a waifu
Person: How many times did you watch this? Me: yes
ok...Filipinos agent....finaly we have represent from south east asia
oh my GOD IM SCREAMING SHES SO COOL IM SO EXCITED AHHH
is she filipino?
Is Neon and Zeri from LoL the same thing
Why does Valorant like characters that can make walls???

So Riot games are releasing both new characters with “lightning” abilities. Zeri from League and Neon for Valorant. The fact that they both look quite similar is either lazy writing from Riot or a big story coming in the future.
Cant wait for people to get raged by this agent.
She's like Apex's octane for valorant
NEON: "Hay Buhay"
valorant never dissappoints
Nc
LESSGOO FILIPINO CHARACTER
Jett will be forgotten
Valorant: Neon - Spark League of Legends: Zeri - Spark of Zaun   Coincidence? I think not..
I think I found my new main
You guys released 2 chicks with the same hairstyle, voice actor, and electric powers that make them go faster in league and valorant at the same time, this company is in shambles
It's the "hay buhay" HAHAHA
Zeri
I love that Neon has a picture of her dog AAAAAAA
When is mobile VALORANT coming
tangina lets go
Im so gay
0:13 😳
what class is this agent btw?
animation looks so janky
valorant i did not do anything
Crazy wall
The words its filipino 😳 cool
Wait I thought this was the new league champ Zeri
Zamn
I don't think Ill ever understand Valorant. It's cool to have realistic weapons in a fantasy shooter/world but anyone who plays this for the CS like tactics and saying it's similar at this point must be on some heavy drugs.
this game is so dead lmaoooooo please tell me how you are going to add an agent that can sprint and slide in a tactical shooter  edit: I was being sarcastic by saying this game is dead, I know the community is getting bigger but adding an agent like this to a tac shooter is stupid
crasy ajent
Waiting
Breedable
KAY/O: yes
Its the singing with a toothbrush that caught me. HAHAHAHA Filipinos love to sing in karaoke maybe that is why this trailer involves Neon singing cause it is soooo Filipino ~~
The way everything about this is just so Filipino 😭
Mommy? i mean
I can see prod trolling with her...
Y'all be changing thumbnails a lot huh
nag Tagalog sya
Hey valorant can you put rgx 11z pro vandal on my shop
New weapon, WALIS TAMBO! XD
Lezgoo ill stop using reyna lezgo with new duelistttt
So this is the same character as the league girl... huh?
ZERIII
just came from leauges new champion trailer zeri. They litterally are the same chracter but one has a gun and their hair colors different. THEY BOTH HAVE THE PIGTAILS TOO.
Rule 34 artists faster than the speed of light or her
another cypher has fallen today.
PINOY PRIDE MGA KAPATID!!!!
she looks cool
So... it's Zeri but with another skin.
PHILIPPINE REPRESENTATIVE !! 🤘💙
optimum pride... dazo?
i wlll be the best neon in the game
This is a idea taken fromo the protoganist in the first light game
AYO I CALLED THE DOUBLE PHEONIX WALL
damn, zeri and neon be having very similar vibes.
Zeri??? Is that you???
I wanna see trailer for all agents specially Reyna and Sage
The trailer isn't animated at a low frame rate, only her character model is, this is often used in animation to indicate inexperience, which makes sense because from what we've seen she is one of, if not the youngest agent. Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse also uses this technique with Miles, as he grows more confident with his powers, he starts to be animated at the same frame rate as the other spider-people.
zeri looks pretty cool in valorant
LETS GOO
WOOHOOOO
No Matter how many times I watch this, I always get the chills. Good Job Valorant!
As a filipino, I know filipinos are gonna be flooding valorant after this release
neon main or what
Killua?
Sheesh
She's literally  sonic
New wife :3
Is this it? Is it time that I change being a jett main?
wow  Neon The Spark of Zaun?
0:10 typical filipino tapping devices to work😂
Neon - The Snatcher Agent Literal most of Snatchers in the Philippines are fast AF.
she vibin to ylona <3
She's gonna be top tier I'm calling it
Oh look its zuri
LES GO PHILIPPINES
2:17 walis tambo :0
Now imagine PROD with this agent
Lezgooo PHILLIPINES!!!!!!
DAMN BOY, SHE IS THIC. AND SO BEAUTIFUL 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
yung buhok niya parang ube tsaka langka
damn neon lookin dope
Let Cypher rest.......
I'm sold
she is for sure getting nerfed
0:36 "Hayy buhay"??
Good trailer, but Chamber's one is still number one (imo).
I was waiting for her to say " *JET* *REBIBE* *ME* "
3.8 million of these viewers are gold or lower. praising a champ that's going to kill this game competitively
my brother need's to see this
man she decorates her room fast, wish I also had electric powers so I could do that!
Jett is shaking
Dead game lol
crush updated
OH NO ,SHE"S HOT
HAY BUHAY! WOOHOO!
zeri and neon look alike
So ELectro+Jett = Neon
Literally made for me
Pinoy time
mu bien mu guapa mu maja
I like how it really shows her personality, especially the part where Sage enters her room and she was ready to get scolded and questioned like every other Filipino kid that grew up with strict parents, I appreciate the way Sage took it and complimented her, I'm so happy Agent Neon represents the Philippines nowadays perfectly, great job Val Devs!
best agent trailer so faaar 10/10
YOOOOO
parang si eugine yung ult nya
when will valorant make an Indonesian Agent?
Not as good as blizzards cinematics, but definitely hype still.
PILIPINAS MAGINGAYYY!!!!
Basically its like 3 agents mixed to together
PILIPINEON!!!
Why's she look like that new champ coming out in league lmao
Sage trying to be part of Neon's experience corresponds to the voice message in the basement office of The Range. Sage is recorded telling Brim that Reyna is too angry and aggressive, and will corrupt the agents, and either she or Brim suggest that she take the lead in new agent training.
Cant wait to be as fast as my Boi sonic
Day 1 Nerf?!
Miles Morales vibes
did she just said "hay buhay" so she's a pinay AHHAHA
spiderman into the spiderverse vibes
TACTICAL SHOOTER
literally just recycling the new league champ
1:13 finally riot
looks overpowered
Pro enemy using Neon sprinting with Judge will give me a mega headache
can't wait for the meme of her Like Officer Earl Running meme for example xD
Sorry but the animation looks so bad..
How many more times is valorant going to steal Overwatch character ideas
Does she have 5 Abilities?!?!?!
How come I still cringe? Like it's a filipino dubbed anime. 😭 I love the artwork tho.
YESSIR PH NO.1
LESSGOOO!! PINOY KAMI MGA TOL!!!  LET'S GO VALORANT!!!
Never seen a walis tambo that huge XD
Nice she has a tazer
What does she say in 0:37 and 1:39? Please.  Edit: It's Hay bugay/That's life and Kontrolado ko 'to/I control it.
Whatever agent can come,but I am a yoru main always 🔥🔥🔥
La del lol wild rift es igualita pero verde, que chingados son gemelas o que!! 🤣
chills
Siiickkk!! Cant wait!
Man, no 60fps video.
oh a new COD trailer, run a gun boys, the new tactical way of playing this game
RUN AND GUN BABY LET'S GO
She from the shadow realm!
i can’t express how happy i am to have filipino representation in a video game. im so proud 🥺
....zeri much
Can’t wait to play Zeri in jung
double walls fire
WOW We now have 6 duelists vs 4 for the other roles, i reckon with how the yoru rework is going that he’s gonna be an initiator now? His info gathering and his long flash seem to fit the initiator role better
**cant wait for the fastest flanks**
Zeri's sisteeeeer 🎉
Nah, nah Riot nah
"Happy Cypher Noises"
are they related of Zeri the new champion on League? they look alike and they have the same skills of shooting electric thingy using their fingers.
Hey look it's Zeri
my new main lets goooo
are we not going to talk about how riot released the same character for both League and Valorant?
This trailer is so cringe
Neon:  "Hay buhay. . ."
SHEEEESHHH PINOY PRIDEEE
Yupp true definition of run n gun
I'm screaming - so exciting aa
Is she a filipino hahaha
This is going to be broken, fuck this game man.
Anyone else think this ie zero bu with blue and yellow hair
Filipino fans COME OUT
I love her design and voice! Can't wait for her to release and see how she interacts with the others!
Is this fortnite or valorant because the title is misleading.
NOONE NOTICE SHE SPEAKS TAGALOG BTW IM SO EXITED TO USE THE AGENT
Such a good trailer gawdamn
if yall playing frag shooter in mobile. there's a character like this. i always wanted valorant to take some ideas from the game. (plus the cable one is lit if it's in valorant)
so this is where all the cringe tik tok faces come from
This is just a COD character
And now, is time to csgo
how to not simp neon??
Yes a Filipino agent I'm gonna get her
Poor Cypher, I noticed he been signed up again to be killed in this trailer too and get paid.
Did anyone notice that this is the third thumbnail of Neon Trailer already - They changed it and this is its third design.
hto woanm
So, the ice skates in snowball mode is just to test how fast neon will go huh-
isnt this like the first character with a revive advantage?
Bruh this is literally the same character than the new character from league but with different hair color
imagine fast fingers(people's) plays this agent like a god
Ohhh yeah i need more fortiche animations
they literally just made a character for running and gunning lol
Please put agents theme on Spotify
She's so good, Riot released her in League of Legends too.
When we're saying to do something about run and gun, it doesn't mean to add it as a feature
Zeri looks great
As a call of duty player, This Agent fits me perfectly like KAY/O
Bring back Replication so everyone gets to try Neon pleaaase
wait theres slide
riot : nerf run n gun also riot : Make a run and gun agent 😂
L trailer
Hay buhay 😂😂😂 pagud n si neon hahahhaa
man riot really released the exact same person in 2 games at once. electric based mobility champs.
RNG Spectre abusers be celebrating
people are telling me shes supposed to be really good to fight off jett
I was too stunned to speak that she is Filipino Wow!!
a whole mix of octane from apex, pheonix from... valorant, and warlock with stormtrance from destiny 2. I hate how OP neon is gonna be ;(
Good shit, good thing this game is a tactical shooter
Is this agent related to the new legend in LoL? theres too many similarities
3.8 m on neon's trailer in 1 day 3.8 m on kay o's trailer in 3 months huge difference
cool
é o corres
PUTANGINA IS OPTIMUM PRIDE OH
Zeri from lol and neon on valorant? Are they made by the same designer in riot? If so i can tell its good, same character but designed for different genre.
Why does Zeri and Neon look so similar? Also both of them use electricity as a weapon. Is there a connection?
Are Neon and Zeri in any way related? They look similar and both have electric abilities and both happen to be announced very close to each other.
it seems broken already
"valorant is slowly turning into overwatch"                                                          - Donald Trump
Finally an agent from the Philippines 🇵🇭
sage is so nice i love her :((
SHE CAN FINGER PEOPLE?
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Kontrolado ko 'to"🥴
cringe
Jett: No one's faster than me Neon: hold my beer
Add a broom knife skin
LMFAO Valorant has a NERI too
Zeri v2?
cant wait to get fucking finger blasted 100+mph
This is literally the best teaser i've ever seen in my entire life.
Seams like another Jett
She's so much similar to the new agent Zeri from League of Legends (?) They have already started to reuse the assets
Are yorus changes coming with neon or the act after?
she looks broken. I've found a new main
this actually looks amazing
PINAS LANG MALAKAS
so is neon the sister of lol's new agent or
Congratulations to Vanille Velasquez for Voicing Agent Neon 👏❤️
Слава Украине!
373548 people infected just a one day! England pandemic getting worst!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
imagine Pheonix is deleted bc of Neon's double Fire wall
Yeah🤘
when is the political commentary bundle coming?
is it just me or did riot kinda just say fuck it and added zeri to league then neon to valorant, damn near the same character design. in terms of looks anyway
looks absolutely busted ngl. Already needs a nerf
Neon's ult: "Wag kang bastos!".
This looks like zeri n I am now a zeri main, neon main
"chief."
now we will have to learn how to slide cancel in valorant
very nice trailer
Zeri.
This Vibe 🔥😮
Why video at 5fps?
The character is pretty interesting, her gameplay looks like cod with those sprint and tactical slide , but hey i can't say no to mobility
That ulti is especially broken lookin and the double wall is just copy paste of Phoenix fire? The slide and stun thing looks cool doe. Idk bout this one
So she has a self-res?
League of legends never the same as before.
Wait did he speak Tagalog when he going kinda out of control?   Nvm he speaks Tagalog when not talking with other agents
Heh, she has the valorant go cup
really made run and gun a meta
octane from apex and winston from over watch at the same time
🇵🇭
Why does she look like a zeri from lol? Same hairstyle, same sparky power lmao
valorant should lowkey make a movie
Of course she loves to sing! Hehe 😅
so echo + tracer from overwatch?
Let's go!
Is this girl related to Zeri?
Neon, welcome to Valorant.
I'm a Filipino, I approve her. She's got the Filipino vibes.
SICK  FIRST AGENT WITH 5 ABILITIES, SLIDE, RUN, WALL, ricochet molly/stun and ultimate
Woooooo!!! A character from the Philippines!!!!
pog, she's pinoy D1 athlete
Main
Neon and Zeri(new league champ) both have lightning like abilities. You think their character design is inspired by Volta XD ?
pinoy na pinoy pag di gumana paluin mo at gagana ulit yon
I see now we have speed competition between Jett and Neon now
woahh thank you so much for the new agent!!
i want more of those shortfilms so that we can feel the characters
Race you there? *neon slams into a ice wall *
ok guys  i work for rito studios,  thess two characters   are literally   the same  but alt universes    some where  in the middle of the  year  we will have a valorant  x league of legends  cross over  and its gonna  be so big i  dont wanna  tell ttoo much about it, think  of it like  all the fortnite cross overs but 1000x better
she needs a nerf she has a laser finger!
literally zeri
Apex legends players real happy rn.
So, thats basically a recycled version of Zeri from LoL (for the design atleast).  But still looks funny, but op. :,)
Good to see Zeri in two games
THE WAY SHE HIT THAT SCANNER AT 0:10... ON POINT ALREADY LMAOOOO
Snatcher lods AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
apex legends go brrrr
Dalagang agent yeah
Literally like new character from League.
SAid In the Description "Our newest Manila-born Agent"  A FILIPINO AGENT WHOOO!!!!!
woop woop
Hope Ylona can wear the Neon Costume ☺️
Woah this came out of nowhere.
I bet most or probably all Filipinos here are gonna main and instalock her.
have they added manila map
I guess Ylona Garcia is canon in the valoverse now. That's cool~
My god this agent and that new champion in league!! Totally coincidence!!  Anyway can't wait to play this characters!!
Did someone notice that this girl is filipino
YESSS
The model for Neon and Zeri looks almost the same?, or is it just me?
Neon = Zeri
Riot multiverse?
It is just amazing how the trailer, the new agent and the music match perfectly. LOVE IT
There are so many things in this video that are Filipino inside jokes. The representation is spot on. Thank you so much for finally a non-stereotypical mainstream character who shares the same culture as me!! 🇵🇭🇺🇸
Ylona is now canon in Valorant lore lol
Making the agent who embodies "run and gun" Filipino is perfect. That was literally the tatic of filipino soldiers during the revolution
i wish valorant would make and afghani character :(
wtf is going on with the frames? this isn't artsy shut up
i see sage has a thing for fast girls
Running and gunning is already broken AF in this game. Now you add a character that's all about run and gun. 😒
Copy and paste Zeri?
So we have to believe that in the world of valoran, doing a little sprint, these a super power xd
Did they just make the exact same characters for both of their games
If she doesn't have "Rebayb me Jett" voiceline I will scream at Riot to give her one
ruined the game
New main. Simple. Slide, sprint, 2 walls at once like you're fucking parting the red sea, outstanding colours and design just the best
So like. There's a very similar looking girl in the league season 2022 trailer, but with green/yellow hair and a different outfit. They both have sparks and have a thing on their back. Connected?
This agent is made solely for PROD
she looks like a fortnite skin ☠☠☠
Her hair color kinda feel familiar
love how they're showing off the precise gameplay in this trailer
Let's go!
Looks fire running that for sure
She's super fast too!
She have to wall omg!
She's super strong like Jett omg💚
She should have used a walis (broom) instead of a vacuum for the authentic feel
dayum, girl's got them thunder thighs.
Riot really gonna release a league AND Valorant character that looks the same
01:12 She's LA Tenorio fan huh? Cool.
I just saw this character being launched in League of legends
Oh, so they're releasing the same character in Valorant and LoL but with different names. Interesting...
I think sage and neon are sisters or relatives
pepePains Jesus christ
electric filipino tracer
lets goo ima main this maybe cuz im too biased that im filipino🇵🇭
SHUT UP AND INVITE ME IN TO TESTING ＞:(
She is just like the new lol champion
Came here after New LOL champ reveal
BIG VIBES
Oh look it's zeri ehhhh I mean Neon
Yo Riot, two electric characters!? You guys good? Yall need an extension cable or something? Either way, shit's dope.
SHE HELPS RUN AND GUN
We fixed run in gun. Oh btw, here's Neon!   Lol love it.
really out here putting a bo3 character into their "tactical shooter"
Delete please
ima bet everyone is gonna use the im fast as fuck boiiiiiiiii sound effect  in their videos
1- elvből nem ismerjük el Dua Lipát mint énekes 2- Nem menő a dupla tűz  3- Szar játék 4- Nem kreatív 5- kabe
I already simp for her =)
“Ayy, Buhay..” JESSUS….
wtf zeri
poor cypher 🥲
She’s Filipina 🇵🇭 (coming from a Filipino, you love to see it!) 🔥
Can't wait to see it get nerfed into the ground and never be used a month later!
Here we are, one more valorant trailer, one more Cypher dead, the prophecy continues  1:02
oh hey i see where Zeri went, and she dyed her hair a bit too!
I hit 49 subs you proud of me
I think her ult only works if revived
Riot never disappoints with their trailers and this is by far the best one yet. Entire trailer was beautiful!
i dont even play valorant and that was really cool
125 pound weight loss journey!! Videos out now !!
Similar design to league poggers
how do you say 'I love her' in tagalog?
only came here after seeing zeri trailer.... bro, they’re so similar
She's Zeri but with other color xD
Wenn Selphy sie spricht mach ich Freudensprünge lol
Can I just say how sweet Sage is here?
Just curious, what does Neon say in English when she’s getting resurrected?
And then they copied the homework into league for Zari.
They made a basically same character in LoL hahaha damn
my new main
The champion Zeri looks very different here
please no
Yeah thats what valorant needs jett v2 to smurf 3 times faster than usual because moblity is not overpowered...at all.
is no one else gonna say it? Zeri (LOL)= Neon (VAL) its the same person
Wow, I didn't remember Devil daggers to look like that.
oh my god im in love
She can revive on her own and gets a lightning gun after? How cool is that???
LETS GOO
Loved the trailer. Also, using an Australian Filipino singer Ylona Garcia's song in this trailer is just in place.
I was disappointed in Zeri but this... Omg I fucking love this
s this litterally zeri
Commend the pocket sage
Zeri, is that you?
Had anyone notices the caracter in the poster above sage and brim with a black outline?
Zeri is looking great
is it just me, or has this thumbnail changed like 10 times since launch?
Welcome to overwatch
Too op
Is this the new character for Flights?
best trailer !
IM LITERALLY LOVING THIS AGENT ALRREADY
beautiful idea, shitty animation.
Ded gem
ANGAS 🔥🔥🔥
LES GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Cleannnnn
Is she wearing Vessi shoes?
This is triggering my inner Titanfall player
I thought Zeri was being added to League
Her name fits perfectly. Instant crush for me.  Also very cool beats! How can a game help me discover so many new artists to listen to?!
looks too op tbh
Bro ur animations are amazing! Love the effects i could watch it again and again if i wouldnt remember it!
Neon: “Ay Buhay…”  Every Filipino be like:  *LET’S GOO! REPRESENT! REPRESENT!*
they said "lets throw jett, pheonix, and stormtrance warlock all into one character" and went with it
I love how well this trailer was put together. The combination of the well edited gameplay montage combined with animated elements in sync with the music, it's just perfect.
She brings a completely different meaning to the term "gun runner".
This agent has taken run and gun to a whole another level
zeri and neon are legit the same person
Finally an agent I can use as a mindless wraith main
Community : Riot Should Fix Run N Gun In Next Act  Valorant : Yes
Why did you add the same exact character to League and Valorant? What the fuck?
They really Got Riot Aguast to Design to Characters for to different games lmao also was the it Citeri liu who design both Zeri and Neon
We got a Dash, Firewalls, Crypto Cage(?) and finger guns. sounds like a hell of a ride.
bravo rito you made phonix and jett in one agent
Wow she actually make me want to reinstall this game from her play-style.
this video was cringe
Why 20 fps
zeri and neon is the same champion
zeri looks different here
"HAYY BUHAY "  HAHHAHHAHAHAAH
She looks like ZERI before she gots some green crack  😂😂😂
She's so prettyyyyy
SHE LOOKS AMAZING
Why is she litteraly Zeri
peenoise
Did this hurt anyone else's eyes. Framerate wise
The music great 💯 tho 👌🏻
apex here we go
Zeri?
LMAOOO they released  the same champ for leauge  HOW fucking lazy is  rito holy shit  i know they have been shitty the last few years (6+) BUT COME ON
Wow the trailer is shit
1:13 I frickin' lose it and shook in HYPE when I saw her frame picture written Pilipinas...   So that means Neon is a Filipina!   Dude, I'm also a Filipino but not a Valorant player, sorry. :''3
really like the new battle academia skin. by the way is this a Ezreal gold edition or lux skin by any chance?
aw shit here we go again.
cocain
Dear, people  I know this is contrary to what has your interest at the moment, but I’ve come to witness to you the incredible mercy of the Savior and King Jesus Christ. If you have ears to listen or eyes to see, let me give you a grave warning of God’s wrath. The only Way to escape God’s wrath is to REPENT and change your lives according to that of the life of Jesus Christ and His blood will cleanse you of your sins and you will have eternal life. Times are perilous, God’s wrath draws near, and time runs out, I promise this will undoubtedly be the best decision of your eternity. Romans 6:23 KJV- “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” This video could never offer what Jesus does.
Excellent graphics. 01000101 01111000 01100011 01100101 01101100 01101100 01100101 01101110 01110100 00100000 01100111 01110010 01100001 01110000 01101000 01101001 01100011 01110011 00101110
NEON for Valo and Zeri for league. one designe for two worlds
jett two?
Love ❣️ it
😍 She looks to good
Filipinos are prob going crazy right now. I love that for us!
Jet rework ?
They really created a champ and gave it a chroma and added it to their other game  Lelw
every game has sliding now, I hate it but ill have to try her I guess.
me: gets chamber cause I think he is cool but does not really fit how I want to play  riot: drops trailer for a character who fits exactly how I want to play   me: damn
looks insane, cant wait!
RUNNING HEADSHOT AGAIN WTF VALORANT  FIX YOUR AIMING SYSTEM
literally released the same champion for two different games lmao
Makes me feel like im playin Half Life
Simple hype nothing more. Still gonna hold b with my kj ;)
Why Cypher always dies on trailers?
League has zeri and valorant has her
Me totally out of my sanity looking at Zeri from LOL today and thinking "aw damn I missunderstood somehow, it was not a new agent for valorant"
Looks absolutely broken
WOWWWWW LET S GOOOOOO

cool to finalyl get some representation, but why does she have to be light-skinned? our people have many shades. if it wasn't for the poster and the accent i literally would have no idea she's filipino.
10fps
If you fear death, read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
she looks bad af
Such an incredible trailer 😍 Amazing work to the team behind this

Put Tank In A Mall
We need a movie now💯😍😌
Cant get better than this...love from India team Riot
SHE HAS A FAT CAKE
Hayo tracer in valo insane

YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Buen video Epic games aunque deberias nerfear el minero
Yaaay everyone’s favourite copy and pasted game
A Filipina Agent..... and listening to Ylona Garcia song.. xD <3<3<3
Fun fact: If your parachute 🪂 fails, you have the rest of your life to figure it out.     Have a cookie to feel better 🍪
directly from Overwatch
She is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 when is she coming out
jett gonna be sad after this drops
bruh

Watch Valorant turns into a game less guns being used to ult heavy
do the polish agent plssssss
So broken
Bro why are the trailers for this game so well-made?! I swear the guys working on VALORANT could make a Pixar-quality movie any day if they wanted to.
Yo valorant guys i want a Rinnegan ability agent.
A perfect character for The Spectre
i ll wait nerf before play
Imagine valorant series something like arcane
hz adem amk o nası yardı side ı öyle
Her sprint reminds me of octane's stim in Apex Legends. I'm gonna have some trouble instalocking cuz my computer's fricking trash though.
Sheeeshhh!! Proud pinoy!
Rush Rush Rush....☺️❤️👉👈
Neon+Specter=OP
1 more powerful agent after chamber i guess for indians deulists ki waat lagne wali hai
you should make all  character from other games of your and make it them in volrant
Yeah funny. I'm keep waiting for a Romanian agent 😀
My BIG goal is to reach 200k amazing subscribers milestone one day 🙏
Overwatch xD
I go fast? Electricity? Damn, she's probably snatching Meralco's lol
Yes please
NAILED THIS SHIT!!!
Sometimes I forget that Valorant and LoL are from the same company.
neon vs jett
This video is lagging little bite
OMG LESS GO
I'm kinda dumbfounded they just gave her a double phoenix wall
PINOY PRIDE !!!!! PISTENG GIATAY!!!
new cod looks good
OH HELL YESSSSSSSSSSS
symmetra
I thought this character was coming to league?
Kay-O doesn't even feel like a new agent now lmao
I've watched this about 10 times already. I can't get enough of this new character.. Pure perfection.....
Sage asking for race with neon  and then slow her done with orbs lol.
HOLY THIS IS AMAZING
MAİN
so fuckin cool
I’m ngl I looovvvve the trailer but we did not need more run and gun in the game. Coupled with slide and gun AND A LITERAL LASER THAT HAS 100% ACCURACY? I mean bro this is not gonna bring me back to the game
Waiting for Walis Tambo to be melee weapon...
Op? I think her ult bit power full i like her Dash and the wall that more helpfull then jett smoke
She’s gonna be so broken
NIce pinay agend :D
Don't be sad Phoenix U can still flashes ur teammate
worst game ever
she’s so PRETTY.
Run and Gun Ultimate. Perfect.
suprise suprise a shit game company put sout another shit charicter in thir shitty gME
So this is basically Jett and phenix have a child together 👁️👄👁️👍
My egirl brain be like : She pretty she speed she my new main
i really think that this is going to be the best agent ever ngl, we will see her pretty soon. im pretty excited
Ah yes finally sage
Jett mains been real quiet after this
Huh
I need Her!!!
u see Lithuania problem America problem all problem from Taiwan!  how about let's solve Taiwan problem first!
Indian agent when ????
Looks like her abilities are  Sprint and she can slide  A throwable concuss that concuss every time it hits a surface, but it drops straight to the ground after it travels a certain distance (like a Phoenix Molly)  Double Phoenix wall that pops up on either side of her creating like an alley.  Her ult is a beam of electricity that she runs around shooting people with.  Looks like she gets a speed boost after every ult kill
op
Animation : Clean Music : Clean Splash Art Final : Clean Concept : Clean  Everything is Clean by far !  It's Subjective
cant wait to play this agent 2 months after its release
COD players gonna love this one
Coe vai se fuder boneco full pra patinete
If you were to give out a valocity karambit for 1000 bp why the fuck did you even launch the champions edition karambit for 5000 bp? A karambit is a karambit Riot what the fuck.
Ragazzi la uso Io mi DISPIACE
Pause at 0:08 😏
The walis is in the room, I hope Riot will make that a buddy
pls rework her
She looks dope asf amazing trailer
Neon ult is a classic Mommy Dionisia move irl
filipino and and born in manila my city  nah
When's neon coming out?
catJam
I love this game thank you devs
Could someone translate what she said before activating her ultimate l think the language is Filipino
Anyone know what she says in her ultimate?
fortnite montage
So Asians dominate duelist categ
Cant wait!!!
bye bye viper and jett
Riot please dont use this as the sprint animation . She looks like me when my parents see my report card . I look dumb for reason but making her dumb is injustice
never forget 1/6/2021 worst attack on democracy since 1812!
Fajna postać
She seems broken and OP ngl
Run and gun champ…
Damn neon a baddie though…
Bring this to console
Kleiner Mund wie Rainer Wingler
everybody gangsta till shes instalocked for the next 2 weeks
People be like, Animation is laggy. It is laggy because it is trying to give a Spiderverse vibe kind of animation, the listening to music in bed with arms behind the head is a giveaway.
Oh waoooooooo😍😍😍😍😍
wow
Риот, есть отличный сериал Arcane, а теперь ждём сериал Valorant, если сможете конечно))
Riot surely knows their music taste.
PvE?
DAMNNNNN I AM HYPED
use me as a R.N.G button :)
rushing b made simple
so theyre adding run and gun
Neon = phoenixjettyorubreach
Does anyone know what she is saying when Sage revives her? I'm assuming it's Tagalog right? Also this might be the best and most hype I've ever been about a character in any game being announced. CHILLS the entire time!!
so that's our tracer, jk, Love ittttttttt!!!!
NANANANA GODDDD
RUN AND GUN GOES BRRRRRRRRRRRRR
hit em with that run n gun
FFS music all the time is good
For those non-Filipinos 0:38 *'sigh(or "Hay [hʌɪ]")' "Buhay"* translates to *'sigh' "Life..."* which we Filipinos say when we're bored or maybe just tired of something 1:41 *"Kontrolado ko 'to"* translates to *"I can control this"* which I think is pretty straightforward  I'm very excited for this new agent!
Von Victoria
Yang auto pic anak babi
insane
Please make Valorant a netflix series, we need this
Yo Zeri reveal?
at least she has a good gaming chair
Now run Neon RUN!
siuuuuuuu
Truly beautiful
Yessss
yooooo, i didnt think they would make an agent better than chamber so soon
is it just me or does the video seem laggy?
It looks cool yall know what does that mean  Exactly nerf akali
PILIPINAS MAG-INGAY!!!!!
Ya know everyone will say IM GONNA BE A NEON MAIN OMG SHE LOOKS SO COOL and when they find out she’s not as good as anticipated they will go back to their old mains
im in love
Kontrolado ko toh = I am in control
jogo lixo pqp os cara vai colocar boneco q atira andando kskdkskfdksdf nunca sera um  fps tatico
So... sonic
she hot AF
Ohh so a visible yoru with precise gunplay
RIP Jett
Fun fact: In the sequence where she's floating in the void, she keeps repeating "I can control this" in Tagalog Edit: Just in case u want the phrase, it's "Kontrolado ko to"
LOOKS FIRE LOOKING FORWARD TO IYTTT
Did you really just fucking stole the Miles Morales shot in 0:47, bruh
can someone tell me what she says when she gets revived?
bravo coaie super
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.
Wow
Looks like gym leader Nessa ngl man
Yeah but.. she left her shoes on. That bothers no one in here? 😬
Electric Phoenix.
Let's go Neon!!!
Run n gun wasn't enough for you eh valorant ?
Yo i might actually play this game now, shit looks fun 👀
pinay agent wow
1:02 Rip Cypher :(
This looks like Walmart Arcane
She looks cute no cap
I watch this so many times and also the walis tambo brooo cuteeee 2:18
Pls buff reyna
Damn she thick🔥
Well I mentioned them adding a slide in a comment for the game. Not exactly what I ment but hey xD least I figured something happening before reveal.
In others words, we have another jett but with viper screens
God sent His one and only Son to come die on the cross for us✝️He took that punishment that we deserve so u can have eternal life.
Home sweet Home 🥰
Nc
Damn the just loving the colour scheme of Neon, mostly blue for the association of electricity but the yellow undercuts in her hair really pop when she Ults, love it!
First Pinoy I ever seen in game trailer... nice...
They all look the same feking hell
YO SHE THICC
SHE'S FILIPINO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Pinoy Representation WOOOOOOOOO!!!! 🇵🇭
Man this gives new meaning to rushing/running in to site and dying first
At this point Valorant should just make a Netflix series like Arcane.
This agents gonna make run and gun even more broken lmfao
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Savior, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all
"Precise Gunplay"
she's just Zeri, the next lol champ, but in the valorant universe
Jett 2.0
Pinoy toxic player be like " i tho-throw ko to"...
bgm?
Reminds me of Verr Power
YOOOOO this character is SO GOOD, I am suppeeeeer exacted for it to come. I will be the first one to get it :))))))))
Run and gun???
Chidori!!! Lessss fooking goooo!!
i m realy love this agent and i wait for u my darling
tAtICaL ShoOtEr 0:53, 1:53
Yesterday, just uninstalled the game.
rng has a new meaning now
Hey, is it just me or is spark kinda reminding me of someone else who just came out on another game   *zeri from league of legends*
Yoo Valorant give us the song plz
AHHH SHE IS FILIPINO
sage is so wholesome
Railgun
very cool trailer, still prefer Chamber one but very pleasant to watch
Por tudo, que perfeitaaaa! Já quero habilitar a Neon 😍
So it‘s Darth Sidious? Nice, I like Star Wars xD
This is exactly I've been waiting for!
Jett'e yeni bir rakip geldi gibi Neon için çok heyecanlıyım geldiğinde direk almak isterim tabi bilgisayarım tamire gideceği için almam uzun sürecek gibi Neon çok hızlı geldi yeni bir ajanın bu kadar hızlı gelmesini beklemezdim 😁
🔥🔥🔥
Is this the first trailer where cypher isn’t getting destroyed 😂
When is the update
KKKKKKKK que merda Video in -60 FPS LOL
That walis tambo rocks!
Respekt das ist das erste Mal das ich das geseh habe.
plot twist: She has a crush o, our fire BOI, phoenix
Jett main : *"Goodbye Jett, Hi Neon"*
Next agent must definitely be Arabian
Whats with the 5fps animation riot running out of money?
Is this blue Zeri
Her trailer is my favorite by far. I loved it.
Thank ur god that i don't play this game, just looking at it makes me want to off myself.
Damn
Man they really did a outstanding job with this, and they keep making better trailers and cooler agents witch makes me wonder what they will create next.
Nothing's more dope than CHAMBER
People talking about the animations being bad its the same shit as spiderverse and arcane, different animation style honestly i think its fire
Yay but I still didn't unlock chamber
The trailer is crazy but noeon is the brig of valorant
I just noticed she was singing with her toothbrush
She reminds me of the new league champ, they even have the same power
jet forgive me neon my new gf 🥺
girl literally a human sonic
nice 10 fps
Why is this a bit laggy
Why not Indian agent? Though its most trafficked server @VALORANT
And of course cypher dies
BRO HELP SHE’S FINGERING ME
Will there be a character which is origin is from India ???
please don’t tell me sage is going to be solely dependent on neon. if neon gets a buff off res sages are just going to pocket and the character will be useless to the rest of the team roster
roit at best ;D they know how to market with shit games
I see that ting ting walis
finally i can be a atlhelet
Valorant you beautiful 💯👍
New agent trailer comes out  Cypher: Okay imma die
Its Probably like...my 15th time rewatching this or smthm...
5 fps xD
More run 'n gun confirmed... 😑
I like how they paired Neon with Sage in this video. This shows that a Chinese(Sage) and a Filipino(Neon) can still be good friends even after all the issues their countries have with each other <3
Release date ????
I'm In f*cking love
She's a dog person I'm sold
Imagine her saying revive me jett AHHSAHHSHAHSHAHA
Just imagine how many cypher tripwires u can dodge with the slide
Holy shit Tari?
you couldn't represent something worst than you just did Congrats .
why is this trailer in 5 fps?
cool
Letsgoooo
i dont even understand whats going on
For someone who has the worst aim, I just wish Valorant would have story mode for each agent. The lore and story of each agent is just 🔥⚡💙💛
from this it looks like she is gonna get nerfed fast lol
thats fireeee
ayyy they added that fortnite sliding lmao
These agent trailer has gone better with each iterations, valorant definitely will go far and beyond!
new JETT ?
Welp not looking forward to this champ
This is by far my favorite trailer. I love the design of this character and the trailer music was great. Cant believe they got Ylona Garcia from 88rising
She's kinda bad ngl 😍
It has precise gun play
that's from pilipinas 💪🏿
dude the walis tambo!!!
hs
We need 1 more Initiator and controller tho
Controlado ko to!!! ang lupit i love everything about her, damn! 😍🤩
bro why is the slide animation same like fortnite
less gooooo my new main
Make other agents useful please
this vid blew up riot great job !!!!
instantly mained
Fire 🔥 less goo riot awesome job I got goosebumps when I watched this hyped!!!
now that is indeed entertaining   ~
WOOOO
fucking 10 frames into the spider verse looking ahhhh, cmon we know yall just being cheap on the render
Fire
“Disruption” i love that so much
need an INDIAN origin agent too
Very nice
Cypher dying in trailers is a tradition at this point
Finger guns :)
troche sus
Why is this at 7fps
Yes yes yes yes
opppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp she's gonna be epiccccccccccc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so excited
Chambers one is better tho.
This has gotta up there in one of the best trailers evers
Just kinda like Echo in Valorant? :D
My new main
GGS u just destroy the game ^^
Kontrolado ko 'to!!!⚡
Bruh I barely speak tagalog anymore but it's cool to see some of the people getting hyped about her and her background. I also always wanted super speed represented in games but I never expected it to be in valorant. Guess I found a new main, no more being a sole sova main lel    W agent
I don't think this belongs in a tactical shooter but it looks insane
I’ve never wanted to play Valorant more than ever
афігений трелейр і музика кайфовая))))
oh my god
I am by far the most excited about this agent! can’t wait to play them!!
lesgo cant wait
Shes Literally a Philipinian Jett
She's Filipina?
Yamete kudasai
hmm so whose  faster jett or neon?
This is the moment when Riot approves run n gunning
Riot: There will be no peeker's advantage in Valorant  Neon:
her ult is so brain dead
YESS
this agent is initiator?
Rule 34 artists are coming
A chaarcter named after my alias Letsss goooo
I bet the dogs name is "Browny"
Is it only me or blue characters is the most drippiest in valorant ( yoru,omen,neon )
new main
I swear Valorants becoming overwatch with these beautiful characters.
Best looking new character so far
Run and gun nerfed you may say...
Bro pls fir the love of god and everyther diety pls dont make her op pls pks oks
new agent lets gooooo 🥳
Jett time is over
Those Poor Cyphers 🥴.
Jett kl
esta ROTISIMAAAAAAAAAAAA
Aaaaahhhh!!!! A Filipino agent!!!
This looks like a fan made montage video
Ability 1: Throw Stun Grenade (similar to K/O, but stun instead of DOT) Ability 2: Dash (Similar to Jett, slower) Ability 3: Double straight Phoenix wall Ult: Laser hand
adobo buff
GODSPEED
i don’t like that you’re promoting reviving in the open
This is how you do it. Amazing song and beat to match the character while showcasing some of the new moves. Just so fun. Love it all.
yepp i present to you the most broken agent
The new hero is a filipino cool
putangina call of duty and overwatch
Powered by Meralco
Yes filipino agent
Can u share this song as is. İts good than original. I guees ylona have to share the song like this. Sounds good.
IS THAT SOME FILIPINO PHRASES?
cringe
0:52 AM FAST AS FUC BOI KEEMSTAR INSPIRED ABILITY
I like how Riot make Neon as Accurate asf, just look at her Slightly flat nose, Pigmentation, and even her singing using a Hair comb, Toothbrush, and a Whisk Broom/Vacuum cleaner as an Alternative Microphone 😆, that's a Filipino stuff💯
Deffo gna run and gun with a judge 😂
"Precise gunplay"  SUUUUUUURE
Vaya vaya nueva miniatura
NASAN NA YUNG POTANGINAAA!
Filipinos are sooo happy right now, Neon and Manny Pacquiao are the only things they got representing their country.
AYYYYY PINOY FOR THE WIN
She looks like zeri from lol
Lets goooooo
Ah fuck now they're gonna run n gun with spectre on me with neon alas
I should be expecting a lot of "precise gunplay" with Neon's sprinting ability
Sage is soo cute
Can't wait to finally play as Hatsune Miku in Valorant
if this agent can run and gun with her abilities, im deleting valorant and selling my account.                 anyone interested in buying my iron 3 hardstuck account with killjoy ghost skin??
why there is always sage in valorant trailer
We need a movie
i approve of this masterpiece/ fe4rroo approved:))
she looks like shes going to be bad for the gameplay.
i think m in love lol
She’s filipino!!!
BROKEN AGENT
Happy National Overreaction Day everyone! Jan 6 needs to be a new Holliday celebrating people who overreact! New Holiday started by USA Congress👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
holy shit
Community: Fix run and gun Riot games: lets create an agent that can run and gun If i die to a shotgun or a spectre or any other weapons coz of the new agent running and gunning i will uninstall the game and sell my account
VALORANT should be made into a film. When says team is waiting really imagined all the agent sitting in a room XD
hear me out
Now all we need is an Indian who is a hacker 😂
valorant just unvaulted run and gun lmao
Oooh I understand now, Riot is trying portray Neon as someone still young and new to the agent life. That's why her room looks like a teenager's and she sleeps with her plushie. Sage also acting an older sister figure. So it makes sense for her to have a reckless run and gun play style, just like how most are when new to Valorant.
Just when I thought chamber secured legendary agent status riot goes and does this 🤯
Ok, flash, got it.
Best character trailer so far. "Entertain Me" was perfect for this.
she's like phoenix and jett's lovechild tbh
Please have a 'putang ina' line
This agent will fall into obscurity after hype is over. Ult is practically useless if its DoT as people can easily headshot you. It's like jett but without the highlight reel possibility with knives.
*Valorant drops new trailer* Sighing Cypher mains : I think we all know where this is going.
at least cypher didnt get killed first
Another run and gun champion lol dummy boy casuals love this game
Now this is kinda agent we all want😍
HAAYYYY BUHAAAYY!!!
Precise Gunplay and abilities that don't kill 🤣
Noice
Wow!
She actually cuteness i think
new member joining our family cant wait to see her
~precise gunplay~
nice run and gun champ as if its nopt already enough run and gunning. all these silver keks one tapping everything when walking just cuz they aim to the ground and get random headshots. now its actually intended to play so good job
How are y'all dealing with toxic backseat teammates in the game? Gimme your best responses.
Precise gunplay bout to get a whole new level
Uwuwy pretty girls
Omgggggg😍😍😍😍
LEEEEESSSTTTTGOOOOO!!!!
Idk how i should feel about the running ability but for the rest of the kit im pretty hyped
neon a pinay agent character? woww
riot: two weeks later ''we need to nerf that sh8'
10 fps! Nice!
Im done if she actually slides and its not an ult
Petition to put "Mga Bobo" line when getting an Ace
KONTROLADO KO TO!
putangina ang bilis yawa gg
riot once again deliveres an unbalanced brainless run and gun agent
no matter how many agent release, momma sage still my main
cod players smiling rn
Im so sorry for you Valorant players...You yet don’t know how trash Riot is at makin new op champions
THIS IS MY STYLE OF AGENT
Ngl, love the agent  love the trailer, hate the ultimate and hate the song
Hilarious she brought her own walis . I love it!
LESGOOO  BRO
new main alert

Thick thighs save lives.
Bruh, why another duelist?
bu ne amina
Riot makes things so good that it made start playing once again
time to leave the game
goosebumps
BROOOOOO THIS LOOKS SICK
Asstra has competition now
the music is soo good
No se podian poner menos fps no?
NO
Riot games can't seem to stop breaking their own games.
it looks like they emphasizing on her ass
Rusher <3
call of duty movement
The scene she die and get revived by sage she said  "Kaya ko to!!!" Filipino agent yea
Someone at RIOT read the manwha "Eleceed" and said 'yo this is epic, lets make it into an agent' and that's how we got Neon  (Eleceed is Electricity + Speed)
ggnotez
This gives me overwatch vibes
how many time my boiii Cypher has to die in those trailer
lets gooo i want to get it when they have it unlocked yes i will win with her
Who wins in a race jet or neon
Godspeed⚡⚡
neon es la definicion de tactical shooter
Reminds me of Low Tier God
2 more years than this game is on Overwatch level 100 shields 100 tanks 100 flashy shits.
FINALLY SOMEONE HAS A PHILIPPINO CHARACTER
cmon now thats just a 1000% better phoenix wall. *sad noises*
Mommy
ayyy lets goooo!!!!!
She's a filipino??? Niceee
"precise gunplay"
GRABE NEON ILY AGAD WAHAHZWJZNSJSJ
Yoru's sister..same hair colour too
She could have look much more better idk wat is up with valorant character colors all similar yellow n blue is already in kill joy …they could have given like neon green n blue maybe
everyone gangsta until cypher pull  up
Makes sense she had a number 5 jersey since its L.A Tenorio jersey number for Gilas
PUTANGINA NAKAKAIYAK ANSAYA MAKITANG MAY FILIPINO CHARACTER SA VALORANT SHET
"Haaay buhay" is peak filipino sighing
Sprint & spray???
Askal talaga yung doggy eh Thanks riot

Pog champ
HOLDD UPP-
Another trailer in which Cypher dies...LESSSGOOO
Tracer + Pikachu

Neon obviously isn't pure Filipino,any true Filipino would keep their shoes off the bed
KINIKILIG AKO LODS
She runs like the cop from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
boom
this is basically an ow hero bruh
Is @Ylona Garcia is new agent neon voice actor ? Confirm me please anyone ? 🤔🤔🤔
Looks like a skin for the new League Champ. Just killing two birds with one stone i see.
Is it duelist ??
Fantastic❤💯
what did she say when she got shot ?? 1:41
Why is Jett crying in the corner
aight... good bye Jett xD
1:25 i like how she is using a toothbrush as a mic lol
lleeez goo
OMG I NEED IT SO BAAAD HAAAAAA
i wish to see a web series about the valorant..
Jett wannabe lowkey
Bye jett
no way a filipino character!!!!?!?
Yikes
insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
So we basically get 2 same champions here and in League?
Wtf
The pinoy have been summon 🇵🇭🇵🇭
This is a fucking joke? Spectre isn't enough for run and shooting?
hi my new main

Haayy buhaay!
IVE NEVER HAD FILIPINO REP BEFORE
WOWWWW LETSGOOOOOO
time to work on our tracking, boys!
pls never do that low fps rate in the trailers. looks like shitty cgi work from netflix. the normal trailers with fluid movements are much more eye candy
Bruh, the song perfectly fits in the trailer! Kudos for riot and Ylona Garcia ❤️
Valorant lesgoo, i will learn about neon
finally we have another quick agent like jett and raze .....
of course she does Kareoke! ❤ mabuhay Valorant
No Cypher's were harmed in the making of this video.

When are we goin to get a Turkish champ
LIKE REYNA........
Volta suits better char
имба
thank you for such awesome trailers riot!
Love how every single bit of this trailer screams Filipino! <3
Not even close to chamber trailer hype!
Noiceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Neon is literally the embodiment of run and gunning.
if she was actually filipino, she'd be rapping Remix in Our Hearts by Nicol Bol-Z and Lay's Philippines featuring Jose Marie Chan
1:33 At this point FPS is really low (10-15 fps) becoz for every single frame, they had to draw the electric sparks by HAND! RESPECT
LETS GOOO
At least jett's gonna ease down on that attitude now 🥂
I like to believe she is Indian with her Holi colors
Frostblade Irelia
So when’s the release date?
we need a valorant show/movie like YESTERDAY RIOT !!!!
Hayy buhay
Did she say "HAY BUHAY"
For some reason I think her ultimate can make her invincible at when she activated it for 3s
she do b lookin fresh
Bro no cap, this character look like she should be in fortnite XD
finally an agent made for run and gun
BRROIO
HAIL TO OUR QUEEN MY FELLOW QUIAPO SNATCHERS

she looks op
poor low sens players
dear devs, get an Indian agent next :")
So, she can dash like Jett, ult save economy like Jett, molly like phoenix and a wall like phoenix.  SHE IS A SECRET LOVE CHILD!!!
Run and gun is legal now
I like the music used however am I the only one to thing that her and Zeri's design are very similar hinting the possibility of cross-game skins?
Imma simp with Neonnnn. KAYA KO TOOO!!!!
I wish it was on console
Slide peek is gonna counter the operator real hard

she cute too
Sage bye bye! Spark is my now new main!
WHATTT DID SHE JUST SAY "HAY BUHAY"????
Welp, looks like I'm reinstalling this game.
NEON embodies the Wunderwaffe DG-2.
Dude, 1:46 what did she just say? "in arabic that's something serious.."
Sees neon sliding as one of her skills   Me also an apex player:I have waited for this moment!
kinda beuty agent

Welcome to valorant Neon ❤️
She is sick
Electro witch
I LIKE VALORANT CONCEPT WITH THE AGENTS ARE FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, CAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE AGENT, I HOPE.......
Zeri > Spark
This is how be a duelist
Lets goooo proud to be a pinoy and proud to see the gilas pilipinas basketball jersey.
Neon: tanginamo adik, gg
The devs were pulling a massive bigbrain move by adding Gabriel “Flash” Iglesias to their game.
Yeah clutch-master
Ah yes a run n gun agent nice, irons will be blessed. Ngl it looks fun to play her, well i hope so.
GG
jett is death
finally, an agent that fits my playstyle. Hella nice
I think it's very cool that they added Tracer to Valorant
Looks yummy(1:00)
*Pinoy's Rise Up*
Philippines
She seems super similar to the new champion in league. Strange
NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY Sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY Sorry NANAY sorry  NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY Sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY sorry NANAY Sorry NANAY sorry
Sory Jett
She has to die to activate her ultimate?
That Finger gun was probably based from Filipino kids using their finger as imaginary gun Pew pew pew I miss childhood :> Even the characteristics are Filipina like Nice Valorant!
WOW @YLONA BANGIS MO PO GRABEEEEE 🔥🔥🔥
This chicken fina out run spike explosion
You already know they finna run from a site to b site in 2 seconds with 10 seconds on the 10 seconds on the clock
2:21 Look the poster. That girl looks like Reyna. Or it is perhaps a LOL reference?
Ah buhay = oh life Kontrolado ko to = i got this under control
when is she out
BOY AINT NO WAY BOY, AINT NO WAY BOY, AINT NO FUCKING WAY BOY
YOOOOOO
Best way to start 2022
Lesgooo, best thing of 2022 beginners
tf..
Pinoy pride lets goo! 🎉
Ngl, seeing sage animated was more surprising.
Proud Pinoy Moment! Can't wait to run with you sa Tondo and make timbang some people out there. 😁
Angas potangenaa
Don't let this run and gun foolery distract you from the fact that Chamber's trailer was better
animated sage :0
UwU🥺
is it yoru? hmmmmmmmmmm
It feels like 10 fps and 60 at the same time somehow
Hey, this new overwatch hero looks great!
i love her so im maining her
this caracter is very op
Sheeeeesh
Shes a flower
Bro she said "kontrolado ko to" She's Filipino fam!
She's not going to be OP, chill
0:21 0:16
looks like jett gonna have a little sis
deyum
how can she run Fast with that Huge DumpTruck ?
ah yess a filipina agent... cant wait to test her ability couse its so freaking cool- no. Not cool... *its great*
Aspin ba ung aso niya?
if you look at 1:10 and you see a wholesome among us character who is green
If her Ult voiceline isn't "Power, Unlimited Powaaaa"   that would be a huge missed opportunity
new agent looking thiccc
is this octaine or what ? ima love this agent for sure
wow now there are two games with filipino in it and the other one is in tekken
nada roubado rs
Symmetra, are you?
Please keep them coming and give some free stuff as well make us keep playing this game. I think this game is getting better than it use to be. but one thing you guys are worst at is when players get into trouble your support your agents are only saying is uninstall the game and reinstall(That option most people have done already before come there and create a support ticket)
Minnal in the house⚡
So good wtf
that toothbrush-microphone!! So Filipino hahahahaha
Another insta lock agent.
Im surprised nobody mentioned that cypher got killed again 😂
Gun and run? YES PLEASE
please tell me that this ult is a joke please
wtf sliding zamn
cod mw slide cancel as an ability bruh
ASTIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Probably a duelist but still Jett is better
damn i thought she was mexican lmao
OH MY GOSH THAT WALL! uhm?? RAY GUN??? DAMN.
Valorant always Find a way to engage their player and also find some hidden talents to make a hype with their banger  1st - Zedd Bundle  2nd - die for you Grabbitz 3rd - this song featuring Ylona Garcia  Good Job Valorant
Yuhooo tagalog yarn
LESGOOOOO
Well...THICC! 🤷‍♂
Those were my best spent 2 minutes in my life
so her ult is basically auto shoot
So an octane reskin?
this is gunna change the entire flow of valorant and i love it
sage and neon best ship
overwatch    sorry     overwatch     sorry     overwatch sorry                overwatch ?
the amount of people that are going to insta-lock her...
Next agent from India 🇮🇳  plz 🙏
Atleast cypher didn’t die first this time
This is gonna be the beginning of the end of this game
this trailer looks like Apex legends.
This is the first time I am seeing a Sage being so chill😀😀, Neon looks Great though!!! Looking forward to playing her!!!
Damn
The music tho
time to uninstall
that wall is gonna be so fun to use.
Spark got Ace* : *average pinoy trashtalkers*
Hayyy buhayyy :vvv
AMAZING
Its a run and gun agent
ohhh shes filipina

Exactly what we need. Valorant will add anything that opposes their stand and shoot methodology. Vile.
R34 artists are on overtime right now.
I'm in love :O
1:23 she is singing and her mic is a toothbrush......so creative
she kinda looking similar to zeri from lol ?
Hoping for an "umay" voiceline
İlk Türkçe yazması ???
Sova : Shock Dart 🎯 Neon rubs fingers
I am fast as fu*k boisssss.
Da GAME is EVOLVING ITS USING SLIDE CROUNCH NOW LIKE APEX LEGENDS🔥🔥🔥
Did she just said "hay buhay!"?
This champ is so broken
they're not even trying to fix the run and gun at this point, they literally made the perfect agent for it
YES!. LES GEEEEEEEEEE!.

Yo a filipino agent
Great Production

That's shitty
they have to change that wall tho atleast add some lightning particles
Let hear..RIBIBE ME NEONN!😂
crongratulation now valorant is cod warzone
Nice thiccness competition for viper Lmao
finally, a character who reminds me of the speed demon "Octane" from apex legends,  looks sick asf
Okay............dammnnn!!!!!!!
Let's go new agent
O MY GOD  ITS Amazing
kinda resembles jett....2 jett smokes - 2 walls , jett dash - maybe a slide or smtg like that, jett blades - some freakin lightning pouring out of her hand
This game is getting worse the more they make new agents
she looks sick I'm defo autolocking her
Phoenix is crying
1:30 so amazing, i love it most
Finally!!!!! Now i can yell "We got a runner." XD
三姑和三姑夫虽是那个年代很少见的自由恋爱而结婚的，但有句话说爱情是盲目的，从三姑父婚后的表现来看，我的可怜三姑当时的确是被爱情蒙蔽了双眼。他们的恩爱日子没过多久，就进入了“颠簸”模式。三天一打两天一闹成了常态，回忆那几年三姑家的日子，真可谓家宅不宁，四邻不安。  三姑夫好吃懒做，恶习还不少。印象中，他不光在自家周边偷鸡摸狗，连爷爷奶奶家附近的村都有他作案的记录。忙时干庄稼地里的农活，闲时外出打工，家里两个孩子，都是三姑一个女人在操持着。而三姑夫则是白天睡大觉，晚上干活。捉青蛙、抓黄鳝卖钱是他的营生——顺带着偷别人家的鸡鸭，摘别人家的菜。  三姑夫这样的人说是人嫌狗憎一点不过分，家里人都很憎恶他，我们作为晚辈也不尊重他，私下里都随大人叫他小余儿（他姓余）。只要他来了，钱、贵重物品都要藏起来，防着他。摊上这么一个恶棍姑爷，我家算是丢尽了脸。姑姑看在孩子小的份上，只能别无选择地辛苦支撑煎熬着。  说起来三姑夫的出身也是极苦，他是母亲带着他和好几个孩子改嫁给后来的父亲的。家里的孩子多，条件不好，好不容易都拉扯大，成家立业了，父母也老弱多病了。这时候一家子为赡养老人又闹起了矛盾。同母异父的兄弟几个打得不可开交，把白发苍苍的父母在地上拖来拖去，都不肯负起为人子的责任。三姑夫当时说了一句话，我记得很清楚：“我情愿去坐牢都不养你!”  老天很快就遂了他的愿。三姑夫在一次偷窃中被抓了，判了刑。姑姑带着年幼的表弟表妹过得更加艰辛。生活上已经窘迫不堪，娘家人的淡漠和外人的冷嘲热讽，更是给三姑和她的孩子们带来很大的心理创伤。不过想到以前三姑夫得来不干净的钱，姑姑和孩子们都有受益，那几年她家诸多的不顺，也算是因果不爽吧。  三姑父出狱后，秉性不改，重操旧业。前几年一天晚上，喝了点酒，骑着摩托车撞到公路旁边的路基，就此毙命了，死时才四十多岁。  三姑夫不在了，亲戚朋友更多的反而是高兴，庆幸三姑终于可以摆脱了。甚至连我的表弟表妹都没哭。很快，姑姑遇到了现在的姑父，生活总算安乐了。  时下网上有句流行话：不作死就不会死。生活中，像这类玩命作死，最后把自己逼到穷途末路的人，并不少见。文中的三姑夫，不孝父母，不善待妻儿，长期偷盗为生，好吃懒做，恶习多多，身陷牢狱都不知道回头，终于走到尽头，来世的去向，更是令人不敢想象。  深究之下，这一切都是源于自私心太重。自私心太重的人，就只会顾及自己的想法与利益，不懂得将心比心，善待他人；乃至利之所在，就不择手段，侵害别人。天道好还，为善为恶，最后都会原原本本地回到自己身上，受报的还是自己。所以说，多一份私心，多一份苦难；少一分私心，少一分烦恼。
holy shit that is mi main for now holy
The agent chamber was waste I hope this one not like that
guys did you hear hay buhay??? 😁😁😁

wohoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Better visuals than Victor Magtanggol
2022 gon be a good year for Valo aye
cool
Lol she is Pinay? She said hay Buhay! HAHAHAHA
Tagalog: Kontrolado ko to. *means: I can control this. This might be a small teaser for Neon's lore, in where a specific time she cannot control her ultimate electric power that may cause a tragedy to her loved ones or team.
🥳🇵🇭
🤯🤯🤯🤯
When she said "Hay buhay..." I felt it in the core. 😫😫😫
anotha waifuuuuuu❤️❤️
Slide cancle mode
Can you all just imagine a movie with all the valorant agents? How cool that would  be.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHAT THE HECK NOICE I REALLY WANT TO SEE THE PREFECTION OF VALORANT WITH A NEW AGENT AND ALSO THE LANGUAGE THAT SHE USE IS FILIPINO LANGUAGE(my national language) LETSS GOO TO VALORANT AND THE VOICE ACTOR OF NEON LESSS GOOOOOOOOOO!
I need the song
Now im sure this made all them specter run and gunners happy
INDO PRIDE
snatcher yarn
So no one's gonna talk about how thick she is?
wow Pilipina ung dubber ni Neon nice!!!!
SO HYPE, music is just perfectly picked
The animations always show all out war, running, looking more like apex than the true valorant gameplay. Sometimes i wish Valorant would be more fast paced in general.
xinyan？？？
Lets get it. coolest agent ever
YOO IM EXCITED FOR THIS
Dude, they even implemented the lag on our country. 15 fps each game. Damn, keep it up guys.
I'm fully sure that her ultimate  would be super open and it would have to be nerfed
cant wait for this agent by the way when Indian agent will come
Riot please do a custom knife of a walis tambo or walis ting ting design! Pleeaaase
KAY O main be like after NEON ult, hmmmmmm
please please make a series for valorant I beg of you
Yoru's daughter
i really dislike the choice of music for the trailer. I just don’t think that it fits the character
INFINITE POWEEERRRR
shtttt this givess me goosebumpsss 🥵🥶
Sage: now, the team is waiting come on Neon simps: 🐵LOUD MONKEY NOISES 🐵
0:13 Aheago character
ohh shes sooooo cute
Why is the animation like 10 fps
New Easy get out agent Jett : 🥲 Chamber : 👀 Yoru  : 💀
finally cypher survived 2 new agent trailers
PHILIPPINES NUMBER 1!!!!!
Run And Gun , one of the reasons i quit this game
Is that agent made from Philippines? I am filipino and she said "Controlado ko to" its tagalog
I love the little part when Sage walks in and Neon almost feels as if she'd be thought of as weird or something for what she'd done to her space and Sage says "it's beautiful" Its like the feeling of acceptance washes over her. Sweet little subtle moment completely!
Me : THIS AGENT IS SO COOL Neon : singing with a toothbrush. Me : i take it back 1% Me again : watches the video again. Me again again : sees she is also singing with a mirror. Me : 2%
aite indian agent when
jett will be sad i think
Run and Gun baby
a sonic tails mashup? yes please XD
Imagine trying to hit a headshot on this agent. Lol
she like phoenix?
Knew it was going to be electricity/lightning based because of the final emblem this season. Just as how Chamber's watch was the final emblem (not epilog) the season before he was released.
TEAM PILIPINAS BASKETBALL JERSEY #5
op agent calornt but pizz no buges agent
Bijli ka bill tera baap bharega??
I think Valorant has found it's formula for revealing new characters, just like we have Champion spotlight for League, x champion reveal for Legends of Rounterra and that Mike bot for TFT. Good job
The porn artists are on it
This third version chancellor Palpatine looks kinda different than the other 2...
I Love You Riot! <3 <3 <3  Laban Pilipinas,Puso!
This is the closest I’m going to get to having infamous in a real shooter so I’m pretty stoked.

It looks like reynas glove
So she can enter the avatar state
I don't like Jett's gameplay but Neon's got my attention
FILIPINO AGENT WOOO
New agent is bad in so many ways.
They added Octane to Valorant
Stup1d instapickers won't let you play...
guess who dies at 1:02?
Valorant tatti
The target audience for this needs to either die or grow up so we can stop this bullshit of a gaming industry that we have been left with..
Rule 34 artist are fast AF
Counter Strike has been looking crazy lately!
Valorant: Warzone
2x phoenix walls + overwatch type ultimate That's cool
1st time i saw sage in the trailer as a 3d animation.
man wish this agent was never getting agent, it’s ruining val in my opinion

HOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! PILIPINAS  I LOVE YOU VALORANT
Philippine agent, LESGOOO
Why she look like zeri
3,069,713 16 hours
Me waiting to race Jett
This is gonna be epic
HEY.....THATS PRETTY GOOD
seems like run&gun isn't nerfed after all
I think i understand how her dash and electrification may work (at 0:52).  So im assuming this is her E because the other two skills are just utils and not the so called "signature" ability, meaning that it can be recharged with kills (since she is probably a duelist). The way i think it works is that you click it, and you go in this electrified mode where you run faster and you can still shoot at the enemies. I'm assuming it will last for something like 3-4 seconds and you can interrupt the ability beforehand by simply crouching, making it so that you do a slide before the ability is over. So the entirety of the clip at 0:52 is done in one single motion, you cant just dash whenever you want or run fast whenever you want. It seems strong but i'm assuming players will need to capitalize on those 3-4 seconds of electrification to entry on a site and/or score some take downs. Seems a pretty cool character by the looks of it! :D
I must admit, those are unhuman abilities, like running and sliding? Insane.      The music is actually fire tho
en vrai le perso en jeu a l'aire pas ouf (pas très bien graphiquement )mais dans le trailer il est mega beau
Honestly.. im kinda cringing rn cuz of her ULT. The rest of the skill looks good
another over powered agent?
Any Pheniox main here?? How are you guys doing? 😂
Now my friends cant get mad at me for rushing, let’s go!
Ghuss ke maaro sabko....lol
Noone has the brains for this agent but me
Yes filipina agent 💓
Nakakaexciteeee 🤩
“Hayy. Buhay”
PepeJam
good
What the did i just hear tagalog?
YESSS A GIRL AGENT
Skills 2 long wall like phoenix, (Probably ult) Speedboost (run n gun) (also the lightning skill i think) (signature skill) Slide ( C skill) a bouncing stun (Q skill)  and i think shes a controller, based on her line "Kontrolado ko to" means Im controlling this or I control this  you can throw other ideas if you want...
Snatcher sa palengke
NEW MAIN
Bro i can watch this all day
I was Shock When I heard Hay buhay im very proud as filipino
It's Filipino!!!
I'm surprise she has the same powers as Zeri. If Valorant is another parallel universe of runeterra, I'd assume she's a parallel version of Zeri.
Neon sleep like miles
too op
One word T H I C C
@1:35 "amboboko" 🤣🤣
i love yoru but he's getting completely useless by the day. lol this is kinda sad. please at least make smth out of his flashes. this is such a cool character to the mix tho

Lezzzzzgooooo

As a Filipino, this touched my soul...
Where's duterte
I don't think sage will win the race.
Apex players be like :  oh finally we can crouch slide now in valorant (evil smile) hehe ! 1:02
1:00 this is fortnite xd
guessing duelist?
Literally the e girl
Walistambo Supremancy
NEON is just going apex the entire game.
DEAAAAAAAAMMMMMMM !!!
Omg best 🗿
Jett : "Finally.. A Worthy Opponent.... Our battle will be LEGENDARY!!"
Sage:"Race you there" Neon: sprints Sage: throws a slow orb and a wall sage: "i thought you were supposed to be fast?!"
why so lagging?  10 fps? 😫😵‍💫😵‍💫
This agent has taken run and gun to a whole another level
SHES THAT GURL
Buong pinas neon main!
this is crazy as fuck man
So excited to watch this. Thank you Valorant for having an agent from the Philippines.
I love cat 🐈
haaaay buhay
I very much look forward to playing this agent.   Her ultimate gives me quake one lightning gun vibes.
*ANG ALAMAT NG ELECTRICITY BILL SA MERALCO*
Congrats on Animated Series of The Year, and thank you for making the greatest game of our time.
run and gun at its best
FILIPINOS ARE VERY HAPPY
sheeeeeeeesh <3
Riot: abilities don’t kill
WAG KANG BASTOS!! Girl version
I cant wait combime odin with her
we know 1 thing about valorant trailers they using irons to make trailer
Winston?
Is it just me or she looks like Hidilyn Diaz?
I-N-S-A-N-E... See you there! ;)
she never skips leg day
once she put up those walls shivers down to my spine
she literally bought a walis tambo
she's going to be to broken, she's gonna need a debuf after a few updates
Lestgooooooooooooo
MOMMY!
Is no one going to talk about how nice sage is? Like she called the decorations beautiful and asked to race Neon.
The voice actor not really my type but aight.
finally found someone who can charge my laptop in a second     ultra fast charging
wow
PROUD FILIPINO 😂
RnG shit
Dude i waited soo long for this kind of agent😍😍
cant wait to get her as a filipino here i am really happy rn
Oh she is from Boracay.
she us gonna be broken guys
bruh just awsome riot love this i guess she is goin to be the strongest agent
Yes neon is hereee😌let's goooo🔥
NEW WUAIFU MAYBE GUYS!!!???
I have to main her
When Neon comes i'll be back to
Good to see valorant finally embracing precise gunplay
As always REYNA is the best
YOOO! neon can​ slide too
HAY BUHAYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!
The first Philippines character in Valorant
Yay another ability to cancel  -Kay/o(probably)
They should have included a Filipino translation for Disruption. Anyway, Lezzzgo Neon!
God pleaseee valorant release the mobile version of this game i want to play this character so bad , i aint got any pc to play valorant plus aint got no time to go to a computercafe . But i do got a gaming phone ready to ply val 🤩😂🤣
Ability's don't kill. -Someone said that
LESGOOOOO
get valorant 32 bit
Well, maybe there will be a new challenger for Jett, but Jett still looks better than her
Best one so far 😝
precise gunplay
Youtube: shows a character with a hint of being filipinos  Filipinos: you summoned us, fool creature
She's Jett's Sister !! ♥️♥️🔥🔥
The White House has always denied creating chaos in Kazakhstan! But the Ukrainian script cannot be denied by the White House! We all know who created the Ukrainian color revolution!
Finally no flash
Sage really gives a motherly vibe huh😩
This new agent will change the concept of this game
Fokin DOOOOOPPPPPPEEEEE
YES! The NEW member of Valorant. 😁⚡⚡🔫
One thing riot has to be given credits for is creating sick and better game trailers then most I've ever seen
Gun run the better version
I personally dont like agents with overly weird abilities being in a fps game, lasers and weird movement is imo not good for the game, rest of the kit seems cool. Only other agent i dont like is Yoru, i think his ult is just weird and off putting, feels like it doesn't belong in the game, i hope her abilities and their effects fit well with the game.
Also this begs the question: how will clips like aces and clutches look?
Jo that Energy makes her look like a Ancient God
love it
Omg I just fkcn love sage's voice, she's just perfect bitch
When the new agent came out?
did i just hear Controlado ko to??
New agent already?! I'm so tired to collect it.
Once she releases, the amount of dodge queues will make me go insane!
Pinoy Pride! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
When champion for Indonesia can be made? I'm just waiting for champion from my country 😅
Warzone and apex combined
daaaaammmmmnnnn
1:02 timestap for the newest Cipher death
She will be op asf
PEOPLE running and gunning the whole match...🏃🏃🏃 Riot : I'm gonna nerf R&G and end this man's whole career ALSO RIOT: Introducing NEON,🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️⚡⚡
Why haven't they added water yet
Jett: Race you to the spike sites! Neon: would you like me to slide or not?
3M views less than 24 hours !! Money in the air for riot !! No 🧢 !
That walis tambo (broom stick) @2:15 gives it a nice Filipino touch.
This is awesome !!! Filipino's are Rising !!! 🔥🔥🔥
Rebayb mi jett
"Kontrolado ko 'to."  DAMN.
hugyos szar cég
Sarap panoorin ng paulit-ulit. Ang angas ni Neon! 😍
OMG WE LOVE A SKINNY PINAY <3 T_T IM CRYING
You should... NOW!
when pheonix and jett go for date the result will be neon..😂😂😂
Now we know why Meralco charges us a lot! It's because of video games! 🤭
when the agent available....
All great untill i saw the ult...
Pinay Agent??? No way! Who would've thought Philippines would get the next spotlight in the list of agents.  Thank you Valorant!!
Valorant Mobile! when??!!!
Tang ina Pinoy raw pero hind nag wawalis? NAKAKAHIYA  Hindi na nga rin lang sumusu.ot ng tsinelas, ano ba? Pang hype lang tlga wla substance
ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
i see, mabilis snatcher to sa jeep. hahahhahah
Perfect mix between a duelist, controller and initiator
Why does I get the caitlyn vibe from the league?
Let's go Filipino agent whoo🎉
PH pride 🇵🇭
omg
Valorant has the best graphic designers
Flash are u here ?
wt
her ult looks liek its very op and unbalanced but its okay
Uy, May walis haha
didn't know "kontrolado ko to" can sound so powerful, I hope riot can make her say some filipino words when you're playing her. Example, when she whiff make her say "Tanginaaaaa"
Neon lookin' cute😳
phoenix and yoru's daughter :V
HEY VALOS!, I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEE AN INDIAN AGENT!
The flash new agent
Ganda....Soliddd!!!
Problem reported: mass run and gun Riot be like: add a agent who is made for run and gun
I am honestly concerned about VALORANT's future if this is how the game is going to progress. All that VALORANT needs is to update Agents on a regular basis and Patches with something useful in it instead of some random stuff. And still there is not VOD reviewer in this game. The main reason why VALORANT was successful was because of their primary Agent roster. We need more of that kind and not these gimmicky stuff. KAY/O and Chamber was ok, but Agents like Astra, Yoru and now Neon is absolutely mind boggling. Like who comes up with these ideas? Firstly, Balance the current game, Secondly, Balance the guns, Thirdly, stop with these gimmicks. This agent's arsenal is absolutely absurd. In what world is running X times faster a tactical ability and in what world is casting a pair of giant walls tactical, like dude its not even small to begin with. That thing was huge that it covered the whole B bombsite. And thirdly, the ultimate ability is a straight up copy from OW. There is nothing tactical, running and shooting a laser? Sprinting, sliding and shooting, like dude........ All I want is this message to be read by multiple people. Thank You.
nandidiro ako sa filipina accent
Do they want the COD community playing val too? Lol
I’m just waiting for series like arcane based on Valorant lore ;3
Ok relax riot
AHHHHH
I hope she will say " putang ina" whenever she kill someone🤣🤣🤣
THICC🤤
Proud to be a Filipino 💯❤️🙏
I think this the first “self buff” agent
"Wir befinden uns in einer Kollektiv-Psychose"
PILIPINOS SUMMONED
I see run and gun. I play.
Thanks…but we are good
goddddd agent
Is this stop motion?
🌑
Who else is watching this for the 10x time?
SHES GORGEOUS OH MY GOD
She thicc and cool as fuck ok she is one of us Filipino but if she doesnt trash talk is she even filipino at this point i mean she's a babe only sometimes those kind of filipino dont trash talk but i love how she sings because no matter the voice you can sing
Jett: Finally. A worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary.
i told yall run and gun is op
HAy Buhay
A new overpowerd agent :)
"KONTROLADO KO TO" Not sure if I can control my excitement 😍
Valorant's getting an electric agent League's getting another electric champ as well Riot definitely planned this
Ys
It's like a combo of yoru, phoenix and Jett just wow!!!
damn that booty
Make some noise Filipinos!!!!!
First of all, this trailer is one of the most exciting one I’ve seen in a while. Editing is just on point. Second, this champion seem to be my next main 😌
controlado koto
Star finger!? Ora Ora Ora Ora Oraaaaaaaa!!!
whoa the ult lookin like a running tesla tower
They be making Dope Music.
aaaaaa yeyy
0:53 “Flint Lockwood’”
Shes, sage breach phoenix jett sova and yoru  all in one
Woóooooooooahhhhhhhhh,riot is the best in making trailers😍
Changing and styling her room is difinitely a Filipino
Cypher not dying ??? Impossible
uhhhm. Is this not Zeri?
Ayy...buhay...
This a banger
Why do I have a feeling that we'll have a hanger knife on the next bundle.. 🤔🤔
It's basic to outplay this agent lmao
Looks really cool but I have a suggestion for the future agents y'all are gonna release. I see that you guys are all for representation then can you please add an Indian agent already? You have a Mumbai server and it is one of the largest player bases. Ig you think that an Indian accent would be funny on a character so that's why y'all don't wanna risk it but if you're truly inclusive, try representing a country which brings in half of your revenue first.
Duellocumu
Yaaaaas she's here to normalize running and gunning
omayyyyyyyyyyy
actually god editor
I don't know but yoru is my favorite
RULE34
I could literally watch a movie about each valorant agent, their just too good
LET GOOOO BABYYYY
Wag kang bastos
pilipin pride haha
Riotttt Viper pleaseeeeeee
Would it be cool if there is an agent that can control metal?
This animation is so unrealistic, I mean. . . an Asian with her shoes stomping her bed?? AIYOoOOOooOOOooOOooOOo
Just the trailer is out and im already simping....  Yes we exist...
with this Trailer Valorant will be a legendary game
Why do i know, that i cant play cypher normally when she‘s in the game?
Represent!  🇵🇭 🇵🇭🇵🇭🔥🔥
i think this agent will be hot and strong in the game
After Jett Reyna and Raze she will going to be my next main ❤️😍
Yo Winston what are you doing here
Finally, I can main the stinger and my team wont complain
Letsgoo my next main 😍❤️
interesting
LESFREAGGINGOOOOOOOOOO!!!! FINALLY THERES A FILIPINO IN VALORANT SHEEEEEESH!!!!
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
As a fellow Filipino I really love how both the voice actor for Neon and the artist of the song are both Filipina, not only that I love the Pilipinas aka Philippine national basketball team jersey hung on the wall and that Neon is speaking a bit of Tagalog in the trailer.
Me: "They cant add another duelist"  Riot Games: Neon and Yoru rework
Is Jett revive me guy from the Philippines?
I AM SO EXCITED
AYY YLONA GARCIAAAAA
what's she mumbling while dead?
I AM SCREAMING LETSSS GOOOOOOOOOO🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
after she got revived by sage it looked like echo from overwatch
filipina valorant hero leets gooo
She is a electricity user I love electric abilities ❤️
why so many black characters?
is she minato namikaze ??
Valorant open my mind , open my eyes , open my heart .
now the "killua" weebs finally have an agent to main :D
Looks similar to Zeri from LOL. Same character?
I love this ❤️
singing voice?? and Talking voice? bruh
fuck this new champ, they killed yoru now they killed phoenix. how am I gonna play phoenix when there's a sassy kilua running and gunning ur whole ass team. 1/10 terrible character design, would not recommend for children to swallow.
The person reading this comment: I wish you great success, love, health, and happiness!  Stay connected 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Yayy lezzego ITS'S APEX NOW
Want an Indian Agent asap.
Neon: “Ay Buhay…”  Every Filipino be like:  *LET’S GOO! REPRESENT! REPRESENT!*
IM SO HAPPI IM SO H A P Y
pinoyy pridee wahahahaha
THIS SONG IS A BOPPPP
Pa Ra Mee
walis tambo cameo
Firee🔥🔥🔥 lock neon = run and gun activated!
Damm a new main😊😊
i can already hear jetts voicelines proclaiming shes the fastest ._.
Mga pilipino we must rise✊🏼✊🏼🇵🇭🇵🇭
Well... This was an underwhelming character reveal. Was looking forward for something bit more exciting tbh.
Her name fits perfectly. Instant crush for me.  Also very cool beats! How can a game help me discover so many new artists to listen to?!
You guys have the greatest video editor in trailers i've ever seen ❤️❤️😍😍 i like it sooo much
Neon: "whips out finger gun" Me: remembers my pinoy childhood
i got goosebumps when she said “Kontrolado ko to” in english it means “I control this” 🖤
Walis tambo
Kontrolado ko 'to!
SO GOOD!!
It already scares me, Judge and this agent
Sheeesh
This song is a VIBE
1:18 ofcourse filipina sings
I wonder, when Jett and Neon together as teammate, what kind of conversation they will have in-game?
Haay Buhay 😍
Was so exciting till they literally gave her a finger gun?
Im sooo excited for this agent!!
ok change my mind im definitely going to main her
Godddd even chamber's abilities weren't so exciting. That ultimate from finger tips and those two blue walls damn it's lookin' so much awesome, can't wait to see jett's competitor on the Valorant maps.. 💯
1:00 a whole new meaning to "ferrari peek"
Neon Bonifacio ❣️😫
LESSSGGGOOOOOO A FILIPINO AGENT
The run and gun was already not sufficient so they introduced a agent which focuses on run and gun😂😂
such a dope champ.. such a shit game :/
SHOTUGUN ON NEON TO BE MY MAIN
HAY BUHAY
Is te same new champion as legue
aruy di naghubad ng sapatos inakyat pa sa kama HAHAHAHAHA
OFC SHE IS A BASKETBALL PLAYER(•̀ᴗ•́)و🇵🇭🏀
💥💥💥
Neon: *fast* Rule34 artist:"Let's see about that"
My new main 😌
LESSSGOOOO 🇵🇭🇵🇭
pls make anime of valorant
This agent is sponsored by meralco unang kidlat pinas lang mapupundihan
Wow. Mby my new main 🤩

The song is addictive. Do you agree or not??
Yownnnn jsjsjejfhurhfjhs

HERE WE GO PHL
She is Filipino?
rng
im already receive 100days ban and this is coming? haihhhh
I love her already, no questions asked
She really said "Hayy Buhay" that so arrrgghhh! 100% Filipina!!!
Officially shifting from jett to neon. Dayummm
this is good in the whole picture : fken bloody ssssss$$$$hit for gameplay
I can't stop playing this game just because of such amazing trailers.
after yoru and chamber trailers its ok ig
1:45 I thought she was from Japan till I heard this line. It means "I can control this" in pinoy language.
it was like a movie so good
One of the best agent trailer right here.
PILIPINAS ❤
I like the vibe of this agent
phenix meats wattson
Did i see this right ? She can shoot easy when she run and she can run very fast ??? Maybe a char for every cod player ,all shooter beginners more fucked then bevor then.
Ikaw pala ang dahilan kung bakit trending ang Filipinx 😂
PHILIPHINES LESSGOOOOOOOOO SHE SAID KONTROLADO KO TO
FINALLY A PINAY AGENT
Homegirl got an absolute wagon
it's almost like valorant is promoting rng. i love the character though
Same theme as zeri I think spark spark lightning speed⚡
Meaning of "run and gun"
another duelist her lets gooo
FILIPINO VIEWERS/PLAYERS WE THRIVIN
Sage's voice omg❤❤
is neon dualist
I'm in love
LESSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
jett but with double viper walls and laser ult. got it.
She enters the avatar state in her ult
Jett's little sister?
Imagine Jett and Neon entering site together 😱🤯
MAKE A INDONESIAN AGENT PLEASEEEE
SEA represent (i hope from Indonesia, Malaysia or Singapore but atleast we have one represent) keep up the work Valorant!
New pinay characters
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GOOSEBUMPS
So she's basically Sonic
DAMN!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAA ANG GANDAAAAA
where all the fat sweaty nerds gunna play
Now i want malaysian agents :(
sooo riot is releasing the same champ in valorant and league lmao
make next character of Indian ethnicity 😳
Reyna, I think you have a competition.  Meanwhile Sova:Nothing escapes my sight.
1:01 the aspin!! so cute:)
Just perfect for asuna.
100% gonna get nerfed after a week 😂
you cant tell me this isnt inspired by miles morales. spider electricity music sure also filipino nice
Neon is not as broken as jett, since she cannot dash out instantly. She needs to run out which is not broken and operator player can still kill her.
I lost my shit when she threw up her walls. that was glorious
Neon: *EXISTS* Rule34 artists: he he it's our time
Is she duelist or initiator?
New definition of run&gun
spiderverse type of animation?
I love how well this trailer was put together. The combination of the well edited gameplay montage combined with animated elements in sync with the music, it's just perfect.
SHE GOT A DUMPY
Why does this have like 15fps?
Sheeeeesh
This is the BEST trailer out of all agents! Great job riot!
Please tell me cyphers tripwire will stop this agent atleast 😂😂
anyone found the sound track on Spotify yet
Ahh yes a character from the Philippines. Of course some singing is involved. 😅
I LOST
1:13 is she a filipina?
Run and Gun ok
That walis tambo in the background. :D
She wore her shoes on bed,  she's not a Filipino
Why its not clean?
Saw this new cool trailer. Install the game, i still cant aim Lose 5 games in row ger yelled at by some ADHD kid  Unistall
Loved it 😍
Whats her ult do? Finger taser gun? Its range is short and take a long time to kill enemies. Probably get dead by headshot first lol.
jesus christ.
Daughter of Phoenix and Jett, UwU
Damm so you can see through opponents behind when she uses her wall too . Seems like she's gonna be an op agent
When valorant mobile will come?
wait, is she run and gunning
What a run n gun 🤯🤯🤯
Jett and phoenix + kAY/0 =
Ty valorant for giving me a Filipino agent I live to filipines so yeah my brother tell me about it to
cant get enough of this
Octane confirm
Ok now i get who s gonna to be my main after yoru
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
Finally, not a reskin of Yoru
It is officially confirmed that Ylona Garcia is canon in the valorant universe.
lessgo pilipino!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eyy Ylona
wth is that ult
YEAAASHHH BABY!!
Seems lit
I love that she was singing, Filipino’s be loving karaoke 🥳
When i put too much drama on homework... :D
Tfw she has a broom even though she has a vacuum
Haay buhay nga naman!
She is absolutely freaking amazing.
Hell yea!
IS THAT SAGE ANIMATED??!?!?!
neon thick tho !!!
matigas titi ko
HAHAHA IF SHE GETS A KILL/ACE SHE CAN SAY: "SANA OL"  with a mocking voice ofc
Neon: *uses Ult* Also Neon: UNLIMITED POWEEER!!
Valorant players be like : *BYE BYE JETT* XD
Her ult is literally broken
Is valorant out of budget for quality cinematic trailers?
Neon main na ata ako
apex player gonna be slide slide slide like a samurai
No more jett only neon lets gooo
When will i see her in a game ?
She looks sick as FUCK as an entry fragger.
basically another seraphine ffs
Everything is on point, even her way of speaking is very natural. Buti di Meralco name niya.
Pinoy
tang ina update agad para goods
No gun needed with her
Gonna main her
Sigh..... *Buhay* Hits different""
All I gotta say is  PRECISE GUNPLAY
just don't let her get near Reyna
Manifesting Filipino curse words on her voice lines
Joltion I Choose You!
Today's chaos in Kazakhstan! We saw the same show in Ukraine a few years ago!
Bro yoru’s trailer is the best by far
has jett and fenix got a baby?
YASSSS!!!! ❤️
I believe she's gonna be an OP agent because Electric bill here in the Philippines is also OP asf ⚡
powered By Meralco HAHAHAAH
RIOT what is this trailer its awsome
omg so coool ;o
2:23 sage should say "its wonderful"  not beautiful
One thing I’m excited about is “What’s her voice lines during matches”
At this point, Riot has just embraced the "Precise Gunplay"🥴😂  But yeah this agent is pretty sick😁❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 Looking forward to grind for it and bottom frag using it🥴
But will she be able to curve her walls too?? 🤔
Most beautiful trailer until now! Riot you outdid yourselfs <3
so, she is the combination of Jett, Phoenix, Viper, Yoru, breach and Kay/0 maybe rebibe too?
😭😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
best agent trailer
they said "lets throw jett, pheonix, and stormtrance warlock all into one character" and went with it
Thats jett
When this agent will be available
Mid
Nice
NICE AGENT RIOT
The broom is so Asia🤣🤣
I like how she also sings 😭
Why are CYPHERS always harmed in these trailer. JUSTICEFORCYPHER.
New agent is Gwyneth Chua
She brings a completely different meaning to the term "gun runner".
She is the lost grandchild of Palpatine, ngl
Toothbrush is now the new mic🙂
well we now have another agent for people to instalock instead of jett
Overwatch Tracer Fake ??????
If pheonix and flash had a child
as if run and gun isnt already a problem... we got a whole agent dedicated to doing that, nice riot .... also fuck phenix too
Yes guys, she is filipino, i mean filipina
Cool agent, spectre nerf incoming for sure
ylona garcia is her fave artist huh
Riot Games representation is the thing that brought me to them and is what’s keeping me with them.
Did she just say "hay buhay"?
Hopefully not another op ez agent like Raze and jett that ppl can spam and rank up without skills.
I can only imagine so many bugs
gonna ruin the game
Wow Pretty cool Neon lightning nice song valorant Thank you
dictionary updated: run  and gun
Please optimize the game also please
dam new character seems op and cool
I'm still waiting for a Agent that is from Myanmar
REPPIN THE FILIPINOS 🇵🇭
Oh, my God, it's such a beautiful trailer, I can't stop watching it. I hope the skılls is as amazing and powerful as the video.
Run and gun go bruuuuuuh 🏃‍♀️
when he got shot Neon said "Kontrolado ko to" Means (I can Manage this) It's Filipino language
Man I hope this trend of low framerate animation ends soon.
🇵🇭
So tru ba na may manila map???? Can't waitttt
bruh swear to god, that riot had to make valorant animation series like arcane
Sheeeshhh
The United States CIA continues to intervene in Kazakhstan! We will also overthrow the current regime in Taiwan! We will implement reciprocal measures against the Taiwan government!
imagine someone with 90 ping and peeking with this speed XD
I love that we get some representation in these games 😍
damnnn, the views just keep going up, for comparison, it took chamber's trailer video 2 days, to reach 2 million views. This has 2.8 million in 13 hours
i can't wait -_- PLS DO A MAJ NOW
probably fun to play but gonna suck to fight tbh
SHEEEIEIIE
This agent is terrifying can’t wait to get hands on this agent :3(absolute monsterous duelist)
sheeesh it so cool best movement agent better than jett and raze also
What country is this new Agent From??
Omfg this gonna be lit 🔥
no flash? damn... i expected a flash with a new agent XD
Neon ult reminds me of Imani from Paladins. My fav character.
Loved ittt 😘😘🥰🥰🥰
neon is from meralco
Filipino LETS GO!!!!!!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭❤️❤️❤️
1:03 Rip Cypher (again)😂
Can someone with knowledge tell me which language is that 1:41
Damn #1 trending wow how this game has grown
ETO PALA UNG PUTANGINANG FILIPINX
This is gonna be a problem 😭🤣
I bet her passive is that run n gun accuracy is increased
No matter what it’s about or who it’s about, phoenix is in almost every major cinematic for some reason
Jett + Phoenix = Neon Sage's daughter??
Please make an Indian agent
do we really need a movement agent
bat ako naghihintay na sabihin nya "PUTANGINA"
wtf.....
taking precise gunplay to a new level
Mah new girlfriend
MINNAL MURALI😂
So she is going to make run and gun accuracy more better.
that is dope
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!??? cool trailer..cool music..cool agent
This is Probably the best agent  trailer I've seen
Best thing about this is both the VA of Neon and singer of the song are filipinos.
Nerf her already! 🔥
😩😩😩🥴🥴
a literal run and gun agent PERFECT Lets uninstall
yoro sad
Call of Duty BO3 Overdrive
Cringe agent.....look at that wall. Phoenix is crying rn
Valorant x Apex Legends Crossover character
PrEcIse GuNpLaY
Woah she actually speaks tagalog XD
Curyente yung abilidad kasi laging nagblablackout
Hayyyyy buhay 😩
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
MOMMY SORRY i mean sorry MOMMY
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
Woahhhhh
So she can run fast and be an annoying target, make walls on both sides of her, can track enemies, got a molly, and her ult is zapping enemies to death? This is one broken agent 😂🔥
sage: "race you there?" neon: "this is my afterima-"
zeti
ahhhhhhhhhhhh so coolllll
Basically Riot uses LoL designs to make Valorant characters.
Maligayang pagdating! Panindigan ko kami ng mabuti! 🇵🇭🔥
i am flash

Yo the flash?

My new Main. :)
the fact that she's filipino is epic
lets see
Valorant: run and gun isnt real, run and gun cant hurt you... *the run and gun*...
Nah what is this riot. How you gonna put the exact same character in league and act like we aint notice. Literally same style and both use electricity, this is literally zeri.
I already see a smurf coming
Walis tambo melee weapon petition!! 😂😂
lets gooo
lets also thank sage for the revive
This characters wall will be a nightmare to the campers in split :)
Precise gunplay…?
shes bhad
Looks broken, please nerf it before the Destiny 2 noobs get a hold of it
For those who doesn't understand "controlado ko to" it means "I can control this"
my team mate: how you dead? *finger
In dont like this new update. She is to overpowered..
I head something at 1:41! What could it be?!
The slide peak mechanic reminds me a lot of Destiny 2
Valorant and League adding electric-based characters
THANK YOU, VALORANT!!!!!!
OMG OMG FILIPINA AGENT YES!!! LESGOOO NEON!!!

Valorant: We listen to the community. Players: So you're going to fix the run and gun problem, right? Valorant:  Players: You're going to fix the run and gun problem, right?  Valorant: *makes a faster run and gun agent*
DID SHE JUST SAY AY BUHAY? I CANT IM GONNA CRY
Thanks for not adding flash to this Duelist😁
Is anyone gonna talk about how the new philipino agent gets rebibed to use her ulti 🤣 I don't think riot did this randomly
octane sister goes to valorant
Let's go Morena sya! Proud to be Filipino
how to counter this shi
Man we need a whole movie for the story of Valorant in this sorta animation
after seeing this i want to see a movie for valorant
This game is aids would recommend
Can she curse ingame though in tagalog ofc
oh boy can't wait to get slid on and blasted with finger lasers.
looks fun to play ngl
So cool 🤩
Abe god agent be 😀😀😀😀😀
SHEEEESH
tracer??!!
Holy shit she looks so strong
“Hetong sayo! KATAPUSAN MO NA REYNAAAAAAA!!!!” “Shutacca Sage!”
Im going B Ascent with viper and neon damn
Finally I can stop getting dogged for not standing still when I take my shots
Golden Days For RnG Players Are Coming I can Feel It :(
he he he haw
She is wild🤤
Best agent is here
So, a Filipino girl came in and rekt Jett, Phoenix and Chamber while ice skating in Snowball Fight. It's time for DOOM and Quake mains to come over.  I love this game so much
"shooting while running isn't enough so let's slide!"
Jett: Finally, a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!
fbi knows how much i played this over and over again
The smoke wall wth
She is Philipina
she looks cool af what the heck
Another amazing cinematic and yet another dead Cypher😂
Jett 2: electric boogaloo
Every filipino after watching  Galing ng pilipino iwagayway!
neon go brrr...
I Don't Know Why But I First Think She is a initiator.  :3
that is sick!
Hit em with the Teslapeak
With this ult I can roleplay palpatine
CONTROLADO KOTO
Run n gun in its finest
My reaction is just so happy and OMG
If her ult is giving enemies electic shock wouldn't that be useless to radiants? They can just 1 tap her?
valorant be like: presenting new character neon pros: this is going to elevate the level of gameplay meanwhile, plastice - silver players - basically now more run AND SLIDE and gun (phoenix + jett + kayo) ah shit here we go again
I wish this trailer never ended
wow it s cool
Y'all noticed that her gloves look similar to KJs. Look how she inspired this girl.
Yep, there will be a new maps, im sure,the lack power solved and they will turned on the portal
jett:
So when it will release and yoru rework?
This is the most exiting valorant agent trailer
Valorant just getting awesome year by year. Love the song the animation and the character.
Plot Twist : Sage saying " race u there " and throwing slow orb so she can't run ...lol lol lol
Yeah New agent
ez new main...ez radiant
Val just simping to TenZ
been watching this for 1000 times
She runs quick so can she get better aim while running and gunning just asking
She looks cute and OP
What in the run and gun
She bring a walis tambo overseas hmmm
She is obviously not gonna be able to run and gun
0:05 THICC
PINOY OF VALORANT RISE
cant wait to buy- i mean earn hard for this agent
Can't wait to use her and slide right into a cypher's trapwire
mood of most filipino most of the time 0:38 "hay buhay" lmao
WAAAAAHHHHHHHH
Can't wait to play her
ok i have three letters wtf
LETS GOOOOWWW
I want to be the reason you break your monitor. And riot just gave me all the tools I need to do that.
YLONA SLAY !!!
val is becoming apex
Bro she is zapping everyone
Much wow!!!
RIOT DID IT AGAIN BOIS, THEY DID IT AGAIN .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  THEY KILLED CYPHER AGAIN IN THIS VIDEO :(
she has a mixed voice jett & kj  <3
Hay buhay neon says?!!!
Full rng
My favourite part about this trailer is how the vacuum doesn't even have a cable :D
Riot:  Run and gun : NOPE!! Run and ability : OHH YEAH!! 😎😎
Lol riot games releasing 2 electric characters at the same time Zeri in league of legends  And neon in valorant
Somehow palpatine returned
Gonna get me back into valo
WARZONERANT
I love how riot is making two very similar design/concept characters out at once in both valorant and league of legends. Short twin tail, electric sparks, xDD
Sage : i see youve made a few changes The changes :
this agent would help a lot
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
and know god level peeking is available in this new agent
THIS SONG IS FIRE AND SO IS THE VIDEO
Les go proud to be filipino
aah wow
philipino agent
I swear to god, if Neon doesn't have an interaction with Jett which she says "Jett rebayb mi! " I'm gonna mald.
Wait! What the fuck?
This is the Wattson I'm talking about
valorant plzz give us an indian agent
Too op balance the mf game first
When she gets revived does she say "controlado ito?"
we have slid cancle now
sage: Race you there neon: SAY NO MORE
Apex players would feel right at home with this character
Am I the only one feeling the love chemistry between Neon and Sage?
similar to wraith  haha  😍
welp we playing apex i guess
wheres the filipino gang?!?!?!?
apex players gonna love this
mommy
puyrrr yas kween
She is over powered in my opinion
Finally, no cypher died in this cinematic.
The most Anime hair Ever
Dem neon is filipina
LOL tagalog?
"Kontrolado ko 'to" jeezz  Salamat Riot!!!
oh poor phoenix
"Precise Gunplay"
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
she us sooooooooooo good
Dooopeeee i loveee ittt. Reyna main but guess imma main this too ⏫
An agent who sing on her trailer video, yep definitely a Filipina agent
"race you there?"  *sage puts slow orb before the finish line
RNG!!! FICK THE GAME
🔥Bring it ON...
inspired by palpatine
Cod slides hahaha might get these because of it
everyone complaining about why its a bit laggy here in the PH: What lag?
Powerd by meralco
When she "died" She's saying "Im in control" or "I can control this" in Tagalog
Did yall see that (sage diff) she walls after revive!!! Damn haha
yoo valo's new agent's so similar to league's new champion
So excited
FILIPINO PRIDE!!!!!!!!!!!
I like those shoes ngl its so neet
Apex Legend ShootRun
Lessgo
buti naman hindi nila nakalimutan yung walis tambo
Mga snatcher sa divisoria: 0:50
she better have the "putang ina mo" voice line or i'll be so disappointed
after the masterpiece that is arcane, i'd love to see a show about valorant. but it would probably take years again lol
she is my new main
Delta and Omicron Variants in the news.. Me: Haaaay, Buhay~
Looks broken
Powered by : Meralco!
lmfao imagine neon swearing in filipino. It'd be cool and funny
Finally I can see my main Sage in animation
wow tht look awesome
i think jett will be jelous because she is faster and has better ability but with run and gun
bye bye jett!
Say with me "SPECIAL BEEAAAAAAAAM CANNON" 😂
Man she a super saiyan! XD
"Putang ina" voice line pls
did anyone else noticed that when neon was scanning her hand to enter access to the room, it was first denied?
deyyyyyyyyyyyyyyymmm Im so  excitedddddd... Filipino Pride Speed up eyyyy!!!
gusto ko makarinig ng mura galing kay neon
Precise gunplay shown at 0:53 riot telling us it is a feature now.
The guns tht Neon were using might be a clue tht those guns might get new skins?
Lets goo new duelist!!! And the song is cracked as always 😀😀
king ina si optimum pride pwowkeng ena si optimum pide
A FILIPINA AGENT😍😍😍
I think she said controladdo ito aka it can be controlled
finallyyyy SAGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Oh well time to run and gun
The ending is so whacking!
Now we know Neon also enjoys singing like in a karaoke, that's some typical Filipino trait right there.
one of the worst agent intros quality. I mean the quality is so bad. expected more from valorant
Can't wait to play Neon!
sage is always at the very end
She is Apex, Codm, and Overwatch in one whole package 👌🏻👌🏻
I want full song
KONTROLADO KO TO!!!! 💙⚡️
Fornite character.
You gotta be shittin me. Her abilities will fck up the game even more yeah thanks riot pls Release more OP agents
Phoenix but better
*RUN AND GUN INTENSIFIESSSS*
I think I'm about to simp 😍
imagine if this new agent's ultimate has an auto lock, it would legit make me not want to play the game anymore
nerf please
why her face looks like ZHC
I LOVE HERRRR CANT WAIT!! 🥰😍😍😍 MY NEW MAIN!!! Omg if there’s ever a Valorant show I would watch it!!!
In last why thay not use hindi word also. Did thay forget india and thay even play there game. I'm not hating here or anything but i just fell bad.
i love speed based characters
Oh , she is pinoy   Im gonna get her and experiment ...
Pilipinas 5 wooohh
This my type of agent like I totally a flanker and dont care where enemy are just go and kill all those bobos
Finger gun
ill main this agents its so nicee
Her ultimate reminds me of shaakti maan sorry
1 cypher died in the making of this trailer, a new record
Representation truly matters, the subtle nods to our language and how appropriately it was used, and the culture of how much we love basketball, music and singing, i didn't feel at all like it was forced, it was perfect
AYY BUHAY!! AHHHHHHHHH!
Let's goooooooooo, Now I can actually abuse the precise gunplay
It is copyrighted
Rule 34 pls no…
I like the abilities
IRL, I doubt Chinese agent will work with Filipino Agent. Unless Sage is Taiwanese. lol
Pinoy power lets go!!
The revive is her passive?
What has this game become? I thought running and gunning was bad enough alrd
Man the song and the trailer too perfect man keep grinding😍🔥
* precize gunplay *
FILIPINO PRIDE INTENSIFIED
SHEESH
LETSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Kpop hero pepepains
Now players won't be able to say "dude seriously, run and gun? ", cuz riot created a run and gun agent themselves.....
I WILL  WATCH THIS MOVIE
double viper walls ????, HELL YEAH
Looks like Jett has competition for the fastest now.
Best and catchiest trailer ever 😍🥵
OMG 😭💞
BRUUUUUUUUUUUUH THIS AGENT GONNA BE BROKEN LIKE LITRALLY THIS AGENT HAS SPEED HAX!!
Nice. An actual Filipino agent, still with her mother tongue and has a personality.

Her ult looks fun!
ackkkk omgggg
good editing must give them CREDITS NGL DOPE ONE..
This shot is going to be broken
The Filipina urge to sing during tooth brushing and cleaning the house.
valorant community: riot pls remove run n gun Riot: have a run n gun agent!
Awesome. Now Neon can ask Sage for the Spratly Islands and Panatag Shoal back.
Damn
Riot literally made a character that doesnt go everywhere with a mild jog and called it an ability
*precise gunplay intensifies*
this character is dumb
this agent gonna ruin this game
Its that a filipino language?
I don't know if I am correct or not but I have a strong feeling this agent is from the Philippines since the framed jersey on the wall in scene 1:14 has "pilipinas" and also the flag therefore I think the new agent is a Pilipino :)
Let’s do rng now
valorant is creating more agents that i love to play
Is someone thinking that agent neon is duelist controller initiator type?
Wtf
ayyyyyyy new agent boutta get finnesed
Now Riot! Go on & entertain me!!
all agents are like avengers superheroes...
FINALLY SAGE IN A CINEMATIC

Hay buhay
LET'S GOOOOOO
OK so noone is going to talk about sage ?? she is featured for the first time...
Jett carrier is over
Slide cancelling intensifies*
JETT : Finally a worthy opponent Our battle will be legendary. Spark Neon : Huh, race you there.
Plot twist: anak siya ni Kidlat at siya ang magpapatuloy sa pakikipaglaban sa mga bastos
I think her passive is Sprinting??? She walks faster that any agent...
Bawaal chij 😂😂
*"I HAVE A MIGHTY NEED!"*
Is nice agent
THIS IS SO COOL
Peenoise agent neon lezgo!

Bye Bye jett mains
SIGN THIS PETITION TO MAKE NEON SAY PUTANGINA MO AUTOLOCK
:53 precise gunplay xD
Bro I just realized she's a fan of Ylona Garcia XD 2:28 (at the bottom right corner)
YOOOOO PHILIPPINES REPRESENTTTTT  Once I heard "hay buhay" I did a double take like, "WAIT A MF MINUTE" dashed to the description and saw Manila born agent- AHHHHH so cool seeing representation, especially in such a currently popular game like valorant !!  As a filipina, this is everything !! Thank you riot and val and whoever pitched this agent.
I cannot wait to see r34 amigo
the music should have beeen kpop.

Rezi alternate universe?

Riot games are against run and gun right !?
omgg she's really a Filipino!! she still has a desk used for online classes
I have never stanned a Valorant agent... Till now <3
1:00 wow she have a doggo (not just a doggo but an Aspin or mongrel), I instantly love this character already.
she looks like CAITLYN from arcane
Run n gun brrrrrr

Proud of you My Nona.. I love u so much..
Wow this looks insane, first time I've actually wanted to play Valorant
why is she wearing a breathe right nasal strip
Man, the way she says "kontrolado ko 'to!" After she gets shot
HEY GUYS I KNOW RUNNING AND GUNNING IS THE COMMUNITIES MOST HATED PROBLEM SO WE MADE AN AGENT FOR IT. ENJOY!

The accent is on point lol This is the common accent now, i think especially for millennials not the heavy tone one, which is usual for the older generation
Can't wait to get rnged and fingered by the same agent.
the song is lit
she looks really cool 😍😍
WOW doesnt look op at all, just a better Jett + Phoenix + aimbot ult. Nice!
1:13
This is gonna be fun. Don't wanna call anything too soon but she seems like the next Jett. Fast, quick moves and what seems like a really cool ability will be a game shaker. Can't wait to use her.
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL!!!
YESSSSS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
filipinos know what that broom in her room is
the agent  look alike character from arcane (powder).
She is going to be my main and I think she is a duelist ?

this is straight out of fortnite
My god 😭
imagine they making a scene where jett and neon compete each other
Aww she's filipino
Okay this is so pumped!!! Laban ko toh!!! Love the new agent...
Neon = Filipina Sage = Chinese  It would be funny if both agents were picked on 'Breeze' map -- Neon calls it the West Philippine Sea while Sage calls it the South China Sea :)
shes gonna be fun asf to play i know it
We need a anime movie
former snatcher sa quiapo vibes
the music in this trailer is amaizing
OMGMGGMGMGMMG
Ohmyygossssshhh!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I pride I feel as  Filipino when watching this trailer is overwhelming
Why do I feel Zoe vibes?
Typical Filipino Characteristics/Player Singer? Check Entry Fragger? Check Speaks Tagalog? Check Plants indoors? Check  I felt the dua lipa genre here in neon's introduction song. Looking forward for the upcoming contents of Neon ♥
Oh.my.god. She's Filipina. SQUEEEEEEE. and OF COURSE she loves singing HA! lmao I LOVE HER ALREADYY
Jett mains be like : I don’t need you anymore jett

Ya'll forgot how Sage saved her ass twice revived and blocked the raze ult Sage best girl.
Kontrolado ko to = I Can Control this
CAN'T WAIT

Community: Valorant Fix the Run and Shoot   Valorant: Take new agent who run and shoots

precise gunplay
bye bye jett
Hay buhay
Run and gun on an other level √
haay buhayy

Can you guys give 3 emp knives to kayo please? I don't want to see a character run every where constantly 😂
Neon literally changed the whole room Sage-i see you made a few changes 🛐
Neon taking r&g to whole different level LOL
actually next level jett sheesh  + (bigger booty )
Gotta hear some lines between her and Jett DJDJJD that’s what I’m most excited about djdjdjjd
BRO THE END IS SO SICK I CANT-
It's gonna be an easy judge game for her fs.
C.molly shoots like viper snake bite  and strike like sova sock dart   E.Glide in just like jet   Q.unique blue  wall that allow to enter the site for the entire team  Ult. Fast running ability and an electric serge that kill enemies with continuous contact this might heal her as well
valorant always creates everything over expectation 🔥🔥
Waahhhhh kawaiiii
not exactly jinx but she got blue hair so ill take it
????????
"Controlado ko ito!" 😍😍😍
LETS GO BABY!
can they just make a series or movie already?? that animation is 🔥
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Riot had no business making her that thicc
make a movie
No way they put a filipino in the game bro i hate it here
Oh thanks 5 neonvs5neom
WAS THAT POLGOSO???!❤️
angas
Full RNG xD...
"wag kang bastos"
*THE ABILITY I UNDERSTAND* RUN N LASER.
hay buhay
lets go penoise numba wan!!!!
0:37 Neon: *sigh* Buhay.  Filipino people: *screaming noises*
That Ult Isnt OP At All
We have dad energy brim now get ready for mom energy sage 2:09
She can heal her self just like reyna but by taking enemy life
OP
PLEASE MAKE A MOVIE OF VALORANTTT ;-;
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
This game isnt apex legends. game is now un playable. gg go next this character is fucking dogshit
the " ay buhay" is my everyday mood too neon.
I LOVEEEEBER LH YM
That walis tambo(hand made broom made from tiger grass) is a requirement for every Filipino home
"Hay buhay" HAHAHA
Why her voice more sounds like a Russian trying to voice a filipino!
i feel like they might do an indian agent next :)
Finally a Philipino character
Are those sockets on her nose AMSKSKDJDJKDK
Riot you need to make a series for valorant too 🔥
This is definitely a W-key agent
i will be intralock this agent -_-
0:37 "Haaay buhay.." ♥
this agent is opppppppppppppppppppppppp
holy shitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt🥶🥶🥶
Dident knew sage was that tall
I CAN SENSE A FKN BROKEN AGENT SHEEEESH
this agent is super
This is an agent I can main, totally fits my aggressive vibe and not check for ppl holding corners like most agents have to, duelists are sure they run around but they cant take fight while running, neon on the other hand, oh boy
a resemblance of the ultimate and mar roxas 😂
Philippines let's go
A Filipino agent 😍😍😍
YESSSSSSS
thats so badass!
OMGGGG
Abhi maza aaya n bheduuuu
Riot when we said to fix the run and gun we don't mean it as embrace the run and gun 🤦🏻
When is she coming out?
she is so sick
Hay buhay

とても美しいですね
i bet she's duelist
I have no words to describe other than ''WOW''
woah she have 2 electricty wall
Muntank ghi na . Khục khạc khạc
Run n gun gonna be so op lol
We love Phoenix on crack lol
Well she really is a filipino, look she can sing!! 😭😂
tactical shooter btw
to over powered
Omg she's a half Filipino 😱
Run and gun Gay
sorry but this just looks destined to be busted then nerfed into the ground indefinitely
we playin overwatch now 💀
Run N Gun machine 😂😂😂
The running and sliding reminds me of apex legends
These agent trailer has gone better with each iterations, valorant definitely will go far and beyond!
Walis Tambo Melee Weapon confirmed? 🤣
well... NEON was inspired by VOLTA... (try to search who volta is and u will know what I mean hahah)
I'd love to enjoy Neon chan with raze
Ylona Garcia is now Valorant lore canon, just like Imagine Dragons but in League lore haha
sprint and slide. so it's cod with valorant gunplay. yikes
She is cool af😩
Neon looks superb but when are they finally gonna acknowledge the need for an Indian agent?
WHEN NEON SAID "HAY BUHAY" IN 0:38 ❤️
shes so fast paced that it reminds me of cod especially her slide
Bu ne aq
🇵🇭
new phoenix
Omg she's a Filipina Leeeeeettttsss goooooooo!!!!!
TO GOD BE THE GLORY!
Song name?
Her voicelines definitely consist of talaga bobo, put tank
Valorant lowkey showing that Philippines-China "GOOD" relationship 🤓😂
Plz valorant can we get an agent from 🇮🇳India..
she reminds me of apex gameplay
Nicee move
She looks like Zeri from league of legends upcoming champion with the same characteristics and powers, hmmmmm.
Sage's hands are so delicate and pristine ughhh
This is so relatable she is singing into a toothbrush pretending its a mic
"mom can we have K/DA All Out Akali?" "we already got K/DA Akali at home" K/DA Akali at home:  honestly i wont complain
She a baddy
1:47 that is  a Filipino word
Run players:Our time has come!
i like the sage more than neon, i wish my sage was like that too reality is disappointing
Jett be like, she is not faster than me
Are they planning another crossover perhaps? LOL's upcoming champ Zeri  looks similar
shes going to get scolded for wearing shoes on the bed
Gameplay: 0:48 -0:56 She activates some kind of ability where she seems to be running faster than normal and running and gunning with rifle ? 1:01 - 1:05 She seems to have some sliding dash of some kind. 1:14 - 1:17 1:18 - 1:25 1:26 -  1:30 1:48 - 2:00 Her ult seems to involve tracking I think takes from tracer overwatch but i really have no clue about those agents  just know they are tracking characters. 2:01 - 2:03
When is she coming
this looks amazing i love the character already, wish my friends actually had PCs lmao
Yes I love the Filipino representation and she looks absolutely awesome! Can't wait to play her!<3
instalock for sure.
Philippines nambawan
song name: Entertain me  artist : ylona garcia
#1 on trending lesgoooooo
rito:"abilities does not kill"

Best Joke I Saw Today  Finally! An agent where i can run around the map while not being called an idiot for not hol ding Shift, thanks Riot

DA NEW JETT????
valorant surpases our expectations everytime and this one was just mindblowing but i think u shouldve let jett say that "race youi there" that woulda made it way better cuz both of them are fast
Yo yo yo yo Hold on  Can we slide ? Ah damn , I love to bhop and slide ok done I'm gonna master it
Da music slapssss
I think jett would be faster than neon if her e ability is infinite
Riot really knows how to get people exicted
0:37 she sounds like speaking tagalog "hayyyy buhay" haha

I need that thunder power to charge my laptop when playing
RUN AND GUNNER

she actually said "controlado ko to' omg haha
Country?
Bro shes kinda THICC 🤣
yooooooo that "KONTROLADO KO TO!" is crazyy
Jett now has a rival
Dude I have no words
For those still confused about her abilities:  Main ability: Sprint Thingy Similar to Octane’s speed boost in Apex and is either cast or has an energy bar like Skye’s heal. Footsteps sounds exist and it will probably have a sound effect so you know if she’s getting closer. Shooting cancels the ability so you can’t run full speed with your gun out with the exception of sliding. You can shoot while sliding, but this will cancel the ability. It’s probably not as accurate as we saw on the trailer and probably just a marketing play to get people talking in the comments.  Ability 2: Bouncy Stun Grenade Grenade that creates a stun field off surfaces it bounces of and one more when it lands.  Ability 3: Double Phoenix Wall Thing Probably does damage to enemies but not to the same extent as Phoenix’s fire wall. Only goes one way like a Viper wall and cannot be curved.  Ult Ability: Zappy Finger Guns Run and gun ult. Does not auto track like Winston’s gun in Overwatch. The ult works like a laser beam so very rewarding for those with good tracking. Damage may vary depending on your distance?  Counters: So basically Riot is telling mfs to start learning to play Sentinels instead of auto locking duelists. Literally cypher traps, slow orbs, chamber calling card solves the speedy problem. If run and gun is your concern just kill her mid sprint when she’s got no gun in her hand. The slide shooting thing is a problem IF you don’t see her coming first so just don’t hole up and camp in an obvious corner.  Overall: Really not OP if you think about it. Her kit almost forces her to play the entry role and her signature ability is similar to Jett’s dash where you’re most likely be using it to quickly reposition in gun fights. Will probably be troublesome in low elo but falls off against smart enough players.
...am I the only one that gets a bit iffy that she gets on her bed with shoes on?
cant wait to main neon
Sheeeeeesh
Flash fans be like
"Abilities dont kill"
thats my mom
yes!! new waifu nice riot games
The "kontrolado ko to"🧐🧐🧐
W key for the win
now we can get some precise gunplays with the stinger now
wtf
so riot made an agent to typical pinoy play style "running it down"
Damn, that looks too overpowered
YOOOOOOOOO
Call of valorant
NAPAKA ANGAS!!!
LETSSSSSGOOOOO VALORANT
Apex legends players gonna be hitting some sweet shot while sliding
I will main her lmao
I see neon is from some province in PH

2:04 i fucking love that look man
Valorant you are god
yo lets goooooooooooooooooo
This neon is crazyyyyyyy
yay another character that breaks the game and is unbalanced
Cool. The PH is on the map. She's definitely inspired by Olympic gold winner Hidilyn Diaz. Hehe it's in the vernacular too- very nice. I wonder who the voice actress is (speaking Tagalog)?  Hidilyn in a way has been immortalized forever on the internet and later as a bronze statue in her old age.  God bless, Rev. 21:4
Flash daughter ay yooo. Remind me of mix electro and flash lol
so rng is a literal ability now
1:23 bro omen just died by a marshal while he is using odin
GANDAAAAA!!
Mabuhay!!!💙♥️🤍💛🇵🇭
Wtf is this? The last thing i wanted was someone sliding in with a judge😭😭😭
Finally a Jett that can rebibe.
0:20  What i see : "reyna and viper daughter
she is speaking tagalog>??
I have seen her ult ability in  flash web series man
Ayo she's filipina 🇵🇭

That Walis Tambo on her room tho😂❤️
ANGAASSS!!!
LESGOOO !!😁
Fun fact: This agent is from the Philippines. When are they gonna release one from India? 1.38 billion people need their valorant representative.
now run and gun will not be abused 😂😂
fkn hype for this agent!
chamber and phoenix mixed...
BRO ITS NOT ABOUT CUTE PLZ DONT ADD THIS MORE COMPETIVE
all we wanted was a cinematice like duelists with sage and all u give is source animation..BOOOOO!
Precise Gunplay😌
FLASH 2.0 LESSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
She's definetely going to be so much fun to play, cant wait to play her
I love that shes a good singer just like every filipinos
LEZGOOO FILIPINO AGENT
My alias for over 10 years has been neon and I love everything about this character already welp looks like I got a new main
shes my main now
lest goo im so exited
all overwatch characters in one
I think neon hav crush on phoenix 😂 she hav molly and wall like phoenix 😂
On 1:49 after reviving her sage tries to stop her with the wall. I mean she could put that wall down before revive but she put it after revive it felt like she wanted to stop her from losing control and go into chaos. When she was shot and her ability was charging her body she said "I can control it". Sage knew that she has problems controlling her power and that's why I think they decided sage will be tutoring her not reyna, thankfully. The valorant lore is getting better and better I hope they do something like Arcane but a continuing version of it because Valorant is still new and I know they will add to lore more and more so a complete one wouldn't be meaningful imo.
Btw I'm neon main
tng aina mo lez go
this agent looks really op ngl o_o
Awesome trailer!!
Sonic
una poronga
Where did she come from?
Wala bang pa tiktok kay neon dyan
I mean she looks fun but it would fut like cod, apex, im not sure how this will be balanced for valorant
My jett time has come to be a legend with her dash. After riot giving us sprinting agent would be so annoying morenthan dismiss reyna.
can we just appreciate that she's a filipino?
MOVEMENT SHOOTER AGENT? LESGO
I like how this agent looks but don't you feel like this is slowly turning into Overwatch.
1:13 is that Ella Fajardo's jersey?
WELCOME HOME DARTH SIDIOUS
woah! super excited 🔥
damnnnn!!!! Trailor is sooo coooolll..... just love it
bye jett
i can bet neon main definitely gonna use spectre for the whole match we all know how shit that gun is with run and gun.
Looks Hella Promising
Yikes
I don't know but this agent vibes 🥰
after she said *ay buhay* which ahh life I Imidietlly know she's Filipino
This means so much as a Filipino.   Hearing her speak our mother-tongue at the end actually gives me goosebumps and makes me kinda tear up (I know it sounds silly). It is very rare that you will hear about us in maintsream videogames.   Thank you, Valorant.
lets gooo woooo
🤣 she will be so OP, she can run and gun
Omg, I absolutely love her hair
Ver esto y pensar cuando salian personajes nuevos en el Overwatch :_(
this is so cool
Riot stop bringing new agents into the game just add some functionalities like map selecting while playing competitive or unranked
finnaly power of the light is in valorant
i just wanna see the alt scene but 4k 144 fps
thats a monitor breaker right there... but dope trailer
Is her nationality is Philippines or Hawaii
when she said, "kontrolado ko'to!", I felt so much goosebumps man!!♥
So hype
i think this girl might be  the coolest agent in valorant
Oh God they added the cod operator into val
her tagalog voiceline:   0:36 hayy, buhay 1:44: ipapanalo ko to, Ipaglalaban ko!
Can Riot release an EDM album already? 😭
ang galing mo bebe girL ❤️
No one can really tell much from like 20 seconds of gameplay but she looks like a fun character you can get clips and carry with but she also looks super balanced
Guess who ripped off Sonic.
This is the child of phoenix and jett.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
🔥🔥🔥!!
VALORANT ROCKS
Hayyy buhay parang life...
5 abilities wtf
Now Call of Duty gamers can finally play Valorant
tanginang agent to ganda
Yall saying she looks OP as fuck in this trailer. You remember when Yoru got revealed and we all thought how broken he looked/.
the fact that she loves singing makes sense cus most filipina/filipino’s loves to sing
I like how everyone forgot about Poor Cypher XD
Masterstroke 👌
LOVE this agent cant wait to try her she is like Jett+ Reyna
Kay/O: 👀
New Call of Duty Character
What is her agent class?
“Haaay buhay” “kontrolado ko to” excited for this agent! ❤️

LOOKS DOPEEE
lol
Sage is the sweetest character 🥺. Also is that song available on Spotify!
ayo she can res herself or am i being stoopid?
We have sonic here hehehe....
Bruh its gonna make people run and gun. Wtf.   And I know this is just gonna be like the one month hype and after that people will eventually come back again insta locking jett and reyna lol 😂
So basically she’s Azula noh 😌
goosebumps!!!!
I can already feel the broken
I like the way she becomes a monster on last scene
Her Voice Actor is no other than Miss Vanille Velasquez 🖤🖤🖤
LESSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NEON LANG MALAKAS

what the fuck lol
Hayyyyy buhay
That's some bullshit
PROUD PINOY!!!!
Parang di naman siya taga Pilipinas dahil wlang electricity xddd
OMFG 🔥
<3
So one of her ability is a lightning bolt that stuns enemy bounces 2 times? cool...
Maybe her sprinting skills is similar to yoru ult but she can be shoot by enemy.
Duelist ?
I've watched this too many times.
Dammm
Thor gf
Riot cant fix run and gun Riot:”I will just make it worse”
I really like this arcane style animation. Also please make a new agent based on India too.
I like that
HOW MANY FILIPINOS ARE IN THIS COMMENT SECTION?

ЮХУУУУУУУУУУУУУУУУУУ ОТЛЧИНО
Finally, another thicc agent to compete with viper XD

ผมชอบเลยวิ่งยิง🔥
the word "disruption" at  2:32 has no "tagalog" yet they are featuring a filipino agent.
2 on trending sheeeeesh
Agent reveals keep getting better and better
they created more precise gameplay lessgo
@valorant 🎉A character from india?
0:04 0:07 0:17 1:00 1:05 1:08 1:12 the flash
I'm ready for neon x yuro ships
LEZGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
I give you 3 days to nerf this agent
Valorant needs a high budget cinematic trailer that's about 10 minutes long.  Back to the character, looks like a Jett, but with Lightning, instead of vertical movement, she's more adept in horizontal movement.  Instead of Smokes, she have walls, instead of blades she has constant lightning for ult i guess.  Still, I am a sentinel main but suddenly have the urge to try her out.
its kinda raze, sage and jett combination, hehe it seems hella to me. SOOOO EXCITRD TO PLAY WHIT THIS.. WOAHHHH
Another agent another smurf account
Hell yeah
Narinig nyo ba yun? "Hay buhay" sabi ni neon
She likes volleyball and karaoke. Yup, really a Filipino.
Finger gun go brrrrr
Just imagine seeing a web series by riot based on valorant agents in future 🔥 like ARCANE
0:38 "hay buhay!" in english means "what a life".  Thanks me later!
WOW SO AWESOME
she turn to avatar mode and become a sith damnnn
"We saw run and gun was really strong and irritating a lot of players, so we just made it a mechanic for our newest character"
MY MOMMY SAGE STAY BACK
LETS GO A FILIPINO AGENT!! WOOO
Did anyone notice that she was invulnerable to Raze's ult for some reason? 1:51
a mix of Jett, phoenix and octane from apex
Damn🔥
🇵🇭
this is sponsored by meralco
this ageant is just a way to promote run and gunners
Valorant be giving us gifts even after Christmas ended.
Now I can finally Play Fortnite in Valorant
She's cute.

so shes speed girl?
Precise gunplay
Valorant community: RUN AND GUN NEEDS TO BE NERFED Valorant: *adds run and gun lazerbeam ult*
Sage😂
Cant wait....🤪....
Is she Yoru’s little sister?
She looks rather dangerous in Low elo but kinda weak in upper elo from the gameplay footage, she’s still moving in a straight line so in higher elo all it takes is one in the head to end it🤠unless her slide is easily abused with the ult together but she doesn’t seem to have repositioning strength—
What in the overwatch is that. Looks OP  also look like its gonna get a massive nerf.
Philippines snatcher
MGA PINOY MAG INGAY!!!!!!!!!
She's a runner she's a track star
So broken.. xd
Cast all your anxiety on Jesus Chirst because he Cares for You.(Peter 5:7)

I PREDICTED ITTT. SO PREDICTED A SLIDE IN MOVE. JETT HAS COMPETITION NOW

Viper got competition now...
The motion's a bit 'laggy' because she's from Philippines. 🥴
:0 neon is a filipino
SHE LOOKS SO COOL AND CYOOT OMGGG
A FILO AGENT YESSSS FINALLY
I love the little part when Sage walks in and Neon almost feels as if she'd be thought of as weird or something for what she'd done to her space and Sage says "it's beautiful" Its like the feeling of acceptance washes over her. Sweet little subtle moment
The Discord is full :((((
This was such a great introduction video.
Precise gunplay🔥
Sage: Race you there? Neon: *Uses Sprint Ability* Sage: *Uses Slow Orbs and Wall" Sage: I don't think so.
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"race you there?" Sage put a wall in front of the door :)
Is it just me or she lives in the Philippines.
ALRIGHT IMA BE THE FIRST ONE TO BUY THE AGENT
I love her relationship with Sage. She feels like her child. Mommy Sage crumbs.
thank you valorant for making a filipino character
The Flash of Valorant..

Anak ni kidlat wag kayo bastos
One of the most Diverse agents

If only the U.S. Military could weaponize 88rising or even Cardi B with this level of success. World peace would be assured.
She's sooooo beautiful 😍 ❤  LESSSS GGGOOOOO
I don't know how many times i've watched this already... Best trailer ever made from VALORANT
why do i want this trailer to never end? its just too good
Bakeeeet ang gandaaaaaaa!!!! 😭
When will we get a an Indian agent huh? There's 1.3 billion Indians which is more than15% of the world's population yet we don't have an agent. There's agents from all major countries except India. 19 agents
gg
Bro the trailer is so sick! Can't wait to unlock her...
KONTROLADO KOTO!
Now i have to practice tracking ;-;
Streamers one day after the trailer- we got lineups for neon.

Jett 2.0
Ha The strongest agent ever😋
I don't care if there are five of them or fifty of them. Let's go! -gatecrasher

Her surname is bonifacio
Well hooly shit that looks amazing
YES.  SHE HAS THAT HARD TONED ACCENT. YAN ANG FILIPINO.
Proud Filipino here
Another thick agent 🗿
I thought the zap would zap another nearby enemies lol
Yup im maining her for sure
as far as i know, this is the longest trailer in valorant. And i love it
A little disappointed with her kit
What a great addition. The accent doesn’t scream pinay to me though. Is the lore that she is mixed?
yay!!! new agent!!
Lol
Gönder gelsin
Jett: Who the hell are you? Neon: I am you but better.
Queen of precise gun play
She brings a completely different meaning to the term "gun runner".
Sage kinda bad,,,,
Zeri's sister lol
she's been sonic-ified
oi oi oi oi. Mama mia mama mia mama mia
IesGoooooooooooooooooo
IDC cause yoru is my number 1 of runner for me!!!!!! XD He need buff 😅😅😅
Soo cool!, imma get another Valorant card! for this so excited can't wait to see her!
Yawn.
This is one of the best agent trailers I've seen. So stoked for her release!!
1:01 proves that the stinger is actually good
Jetts been real silent after the trailer dropped ngl
Welcome to the NextGen of Rng bois
SHES FILIPINO? NO WAY!
Too much excited!!
parang may hawig ung mukha nya kay jett
Sooooo basically instead of fixing the Run and Gun meta Riot made an agent that specializes in it. Hmmmmmm...... omoshiroi
LESSSSGOOOOOOO
Typical Asian girl  Making some creative moves but afraid of getting scolded
The real octane gf 😍
Bro omen dies 3 separate times in this trailer.
The WALIS TAMBO hit me
KONTROLADO KO TO AAAAAA
run n gun goes brrrrrrrrrrr
POG
I love how accurate the toothbrush and the broom as a mic
im so gonna main this agent
yung walis tambo haahahahah
as a sentinel and controller user, i think its time to be a duelist lol
I bet she says potang ina and gago
broken jett
crazy how this sort of looks like that one show, Arcane
Great, so she has the spirit gun from YuYu Hakusho. That's too OP
Pretty she my new main🇵🇭
btw riot, when is an Indian agent coming😆?
Me not playing the game but I kept watching it 😊😊
is this the new mascot of Meralco?
"Out Ivy, out middle, through connector, like a speed demon"
imagine if neon's ult is chidori........
Every agent should have a passive skill ftw?
Hey Riot, We also want this in Hindi language, ig Valorant India community is one of the biggest community of Valorant.
she thicc, might beat viper
Valorant imagination is lit
Double wallll lesssgooooooo
Zenitsu!!!
this game isnt even valorant anymore its just cod
HYPE!!
yus baby! another duelistttt
tooooo bad my laptop is dead lol
LEZZGOOOOO!
yessss new valorant waifu
she kinda bad tho
So new music will come soon?
OH YEAH DUDEEEEEEEEE!!⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ finally tho, a double waller and will manila map be finally out?
shes so cool wtf
Neon = Filipina Emperor Palpatine.   We get an agent and a sith lord.  Absolutely sick!  Well done Valorant! <3
Do we call it Jeepney Peeking now instead of Ferrari Peeking? XD
Oh no not more run and gun
shoes on the bed??? is she really filipino
Rip jett...
chidori stream
Optimize your game first
I don't see run n gun mechanics here.
New jett??
YESSS I LOVE THE NEW AGENT AND THE FACT THAT ITS FILIPINO MAKE ME PROUDD
This gonna be shocking ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Neon really singing in a tooth brush 😂😂😂😂
Damnnnnnnnnnnn!!!
Every filipino gamer: Im gonna main her
Bruh I like how sage says "race you there? " I feel like that should've been jett
She's so fast Maybe it's because of  "Tondo Experience"
Goodbye Jett main. Hello Neon! ⚡️
GADDAMNNNNNN
damn one of the best ones
:D nice..
she looks like a duelist  i think jett got a compitition
2 super long phoenix walls 2 instant stuns Movement speed buff like that apex guy on steroids  Ult like overwatch mercy auto attack
I just love how sage is so welcoming and nice
I haven't even unlocked the previous agent and there is a new agent trailer already 😂😂
CONTROLADO KOTO😳😳😳😳
amazing concept but it's basically putting viper and jett in the same operator which is op asf
Potaena bat may walis tambo
Kay/o bout to be so useful now
WTF IS WITH THAT ULT NAKAKAIYAKKK
Blue Pikachu!
Can we get a "ang bobo mo" voice line? 😂
awesome
bruuhh i just listened to this song fot like a hundred times and then this????  sheeeshhh 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Jett should've been the one who revived her
This is so cool.
I KNEW IT, when i know the new agent its lightning, i thingking that her ult might be a laser 🤔, AND LOOKS ITS REAL 😂
So basically she is another jett?
And of course she's a singer
why valorant make a trailer on which fps i play valorant
one word, *BROKEN*
Sheeesh
Did she just run and gum with full accuracy
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
This character looks weird, but cool at the same time. Can't wait to play with it
Love the blue and yellow lightning, hate the character design. Why does she have to be an influencer bro.
I'm so excited to use this oneeee! LETS GOOOOO!
Love the representation! Pinay Agent lets goooooo
<3
IS SHE WHAT I THINK SHE IS. IF SHE COMES OUT AND THAT MY SPECULATIONS ARE RIGHT ABOUT BEING A FILIPINA AGENT IM GOING TO FREAK OUT IM SOOOO EXCITED!!
Hay buhay
Basically octane's stim?
Yes! I can finally run and gun better
so she's the definition of run and gun?
Jett being power crept already
Jet the cooler jet:
I swear to god, valorant devs based her to Ylona.
Who the fuck packs a walis on their way to a foreign country?
Song?
I have been asking for another movement based agent for so long as I enjoy Jett a lot more than anyone else. Sufficed to say THIS CHARACTER IS ALL I COULD ASK FOR!
she's so cool😎😎😎
Neon is  OP
call of duty players are gonna love this agent
Precise Gunplay 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Must cypher die in all official valorant videos?
Punyeta why didn't she take her shoes off???? 🤨🤨
Finally a agent that is my type
Is she speaking tagalog?
Finally Our Representative From PH. Hay Buhay
Pinoyyyyyyyyyy
Neon + kayo =))))
Run N Gun malala HAHAHAHAHA
Am I the only one who heard "hay buhay"
Proud to be a filipino with this new agent in the game <333
Welcome to apex legends :D
Lezzzgo!!!
i like how she has a "walis" in her room
Riot now themselves are supporting run and gun
What is this. They did a vey good job 💀
yoru's still the best
This is Philippines???? 🤯
Finally sage is in agent trailer
First time I repeat on watching this trailer. I don't even play valorant after killjoy released 😂 This is so good
Imma love this female sasuke 🤝
Bet neon main gonna be pissed wen Kay/o shuts them down
When Yoru Rework?
From "jett revive me" to having our very own agent from philippines
Valorant never misses 🤩🤩
i like Sage voice
Well, you definitely entertain us Neon! ♥⚡
Filipino????
Love the filipino representation 💪❤️
bro cod vibes
idk if you guys saw but i maybe see another new agent and map in the artwork if you look closely to chamber you can see them and maybe the map teaser is the big thingy at the back.
When we can use this agent?
so jett having a child with phoenix is canon now?
did she say hay buhay?
Prod is gonna have a field day with this
karmasa’s so litty!!!! i love her alr!!!🤩🤩💖
Dam that agent looks overpowered
so a better jett?
TEAM PHLILPPINES 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
such a good trailer omgg😭😭😍
i have just one complain that is that running animation is just stupid lol
QUE BUEN TRAILER!!! ME ENCANTO... letttssssss gooooooo. i am so exciting
literally can please riot stop? i wanna rank up. i already had enough with chamber and kayo
Yawa ganda!!
Mother fuckers just made rng even worse
Ate looking awesome I swear
Dollar Store Tracer
Ah riots, whole music and animation industry that develop a game when they're bored
Fucking OP
Walis Tambo in the room, Feels like home haha
The YLONA POSTER AHHHHHH
me so happy me so excited
Jett 2.0 XD
run and gun agent????
The first time I didn't cringed when a game character from a foreign game spoke tagalog.
I can tell that she is fkin broken x_x
Wow filipino agent so amazing 🥰🥰🥰
Ayee
ESKETITTTT
KONTROLADO KO TO
Kontrolado ko to
honestly she look fun but hella annoying to play against
Dang Valorant really wants the THICK now in valorant
Clean
KAY/O : hold my dagger
YOOOO However the Hand electricity will be overpowered 😬
Broken agent.....
Nice.
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Wtf it’s sooo bad
Why sage gets to play mumma
THE RUN AND GUNNERS GONNA ABUSE THIS SO BADLY KEKW
OMGGGG
Not ow plz lol
wtf shes broken
Me : *Lose streak* Also me : 0:38
This trailer is so accurate, they even got the low fps of most Filipino players...
Im gonna go fast  Valorant:so op auto nerf
I LOVE HOW THEY USED YLONA'S MUSIC!! A FILIPINO SINGER FROM 88RISING
SHES SO BEAUTIFULLL
So is nobody going to talk about that sage perfect synergy blocking the raze ult?
PH!!!!!!!
The music and video is good , It will be awesome if there is a valorant movie , hope we can see in the future
There should be an animation where Neon and Jett race. I feel like that would be sick!
wow a agent that can run and gun wait i mean slide and gun even better
Boomer sage be like : ah fuck here we go again LMAO
when ?
I was so sick of Killjoy’s machines and Jett’s dash that I was craving a lightning/electricity agent. Got what I wanted but not exactly what I expected.
Make a movie already 😍
riot know how to make us download valorant
Cant wait for the 'running towards you' meme for her running animation
Lezgoo
Thank you riot to make filipino agent am very happy what you create i love it
To the outside world she's just an ordinary forensic scientist
I had my goosebumps when i heard "Kontrolado ko to" tanginang buhay to hahaha
At this point with Neon's shoot and sprint, Riot is just telling us that their RNG is just a mechanic and they will never fix it
Ugh I love her!
I love it already
Daaammm
eager to play
Yo! Nice!!
Baddie😍🇵🇭
How about you guys first fix the unlimited bugs in the game and then release the agent?
"race you there?'  you fucked up sage,  you're about to get dusted
30 fps ?
i bet in 2 days, a bit more or less, Neon will get nerfed
YES PILIPINO AGENT YEZZZZ
ig riot is tired after chamber teaser , so they just dropped this abomination , there goes all the precise gunplay also RIP phoenix
Valroant's Flash
"kontrolado ko 'to"
R34 artists are already doing what they do best. God damn it man
So basically the flash
RUN N GUN BACK ON THE MENU, BOIIIII
so we now have an octane with us less goooo
Another agent that looks overpowered 🥴
Zeri and now this.. mmm sus
wow
she looks hella broken lol
I love her and the representation so much, I think the only critique I have is that I wish her hair was more up like in her splash art!! I wish it was more in the pigtails and had less hair out
Let's make som anime battle, Jett vs Neon
AW YEAHH
AND SAGE
wtf is this, im fs gonna main this bs
Convenhamos pessoal, aqui podemos ver a "Rainha do Patinete"
i hope valorant become a movie like a arcane lol
Rito i’m hoping for the “Lods, Pa-drop” voiceline when you request a gun.
THAT FINGER LASER THING THAT HAS TO BE HER ULT OR IM DOOMED UNLESS I SPEEDRUN THE CONTRACT
🖤🖤🖤
So its owerwatch now
release when
AYOOO OVERWATCh
Didn't kill cypher this time.☺️
Every Filipino player is going to start insta-locking Neon once she's out
When Jett realizes that she’s not the fastest anymore
Why does she have walls of fire instead of lightning?
This girl is literally a walking cod machine xd
Episode 4: DISRUPTION?! My GOD this is going to be wonderful!
damn this agent is op
sheeesh
Looks trash lol
Viper's ass >
Gila sihh  Gass langsung beli  Ga mau tua gwww
this is why i love riot
"HAY BUHAY"
At bati na po ang Pilipinas at China🙂
ahhhh i can now see the future meme's... sorry jett... XD
Okay I love her everything about her, I love how she has the filo accent although i would love some conyo line, I love that she has the typical filo nose and she also has an aspin ❤️
Oh wow she is a filipina
I think the judge will be her most used weapon since she can get in your face fast.
her ult looks bad. would be useless if she gets headshot on skirmishes. but we'll see in the actual gameplay. the smoke path is op though
Just have to say her personality, her style, and Color’s match her perfectly and im so excited to use herrr
The music was also really nice
Well it's good and all but dont u think everyone gonna run and gun now
another filipino that can sing lmao
run and gun right out of the box, perfect for me
this is going to ruin the game more than anything else
This gets me a bit scared, relating to chambers voiceline to reyna, she might get corrupted, so this trailer is probably going to be the only time we see Neon this happy.
TACTICAL SHOOTER BTW
LETS GOOO RUN N GUN PROMOTION  riot doesnt even care anymore
YASS A FILIPINO AGENT!!!, Her skills looks pretty too
filipino omg
Jett:why you instalock my neon
So… she’s jet 2.0
Think the slides/sprint+crouch might be similar to Apex Legend's
The run and the gun
Finally a Trailer where Cypher doesn't die
sheshhhhhhhhhhhhh! chamber then neon  no value for jett
Woooah shes cool, hella dope
Ah.. Riot's classic two birds one stone move cus this is like zeri's(LOL new champion) valorant counterpart.
Hey If you are making an Indian(Male) agent, my voice is up for grabs. (Evil laugh)
as a iron and a simp I am maining this agent
i wanna hear like PUtanginaa moooo for ult
Sheeeshhh
WOW
Goshhh she spoked tagalog,🥰🥰🥰
She looks soo cool and her wall seems super cool aswel!!
Run and gun gang where ya yat !!??
can we just all admit how much of a banger is the background music  is.
I'm pretty sure overwatch and apex players will be celebrating.
HELL YEAH THIS AGENT LOOK FIRE
Philippines Inspired
stun firewall slide and speed
idk why this made me cry happy tears
rip for the omen who died three times (or two if he survived sova's ult)
this is amazing. its gonna be my new main
Damn riot is so used to hearing the precise gunplay meme they started to put it in their own trailers
I'm lovin the 4 fps trailer from a billon dollar company
<333333333333
Why is KAY/O isnt in any trailer except his reveal one
Yo this character looks lit!! Cant wait to actually try her out
LET'S GO NEON
Kontrolado ko to gave me goosebumps
Amazing! 😍
Ang ganda niyaaaa
sino taga philippines dito
1:00 I hope there is an interaction with Skye's doggo
01:30 neon=killua IM SOO EXCITED FOR THIS AGENT HOLY CRAP
Less gooooo
useless meralco sa bahay ni neon hahahahah
This should be an amazing video but... İn game animationa are SO BAD that  this video look lıke a mobile game ad. Valorant really ADD ANİMATİON in their game.

Yo neon is a run and gunner ?!?!
Day 4 of asking riot for a replay system
Neon looks like a really fun character to play. I loved the video. Makes me feel very HYPED!😄
Ofc she’s Filipino because of her singing lmao
HYPE
USE ULT = easy ace
neon is coming to the battle. I wanna know what agent will be relese at 2023 Lol😂😂😂

Proud to be Filipino Right Now!
Overwatch 2 took a different direction I see. I hope they can still bring Lucio over to the new game!

Valorant is finally embracing the run and gun meta
Let's Go Philippines!

Neon is based on philippines fastest creature called "snatchers" of the streets in manila. Tondo things
I hope she says "putangina"
I believe she's gonna be an OP agent because Electric bill here in the Philippines is also OP asf ⚡
Looks like beat agent and a beat trailer of all time

Omg shes Filipino! "Kontrolado ko to!"
Grabe nakakakilig at nakakaexcite 😍
op af
1:45 she says "kontol", what else ya'll need? XD
Flash?
It’s not a Valorant cinematic if Cypher doesn’t die
Mygawddd
so this is why they never fix run and gun... becuz they planned this character already =_=
Every filipina streamers rn : "IMMA COSPLAY DAT"
Is it too much to ask for trailer for every agent especially jett. I wanna see what music suits that girl...
Cooolll canr waittt!!!

LEZZ GOOO A FILIPINA AGENT SHEEESH IM SO HYPED
That run and gun wtf, precise gunplay

This year gona beautiful with this agent  💓
vawlorant players : remove run and gun!!!!!!!!!!!  RIOT: Okey.
OK BUT SHE SOUNDS LIKE DUTERTE HELP
Proud Filipino Noises!
Just like that we're probably getting a band or something in Valo.
I am fucking Impressed 👀

First time Cypher didn't  die on a trailer. CLAP CLAP
Gotta go fast
Apex legend players will love this agent, I love this agent!
She's so pretty
Istg this is gonna be my new main for sure
Her wall is literally phoenix's but better lmao
Wow an agent who do concerts by herself in her room alone dancing and singing. Just like us hdjshdjshjdhs. The accuracy
😻⚡
Not excited tbh
SHE HAS 2 WALLS!!!!
VOLTA!
Lower the graphics settings on your Fortnite install to fix that framerate issue.
sheeesh angas lets go
Welp i know what im gonna sepnd my crhistmas money for to unlock this agent as soon as she releases
Better than sage and kayo ngl !!
Now. Thats what speed we are talking about.
Ahhh a new duelist that will easily rush in to my cypher tripwires
FIRST FILIPINO AGENT WOOHOO
Can you  make a video  of neon racing Jett
A Filipino Agent lets gooooo!!!!
I'm about to bust
THE WALLS ARE COOL AF
The way she slides around just reminds of Apex Legends HAHHA
Kinda OP just like chber but i dog it
Why do i like her
Yes and she's filipino too😍😍🔥
Everything aside, this is the first time we got to see sage in a reveal trailer. And NGL sage is waifu material
*WOOOO THIS TRAILER IS GETTING ME HYPED!! *MAN IT'S GIVING ME THE URGE TO PLAY VALORANT AFTER CLASS

YLONA getting a shout out from riot GEEEEEEEEEEEZ
Noicee
im inlove
Next slide please
wea mala
Yey finger gun ulti also YEAH FILIPINO
Why does she always run and gun? Its like riot games know that their game is shit and began to embrace themselves
Bloody hell she fingers the enemy!! 🙂
instalock Jett no more, its instalock Neon now
Oh my god this character is too op omgggggggggg
So good!
Her hairstyle is kinda close to League’s new champion Zeri LOL. Conspiracy much? They’re the same company.
wait can you super glide with this agent?
Why does she kinda look like Jett though
m-my...pinoy....pride.....is...SHAKIMG
nice
RACE YOU THERE? IT SHOULD BE JETT SAYING THAT LOL!! I LOVE IT! FILIPINO GANG!
Good
Yeeeeesss she is a phillipino
CYPHER didnt die here yaaaaaaaaaaaay
Wtf is this run and gun agent? 😂😂😂
ult looks so broken am expecting instalocks
u can and become sanic slide to trip off enemies when u use octane ability (but ur aim with guns will prolly be doodoo), u can use like 2 fucking phoenix walls at once in a parallel line, a breach stun but implemented into a sage orb AND an ulti that has the same effects as the octane ability but makes ur hand a tazer which has 0 recoil so basically its an op run and gun ability. Good for apex players? Since apex involves more tracking and movement which is heavily utilized when playing as this agent.   I recommend to watch the vid in .25x speed or .5x speed
APEX PART2?
filipino incoming
rip jett
She looks broken - based on what I saw she looks like she has 5000 SKILLS when she comes out im sure ppl will be demanding a nerf-
Freaking Ylona Garcia made another banger music  Makes this video sounds more like a music video
can't wait to get finger blasted by Neon...  wait what
🔥
after unistalling valorant for the 6 th time  wellll here we go again
can't wait
lezgooooo
Sheeeeeeeesshhhhhhh
another mbak2 PLN :v
Valorant is becoming Overwatch!!!!!
Aún no ah salido pero ya la amooo 👌🏼❤️
This is cool and all but super fucking op for a tacshooter. Lowkey Riot gonna ruin this game and make it super corny with shit like this
dam run n gun is going to be Op
BROKEN
Letssssgoooo
Can we get a Nepalese agent plzzz 🥺🥺
WOOWWWW THIS IS SO COOL
Wait she speaks Filipino?
When she said "Hay buhay~" 😔🤚
Common🔥
As per her ethnic background, they sure love to sing!
Go pilipinass❤❤
Here we have another agent that is gonna get instalocked by kids🤣🤣🤣
LEZZ GOO! FILIPINO CHARACTER IS FINALLY HERE!!!!
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
Vai toma no cu riot, nao sei nem joga contra jett vou saber jogar contra isso ai
She is cute just like jet only difference is that one is more mature one is a bit of childish nice work
She is so cute!
dapat ult niya tsinelas ni mama
SHES SO PRETTY!! she look soo fun too play with
Take your sneaker’s off when you lay in your bed
Jett watching like: 👁👄👁 "gunna take my place I see"
Jett’s gonna be one sad agent after this 😂
PH REPRESENT!!! 🇵🇭
Shèeeeeeeeeeshh
want to riot Added new guns to the game.
WTH HER ULT IS MOSES SPLITTING THE RED SEA
Representation matters!🔥🇵🇭🇵🇭
Finally! An agent where i can run around the map while not being called an idiot for not holding Shift, thanks Riot!
overwatch hero in valorant lol lesgooo
They did their research on a real Pinoy agent. Everything about her is Pinoy👌
br o im so hype for this
LETS GO!!
That dual wall was amazing I guess it's gonna get nerfed😂😂😂
Did she just say "kontrolado ko to“?!!
Neon instalockers are either going to do two things, actually play their role and utilities right and takes sites, or get hit by one bullet and are already halfway across the map yelling at everyone to rotate, lol.
Ph we Rize!!
yes i see the filipino pride in her
Power creep is starting real early in valorant I guess
ANG GALING MO YLONA!!!! KAMUKHA MO PA SI NEON!
Ang ganda mo!❤️
Did the animation/frame rate get worse?
Music 10/10⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
wow pinay

VIREI MAIN FODASE
So happy filos are getting recognized in the video game community. This is pretty much the first time there's been a Filipino character in pretty much any video game ever.
is it me, or do i hear Tagalog after she got shot.
Ohh yes more run and gun now XD
well goodbye jett
They need to nerf this agent already 🤣
Finally a proper female character for the r34 fams.
Broken jett
help anyone spare windows 10 keys to play valorant
Yooo so proud being a Filipino!! Gon' wait for you, Neon.
The Call of duty Dash ahaha 😅
on that one ascent clip   me: Holly shit there gonna be more judge with this character
Tangnang yan ang gandaaaa

Hella fun KAPAMILYA NEON! pinoy por life
call of duty?
Ukin nam is I love you in filipino
please why do we need it on windows 11 but not on 10 ): its not fair its like picking a favorite child
Perfect Filipino cultural representation by @riot @valorant -She says "hay buhay" (dear life) -She says "kontrolado ko 'to" (i can control this) -Her English is so Pinoy -Her dog is an Aspin -Pilipinas 5 framed in her bedroom which shows her love for basketball -The interior of her room showcases pop culture in the Philippines and love for the Island life -Her tattoos and piercings are inspired by Filipino mythos - the Pintados (Painted Warriors) -Her colors blue and gold are lifted from the colors of the Philippine flag (Blue for peace and Gold for the sun rays) -She loves music and karaoke and is definitely into fun runs and marathons -The song used in this video is by Filipino artist under 88rising Ylona Garcia -And, MAHAL ANG SINGIL SA KURYENTE SA PINAS (electricity in the Ph is expensive) ergo her character abilities 'PUTAH, ANG SAYA!
hes filipino yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy huhuhuhu finally
wait! sage giving the welcome? does this mean brimstone died?
NO DEAD CYPHER? WHATTTTT? CYPHER BUFF CONFIRMED
mato corriendo

VALORANT SEEING THIS TRALIER MAKES ME WANNA PLAY BUT I CAN NOT CAUSE I DONT GOT TPM 2.0 😪😥😭😢🥺 i just wanna try the game i might be good at it
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🎈
Pag si reyna nagsalita ng Punyeta pati Neon   Hispanidad!
Sage said "Race You There" 💀💀💀
ugh pilipinas 5?
the filipina hero everyone was wating for
squish squish
New valorant waifu
Yessssssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥
YUUZZZ FILIPINO AGENT "NEON" IS HERE LEZZZGOOOO ^^
❤️🔥🔥🔥
Lady Flash comes to valorant👍
ahhh shit here we go again....
BRo this agent is going to be so COOOOOLLLL
“Give your burdens to the Lord, and he will take care of you. He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭55:22‬ ‭NLT‬‬
the flash but it is from riot
Run and gun gon' be a hell lot of fun with this agent XD
i think this in my new main agent
she looks broken!
PINOY REP🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I'm uninstalling
Run and gun 😎👌
les go a filipino WHOOOOOO
Ang cringe ng "kontrolado ko to" 🤣
Riot must made Neon sing this song into the voiceline, right ?  what do you think if we have 1 agent and the voiceline is singer
Very excited for this character this character calls my name     **though my friends don’t invite me to play I will still gladly buy this character and play customs alone lol
duelist lesgooo
I wish I could play I cant Windows 10 is too expensive and I'm not trusting scammy websites and I don't have tpm 2.0 Why DO YOU DO THIS TO ME VALORANT WHY if anyone with a lot of clout sees this please tweet or post about this so all the people without tpm 2.0 can finally play I just got a pc just to play valorant and this happens you would have more players if you did not need tpm 2.0
new sage's friend
This makes my Filipino heart happy 💕
Finally, a fun character.
She works for Meralco right?
Let's go 🔥🔥🔥
Why does she walk like that 😂
So she is like fast amazing agent love it :D
気でも狂ったかw
ah yes it is apex legends but in one character
0:55 wtf run and gun?!
I knew the abilities would be Sonic like
oh boy cannot wait for enemy to use neon and crush my team. hehe im in danger
Yeah letssa goooooooooo ❤️
Walmart version of arcane? Lol
Wtf COD slide?
0:55 wtf run and gun?!
LETS GOOOO
She's filipino
Sheeeeesh
Every filipino players be like* We made it bois
this char is just run and gun :/
🥺🥺🥺
Any Filipino peeps here would hear her say "Haaay buhay" which translates to "Oh this life" after she put down that tablet and hopped into the bed 🥳
run and gun is a real problem now
I feel like the sliding mechanics might be similar to jetts gliding ability. That’s actually sick considering that Jett is the only one with that mechanic  since beta.
woooo pinay agent :D
Lasssssss gooooooooooo
Proud from philippines, Im literally hyped up..this is fire❤‍🔥❤‍🔥!!!!
Don't she kinda look like Pokimane???
Average Valorant players: Complaining about run and gun.                                         VS Average Neon mains: Enjoying run and gun at it's finest.
This is just an assumption.  Neon's personality is definitely a kind and caring girl. Just the fact that her pet is an Aspin and she chose to be under Sage's command proves this.  The Aspin means Asong Pinoy which translates to Philippine Dog(yes we're great at names) and they may be the most common breed to own in the Philippines, but they're also the most common breed of strays here. They're also mostly neglected by some of the people because they're a "local" breed and would rather own a dog with a more notable breed such as Huskies, Shibas, Shih Tzus and Pits just to name a few.
i hope yall dont pull an overwatch :(
controlado ko to means i can controll this
this bout to be the next aphelios
So she's basically Azula???
I am excited to use her when she is released already.
Waiting for gloco use this in peenoise plays
Alright guys what are we thinking?  Duelist OR Initiator
Pinoy Pride! Philippines Speedster Duelist with Lightning Attributes ⚡
Title of the background music? 🥺
Savage but Cute, Cute but Savage. Reminds me of Jinx but she's too gentle I guess. Also "Ylona Garcia" poster is a great "Easter Egg"
NERF HER ALREADY LOL!
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
HOLY SHIT LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
kontrollado ko to 😍❤️
It looks like she needs to stop for full accuracy with guns so if you have good tracking you're alright against her and playing her. The nade looks solid (hopefully something different about it). The ult looks... interesting to say the least. The double phoenix walls are a cool idea? But now i pity phoenix getting kind of outshined in the wall section, with viper and now neon having p gucci walls.
Finally a Filipino agent except for chamber
nah too op, where is crow
Kontrolado ko to?
This animated short film look like Studio Fortiches or Little Zoo Studio !?
Ugh, jett mains are so happy they get to have fun again.
Get prepared for the instalockers
Does she live in Palawan, Philippines or any places which are near the shores since it seems like she decorated her room to remind her of her past home together with her family and dog.
she a baddie
Holy holy 😱😱😱😱
ahh more precise gunplay with this agent
Lets gooo
Imagine if valorant made her abilities different for example C ABILITY: PUTANGINAMO which she shouts and made the enemy stunt. Q ABILITY: WALLY BOLD, which she shows a picture of wally tand the enemy becomes blind, E ABILITY: RENDON SLAP, which slaps the enemy making them taking damage and says at the end of the ability CARBON LODI ULTIMATE: KIDLAT WAG KANG BASTOS, which summons KIDLAT to eradicate and ability while saying wag Kang BASTOS😂😂😂
MOMMY SAGE YEAHHHHHHHHHHH
Hayyy buhayyy!!!! :<
That wall
I love how when agents are released they make it the most coolest thing, but for neon it just starts with her walking in a hallway.
Champ from the Philippines? I'm down
I am very confused
If they dont make "ay nako" one of her voicelines im deleting the game
Niña
me: basically jett on crack otehrs: tf you say
Maybe this could replace Jett.
Thumbnail lookin like Lowteirgod
Lesgoooo!!!💯💯💯💯
Phoenix will likely never be used once this goes out
may marites na sa mga agent
Ylona Garcia 🖤💙 🇵🇭
LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOOOO!!!!
This agent is a mixture of phx and jett and raze ........WOW  ,  SHE IS FUN

I'm not a Valorant player, but this is how you make a trailer. GG.
I love how it represents pilipinos like our hobbies, like supporting our basketball team and etc.
Her just singing is very filipino for me

Sage : “race you there?” Neon : activating her speed Sage : Slows orb

Now make her say "WAG KANG BASTOS"
So cute 🥺
Filipina Neon lets go!!!
Run and Gun players are excited for this agent to come out.
Yoru shoes and reyna butt

She's says "kontrolado ko to" when using her ult which is noiice..
Yes broken again like in league

Riot baka naman a race between jett and neon 😆
Looks like Echo
OMGGGGGG IM HYPPEEEEEEE

Basically she can run gun
That wall after the revive is common in my ELO lmao
Dude imagine entrying with this agent
The song makes her cooler idk why
letsss gooo
0:37 "Hay, buhay" translates roughly to "ugh. what a life" denoting weariness. 1:43 "kontrolado ko 'to" translates to "I can control this" or "I am in control"
why she a baddie
This seems like soldier76 with double Phoenix wall
hype train !!!
hay buhay❤️
Great, Let's welcome rng 2000 to our lifes
New agent toh maal hai 👅

Player cod like this agent
Apex players can finally tap strafe in the game
So valorant made run and gun official ?
W
Apex legends player wet dream
Filipinos 🥰🥰🥰
damn she sparked my heart.
Apex in Bali yesssss
Very Excitinggg😊🤗💕
Neon the pilipina girl
Everytime they reveal the abilities i get instant chills- ITS GONNA GET SMURFED
PINAS STRONG LESS GOOO
That double flame wall looks pretty handy, and im guessing the ult has a short range only but she still looks really good cant wait to try her
I better hear putangina shet as a voice line
YES MMMMMMMMMM TIME TO MAKE EVERYONE RAGE QUIT WITH THE NEW CHARCATER BC BROKEN MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Philippines love music and gaming  Riot: We got you *mga pre*
SO SHES FILIPINO, THE FLASH, EMPEROR PALPATINE, AND BLACK LIGHTNING ALL MIXED TOGETHER. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED FOR A LONG TIME D:
oooooooooooo tenuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
1:20 ability will be too op
New main
My god she gonna be nerfed so hard. I can feel it.
omen yoru neon blue squad lets go!
welp, i like how the italic font in here and the new agent that can slide
Ateh Neon Is an ABG
Yo, imagine being the last man standing in replication and all 5 Neon just running circling at you
she feels like somewhat overpowered i wonder how many slides she got
wtf was that wall op valorant
1:03 of course it won't be a new agent trailer if they won't kill Cypher...
eyooo
Omg double wall like heckkk !! She's unstoppable 😭😭😭 another Pikachu
Shesh grabe, nice one valorant for actually having a Filipina voice actor and not just that but you guys actually made the character love singing which is the Filipinos favorite and most dominant talent here in Philippines l, and also I don't know if this was on purpose or not but her ability electricity is actually one of our biggest problems here in Philippines by having lack of capacity to provide long and sustainable electricity here, and lastly the background and her pictures are well introduced since Philippines are consisted of beautiful islands and the background of a "bangka" with the dog is very accurate, well done VALORANT.👏  might be my next main😁
Run and gun players : we got a solution 😁
Kontrolado ko toh!
Nice I just love power creep
Pin?
Everyone hyped for the agent. I'm just hyped that cypher wasn't dying this reveal.
Finally cod in valorant
Filipina agent, that's lit!

RAYGAAAN
Did she say "(High) Buhay"??
Ready for the Quiapo snatcher agent in Valorant
sheeeeeesh
Looks like she likes Pheonix Maybe...
Yo is this the same character from league? The electric theme
Filipino agent? great time to main her
I love how she switched the screen to show a beach background which reminds me of BORACAY or any beaches in PH I can tell she is homesick
Nice a new agent like jett so aggressive
another jett
#1 on trending damm
That was fiyaaaaah!
Cant wait for her voice lines to come out by the looks of it I bet she will talk more about her families and relatives back at home. She was also talking to her mother in the previous teaser that why I think she's really homesick and misses her family
Run and guning to a whole new level
I am the flash!
the run and gun agent LMAO
looks lit
LMFAO WHAT THE FUCKKK
Noice
Time to main her and spam run and gun💀
FILIPINOS  BABY
you gotta buff phoenix now tho if she gets two walls like that xd
Sheshhhh....  she said "hay buhay" btw she look like Alodia... I want to know who the voice actor is
Damnn the hay buhay Controlado ko to HAHAHA
Basically octane but in valorant with additional shock
shes filipino OMG
Y it feels like she's gonna overcome Jett ;) idk why but it feels as such
So it's basically a CoD and Overwartch champ in one? You can now run n' gun + slide? This is gonna be exciting!!
No explosive tsinelas in her kit? She's not legit......
CANCELEM
Hands down my new favorite Valorant trailer
She's like Phoenix reworks. RIP Phoenix mains

Run and gun available now?? 🤔
SOMEONES BOUTTA GET NERFED REAL FAST

1:13 PILIPINAS😎🔥🔥
Song name?
Guys how did Yoru miss?
Filipino agent wowwwwww
Poor cypher died in this one too
My god this was the most beautiful agent trailer everrrr. The song, the animation and most of all the agent. That's it. Sorry Reyna! Sorry 3D girls, but I am hooked on Neon now. She's the best.
Wohooooo lesssgooooooooooo

0:36  HAY!!! BUHAY!!!
1:13 Philipinas les go
valorant should honestly make a tv show
OMFG NEON IS A FILIPINO!!!!

The voice actor sucks.....

Looks like Moxie2D had a character bought out by riot
GG Phoenix and Jett 😈
Let's goooo! Nakakaproud maging PINOY!
she should have a voice line like "im fast as fcked boiii"
yooooo perfect, just perfect, also how much does she have to pay Meralco?
Bro thats gonna be so op
her X ability was legit man an electricity beam and then the electricty wall that to from two sides
uhh i guess valorants becoming overwatch
Gagi kaboses ni Ylona
I love it, tho i might add that shes gonna be hard to play, i dont think riot’s gonna make her run and gun  that easy, meaning we still have messed up accuracy when we sprint and might have to stop for shooting :/ anyway who cares im getting her once shes out
OMG LES GOOOOO
I can already feel it. I'm gonna run and slide right to the enemies face and just die T^T
after unlocking chamber  i should get her
Omg sooo excitedddddddd
Lightning blade 😂😂😂🤌 Naruto
can we get an armor character like torbiorn from overwatch?
shes op
WOOOHHH!!
Cool and useful skills, she can be the best agent
The double side wall is shocking
Ok i must say, as a filipino im very proud she is my nationality, but i think we are gonna get alot of nerfs throughout the season XD
Another trailer where cypher died.

Battle royal character is here. Run and gun and slide. Great.
Let’s go

Manila Map when.. with some ancent Churches

Sage and Neon now both are the crush of many valorant players 😂
yawwaaa daii ang ilonngg ang ilongggg
Kontrolado ko to ❤️❤️
Everytime riot inserts the coolest music for agents
Looks amazing
nakaka cringe ung pag tatagalog hahahaha
THEORY: What if she has a crush on Phoenix? Shes singing about a boy that's petty and "entertaining" her, the song is called spark, and she literally watches a video about him. I mean they said she was a "Jett Counter".
Run and gun meta
Weiß ich nicht digga
SHES FILIPINOOOOOO IM SO HYPED

Wow
run and gun is usefull

2:31 would be an awesome moving background
Haaaa she is so cutie and powerful ♥ Can't wait to play with her ♥_♥
Whooooooooooooooooooooo lez gooo ph
Jett 2.0 Lesssssssssssgoooooooooooooooooooo
MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS!!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
To be clear, in Project A, shooting matters. You don’t kill with abilities. Abilities create tactical opportunities to take the right shot. Characters have abilities that augment their gunplay, instead of fighting directly with their abilities.
The music. The damn music. RIOT the music company that makes games is so good.
Pinoy na pinoy yung kwarto HAHAGAHA ring light and gaming chair
New agent be like Lods drop
they high-key made this agent for valkyrae lmao
Neon is talking  Tagalog she is filipina
Riot: "you don't kill with abilities in Valorant."  Valorant: Have Raze, Sova, Jett, discount Widowmaker (Chamber), and now her.  Yes, Valorant slowly becomes Overwatch and I love every single bit of it.
what did her ult do? It look like she have second life hmm
SHEEEEEEEESH!!!
Psalms 23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 2     He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 3     He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness     for his name's sake.  4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,     I will fear no evil, for you are with me;     your rod and your staff,     they comfort me.  5 You prepare a table before me     in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil;     my cup overflows. 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me     all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
LOVE FROM THE PHILIPPINES!!!
Shess kyut
yes finnaly when is it gonna realease???

"Hay buhay" Gives me the vibes haha.. If I'm  too tired and lazy to do work haha
This is the most PROD'est thing i ever seen

im definitely going to cosplay her in the future
This looks so similar to the upcoming new champion in lol. They both have electricity and double tails
Welcome to apex legends
I was searching about Ylona Garcia poster & music you can see in the trailer... ...Neon is a Filipino agent designed by Vanille Velasquez  (a filipino artist) and voiced by Vanille Velasquez (a filipino voice actor) ! So happy for you filipino gamers /o/
OOOOOOOWH SHEEEESH 88RISING thanks  for  the  song!!
Valorant players : Please nerf shooting while running, Riot Games : Lets add an agent that can sprint and spray guys!
lezgooo
based on the trailer, NERF THIS AGENT lmaoo

My reaction whole video : *AYOOO AYOOOOOO AYYOOOOOOOOOOOO*
MABUHAY!!!!!
Man if they're gonna drop someone with all these cool abilities the least they could do is buff yoru, and omen. Maybe even show phoenix some love.
Damn
Let's,goooo 😀❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ riot u deserve salute 🙂
Bat nakikita ko yung quality ng character sa The Sims 4 HAHAHA anyways cant wait for neon!!!
Riot doesnt care anymore they just put run and gun hahaha
SHE HAS APEX MOVEMENT
octane valorant editoim
her ult looks like complete bs uh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Wasting my money again
I think her sprint is a passive ability.
Loveee itttt!!! Gonna be hard to pick her tho a lot will instalock her
My favorite Valorant agent trailer by far!!!! Neon looks so fun can’t wait to try her out
Me far away from home be like
pati ba naman sa valorant chinita pa ren T-T
now ik why shes jett rivals
The HYPE is on.
I FREAKING LOVE SAGE AND NEON TOGETHER OMFG I SHIP THEM! THIS TRAILER WAS LITERALLY THE PRETTIERST VALORANT TRAILER EVER!
basically phoenix but better
what did she said at @0:37 "hayy, buhay"?
perfect agent for players with 8000 dpi and 1 game sens
can't wait to play sage whe people instantly lock her 💕
looks like jett on crack
PEENOISE NAMBAWAN HAHAHAHAA

oh the thing on her back is the card for players
OH MY GOD SHES SO FKIN COOL!!!!!!! THE MOST CREATIVE AGENT IVE SEEN!! DEF GONNA MAIN HER!!!
New rng agent

Riot just straight up buffed Phoenix's wall and put it in another agent, nice.
YOOOO I WANNA GET HER
DOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Cuando van a sacar la canción completa 😊 la necesito 🙂
bro omg this is so good well done riot
Cant wait to be like emperor palpatine on steroids!             Edit: also was the sage revive intentional? Because of the meme "revive me jett"?
she looks like she'll be so much fun to play
Wow
singing on a toothbrush gives some filipino culture lol
What the....her abilities are literally run and gun.
shes so pretty
This brings a whole new problem with NEON jumping around the map. THE JUDGE.
U guys added chidori this bout to be more broken then Jett before her nerfs LMAO
Wowww! 💕
Filipino are always connected into singing
OPTIMUM PRIDE OH UEH UEH UEH UEH UEH UEH
run n gun now is available as freature
"Riot, fix your run and gun" Neon's ult:
this gotta be the most broken shit ive ever seen
It seems like NEON thinks Sage is annoying.
Every Apex player after picking Neon: *haha, run n slide goes brrrrrr*
Astig 🤟😍
this is a very cute trailer
Just imagine run and gun with this agent in rank it will make someone mentally disorder playing this game....
shes mine back off
🅱️ilipino 🅱️ride
The animation has a stop motion feel to it which adds really well to neon’s overall character, thanks riot
She definitely got a thing for Phoenix. She puts up a vid of Phoenix first thing as she entered the room and one of her abilities straight up copies his
Lets go snatcher agent!!!1
"Controlado ko to" LES GOO SHES ACTUALLY FILIPINO
2:16 HER WALIS 😭😭😭
RUN N GUN LEZZGOOOO

THEY FEATURED YLONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THEY FEATURED YLONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Pinoy priiiddeee!!!!

cypher isn't the first one to die, let's go
ok don’t get me wrong, I love the trailer and the new agent, but I’m NOT excited to be run and gunned in half a second
Yooo run and gun comes with her 😂. Excited to use her
Run and gun is now official
Octane mains : well, i think i'm gonna move to valorant bois
ok so another wraith
So was it planned for both the new league and valorant characters to look pretty similar and have a lightning theme?
Zeri from League got isekai'd to valorant
mommy sage
I LOVEEE VALORANTTTT
Oh I'm definitely gonna start replacing raze with this new agent lol
electro wizard
Looks cool. But I see we aren't going for tactical or precise gameplay anymore lmao. Oh well.
very nice lookin forward to test her out
OMG NEW META COMING call of duty move set
i love you na kaagad neon
You are not serious
"controlado ko to" omgggggg
ulti de yoru + muros de phoenix + algo parecido a la ulti de brim+ e de jett = spark

Sheeeeshhh now jett have a competitor, lmao
yo this is fucking terrifying
mid
She's gonna destroy val 💀
"I come from an ancient bloodline of run and gunners" -neon, probably
i wanna try everything!!
Us philipino's are prideful in our culture. Riot sure knows how to appeal to us 😂😂
The ult is the thing that bugs me out a little, but let's see when we play her
1.7 mil in 7 hours?
bro she kinda looks cute
Ah yes, Viper wall BUT 2
eyy we have our first Filipino agent on valorant im so excited😁💪💪
i think i just witnessed run and gun.
Is she toxic tho? Just like filipinos😉
Fuck me take my money
bat nandyan yun walis na pamalo ni mama!
Based on the video, I think her sprint ability would be her E that she can toggle and is limited from a cap of (example) 100 energy to 0. Maybe it can recharge 20 energy per kill. This is cus at 0:50 of the video, she sprinted then took out her judge and went back to sprinting after killing Sova.  Then perhaps her fire walls are her C.  Her Q would be her cc, acting similar to a Skye Q (Wolf) or Breach E (Concuss) - which according to the video can bounce at least x1 but leave x2 stun areas. 1st is where it bounced and the 2nd where it lands. Probably to flush corners (Like Raze Boom Bot) but need to be played strategically to get the most of out it.  Then clearly her ult is zap zap that seemingly is not affected by movement in terms of recoil.
thats so op XD
Precise Gunplay
Also... She give me joylyne vibes...
wtf that op
cool
One of the best trailer of a new agent
She's cute.
Nice lets goooo
neon go skrrrtt skrrrt
I've got goosebumps this agent is so badass
What the .....!
LESSSSGOOOOOOOO ALABYOOOO VALORANTTTT!
Only me who thinks the Marshall has had a rework? Looks like it
The question is, will she be in my game today? Can't wait to activate and use the agent, Nice work, Riot!
Let's goooooo  This is soooo gooood
WTF SO COOL
Its that RayGun?
I INSTANTLY wanna main her 👍🏻👌🏻💙⚡⚡

Singed do Valorant
"HAAAY BUHAAAY" is my current personality right now i can't T.T
man imagine getting one tapped with vandal while neon is run and gunning
Daughter of phoenix and jett
I hear her say ayy buhay and kontrolado koto salamat valorant
Me: Oh sheesh she's op can't wait to try her.      *The Insta Lock Guy* : Erm yeah bye Jett im ganna use this.
a Filipina agent and a Filipina singer.
Jod or what
Daymmmnn  valorant op
Flash
run n gun new meta :))))))))
She should have a Filipino accent.
LETSGOOO PILIPINAS
yeyyyy
Alright this is about neon but if she has room for herself, that means every agent in the protocol has room for themselves  I kinda wanna see each and every agent’s room now
Now release War Golok.
Now here's a new charger for my arrows. So convenient.
bro I thought neon had a revive too and I started tearing up. Really sick character!
aside from the obvious tagalog words you know she`s a filipino when she loves to sing haha
Make a film pleaaaaseee
Pp
Represent lezzzz goooooo
SHEESH! LESGOO FILIPINO PRIDE!✊ Where are all the Filipinos at?  And can we just appreciate the fact that this trailer is bomb!💥❤‍🔥
I think they just made a second jett
OMG, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I SEE SAGE IN A TRAILER, FINALLY And its been only 1 act and another agent is coming? Damn that was quick edit:sage looks thicc like literally
Neon + Spectre will be cool
thats gonna be my new main ~///~
Lets see how long will she get a nerf
Parang nitibo char
this means that this girl can run and gun, ok valorant nice gun play
ngl, i kinda expect a blink or a dash but shee just run af boi
how tf is this dawg shit number one trending gtfo so my master yb can be first 🤣
1:20 phoenix fire wall: i joking to you
this game is MID, valorant is better.
This agent looks sick but i swear to god if one of those abilites is a run and gun thing (which it looked like it was) im uninstalling and refunding my purchaeses
Philippines bb
O yeah <3
yooo this devs have no clue about what you can put into an fps game and whats completely fkn busted. this is some fkn bs right there. MORE RUN N GUN PLEASE THANK YOU (:
Imagine if she swears in tagalog in game HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAH
Damn riot literally took run and gun and made it a mechanic 😭
perfectly accurate run and gun?
RIOT GAMES: We don´t think our Champions have overloaded KIts´
Zamn she kinda bad tho
superspeed run and gunning looks great!!!! The character herself tho looks cool lore-wise
this is... TOO OP also theres no way youre not gonnamake series right riot
she can shoot Laser... wait... LASERRRRRR?????
she's cool but going to ruin the game sorry riot but no one wants more run gun
how about the gun's recoil while she's run fast? does it stay steady like shooting without moving or not?
0:27 every fnaf players when hearing the phone guy:
hella dope!
2:19 if she gets a valorant go cup of reyna i think riot should let us buy it too
LEZZZGOWW PELEPENSSS🇵🇭👌
She can slide?
deadass just brought the CoD movement system in with her lol
now this is awesome ☺️
damn,,, apex reference!
Zeri just up and at it in the Real World guess Zaun was too much for her.
hype
Proud to be pinoy...
Phillipines finally getting some love😩
ah the tracer i was waiting for
seems balanced
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ✨💞
So..  Faster running Sliding????  A concussion grenade Two Phoenix walls? Sappy zappy fingers?
Yooo Filipino word? Ahhh I'm excited well the problem maybe I don't have enough storage for it maybe?
The way sage want to race with neon is cuteee i wonder if sage will skate using her slow XD
Okay so she can dash like Jett, double wall like Phoenix and can concuss with a ranged grenade. Not to mention the ultimate finger tazer. Sounds like a duelist to me.
less go phillipines💪🏽
YOOO THIS COOL
the new agent skills look like reyna alot
race u there? puts slow orb
Powered by Meralco
Filipino representation lets get it!!
hay buhay is mood
I think her hair would look better if it is entire blue. I don’t like the blonde addition

Tactical Shooter

Jett 2
REBIBE ME JETTT
*Neon exist* Rip phoenix
Sheeeeeeeeeeesh
Confirmed this is gonna be an op agent like jett
Takbuhan na! Salamat, Riot-Valorant!
Valorant mobile when? 🙏
Lol sage introducing new member to the team is so friendly, imagine this is viper or yoru doing it :p "you made a few changes? Good, now drag yo ass to the team meeting"-viper
Are we gonna ignore the Sage debut (physically😅) in valorant cinematic lore... Neatly Done Riot Games... I give you that. 😏
i hope the next agent is vietnamese
MGA PILIPINO RISE UP
Great another asian character for the community to sexualize! 🤠
KONTROLADO KO TO
This trailer is so cool, many of her kits are interesting. Especially interested in the sliding mechanic and how that works in terms of aim. I can see her being one of the "OP" agents upon released but the community gets used to her over time. I bet chamber and sage will get picked more now, her kit gets countered too much from slows.
Why doees this Trailer have like 12 fps
HOLY!
Oh hell they made run and gun into an agent
So So COOL!!!
That's a freakin Rei gun right there. Cooooool!!!
With Neon on the game absolutely making every Filipino proud, I hope we Pinoys are motivated too slay the FPS scene.  Neon aka the Quiapo Snatcher
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEESSHH
New meta: neon run n gun
It feels like riot is trying to replicate what makes jett popular with the new agents (neon, chamber) - movement abilities, ulti that does dmg/kill
seems like playing this agent will make your game overwatch
Looks AWESOMEE
Son solo pixeles? :c
Why does she run like the cop from the raining meatballs movie?
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeessh
She is going to be absolutely broken isn't she
Di yan pinoy hahahaha nag sapatos sa kwarto
Welcome to Overwatch 2!
It’s such an unexplainable feeling to hear the words I would say, the accent I hear, and see the items that represent the Philippines in such a big game like Valorant. Insane.
YEAHHHHH
omg she op
THIS NEON PLAYLIST ABOUT TO BE FIRE!!! as a filipino woman IM SO EXCITED FOR HER RELEASE
I usually skip this part of the video
VALORANT OMG
I love how Valorant made this agent very Filipina. Just by looking at the items inside her place, the broom, posters of the artists, the Pilipinas shirt, the Bonifacio clothing (?), and hanging medals on wall. Include also the lines and her singing using the brush comb and toothbrush HAHAHA. Love the music choice as well, really fits with the trailer! Can't wait for this agent to be released!
lmao a finger gun
Eyo every girl in the ph had a ring light with them great detail riot!
ya estoy pidiendo el nerf xdddd
The details on her cultural background🤌
Sickkkkk!
Wohhhhh
She's so op
jett drowning
Na esto si que esta rotisimo
OGNFNDHFJ IM SO HYPED WE GOT A FILIPINOOO
We better get squish squish as a gun buddy or Im gonna get mad
We all know she’s gonna be OP before even seeing her in game
delete pheonix lmfao
THANK YOU RITO🖤🖤🖤
Ois... Another hero with mobility... I think she's gonna be meta.
Judging by that op shot, I think part of her lore is her having difficulty controlling her radiant abilities just like Jett and Phoenix, because of the tear-like bolts after that shot, and the giveaway when she says "I have this under control". I can see the three of them having quite a connection, a friendly rivalry with Jett and somewhat of an acquaintance with Phoenix, also because Jett and Phoenix are into each other. Or maybe I'm just overthinking idk
3 words run and gun
Ladies and gentleman run and gun meta is here
Her abilities color looks like inspired by ph flag
Lesss Gooo A Filipino Agent Big Respect
We need some “Mga bobo!” Voice line
The new Sonic the hedgehog movie hits different
omfg this agent looks so powerful🤩🤩🤩🤩
gg run and gun is a skill now
Quicksilver but female Hope she sees the bullets coming !
The pinoy voice line on the ultimate gave me goosebumps
Im getting the chills shes filipino shes a good entry definitley maining her
Imagine Sovas darts can charge Neon
Let sage be her mentor and not reyna. Also it’d be cool if we get to see other agents’ rooms too.
thicc
wowoweewow
The she sighs, i heard like she said "hay buhay" 😂 like most of the filipino says it 😂😂😂
Già sto smadonnando ed è solo il trailer
MY FILIPINA QUEENNNN
The Philippines represent!!
And the first place on my waifu list goes to Neon! She is nuts! ❤️❤️❤️
MABUHAY
OH NO. NOT THE "Haaay, Buhay..." 😂
Now all we need is a Walis Tambo melee weapon that costs 35 dollars and the game is complete
KONTROLADO KO TO
BROOOOOOOOO
Cool new character is from Apex Legend ...
Soooo hype! Cant wait
LESGO I CAN CONTROL THIS IN FILIPINO
Im gonna play this game if Neon says "Pisting Yawa" everytime she dies.
WAG KANG BASTOS MEMES ARE COMING
Wow her ult is finger of death
Ohshi shawty pare
Ulti sound : PUTANGINAMOOO
Hella cute ;)
Phoenix but better
NGL, since I rarely hear my own language in games I kinda cringed there a bit 😂 is this how the normie Japanese feel about anime?
Another new agent trailer where Cypher gets killed... Sad
This is great, good job valorant!
She has a portrait of her dog Automatic top tier
HAY BUHAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tactical shooter¿?
Hay nako BUHAY! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Nerf to miner
Ngl I think ima love this new argent to Valo, good work Riot. ^w^ Sidenote, it's funny that Neon is a character now because I always wondered if a fast mobility agent would ever be made for the game, (I may have thought of a few ideas what the character would be like) but it's funny how coincidental this is XD Anyway again, awesome job Riot, can't wait to play her in game.
Her ult looks like something out of overwatch
The Fun in Run and Gun is “u”
DID SAGE JUST SAY "hey, race u there?" LOLL
of course the most broken character will be from the Philippines. 🇵🇭
Riot proved themselves that they're game doesn't provide precise guNplAY at all.
RUN AND GUN
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEe
jett who?
Love the tenorio jersey!❤
flash with chidori
they fkin embrance the run and gun mechanics WTF IS THIS RIOT THIS WILL BREAK YOUR GAME
Killua Godspeed Skills.
1:41 - kontrolado ko to
finally an hero for run n gun
I DECLARE THIS HAS TO BE A SERIES
Jett's gonna have some serious competition...
Sana may mura sa voicelines lol
Neon main already LESGOOO
AYO the defensive rotations gonna be crazy fast
Looks like a run and gun character to me
ho shit
Her crouch sliding and sprinting makes me think she's an agent that is supposed to attract Call of Duty and Apex Legends players.
So instead of fixing the run and gun issue they make it worse. Makes sense riot
the only unrealistic thing here is her wearing shoes on the bed but this is so sick damn
SHASHEESH
Finally cypher survives this trailer
Yooo this agent can run n gun xDDD
waitaminute, cypher did not die in a trailer?
LABAAAAAAAAAAN
after this: sage wins race
awtiiii q fofinhaaaaaa  bem vinda neon, minha main??
When js she coming
Q: What devices it on?
Yes now i can finally counter op users
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
neon - the better jett
yes run a gun character now i can mold even harder
Flash's sister?
i want the song
:o
Entertain me!!
Eyyy! Ylona!
1:53 this reminds of a certain scene in reveng of the sith👀 👀
OMG si Browniiieeeee 🐶
Sage: Race you there? Also Sage: uh uh you can't **Wall the door*
OMG SHE LOOKS SO COOL

"Hay, buhay." Hahahahahaha nice.

Amongus?
Pilipinas sumigaww
Powered by meralco
Wohoooo
10fps animation

Reppin the Filipino community, I love it
Valorant is all bout holding angles. and they come up with a sprinter character. we cant even aim when people strafe left right. great
Siiiiiiiiiiiiii
Ahhh yes jett will ketar ketir
biglang naging proud filipino dahil kay Neon ngiiii
Cypher is definitely going to get played a lot more often
Stinger users: I'm in love
I can feel the F I L I P I N O radiating from Valorant again
Ah yes tagalog Neon says "Hay Buhay" and "Kontrolado ko to"
💓
so her abilities is like phoenix and jett and breach
1:54 hi echo
Now i wait for polish character
SHE IS THE TRUE DEFINITION OF RUN AND GUN OH MY GOD
So it's just sonic the hedgehog
Lets goooo finally!!
Neon and jet will make a deadly combination in a team cant wait to see it
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
instead of adding new characters, fix your horrible gun mechanics
NOICE NEW AGENT
HAY BUHAY HAHAHAHHAH HOLYSHIIIIIITTTTTTTTTT
I'm just happy to finally see Sage in a trailer XD
._. She is Zeri but in Val
REPRESENT!!!
I swear their better not be r34 of her, she is too precious
VALORANT YOU ARE FUCKING SOMETHING!!
Salute to the creators
WHAAAAAAAT!!!
Wooooow🥺
did someone saw the frame that has a name “Pilipinas 5”
is a fucking jett- cool. thx valorant finally you make a rival for our jett players
Thicc !
I feel like this is gonna need a nerf XDD
could you maybe release the agent on my bday jan 8 yeah I'm sure even if this was noticed riot wouldn't do it
Amazing😍
im not even lying, lol.. i actually teared up and cried a little bit watching this. As a Filipino who is in the United States, it hits so close to fucking home seeing her miss her country, miss the beach, miss the culture, and everything.. making her room like the philippines, the way she's singing, the way she used "ay, buhay. (ah.. life..), the way she hears her family while she almost dies. Everything about her is so authentic.. even the jersey with pilipinas on it, and the walis. thank you valorant for this my god, thank you riot.. it may seem like im "over reacting" but she's just so relatable and i see myself in her so much.. </3 ty.
damn she kinda fine
A filipino agent
Phoenix x yoru x jett
This a banger. Couldn’t have been a better set of animations and found a better blend of music.
Say goodbye to Jett?
Finally we got a filipino character in valorant 👦👌
bro i doubt that this competitive game
Filipino Pikachu
WAAAAAAAAAH
KIDLAT!
The phone is fully charnge everytime
Maybe her ult is the electricity thing and then self rez when she dies… idk she seems kinda broke
bulldog run and gun brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Sonic the hedgehog in Val??????
"Hay, buhay"
can already tell its going to be a rough few weeks
Ahahahaha *cries in potato laptop*
Trying Neon in Unrated MM *Run and gun with 20fps* My 🥔 computer: bruh
he is Filipino😍
Đột Phá 😁
EPIC! but its kinda hard to use for me but the new agent looks epic!
sooo octane??
How the hell you supposed to use Neon without frames? this game is meant to be super easy to run, and something tells me it may to change.
YO VALORANT IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL
HAHAHA IF SHE GETS A KILL/ACE SHE CAN SAY: "SANA OL"  with a mocking voice ofc
It would actually be a great idea if she switches from blue to red when she uses her ult, to really have that pinoy feeling during war when the flag switches blue and red.
Omg overwatch
Time For Speed
as a used to genji main this is the perfect character for me
WOW So cool
Did she just say "Haaaay Buhay"?  Thats sooo filipino. Hahaha
RIOT really said "precise gunplay" then proceed to make an agent who basically run and guns :/
Can't wait for dasnerth to abuse this meta with his controller and judge
im bricked up rn
Imagine being able to charge your phone fully by grabbing it; I'm fucking jelly.
can we get a good map?
Finally i can apex legends in valorant XD
Sage is my main, she welcoming her is like Sage's indication to me for my new main Hahaha.
I'm sensing my new main agent 😊😊
i think zeri and her are like mirror clones yk
Flash but its girl
Eyyy the room has a walis 😍
Now I can see myself get killed by running and shooting in 60fps and 144 hz
;PInoy agent Letzz goooo NEON number WAn
cant wait for her to scream: "PUTANG INA MO"
FILIPINOS, UNITEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ah finally, an octane in valorant
FILIPINO GANG LETSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yo, she got that palpatine ult
Why u wear shoes inside neon 😂😂
this is so mindblowing
Finally I can run around faster to die even faster by 1 tap from smurfs. Gotta go fast.
but im already tracer
when we ask blizzard for new filipino overwatch character  blizz: NO only america and koreans only  when we ask riot for filipino character riot: YES  this is why i like riot more than blizz coz they listen to their players despite the flawed penalty system
Still waiting for a console port
neon is speak tagalog
Jett but faster hahah
This is what I'm talkin' about! LESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Riot rly said make the run and gun officially meta
Instalocked!
Kontrolado ko tohhh!!!
I see Riot finally caught on with the Pinoy baiting trend and I honestly don’t mind. Also, Ylona is <3.
That is sexy as fuck!
Now I can finally Ferrari peek
THE WALIS TAMBO IN THE BACK
Sheesh
that wall seems rather stupid to me
yo lesgooooooooooooooooo this might be my new main
Jett x Phoenix
So op! its awesomeeee
I love her already <3
many said she was build for run & gun but don't realize that she can not hold a gun while sprinting
This agent is gonna haunt my dreams shes way to strong
Bủh
Ah yes a new jett
Broken broken broken broken 🤣🤣🤣
Yo this looks so cool
Pause at 1:13 and you can actually see a Philippines jersey with a number 5
WOW

Oh my i love going fast. My bro use to call me speedy
😳
I Love Her Style!
RUNNN AND GUNNN NOOO WTFFFFF

This FPS looks so f**king bad, STILL. How have they managed to create such a vapid excuse for a video game IDK. 2020+ video gaming 🤣🤣😂😂
yooo sfm artists gonna have a field day 🤨
I'm smelling a new main~
❤️
Ganda
OHH MYYY GOOOD
dang her face looks like stacy from the spider verse- change my mind...
HYPED
Movement based agent?
looks like phoenix/reyna abilities merge conflict
The dog u see in the photo frame is actually Kayo with flesh on ಥ‿ಥ
Neon is basically a mixture of Apex and Quake 1 gameplay as her loadout.  And holy crap, her ult is similar to those to a thunderbolt gun in Quake.  *QUAKE GAMEPLAY FILIPINA*
Thanks so much riot! You really did your research in the Filipino culture 🤍
Those walls tho
That's Sick, Ilove it
AH BUHAY 😍
SHEEEESH
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I'M JUST SMILING AND YELLING RANDOM SHIT WHILE WATCHING 😍😍😍 MY FILIPINO ASS CAN'T CONTAIN THE FILIPINO-NESS REPRESENTATION IN HEEEER AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
is Jett"s reign finally over ?
Forget unlocking chamber, it's basically required for me to have Neon unlocked first
Disruption 😳
BRUHH SHE SO CUTE WTF
#1 Trending
LESGOOOO ITS A PIKACHUUUU !!!!
I will like this agent!
uhhm this is a concert... and I like it, the goosebumps, the hype, the mfking ult is too op.
Let's goo this is #1 on trending
jett 2.0
The animation team were DEFINITELY inspired by Into the Spider-Verse for this one
did she say "Hay, Buhay">??>????>?>?>
i really had high hopes that neon can finally be the first agent to outrun jett but i was wrong
Love ittt
I don’t know if this looks dumb or absolutely amazing, but it seems like both
SHE SHOOTS LIGHTNING FROM HER HANDS?????
LEZZ GOOO Filipino Si Neonn YWAAA
Damnn is that ghost figther spirit gun
the grind begins
I swear Sage and Neon symbolizes China and Philippines lol
Fillipino friends, can you tell me what she said while she on her ult
I hope she curses in tagalog 🤣🤣
I actually like a lot the new agent and the way they presented her, but Riot. .... Where is the Italian meme agent?  The game needs it
so run and gun is now a thing?
guess reina isn’t the only hot one;)
Pika pika?
IM GOING TO MAIN THIS
At this point  How can you outrun her when she has sprint
OMG NEW AGENT???
🐄
Smart move Rito. Release the same character on two different games!!
what i think in my brain when im using neon: RUN AND GUN
MABUHAY
Finally jett has some competition
YAS SHE'S FILIPINO "CONTROLADO KO TO"
simplified : Breach + Phoenix + Jett + Apex + Snatcher
YES
HOW IS SHE SO CUTE AND SO COOL
Im about to Auto lock faster then jett auto lockers

Jett: Race you to the spike sites! Neon: would you like me to Slide or not?
Am I obligated to get this agent if I am Filipino?   Also I am excited as hec to try her :o

The moment she said "haaaay buhay", I instantly fucking knew.
To everyone saying she is going to ruin valorant from run n gun, Jett has been doing that since day 1
wow, run fast, teleporting, double wall, and electric ult. awesome. cant wait
Run & gun and more kill abilities. Expected from riot
Riot: we fixed run and gun Also Riot: here’s an agent who’s gimmick is running and gunning   She looks super sick tho

Wtf 😮
Neon otso otso when?
Hi lookalike Jett ah I mean Neon whahahahha:)
I hope they didn't just make a run and gun ability.
Ahhh man. I miss playing Valorant. If I didn't have a job the days would be Valorant + Halo. Valorant is such a good game.
GAGI ANG ANGAS
Bilis nya ah halatang taga tondo praktisado mag snatch.
Add a male agent next
Nice running and gunning around the map,but the video was incredible
Finally a 3d sage
Dammnnnnnnnnn God Dammmmnnn I'm ready for the new agent
"HAYY BUHAYY" HAHAHA LEZGOOOOO!!
Though it was a troll of her being Filipino then she says "hay buhay.."
Run n Gun takes it to the whole new level :>
Controlado koto
Ayyyye Shes filipino <3
this agent gonna take run n gun to the next level
Bro- I know I won't be able to play her well, I just wanna see jett and neon fight

Yo wtf walls laser hands the ability to slide this is cap
New agent looks pretty sick but can we all agree that this trailer is pretty wonky
This is sick
Soundtrack sounds great
Nah she should go to fortnite
So you just need to add a p90 like in csgo
Valorant the last airbender
God of run and gun lol
Nays nays, just don't add her tribal affiliation on her bio.. Filipino tribes uling roasters each other.. specially tagalog vs bisaya, just sayin.. I'm ilocano btw.
LFG! I AM SO HAPPY THAT THERE IS A CHARACTER THAT RESPRESENTS YOU!
U are ungrateful

Kinda cringe, ngl
PHOENIX BE LIKE: ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?
Jett main trying neon be like: Omg this girl so smooth and fast like jett lol Also Jett main to neon main: wanna race :)
🛴🛴🛴
Riot is not even hiding gun and run
Sheeeeessshhh
Where is the Canadian character? We need Canadian representation in Valorant!
Sigh...makes me wish I was good enough to actually enjoy the game.
It seems like running and gunning is now canon
wait she's filipino right  SHE'S RIOTS SHIP CHILD OF MICHEAL AND LILY   Ok legit, she good with tech, powers support tech, playstyle can be technical and simple, she makes beautiful stuff like heck
Dont worry "abilities dont kill" and "precise gunplay" is included in this.
Sheesh
Had filipino vibes from her. And I was right
this is where slow orbs actually come in hand.
🔥🔥🔥
Neon lang sakalam
Looks like Jett getting replaced O_O
wtf is that bro run n gun accuracy?
yes sirrr
Prod will abuse this character
TAGTS SO COOL OMG
Don't laughing at England primitive man!  because America it's same primitive man! 😂
I hope she had a line that's says deputa kayo if she got revived
this is really Dope i cant wait to use this agent
I think there's a meaning of her power is it weather
Omg I predicted she was Filo and I was right! Philippines represent! 🤙🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻
Damnnnn I'm crazy
türkçenin ingilizcenin(gerçek kanal burası) önünde olması  2:30
Will she look cool sliding on sage's slow orb?
Neon, the Legend of Run & Gun.
Everything these artists make looks the same it's like california the video game at this point
Shocking
KILLUA GO GET YOUR ANIME SORTED , BEFORE YOU GET IN THE GAME
Ughhhhhhh 😍
1:39 I thought she rebibed herself and then realized that jett is nearby
Eeyyy yoooooo Niceeee
Ah yes, i will run with her with my 15 Valorant FPS 🥰🥰
Isnt the ult useless if we just one tap her
The real definition of run and gun is here!
soo cool, riot i love youu!
YOOOOOOOOOO
Her ult looks a bit goofy
ok i will hate this agent
Valorant 2022 is for Filipino people Lakad Matatag
Dont peek  Neon main: *Bet*
I'm so excited to main her
Using Neon would probably spark my pc too
I like this agent because she is beautiful
phoenix have 2 firewall now ?
Eh
Hmm, Hello Tracer from Overwatch
5 abilitys??
Jett replacement trailer O-o
It would be a shame for all Filipinos if she doesn't say "Jett revive me"
Tangina lezzgooooo
She sprints, slides, walls, stuns, and fires lightning out of her fingers. She's from Narutoverse.
Why is are the animations in 15fps?
Run and gun baby!!
Anggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas!
Oh my fuck this looks so fucking broken, I like the wall ability but they literally just makes phoenix that much less viable
No way! I'm speechless right now. Gotta love this character for the rest of my life.
Thats is crazy
Valorant just said u b*tches have been complaining way to much about run and gun, I'll show you what run and gun really looks like
when she comes out get ready for the nerf a day later
Run ang Gun

AHHHH I'M SO HYPED
MY BRAND BOIIIS and I'm Filipino
Now I can actually play COD in Valorant
OH SH*T THE 2 WALL BESIDE HER THAT ANILITY WAS INSANE
looks like Electric SpiderMan in Call of Duty but the game is valorant
if they made a valorant tv series like arcane it would be the best thing to ever bless our eyes
Kontrolado ko to means I control this
op
it's one of the best trailers I've ever seen
HIT AND RUN...🙂
Neon is gonna be so fun!
"hay buhay"   -oh life-  That's the expression that every Filipino said HAHAHA
Im gonna spend VP on her contract so I can play her first XD
Yeah so what are your abilities?  I am Speed! And i am apex movement

So ...in short she's the Phoenix but better!
Sage: "Race you there?" *throws slow orb* Sage: "bitch u thought"

I feel like raze and neon will get along well
HYPE AGENT HYPE FLOWING THROW MY VEINS
Mabuhayyyyyy did she just said that

Cipher died on minute 1... again... 😖
So Phoenix jet hybrid + sith ult
Arat na pinoy! Hahahahah
The double wall seems insanely op

Her ult seems Messy... But i still think jett is better, more agile
Hayyyy buhayyy

Yes I see lowtiergod's meme made into a Valorant Agent
the new jett and phoenix?
i can already see that neon and sage will be the best duo lmao
YO
Now I can run and gun even more
yall got the idea from fortnite to add sliding? lmao run and gun time
1:18 every filipino ever:
BatChest
I hope she speaks tagalog when she ace
Each day we stray closer towards overwatch 2
Yessss Riot did my country girl a great job!!!!
LIGHTNING GUN!
Hello baby your name should be broken, because you are so broken. ',:)
Good job Val adding a insanely broken character to a game that already is just run and gun at this point that’s just better phoenix wall making him even less meta
🇵🇭
Dat ass viper's got a competition
"Hay Buhay" something is rising and its not the shield hero!
LETS GOO PINOY POWERRR
I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!!
Call of duty
Blue hair? let me guess, Pronouns?
Damnnnnnnnnnnnnn
mga autolock duelist jan.. may pang entry na duelist na kayo mga hinayupak kayo Hahaha
Wooooo
True meaning of run and gun
So neon is a call of duty veteran who got bored and came to valorant
So a Run&Gun agent!
The singing part is really accurate
Looking forward to it! Human Pikachu, here we go! Mixed with fire. Also, she's from Philippines? Or just teamed with PILIPINAS? She's probably will be my main because I was born there.
Damn this agent is fast as hell
Don't forget that cypher died again :>
Neon: *Walls Pheonix:Waiittt...... that's illegal
it's time to play high sens
S P E E D
Oww shig i dont have pc
WOW
Phoenix looking at her wall : "y- you can do that, too? :("
Meron Filipino agent i think all filipino players like me will use spark because why not
Pog
I look at this trailer and all I can think about is arcane
The character version of run and gun
1:13 Pilipinas in the background ✨
this agent looks like a combination of Wraith and Tracer lmao
Run n Gun meta
Sage: Hey the team's waiting, race u there? Neon:  **Ready to sprint** Sage: **Throws slow orbs along the way** 😅😂
I love how they literally show run and gunning like its nothing... I guess they just embracing the run n gun
CANT WAIT
its so cute for some reasons ;-;
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
people need to hurry up with the rule 34
Neon singlehandedly killed Call of Duty
Shesssshhhhhhhhhhh goosebumps! Thank you riot🥺🥺🥺

That Sage wall was pretty clutch
i love her.
aiyo the next Phoenix bro
I’m early and good job Valorant I Love Your Videos So Much and Congratulations on #2 Trending For Gaming
YOOOOOOO
Ayo ninja in valorant?!?!
かっけぇ！！！絶対使ってて楽しいやつやん！
So you're saying I can play Octane in Valo? Done.
I'm guessing the ult is the lightning laser thingimajig
why is it in 2 fps? other than that, this makes me almost want to download the game, but i dont wanna get addicted to it like all my friends :/
okay but who uses the stinger at the range and gets a kill........
Niceee
Players: Stop run and gun!! Rito: It's an ability now.
wooof woof mommy
Que a gente apelona
op as hell
loud filipino noises***
Team PH letz GO
So much fan service for us Filipino fans and players. Thank you Riot. Expecting her to be OP on release 😅
She is like Barry Allen fastest man alive 😆😆
The song, the agent with its skills, the dog photo and the on point voice acting got me so bad. I love it!
I haven’t seen a Filipino in a video game since Santos in Def Jam: Fight for NY. Representation matters. Thank you Riot and Valorant
Wag ka bastos
Just want a male healer tbh
neon+odin+run and gun=bisaya gaming hahaha
MOOOOOOBBBIIIIILLLLIIIITTTTTTYYYYYYYY
the ult seems like an apex legends gun lmao, its gonna be op with good tracking ability
I didn’t know that the league balancing team moved to valorant
Sage won race
SWAGAPINO 💖💖💖💖💖
Valorant sucks ! Let’s goooo apex !
we playing apex right now?
Lamo CoD players fave character confirmed
Riot NERF Neon please!!!
I am...... in LOVE
Need a new $100 bundle so you can hire some animators
Im gonna make new account just for this agent
Her singing automatically qualifies her as a filipino❤️🤣
which agent lets me crank 90s
Walis Tambo Supremacy
so a passive slide, a run, better phoenix wall, some sort of bouncing shock grenade or whatever, and a lightning finger gun. have a feeling she’s gonna get nerfed
jett replaced
Jinx?
Como la tienen con darle armas a los agentes mediante habilidades
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
bouta increase my dpi to 600000
Looks cool
When run and gun is already an issue u decide to release this
W
Who tf is the creator of this video !!! GIVE HIM A FREAKIN RAISE !!! RIOT !!!!
Halo players be like: Finally, a worthy legend.
dopeeee
Riot : running gun would bot happen  again , we just fixed it . The new agent : running  shooting Lazer  lol 😆
Killua fans, RISE UP,  IT'S OUR TIME.
what is the song 🥺🥺🥺 it is so nice 🎶🎶🎶
Is it just me or does she look a lot like jett
Run and gun: Level Up!
EYYYY DRIP AGENT LETS GOOOO
Get ready i instalock Neon fast
fuck playing her, shit looks broken af will be a horror to balance her out for comp
The ult is beyond broken wtf is that
Nice Voice Actor and her personality truly represent some Pilipino
She is so waifuable Haaaaaa
So, her ability allows her to run and gun like Jett, however instead of being precision based ult it's a tracking based one?  Where she does damage over time instead of one tapping people?  That's kind of neat, I think she's supposed to be the rival to jett idk?  Can't remember where I heard that but the similarities are there, I think that's pretty cool honestly.
jsut what we need, a gun and run and slide Duelist. Well done Riot
Basically pilipino flash
Inaccurate, she's Filipino but wearing shoes in her room and on her bed get it together riot smh
FILIPINO GANG!!!!!
The "Hay Buhay" part made me go AJDBJSBSJBSJEBJDBDJXBJSBAHBAHSBSJBRNDJWJND
i am going to be maining her!!! she is fire
Soooo I guess in her lore she has problems controlling her powers, from the lines"Kontrolado ko to" when she got shot
AMAZING TRAILER 10000/10 LOVE YPU VALORANT TEAM
Literally turn it into Overwatch XD
Zeri, is that u
JETT IS OVER!!!!
I love how all the clips of her are just running and gunning such accurate gameplay from riot here
Noice
Sliding agent nice
cant wait to be finger blasted by neon
Where is the Battlepass?
WAIT SHE SEEMS SO FUN
Copied sliding from Fortnite🤬🤬
They just copy and pasted the new League champ to Valorant? XD
Unnnlimited POOOWEEEER!!!!!
DUDE THIS IS SUCH A FREAKING BIG BRAIN IDEA, FILIPINO, FASTER THAN JETT, SICKEST SKILLS (LITERALLY PHEONIX’S WALLS, SLIDING, CAN BE FASTER THAN JETT, TRAPPSSSS, AND FREAKING LITERALLY A FREAKING “HAND” “GUN” THAT COULD LITERALLY SHOOT LAZARBEAMS AT U), AND LASTLY THICKER THAN A BUS TRUCK!?!?
YESSS!!
another duelist eww
When Neon meets Sova Sova: SHOCK DART!!!
Ohh sage😩😩😩😩

0:37 "Hay, buhay" is basically, "(Sigh), life."  1:37 "Kontrolado ko 'to" means, "I can control this," or "I control this."

Jett’s career is found in a ditch
Pangit SF pa rin

In 1:13, you can see in the background there are jersey on the wall posted and said "Pilipinas 5" thats a Basketball Jersey t-shirt represent as Gilas Pilipinas in the Philippines.

POV: You use to be Jett main
If anyone knows when is the exact date she will be released?
Indonesian Agent when?
MY FILO QUEEN I CANT WAIT FOR YOU TO COME HOME

Oh my fcking god!!! Yeaaah!
Omen was not hurt during the making of this video...
octane of valorant
Zeri valorant counterpart
Isa na akong ganap na SIMP!
at 1:44 she said i can control this
i love how they gave her an askal (stray dog) as her pet <3
After taking all my money for skins they make this bootleg trailer 😃
Ylona HHAHAAHHa
yessir
Sprinting and crouch sliding… bring on more CoD players to Valorant!!
This looks so awesome, but idk how some people are gonna feel about constantly being run n gunned
anybody sees analogies with zeri?
I love the detail where she says kontrolado ko to while ulting.
Oh god wait for the "I'm from the Philipines" comments lol
gago boi parkourist
Is this a actually a tactical shooter
Hyped baby!
This video in short:  Ability leak: Double wall, works probably similar to Phoenix‘s wall, but 2 walls leaving space to walk in between. Ultimate (probably) leak: Just goes Sith mode and fires lightning at enemies, will probably have very litte range.  Also, no info about the other 2 abilities. That‘s it. Late game I think she could be pretty good with operator since you have the ult for close range. This heavily depends on the cost of the ult tho.
Yoru be like you fast neon
Definition of run and gun, ngl agent looks heat though
Okay i like her
Wait what?! Duelist with concussion? I rather choose to die to duelist with blind than with concuss. Anyways, cant wait to play her
Can't wait to open another Valorant account.
Let's go I'm really excited for this agent!!!
Hayyyy buhaaaayyy
Not riot promoting bulldog run and gun💀💀
bye jett
what has this game turn into...
1,445,092 4 hrs

Oh yes, running and gunning at its best, with a splish splash of Symmetra, murmurs : time slows downnn when it can get noooo worseee...

ZERI'S SISTER ??? IS THAT U WTFFFF.
lot of horizontal mobility but no verticality shes going to be for realy quick plays eith might not be ideal in a positional shooter
Ok the last Ability shown is rlly rlly reminding of overwatch
As a fellow Filipino. Putting a filipino character makes me happy. She looks amazing.  But her skills. Oh oh oh well she an apex player zoomy zoomy 😂
Slide canceling 😤👍
Add a way to select an agent in chat so I don’t get constantly flagged for queue dodging because the game won’t load
I don't spend money on games like that but bro shes lit
So its a duelist
Titanfall in valorant but no wall running
She fire

RRRRRAAAAAYYYY GGGUUUNNNN. BRRT BRRRTTT!!!!
This is it
I hope she can control the width of her wall to make it like 1 thicc wall or 2 seperate walls because without it she's gonna be pretty predictable
she is a filipina right?!
Probably one of the best designed agents and an interesting kit to be added in valorant
DAMN TOO SOON TO BE SIMP!!!
She is thick

yooooooo
Road to the end
LEZZGOO PINAS!!!! Damn I really like this new agent!!!
Run & gun bug  If you can't beat 'em, join them.   For real riot. Fix the run&gun
This is what I think that the abilities are: -Passive: Slide (Hold+CTRL)  (C) Ability 1: INSTANTLY shoot an electrical projectile forward being followed by TWO electrical walls on the side, creating a pathway for you and your team.  (Q) Ability 2: INSTANTLY shoot a lighting projectile that bounces off ONE surface and hits TWO surfaces. The collision will be followed by a blue indicating zone; players who stay inside it after the projectile hits the SECOND surface will be stunned.  (E) Ability 3: INSTANTLY start charging your legs with electricity and zoom away! (You cannot hold any type of weapon while you’re in this phase.)  (X) Ultimate: INSTANTLY start charging your whole body with electricity which you can redirect at enemies. While in state you can run at maximum speed while still being able to zap your foes!
Yo did she just put her shoes on her bed????????
Daaamanananannnnnn
Me speed run valorant
Jett: Nobody's faster than me Neon: Bet
Zeri from league Is a copy and paste from this damn they are the same... Both electric and coming out around the same time sus?
ALL FILIPINOS RISE YOUR HAND
Thank you RITO!
Very Nice
This is racist Riot, just because she’s Filipino she can sing? Nah hell nah not having that. Anyway damn girl she got cake 😳😳😳
Aw man, I really looked forward to Neon's and Jett's rivalry in the trailer. But hey at least we see that she is faster lmfao
Gotta go fast
UOWWWWWW!
Kapan agen baru dari Indonesia
Neon sliding is like getting one of the gifts in Snowball Fight which is Skate.
All I want from this is food voicelines about adobo manok
I quit valorat
THIS IS EPICCCCCC!!!!!!!!!!
Dude, with Chamber i thought "Yeah, MAYBE there's a slim chance i'll main him" But her? 100% 1000% gonna make her one of my mains no cap
waitt.... can he dodge a shoulder height tripwire with his slide? lmao
well goodbye val. this actually might make me leave. why tf does she have double pheonix wall??????????? jett ult on crack. and a slide..............
Sage and Neon are besties now
i can feel the instalock from here
when you run out of ideas
Zeri? What are you doing here, wrong game!
Am I the only one who thinks she looks like the new league champion ?

"Precise gunplay is best and abilities don't kill" -Riot Games
So, she is basically Lancer from Rogue Company?
Sage really said race u there and instantly lost
My Filipino side is so HAPPY RN

Valorant gonna be a cod lobby bruh
Bruh... she and new league champ look the same. Also use electricity as source or smth 🧐
"The Filipinos are worth dying for" - Ninoy Aquino
The animation was weirdly bad
riot should be a music company
Precise Gunplay
Fucking run and gun
Finally, a filipina waifu
Bro that was a great detail where sage walled up so raze couldnt shoot her show stopper at her
Y’all already know imma be maining her. Can i get an amen 🙏 from all my duelist brothers
Don't really like her art
This is how war betwen jett mains and neon mains starts 😂😂
Amazing!!

So riot took run n gun to a whole new level
SUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
sonic
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA i cant with this its too good <3
I didn't expect Ylona to be in there that's so cool.
Finally a filipino character
oh no a run and gun agent
Can u make this game for mac please? I want to play…
Reminds me of Octane from Apex Legends
Karaoke with neon would be awesome
"haay buhay" 😆
Bru this so cool
Nice aim!
RUN AND GUN WILL BE BACK AGAIN BOYS. RUN N GUN GO BRRRRRR..
She’s Pinay!?!?!?
I swear its gonna be a thing now where whenever a new agent is revealed...all the nationalities are just waiting to see where the agent is from hoping its their own country :) And I love that😂
QUAKE PLAYERS RISE UP
Jett replacement
Dude my girl plays basketball and sings and is Filipino surprised she’s not a nurse
may walis nag vacuum Naman smh
this game could be a very good game, but with these new agents, u ruined it all. I used to play this game in the beta and a little bit in the 1st season, but when i ve seen the character who is like a tf2 engineer i deleted it. IMO if these new "balanced" and "skilled" champs wouldnt be in this game it can be the top 1 esport game. A lot company thinks that the change is good, yes good, but somewhere u dont need it.
Oh my gosh she looks sick. Like jet on staroids, and electrocuted 🤣
Prods new main
its like an jett ang phonex combination
Letsss foooooo
I like it
Sheeeeeeeeesh
She is a mix o Jett, Reyna, Pheonix, and a bit of Raze
Energy gun???
Those slides gives me apex legends ptsd LmO
New jett  coming in?
Valorant is the future
Neon is a filipina agent lets go valorant
(HAY, BUHAY!) "*Sigh* this life."   (Kontrolado ko 'to.) "I am in control of this." or  "I can control this."  Good thing to learn new Tagalog words, aight?
Finally an agent that I can dodge raze grenade and brims ult
Smite Odin run and gun 😈
I figured she would have looked like this. Finally, New agent. They did a good job on Chamber, I'm waiting for Yoru rework to see how that goes.
This trailer was amazing. sad that there'll now be instant lock jetts and now instant lock neons
She got a goddam taser?
New speedster with a weapon ult? Finally a reason to play not Jett.
3hits headshot neto matigas ulo
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
SHES'S PALPATINE LOL, HER ULT
Oh my gosh can’t wait to use her
Que Deus nos ajude
QUE QUEBRADA kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk   ]
Finally a trailer where cypher wasn't die Oh wait he die again lol
Sage not being serious? That's rare
LETS FCKING GOO THIS MADE MY NIGHT BETTER. ..        MY NEW MAIN IS HERE
Nice Where eps 3
Holy crap. Chamber who?
Skills: Some kinda of bouncy electric orb, increases her mobility, wall like phoenix but better and Zapping agents around. I'm fricking ready to play this agent. PILIPINAS LANG!
yeah the beginning of the end for this game.
finally a filipino character in a video game!!!! LABAN PINAS <3
Dude... That's sick
alrighty new waifu
mommy sage 🥺🥺🥺
BruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuH
OMG I LOVE HER ALR
Omg! she is a filipino:o
This will be the Octane of Valorant (Apex Players will understand.) Btw who is the voice actor?
So jett with Op wasn't enough now they have chamber with upgraded Op and latest being neon that could be a another Op meta as well as run and gun.  Excited to play her but at the same time afraid game will be more oper base or she can counter jett oper with run and gun
Insane
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
holy... thats nice, im about to main her!
this is by far the best trailer for an agent dkdkshs I AM HYPEDDDD
the day they add a "trans" operator is the day they lose their American playerbase
SHE'S SO ADORABL HOLJDSFNKSD
Race you there? Instantly walls Neon. Hahahaha
Is she faster than quicksilver?
who are the people that are exited for this agent because they are filipino
1:46 what language is that?
Omg Let's goo
Welp..I think I just found  my video game crush now
oh my goodness
“ High Sens Players “ - MY TIME HAS COME
So we have zeus on the squad. Im sorry the second i saw lighting from the fingers i busted out laughing
Okay I'll stop complaining about run and gun
Finally, A COD character.
Wow ♥️♥️♥️
Huh, valorant and league of legends have the same type champion coming to them, interesting 🤔.........
i need what yall mfs smokin ombmb
That Sage walling Raze’s Ultimate: cracked.
Now fix yoru
Finally a filipino agent, thank you riot.
octane tracer and phoenix combined
woah! spark is a Filipino agent😍
There better be a swear word on her line or this would not be a full Filipino agent
I am going to hate people playing shotgun with her now
when is she coming out
Shesssh
Wait she's Filipino??? She said " hay buhay"
She looks really good, but I think they could do a little more original because most of her powers are from others agents

I CALLED IT ITS A RUN N GUN AGENT
Querida, Odio cómo me obligué a decirte que me dejes en paz. Pero, sobre todo, odio cómo todas y cada una de las veces fallaste en hacer lo que dije, obligándome a lastimarme una vez más por tener que repetirlo.  Odio cómo haces tu camino dentro y fuera de mi vida como si fuera tu casa. Pero sobre todo odio que quisiera que fuera tu hogar.  Odio cómo hiciste que todo me recordara que eres la única persona en este mundo. Pero sobre todo odio que fueras el único en mi mundo.  Odio cuando dices que no hay nadie como yo porque hay muchos como yo que todavía no has herido. Pero sobre todo odio que necesite ser como nadie más para ti.  Odio cuando dices que soy el que más amas. No hay razón para eso. Odio oírte usar esa palabra como si supieras lo que significa.  Odio que seas tan obstinado en querer compartir todo conmigo como lo que creo que importa. Pero sobre todo odio que no pueda dejar de importarme.  Odio que odio todo sobre ti. Pero sobre todo odio que no pueda odiarte.  te quiero.  En primer lugar, me gustaría decir sin reparos que te odio. Odio que no importa cuánto lo intente, no puedo odiarte. Tu sabes quien eres. Entraste en mi vida sin previo aviso, y para mi sorpresa, creciste en mí. Mucho.  Tú fuiste la razón de tantas de mis frustraciones. Una razón para muchas de mis lágrimas. Una razón para muchas abolladuras en mi corazón roto. Y entre todas estas luchas, me mostraste más de mí de lo que nunca había tenido oportunidad de ver.  Aunque esta nueva versión de mí mismo no me resultaba familiar, era un lado de mí mismo el que realmente disfrutaba. Fui una versión más compasiva, reflexiva y generosa de mi yo normal. Me saludó con respeto y me mostró cómo valorarme a mí mismo y, para el caso, me mostró cómo merezco ser tratado.  Te odio porque hiciste que tus metas se convirtieran en mis objetivos y tus momentos felices se convirtieran en mis momentos felices. Odio que mire hacia atrás todo lo que pasé y solo puedo recordar cosas positivas.  Aunque su compañía es un capítulo cerrado en mi vida, fue un capítulo muy bueno, bien detallado, imaginativo, aventurero y emocionante. Un final triste, pero un buen final. Lo que me diste fue esperanza.  Me dieron un regalo que mucha gente necesita. Me dieron a alguien que apreciaba mi felicidad y me ayudó a construir en lugar de derribarme. Alguien que destacó todas las cosas positivas de mí y me apreció con todas mis peculiaridades y defectos.  No voy a mentir, he intentado odiarte. Intenté culpar a todas las cosas que salieron mal de nuestra amistad por ti y por tus incapacidades. Pero en realidad, tus inhabilidades fueron cosas que realmente disfruté de ti. Si hay algo que aprendí sobre la dureza de nuestra caída, es que las cosas que crearon nuestra caída no fueron nuestras acciones. Eran simplemente una lista de cosas en las que no podíamos comprometernos. Creo que tú y yo sabemos que no podríamos convertir a nuestros seres centrales en una amistad forzada, por no mencionar el tiempo, que ambos sabemos cómo funciona.  Déjame decirte que eres una gran persona. Fuiste una hermosa sorpresa en mi vida, porque no solo no te vi venir, no tenía idea de cuánto influirías en mi vida. Espero haber dejado una marca en ti como lo hiciste conmigo, silenciosa y sutilmente. No fue hasta después de nuestra caída que me di cuenta de cómo me cambiaste, pero para mejor.
Why is everyone so hyped about this? This game is more and more turning into Fortnite. I just want to play a tactical shooter why do you have to make her slide and run like Usain Bolt? This isnt Apex its a tactical shooter!!!
RIOT is the best thing out there for gamers this days and hopefuly to be much, much more in the future. It's not just that the games are more than good and entertaining, the videos and trailers are awesome aswell, top quality when it comes to story telling and the music brooo, everytime when i start a video I'm waiting to be blast with some awesome music in the background, DIE FOR YOU, just saying! What I'm trying to say is, THANK YOU RIOT for everything so far and never stop to amaze us. THANK YOU!

So basically Sylas but in Valorant
that's a badass trailer. mad. respect.
Ngl she kinda baf
Filipino proud moment wiws.
you can tell they were really excited making this character
Bro are we playing overwatch rn lmaoo
Bruh
lesssss go
Shitty music choice this songs ass
This was beautiful
1:30 Tangina!! Opitimun PRIDE..
what the hell is that wall
0:37 .... What did she say? Is she what I think she is?
Jett players rn:
THE FACT THAT SHE'S SINGING OMFG! THE FILIPINOS PASSION FOR MUSIC! AND THE LITTLE DETAILS IN HER ROOM! (PEEP THE BASKETBALL JERSEY)
Apex meets Valorant
was expecting after "kontrolado ko to" she would say "tayo'y mag otso otso"
flash sister came to valorant😁
uuuu, a girl agent? 😏
Finally some agent that captures the rush playstyle and also a new agent to botfrag with
Jett and Neon, who will be the fastest?
NICE, she can slide cancel and shoot lightning👍👍👌
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SHE GOT THE WALIS YESSIRRRRRRRRRR
putanginang buhay dapat
“Ay buhay” - every Filipino when facing problems 😊 “Kontrolado ko to” -  also Filipinos when have problems ❤️
This agent is gonna be fun to play
lessgooooooo new  agent
Never thought I'd see a Filipina agent in Valorant this early. Lesgoo! 🇵🇭
i'm unlocking her as soon as she comes out 100%
she's so relatable with the "hay buhay"
run and gun is going to be abused now. buckle up bois here we go.
shes gonna be my new main, ima auto lock
Octane but valorant
That "Hay, Buhay" at the beginning tho.
i think the real hero here was sage
Looks so fun! Whats not fun is that instead of people instalocking reyna and jett now it will be reyna, jett AND neon LMAO
omfg
sprint, slide, molly, wall, ult. That’s 5 so one of em has to be a passive, maybe the sprint? or maybe the sprint and slide is one ability having 2 styles to use it.
letz go pinay agent hehehe
Ah nao, cara...
I wonder what will happen to phoenix now that there is a better one.
The gameplay looks hella clanky
Siickkkk. Cant wait to play herrr
It's a fusion between jett and phoenix
Shit trailer tbh terrible choice of music too
Riot games you guys are so cool 😎
what do i hear spectre meta
You're going in the wrong direction.
OMG
Yooo we need more valorant lore animations, its soo awesom
this agent is literally built for prod
Best teaser yet, so well done
marche moi dessus stp
Run & gun
DID I SEE HER SLIDE??? AYO??
She has hacks
i have always been looking for TF2 movement feeling in characters of every game, i think i found that character on valorant!
Broken
Looks literally the same as new LoL character lmao
Valorant, you guys have no idea how happy this made me. Thank you for putting in a Fillipina agent.
U know how take me back. This agent make spark in my heart :P.
Very sad to see that she has a thick booty and small waist not that it takes anything away from her character but I want to see some less of that since we already have Jett, Sage, Viper etc, couldve gone the athletic route where she has balance proportions but nevertheless still a good job!
if ur going to be an duelist instalocker just know people in ur team are going to be mad
Did Riot just made the same character for Valorant and League? It's juste Zeri but with blue hair.
this fire!
YOOO YOU CAN SLIDE CANCEL NOW 😱😱😱😱😱
So Cool！！！ I like everything that Raiden thinks(Google Translate)
1:45 "Controllado ko to"
AY BUHAY
She's actually REALLY cool. I am looking forward to seeing how she plays out.
imma channel my inner csgo kz skills and fly across the map with her
SHE CAN SLIDE?
pog
LETS GOOOO
How to kill a game in 3 minutes

This new agent gonna love spectre so much
WOAH . OK. M EXCITED.
Cant wait to actually get killed by run and gun!
CANT WAIT
Ah yes precise gunplay
Lets not ignore the full run and gun headshot with the bulldog
and the shotgun will be useful because there's a run and gun character
The real run and gay
So basically Jett+ Phoenix + Symmetra ? 😂
Cringe
New main lesgoo
S H E E S H
0:53 remind me of the running police meme from the ‘a clouds with a chance of meatballs’
Maybe I like this better then caliber
Rule 34 be like
I am terrible with duelist but when she comes out I might give her a try
May askal hahaha
She's really gonna change the pace and might even get  better pick rate than Jett cause of her Speed
You guys are turning this game into a run-and-gun style game slowly and it saddens me, but she seems cool
People hated run and gun so much they made an entire agent just for it.
LETS FRICKEN GOOO
Nakatigas
Pinoy Agent, Lets Go
Viva o patinete
its literally a prod character
YOOO she seems so god damn cool
How to change valorant to cod with only one agent
Felt like yesterday for me that we got Chamber as a new agent
.
YOOOO
her kit looks amazing!
wtf lol seems OP Lol def will be
she is OP   imagine seeing someone running and gunning with 60 fps would be fun.
Holy shoit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Speedrun to Iron, ANY %
wow shes gonna be annoying to play against LMAO
Playing call of duty in valorant lmfao
see.. shes gonna be the master yi of valorant..
Was it just me that noticed that she had a walis in her room
Girl has a whole machine gun with her ult
Jet: I can use my instant dash to quickly push or get out of sticky situations, and use my updraft and float to reach places no-one else can.  Raze: I use my satchels to explosive jump my way around the map like it’s Quake or smth.  Neon: _legging it_
Finally a proper representation of Filipinos that actually use the language. I'm proud of this as a mixed Asian Filipino!! 😭❤️
OMGGGGG
Sponsored by meralco
🇵🇭🇵🇭 lezzz gooooo  neon!!! ❤️⚡
haha electricity go brrrrr
i have literally uninstalled valorant my user was main frame if your friended me to me or have seen me ive literally uninstalled im not dealing with that ultimate that slide and that wall sova dart thing ima play minecraft
Bruh she got 5 abilities, I wonder how her abilities will work like
The Gilas Jersey though
Can't wait for the new agent I'm gonna main her for the rest of my life! (not really for the rest of I'll play her for 3 months and then ill not main her)
"HAY, BUHAY" hahahahaha!
Already know who im gona main
So this is how Riot "balance" Jett, by adding more agents that can do exactly the same?
But is she faster then Jett cuz roit said she would be faster then jett
Think shes faster than Jett xD
monkaW
insane trailer
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
why does the new agent have a taser
op, gg
Power creep at its finest.
Speedhack confirmed.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS 🥺😭
why she run like the dude from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
i bet sage beat her in the race
Sheeessshhhh now you rush B every round. Can't wait !!!
Holy sh-
idk why the inclusivity of this made me wanna cry lol
they added the guy from spider man no way home in valorant
she is such a vibe
Rip phoenix wall
Kontrolado ko to!
Valorant: call of duty
"Kontrolado ko eto" means she is in control dont get me wrong is she a filipina?
Pog
Why is that wall so long Riot
Did we need another agent that can run and gun? Oh, wait, given that I'm constantly headshot by idiots full-speed strafing I guess it really wouldn't have mattered.
what pinay??!
unlimited POWER
entire video was just 1 fps shit looked like a stop motion
Lezzgo!!!! Cant wait to use this agent!
pls no run n gun
They brought an apex legend into valorant wtf
WOOOOO, YEAAAAAA BABYYYYYY
The age of consent in phillipines is 13 right... right?
I'm a Filipino girl in the media industry and I just shared this with my fellow co-workers. We're currently working on a highly anticipated VR game Broken Spectre! After a full day of meetings I finally caught up on social stuff and came across this. I'm so happy to be represented In this medium, everything from Nia's skin tone, nose, thighs, and environment was just on point and so ready for the world to adore! Thank you guys for this! Shout out to Jon Lam for his contributions! Garcia's soundtrack was on point!!! Great job guys, truly a big deal for me. All love, Jowy!
time to embrace running and gunning
Lezzgo
Oy ung walis tqmbo masisira agad hindi nakasabit
SOOOOOOO EXCITED
ayo who are the 3 agents in the background? 2:31
ITS TRACER + LUCIO 😫(no hate, i love that)
Finally octane  come to valorant
oh boy PROD'S gonna have a good time with this agent
1:01 sliding into her dms be like
Hay, buhay! Neon is here!
APEX?...
damnn!~!!!!!!
the flash
1:52 reminds me of when bumpaah said "How about we fucking buff the character until she's literally fucking ZEUS HIMSELF"
did they just run and gun in their own trailer
I love her design holy moly
can already see how annoying this agent is going to be
I see so her ult is for run n gun players
ngl spark kinda sounds like Phoenix crossed with sova
Yessir
I expected more of a black haid dyed  but it looks good
This agent is cool ngl
People definitely won’t abuse this agent
Viper's got some competition if you know what I mean ;)
She’s got a dumpy 😳
Is she a duelist?
If people asking where did she get that blue wall long walk? You can Look at primeGaming leak picture, you can see viper shadow on the background. Chamber voice line to viper to get her. Viper is one of teacher
yo shes goign to be insane
Pinoy agent legit !
I CANNOT WAIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
omg i’ve been such a big fan of ylona and it’s crazy to finally see her get the attention she deserves :’)
bro the cakes
the first time i get excited about a new agent
SHE IS AS THIC AS REYNA
That´´s why i cant stop loving this game
I LOVE HEEEEEER
Kinda OP
F for the comp scene but looks fun at least
Letssss gooooo
seems to me like her ult makes her res herself? unless somehow sage was dumb to res before wall? o.0
SHITS INSAINE
jett 2.0
Phoenix sliding in the opening sequence??? Phoenix buff too riot!? oh my
w
Zeri?
She will 100 percent my main character
Prod's gonna be proud
LETS GOOOO I LOVE NEON PRECISE GUNPLAY 🦔❄️
sage and neon interaction is so cute >///<
Hell yea , looks like i find an perfect agent for rng
This is equivalent to speed hacks lmao 💀
Sasuke: LiGhTniNg BlAdE!  Neon: Watch this...😉⚡
Sheeeeeshhh lezgo 💙🔥
prod i found your new main
Fortnite adds sliding mechanics  Valorant adds agent with sliding mechanics plus faster sprint
penoysssss
i feel sad for phoenix 😔 she stole his ability
Im severely disappointed how is this "rivaling Jett" exactly? And all the lightning from the trailers and teasers is only seen in the ultimate and the slide she has a literal flame wall, thematically meh and also just another slap in the face of every pheonix player. Dont get me wrong i like the trailer and just beaming people sheev style sounds cool but this isn't remotely what they teased
Pusang iring lezgoooooo
This looks hella Broken
Its already too fcking disgusting
ADOBO GANG
Dead game, cs is better + ratio
I only need to unlock Astra now and then Riot makes another Agent 😂
valorant's slowsly turning into CoD
1:02 And here again we see Cypher die.
Cod players in valorant:
Love it Does anyone know Where is she from?
I love that she runs like the cop from cloudy with a chance of meatballs.  New main.
oooooo
ZAMN
i hope the next charcter could be from portugal i appreciate the efforts put into the game and i would really like a representation to my country
I like that Neon sings/karaoke because it's such a part of the Filipino culture.
bruh the double wall phoenix just insane
Did she just revive her self?? I didn't see sage make her animation for that????
my name is deon and hers is neon
So basically they have made the agent for run n gun .Eventhough all agent can do it lolzz😂😂.
She seems to have a dash, some kind of double wall ability and a stun molly, and her ult seems to be some kind of electric laser pointer, well im excited to play her already :D
The Moment that Valorant is Becoming More like a COD clone rather than a CS GO and Overwatch clone. Lol.
KARMAŞA 4.SEZON
jett who?
I can already tell the ex-CS players are not gonna be happy about this one LMFAOO
Valorant.good job.seriously
Watching this at night , felt like a fever dream .
riot: jett is unfair, she's too fast and can run and gun  also riot: this character
This one just gave me goosebumps 😳😳
I don't like playing duelist but damn I'm so excited to try her out.
Literally recycled design from the new league character LMAO
The ult LMAO
So its Octane with electricty, or easy to say the daughter of Octane and Wattson?
popin off with that stinger
Looks like a destiny 2 player, oh no
Sonic the Hedgehog joins the team
holy shit this agent is so sick
Movin' at speed of sound (make tracks!) Quickest Radiant around Got ourselves a situation Stuck in a new location Site A has a bomb plantationnn! No time for relaxation!  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't blink, don't think Just go, go, go, go, g-g-g-g-go, go!  N-n-n-n-n-n-na N-n-n-n-n-n-na  NEON, She's on the run! NEON, She's number one! NEON, She's comin' next! So watch out... For NEON X!
How to destroy a tactical shooter 101
Bro she can run and gun so op lol
Yo lets go the team waiting you in compe 🔥
Lesssgoooooo
OF COURSE SHE SINGS
The next jett
so ah, a run and gun agent
Hahaha this is literally running and gunning. You have her chamber reyna and jett hard pushing it's game over.
A Filipino agent
Hay buhay.
Valorant: The only game that gives the hype, and actually delivers
What?
Bro this agent broken af lmaooo
They should make a series for valorant too there’s alot of things that we can know about agents if that happens
AYOOOO
maining.
Plz... dont add her to comp... you already ruined the game by adding fracture dont add this agent🤦🏽‍♂️
Gives me goosebumps, Good job Riot Games, Since the Closed Beta I said what if there is a Agent that came from the Philippines and here we are, I'm also a supporter of Team Secret and I'm a Pinoy, Proud to be, Spreading good vibes from the Philippines.
Sheesh nice agent dude, speed characters are my fav
I don't think she's over powered. Players will just have to react or engage against her differently as with any agent.  But she's top tier for sure. Devs weren't lying when they said they wanted a rival to Jett. So happy they thought of this.
feral by meganeko would be a cool song to use for one of the new agents
I waiting for Yoru buff 🤡
blush blush :>
AH YES AN AGENT THAT ENCOURAGES PreCisE gunplay
So this is why they didnt fix run and gun!
Is it just me, or does phoenix and neon remind me of zuko and azula from atla. Blue and red fire 🔥
She reminds me of octance from apex thats why im gonna main her
The way she said "Hayyy, buhay" i felt that.
YESSSSSSIR
god fucking hell no
yeah man basicallyy Zeri
Anyone know what the voice is saying during the animation before the Sage res? I'm not sure what the language is or what it translates to.
E - Run fast (1 Charge, signature)  Q - electric grenades, aplly damage, stun enemys. Two charges  C - Short double fire wall straight front (1 Charge) X - shots electricity, probably aply Debuff to enemys preventing getting one tapped due to TTK (7 points)   Passive: Can slide like apex chatactecrs.   Thats what i see
el pj mas virgen
This $h_t looks fire and looks fun to play hope to see it ingame
AHHH IM SO HAPPY THAT THERE WILL BE A FILIPINO AGENT!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Her sprint will make you nervous with that fast footstep sounds! Owshi! Here she comes!
what in anime weeb is this
So when are we getting a valorant netflix series
Update kb tk?
brooo.. i can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Run n gun enjoyer will be happy with this :D
Duelist again
LITERALLY SONIC BUT THICC
Holy shit. God tier trailer. Amazing music choice and editing. I think I'm in love.
cod movement add to valorant wtf lmao
Nah bro, i thought she gonna say tang ina word
Yikes
Fortiche is that you?!
Kontrolado ko to deymmm!!!!!
Wonderful work!👏👏👏👏💞
Jett 2.0????
Of course, as riot tradition, the animation is better than the game. Good job.
Puuuuutang ina
Players:please fix run and gun  Devs:ya like cod?
They nerfed run and gun just for her <3
OK I LOVE THIS !
they literally just took call of duty and made it a character, are they really running out of ideas this goddamn fast? this is the fifth character with an ultimate that just gives them a gun
FLINT LOCKWOOD |
AYAYYAAYYAAYYAYYAYAAYYAYAY
Well it's official, Agent Bans are coming lol
Considering it’s just more run and gun bs, I’m happy I don’t play Valorant anymore
Siiiii
super cool!! the abilities are so interesting, the wall, the slide, whatever that thing she did in ascent b site was, and then i'm assuming her ult is being able to electrocute the enemies? dope asf
Her voice lines gonna be like  "Oy, psst. Over here."  Or  "Ano, there's like 4 here."
she fine fine
1:54 hi echo from overwatch ^^
Riot so we’ve seen what you guys don’t like about the game so we’re going to make all of that into an agent have fun
Bruh the phoenix wall is gud but riots like nooooooo no no wait a second 2 WALLS UES BERRY BALANCED MAN
SHE SO COOL WTF
New instal lock
realmente precisa de um boneco pra deixar patinetar mais facil XD
let’s go
FINGER BLASTER LEGO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lesgo Philippines represent 🇵🇭
IH MY GUFKCING GOD
busted deulist :(
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH !
Sage be like: let me just race a speed demon
guys i think i want to start playing valorant now
este agente va a resaltar lo PRECISE GUNPLAY del juego
Ulala
WOOAAHHH SHE LOOKS SO COOL
nice we have pikachu and sonic in one
definitely not a fan of the direction you guys are taking with adding this rn, the game needs more stability and moderate agents rather than just a fuck ton of mobility agents. Please dont miss your opportunity to finally create something truly unique from league. With additions like this, the tactical and strategic aspects of this game that we all love are going to be oversaturated with flashy duelists. This is dangerous guys, and i really do care about this game. I hope im overreacting
Disappointed she ain’t wearing “tsinelas” lol
🥵
So she has a sprint power up, making her useful for engaging intro sites. I am assuming her and Kay-0 would be a great match up of getting the opposing side off guard and defenseless
Riot: Precise Gunplay  Also Riot: 0:54
YOOOO
Make valorant a total pubg rng shit noiceee
It looks so dumb OMG
a cara do patinete
Oh no
Now this looks like some precise gunplay
o
KIDLAT: AH YES MY SUCCESSOR  WAG KANG BASTOS!!!!!!!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO FIRST FILIPINO AGENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I couldn’t make out the first few lines before her ult,  but she says "Kontrolado ko to" it translates to “I can control this"  literal finger blasters lol btw
Well, looking at my gaming Nickname, I guess this is my new main agent 😂
Pog
Thanks Riot
Sage: So what's your power?  Neon: *I run*
Leeets fking gooooooo
GYATTTTTTTTTTTTTT
“Utility shouldn’t kill”
Already needs a nerf
Sage : The team is waiting. Team: insta jet, toxic reyna , the guy who picks chamber just bc his op
Flash
that "hay buhay" tho
sry but some overwatch here
She  saying "Hay, buhay" (Oh, Life) in a sigh manner sums up us Filipinos. HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA! GJ RIOT!
Slide shotgunning in valorant?! As a D2 player I'm quite prepared
SHE’S SO FUCKING PRECIOUS IM CRYING 😩😩
riot said "precise gunplay", got clowned, and released "precise aimbot laser"
clap
Proud to be Filipino 🇵🇭💛💯
STUPID ASS GAME GO DELETE SERVER PLS RIOT
IF RAiDEN FROM MORTAL KOMBAT  WAS IN VALORANT.....
Valorant dropping elemants at this point 🥶🥶
NICE RNG PROMO RIOT <3
I find it funny that both Valorant and League of Legends are releasing an electric-based agent/champion around the same time. They even look similar when it comes to their hair in the style and color scheme.
Nadie Riot ahorrande creatividad  : sacar el mismo personaje en 2 diferentes juegos es un poco pndjo
Filipino lines : 0:37 " Hay Buhay " - hays (sighing) life 1:38 "kaya ko to,  kontrolado ko to!" - i can do this,  i can control this!
FILIPINO REPRESENTATION LETS FUK INF GOOOOOOO
STOP KILLING CYPHER HE'S HAD ENOUGH!!!
El tactical shooter se fue a la mierda
Unang labas, nerf agad.
Kind of Roadrunner + Flash⚡️🙌
The energy of Pinoy becomes stronger
Fire
cryin rn
this looks like the dumb funny kinda cool! I think a lot of people will enjoy this agent.
jett mains sweating like crazy rn
Exact play style I need
OH MY GOD YES.
Bro. Riot. No.
Overwatch 2 looks hype!
Run n gun to another level
Finally we got to see Saageeee my cutieee 😍
YESSIR
who plays sova in split?
YESSS
Her bff is a nurse (healer) LOL
Just banger
Riot only went and made The Fast in valorant
It scares me how many run and gun clips there were in this video lmao
Simplesmente minha main
Her kit would be more amazing if only you can  b-hop in valorant.
BFF with Sage
Omg
I wish her voice animation in the game will also speak some tagalog words hahaha
She has the the call of duty slide… my god I wonder if it’ll have a cool down or if you’ll be able to slide cancel as if it’s a passive like Jett’s space hover
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Her skills look sick
sage is so cute
FINALLY, WE HAVE A SPEEDSTER WHO USES LIGHTNING!! THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED IN THIS GAME!!!
camon man !
Is Valorant turning into Overwatch?
Filipina with Speed and slide abilities? Interesting~
seraphine but valorant
Filipino Pride!!!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
lmao imagine prod
menudas habilidades man va a estar rota
Shee
w0ow so awesome overwatch me love!
New main
Can't wait to get judged!!
new agents are both interesting
Bruh really run and gun get worse
it's from a Philippines agent?
nope nope nopr idgaf im maining her
Sa Philippines, lets gooooo
SIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU PROUD PILIPINO AKO
Is no one going to point out she literally does the electric slide
My kind of character!!
Her hair is 💅
shes going to be the new insta-lock jett... encouraging run and gun. rip this game.
Flash and every single cod agent : FINALLY A WORTHY OPPONENT OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY
ASTIG!!!
Jett 2.0
Filipino representation 🔥🔥
Clearly Neon is gonna be difficult to kill in game
awesome!
Meyli agent
This is fair.
At least tell me you will add a guy with gernades and a rocket pls
Carbon copy of the league champ that was just revealed, interesting.
Now this Agent is going to be fun. Lets gooo!
🇵🇭
OMG MY NEW MAIN FOR SURE 🤩🔥😩
FILIPINO AGENT WOOOO
New main acquired.
Of course she sings. She's a filipina.
Im scared with her abilities, I hope my alarm bot and my turret can slow this girl down 💀
Zeri in Valorant looks great!
Trailer recorded ingame, 12 fps and dropping :)
When she said "Hay, Buhay.." I FELT THAT
CRYING AND SCREAMING FILIPINA REP💪💪💪💪💪💪
Why she runnin like the cop from the meatball rain movie 🤨
a filo that can sing and dance. <3
WALIS TAMBO BUFF
Hypeee
12 fps
She's got that thick pilipino aksent
Well, consider me playing against her a GG cuz I cant track to save my life
cant wait for another duelist who can run and gun :)
Zeri and her lightning magic
I love this character already! I've been waiting so long for more Filipino representation as one myself. Games like Overwatch, Apex and even R6 have yet to introduce a Filipino character. I'm glad there are a bunch of representations but it always bummed me out when I hear about an Asian character being something like Japanese, Chinese or Korean. Nothing against that! I would just like to see more people go into different Asian cultures.
Now there won’t be an empty agent spot on the lock in screen 😂
nice
lets gooooooooooooooooooooooo
quarkwy is gonna like this one
this agent will be fun to play 🔥🔥🔥
Another agent who can do zoom zoom? My kind of agent
The embodiment of run n gun
Lets Go Meralco! Maliwanag ang buhay
WINSTON AIM OMEGALUL
reminds me of lucio
Gonna be in your spawn in 3 seconds riperoni
always riot in another level, the animation and the agent are amazing
Looks cool! But they didn't even bother to make a new "wall" texture for her? Just copy pasted Phoenix wall...
Here's to an agent that hopefully won't turn out like yoru on launch
Niiice :P When Riot realized, no we don't wanna instalock Jett.... we just want more waifu agents :DDD Btw the sound and character design team at Riot should get a massive bonus like the amount of work they've put into this game is crazy.
she is my type
this game is turning into overwatch
I'm in love
omg its jet but cooler, i have to play her. the feeding potential is off the walls
This shit straight out of overwatch
wtffff
It feels this agent is perfect fo CoD players
RIP FPS and VALORANT
SEXY SHES MY NEW MAIN
Yeaaa broooooo🔥🔥🔥
Idk why but I'm crying 😢 😭 I'm filipino 😭 😢 🤧 😩
WAIT THE TOOTHBRUSH IS SO WEIRD LOOKING. AM I THE ONLY ONE?
Nice, i will be a spectre Neon main :D
Time to die while trying to shock people with ult. And also will wait in fear because she and Jett players gonna rush and kill most of the team in 5 seconds.
New jett voice lines coming up 😅
im soo ready man
yeaht that was cringe, fanservice focused and op
PINOY PRIDE 🇵🇭 💜
Literally tracer in valorant
fck run gun
Sonic girlll
WHERE MY FILIPINOS AT??? 🇵🇭
Yay, more run n gun
Zamnnnn
LETS GOOO FILIPINO REPRESENTATIONNNNN
Prod’s new main.
she gotta dumpy no lie
The best trailer so far!! I loved that cinematic and the music just fits perfect🔥🔥
YOOOOO.... FILIPINO!!
She looks so fucking broken!
FLINT LOCKWOOD
OK BUT SAGE A REAL ONE CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THAT REVIVE WALL COMBO AND SHE COMPLIMENTED HER ROOM LIKE UGH I NEED ME A SAGE IN MY LIFE
sage really said race to the site 😂
Typical Riot, just like in League, all the coolest abilities, esecially lightning and always given to a female character, never to a male one (ye, whoever wants can hate and stuff I don't mind nor care about it, it's my opinion), I simply don't understand why but hey, female world I suppose, sexism and discrimination are kinda normal things now anyways apparently...(sigh) At least the song was nice if anything.
Poor Omen 🤫
Okay. So I'm going to assume her Signature Ability is her sliding, she has an ability that is KAY/O's range and hits the ground like Pheonix's molly but Damage is replaced with a Concuss, shoots a wall up on both sides and her ultimate is a beam similar to Moira (OW) that has an alternative fire mode that shoots an orb? I'd love to see how this idea turns out! Anybody else think that her sprint is kinda slow?   Edit: I mixed sprint with sliding! Correction: Signature Ability is sprinting and Slide is passive
Bro how many abilities does she have😂😂😂
did they literally add same character to league and valorant at the same time? fast shock themed ponytails female patch on a face CMON RIOT
what ive understood is: Sprint/Slide (similar to jett), a beacon of live electricity that can bounce of walls (similar to phoenix's molly),  two walls of electricity which can also give enemy location (combo of phoenix and sova), ult: electric discharges like knifes of jett and is of Philippines origin which is interesting because they have probably based her of "ylona garcia" (edited) [1:26 PM] she will be the most aggressive/entry fragging role there is. Im excited to play this agent (edited) [1:28 PM] i dont know if it means anything but they seem to stress the relation of sage to her
Rebibe me Jett
Looks better than Jett
lit
Games broken again T_T
i think i found my new main she looks so sick cant wait
Sheeesshhh
why would sage ask for a race
Whens it out?
Oh god, and I thought Jett was bad enough
A Filipino AGENT?????? LESSGOOOO!!!
jett GG guys
So fire🔥🔥🔥
She’s either a duelist or a new role, either way if all she has is a sprint/powerslide ability, electric walls that i guess damage or slows you and a stun that will stun two areas it doesn’t very useful against sentinels
Zeri with gun looks nice
Yes!
Song: Ylona Garcia "Entertain me" 😎✨
damd they added Zeri to every game they made?
Aaa so cool
Spectre run n gun mains are gonna love her :)
Dog she gonna get nerfed before she even come out lmfao
Her ult is like ultraman lmao
I think I love her ^^
I get sombra vibes with that sprint
sonic the hedgehog
😍
rip jett?
I love ur artists and animators! Gold people! All members of Valorant team are awesome!
Where re-work yoru wy kurwy jebane
I saw it 4 hours before here xD
Oh god the spectre gonna get abused
jett 2.0
can't wait to main her 😍
looks like white washed filipino 😂💀
can't wait to main her
She literally Sheeesh when she Ults.
allright, this is officially Overwatch now
W
Neon is broken yo
Not run and gun anymore.. SLIDE AND GUN!
I can´t wait
i feel like shes a mix of phoenix and jett
She can run and gun me down anyday 😳
This agent seems OP tbh, may need nerfs
GO!
Riot: We patched run and gun!    Also riot: Here’s our new agent who sprints and slides!
oh my
At this point Riot releasing a new agent is like scientists discovering a new form of cancer.
Ok so just run and gun I guess
her dashes reminds me of tracer from overwatch, and her finger shots reminds me of echo... hummmm
"kontrolado ko to" sheeeshh
this is epik
looks like a balancing issue waiting to happen.  on another note im not looking forward to the *insert pinoy pride comments here* which just cringes me to near death.
She’s too op
Valorant team: Chef every Player is mad because run and gun is still too op Chef: hmm to fix this problem.....how about.....we just make a character thats the defenetion of run and gun
1:14
duelist again??
SHE CAN RES HERSSELF????
LET'S GOOOOO
CSGO > Valorant
I mean…with this animation style…for a trailer no less… lets just say im hopeful we‘ll get an arcane equivalent for valorant. The agents already have so much depth, character and conflict it‘s bound to happen.  Also wtf is that ult? First of all its meme material. Second of all she’s making thor look bad. Third of all is that the reason pointing fingers is rude? Forth of all two neons ulting = spiderman  And that wall? Phoenix gotta watch out
ACABO O JOGO OS CARA VAI PATINAR DANDO DESLIZADA KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
a double phoneix, cricle breach stun, zzpping ult and  THE BEST OF THEM ALL FUCCING (SLIDE CANCEL).
Ah yes Second jett
At least they finally excepted the “precise gunplay”
jinx  insirated
niceee! -but just me that feels its too hard to unlock new characters?
Her ult feels like playing ow
cool
which nationality is she
reminds me of echo lol. mannnnn why she gotta be blue, i hate blue.
looks pretty bad to me
so now we are waiting 3 more hours for internet artists
This is so broken
Ez
”My name is Barry Allen”
She looks to op
yes let's make multiple Jett like agents then make full duelist team meta and become another overwatch again
i think .. JUDGE PLAYER WAITING THIS SH!T AGEN Second opsi no raze
Was that a self res? Or did the sage res her 🧐🧐
seems balanced. nerf yoru
Jet 2
My typa character💯
SHEEESH
Still slower than Yoru
I can already see people using her to run n gun with spectres
octane for valorant
Her wall animation is so freaking sick.
yo zeri looks sick
Fix ur game
I retract my statement. This agent "Neon" screams PINOY with all of the presentation. Here are my insights:  0:20 - The way Neon says, "Home sweet home" hits different - it smells Filipino in terms of how it is being delivered.  0:36 - "Ay Buhay!"  a common Filipino expression that signifies either: a. 'Let's leave it like that'   b. A sigh  c. Helplessness, or; d. depends on the person's mood upon saying this.  1:00 - typical breed of dog in the Philippines. They call it ASPIN (asong pinoy). Also the boat has resemblance to most common of fisherman boats in the coastal areas - barangays in Philippines.  1:10 - Heh. Ylona Garcia <3  1:11 - this might be out of place but most houses in PH do love that kind of "hanging plants" in their rooms (based from experiences and travels across PH archipelago)  1:13 - Pilipinas jersey shirt. I'm assuming its blue and (maybe this is way-off) it is hinting her favorite basketball player L.A Tenorio??  1:48 - "Kontrolado ko to"" I can control this in Filipino language (Tagalog)  2:15 - Ah yes.... Walis Tambo (broom in English) typical cleaning item in every PH household.   Well.. That sums it... Any thoughts?
Cool
Wait waaaaait hold up doesn't she look like the same champion as league of legends new upcoming champion
Khe
Actually looks pretty good iam exiti
This agent is for lower ranks prob because we have bad aim...
I see so we can shoot electric sweat
bro they puttin the same character in league lmao
This trailer  was shocking
if she has electrical hands it means she can play on a switch with no charging any time.
REALLY GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE THAT RUSH IN
APEX. SLIDE.
The dog's name should be Pulgoso or Chuchu to be very filipino, kidding! Anyway, this trailer with Arcane artstyle is 🔥🔥🔥 also the jersey!
E
Im scared...
1:17 "Everything can be a microphone as long as you can hold it in your hands" - Filipinos probably
New main!?
Lesssgoooooo this is cool shit
O
Because we didn't have enough insta lock duelists already. Great. Rip Sentinels I guess
Me, who sucks at tracking and can only flick and hence is chamber main: "MERDE! Elle est une grande probleme!" xD
PIPINO PRIDEE BABY
"hay buhay" "controlado ko to" Nice voiceee!!
B
bro im still tryna get all the agents then you just gotta ad a new agent when im about to get breach cmon 😭
Come on bro nooooo
Every filipino @ 0:37 HAHAHAHA
you know when I heard about the new agent I was sure that one of the ability will be super speed. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I hate her already (ability-wise) but the video was fantastic!
Leshh gooo keep that fire burning  riot games 👍👌❤️🔥
YESSSS!!!
I LOVE VALORANT SMM
Jett and Phoenix had a child and her name is Neon
Bitirişteki ilk yazıyı Türkçe yapmaları peki :))
Shes thic😂  Neon is going to be OP
**screaming in Tagalog**
Ain’t no way she Filipino let’s gooooo
I see Spark - NEON and Zeri got similar inspiration traits... Makes both less unique imo.
Epic comeback from riot against our run & gun joke
she"s thicc aswell LETS GOOOOOOO PHILLIPINES
Yay slide canceling in valorant
New main coming!!!
SHES SO COOL UGGHHHH
Damn!!!!! Tears of joy! 😭
congrats to Ylona Garcia for the wonderful song and Vanille Velasquez as the voice actor for Neon.
Ühmm ja ühmm... lovee...
Nice
Ya quiero jugarla para hacer un dash y que me peguen 1 head y me manden a dormir
Mommy?
Oh my that was a good one.
Phoenix needs a rework real bad. Least picked agent and spark just makes it worse. Real sad how they sidelined my boy.
somebody got way better skills oops...!
Seraphine 3.0?
Bro whatever that lightning beam is... that's op
Scream will give onetaps now while spriting oh nonono
Riot give normal human body proportions to a character challenge: impossible
wow she is so beatfiul she has so a nice personality
Finger gun  👉⚡
We asked them to fix run and gun, so they gave us an agent that runs and guns 😭
wooooooooah so cool is she german?
Subroza said the trailer is cringe
Will neon be the recreation of the skye in that one dopatwo animation?
Valorant solo quiere que odie más a los duelistas
Does this mean that Ylona Garcia canonically exists in the Valorant universe? 😲
I like how she sings with her toothbrush, makes her character look more human
She's gonna get nerfed so fast
Already looks like the most broken character
Woahhhh! That double wall. It’s insane!!!
Rule34 is going to have fun with this one
overwatch + apex legends = spark
Yes Finally on Philippines Agent
Noice
Does this has anything to do with the new LOL champ, Zeri ? she does have electric power too
Why play phoenix
Octane : 👀
Lesgo filipino actor💪
AM SEEING THIS CHARACTER ULTIMATE IS THE BEGING OF DYING OF VALORANT
Nothing not even this Agent 8 Intro beats Chamber Intro. Chamber's got that Suave man!! The dude's epic! His face is like "I got this"
MORE OF THUSSSS
This is Dope, but still can't beat Chamber's trailer.
wow it looks like super sonic  COOL...!!!!!!!
I have a feeling the new league champ will have a skin to cross promote neon
Angas 😭
Daaaaamn
my new main
Tracer vibes
LETSGOOOOO OCTANEE!!!!
Sage saying “Race you there?” is a hint that she’s her counter, along with chambers slow.
Moo
there is no chance you kids enjoy this game
She’s cute. But I’m still on the fence. I really want her to have an increase in passive running.
She’s putting Jett out of business
OF COURSE THEY MADE HER A GOOD SINGER
I can see PROD going crazy with this agent🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
YOOOOOOO!!!!! Awesomeeeee!!!
Jeet who?
Run and gun to the next level
VAMOOOOOOOOO
may trangkaso yan
Apex: makes octane Riot: I’ll take that
Is it me or she looked just like this one prototype of the upcoming agent that i jjust saw
can't wait to go back to cs
Quake players rejoice with this ult
We all know Sage is not winning that race tho
S P E E D
letss goo
This is gonna be the most noob friendly agent (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
Damn i love it
00:51 Officer earl??
nice fortnite style
New crush unlocked :'D
That "Hay, Buhay..." speaks a lot...
Imagine telling this agent dont rush
riot definitely knows how to hype their community up tho ngl
Pinoy?
Mannnnnn she gonna need a big nerf after release
Whats the song’s name? Hereeelp
So many cake shots, riot ayo?🤨
10.057
Jett and her are gonna be rivals or best friends.
Not busted at all
Hmmm smell like nerf to me
They put a female me in the game... uh ok. Let's see if what we can do
Riot glad YouTube removed the Dislike button because I know This character is gonna be despised
Whats up with framerate. Make 60FPS at least
this gave me chills man i cant wait!
Putang ina si optimum pride🤣
Philippines numbah #1 hahahaha
my agent.
Wtf?
oooooooooooooooooo she fancy af
They couldn’t fight the run and gun so they made a whole agent around it💀
1:13 Gabe Norwood?
1:12 DOCTOR D
Bro this is not overwatch. What is this agent ???
They should add some red to her because of the flag meanings
We better get a Jett revive me voiceline
Haybuhaaaaay!
Finally, an agent made for PROD.
Dont need it the guns to play valorant in 2022
seems like Zeri from League of Legends lol
so cool that new agent 🔥👍
Another Duelist uff😑😑😑
BZZT
SHEEES INSAAANE
LESGOOOOOO omg
Jett 2.0
omg omg omg ITS NEON OMG OMG filipino poggg
Noice.... ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Damn 🤩
i think my favorite ability is run so far
Valorant said they nerfed run and gun... then makes an agent about run and guns
When is she coming in to the game?
Omg opening the smurf acc 2 try ut out
Run and Gun, reimagined.
Don't worry guys abilities don't deal damage they just create tactical situations
Val devs: we need to change up the game with this next agent  Also the Val devs: so fortnite made this sliding thing let’s copy that
🇵🇭🇵🇭
TANGINA ANG GANDAAAA
The amount of run and gun that will happen now is insane
em 1.25 o video fica melhorzinho
Is there a right click on her ult?
I LIGIT GOT CHILLS
Her fire wall ability looks really cool!
Holy moly sooo cool
Cypher didn’t die first, let’s gooooo!
Ang cute ng aspin
Bwiset binigyan lng pala tayo ng agent na pang run and gun. Hahaha
Bakit may kidlat?  Dahil ba madaming jamper sa pilipinas haha
OMG shes so cute :)
as a filipino girl, this trailer makes me so happy and makes me feel so seen and I love how they incorporated some tagalog!! representation is so important!! I’m actually crying happy tears and that rarely happens
seraphine 2.0
Might as well be playing overwatch
agent against neon are like , when smurf play in bronze lobby lol 🙄and enemy is like wowowowo
Let’s go
This character is gonna be super controversial. Run and gun style in a way. Ability based kills. The fanbase is gonna go nuts lol
LET GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Volt from Warframe
aaaaa
Me looking at the abilities Stun grenade? Standard Run and gun? Cool Double firewall??! Lit! Ult?... Zappy God mode??
theres no way they made a run and gun agent
WOW SHES SO COOL
Nice, Tangina agent
Jett mains goin' wild right now.
"Hayyy, buhay"
So, I just found out that the Voice Actor for Neon is Vanille Velasquez, you can check her tweet regarding her role
Jett 2.0
Let's Go 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
O no
Run and gun to another level
C: Shoots a bouncy grenade. Bounces once. On each impact, creates an unstable zone which ruptures after 1 second, dazing all agents inside.  Q: Throws up a wall of smoke on each side of Neon.  E: Neon starts running, dropping her weapons. Crouching initiates a slide.  R: Neon shoots lightning from her fingertips, dealing damage.
Goddamn, first nice trailer, second. The first thing that came to my mind after seeing the cinematic is "more run and. Gunner letsgo"
WHAT THE FUCK
Good bye viper
Que
So she’s tracer
i love her alreadyy
Can't wait to not play her because everyone will be insta locking her :(
into is lit first chracter that slides aswelllll THIS  IS LIT ASF IM ATUALLY EXSITED TO MAIN HER
Already gonna main her lol
she is the philipino jett
Bruh neon will be nerfed at lauch shes way too much powerfull pheonix has 1 wall she has tep of them but plz dont nerf her
tracer + phoenix + winston = riots new original idea
It's just zeri on valorant
Finger Gun is the best gun
Riot You surprise me again and again Wow I love that
any one else just not able to watch this due to like 15 fps
WTF is this shitty hero  ??
You can tell it’s a dream sequence because she gets a kill with the stinger
Let me get this straight, a run and gun character. Comp lobbies are gunna be soooooo much better.
W
We have enough duelists bro...
Imagine Prod with this agent…..
So, she’s like Jett…
Breach + pheonix + Jett + lighting = Neon
Call of Valorant. Precise gunplay in a nutshell. Can't wait to get killed by judge while my opponent is sliding in.
Jinx is that you ?
I'm glad her ult is electrocution xD yes please, now we just need agents that control water, ice, rock, and wood or other elements.
DUDE
Yassssssss
Riot Wtf are you fucking crazy man?
Ok she gonna be so sick
truly filipina. they even got her doing karaoke.
Brokenn 😭
SOOO PROUD that they created a Filippino agent!!! <3 <3 <3
Agent: Wm1
rip cypher
First Time no Cyphers being Killed from the new Agent...
OMFG MAIN MAIN MAIN
No one: Root: Make the same Champ for league and Valorant and just change the name lazy again 😅
SAGRE IS SO CUTE
Can't wait for the jollibee sponsorship.
Ult is weird I mean one tap her and shes death again
If run and gun had a name.....
cant wait for the plat smurf jett instalocks to magicaly have a new main
Sage giving the mother vibes looking after someone incredibly close.
Finally I can main Tracer again
OMEEEEGGGGGGGGGGG AHHHHHHHH
HOLY CRAP OPPPPP
TANGINA YLONA HUHU GUSTO Q NA MAG VALO ULIT
who tf gave this the green light
apex player: now im gonna beat your ass
how many abbilities were that bruh
I am in love with that universum and i need something like Arcane, but about valorant <333
LETS GOOOO.  jk this is gonna be a bitch and a half.
this looks so good
i like how Neon is karaoke-ing since filipinos love to Karaoke. lmao
Bro came from call of duty 💀
This character is either gonna be horrible or beyond broken
i can smell r34 coming its way already
YES I AM GOING TO LOVE THIS AGENT (maybe because I know she is from the Philippines 🇵🇭 😅)
I think Zeri flash sprinted to the wrong game accidentally
jesus so good, nice desige rito
For anyone wondering, the agent hails from the Philippines and the singer for this song is also Filipino. Well played Riot games, impressive as always.
Damn two banger agents( chamber is fun af) in a row! You are killing it Valorant Team :)
Shawty bad af
Dude, how many abilities does she have?
Sheeeessss soooo coool
is this fortnite
Is her ult is like the electro/lightning gun in half life? 2001 game i think.
Gonna play like im in apex legends with her
arina is better agent
ULT Be like "The power!!!"
Need nerf ASAP
put it on m1 Mac
Did Riot Games or an outside company animate this? Really nice trailer.
THIS SONG FUCKING BANGS LET'S GO
Hell yeah
when phoenix, octane, and storm spirit having a threesome:
BUT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF FKING GOD RIOT GAMES FIX YOUR ASS GUN PLAY, THE HIT DETECTION IS SO SHITTTTTT FIX THIS FUKING PLEASEEEEEEEEE
she looks so cool
Finally I can run and gun all I want
i want her nice song
Zeri - League of Legends
new mechanic!
Ooooooh this is legendary
WOWW
YESS
Sage: Race you there? Neon: *Runs at the speed of mach 10*
shes so pretty tho
*nuts everywhere* yessssssssss she's gonna be new jett bae.
aww hell nah what the fuck is this shit
I`m so hyped AAAAAA
Bro its fps game no fortnite wtf its was shit game like fortnite gl riot 🤡
yes finally ican sprint evrey where with the judge. soo much skill
woooow that's awesome
Too op
Check the servers
OMGGG 🥰♥️
Yessir!! Can't wait for this new update Riot ^
SHES A RUNNER SHES A TRACKSTAAAR
Best trailer yet 10/10 sudznews
Yesss another speed agent I'm so excited to play her and terrified of the emerging one tricks LOL
ah shit here we go again
I CANT WAIT TO PLAY HER AHHH
Ok 1st skill Lightning strike(Stun) 2nd skill lightning wall 3rd Dash and slide. Ult: Volta!!!!
I like this one
Ylona Garcia 🙌🙌
Wtf are they thinking
TAPORRA Q FODA
Finally, you can slide in this game. I guess more Apex players will play Val from now
sheesh
ok
I wonder how good her finger shock ult will be when sweats swing corners and one tap you before you can react. It seems to have a pretty long time to kill, atleast compared to the rifles
I dont think it’s a coincidence that Val is releasing a high-octane duelist with electric lighting stuffs and League just had an ADC with lightning stuffs leaked.
She's hot 🔥🔥🔥
i like how shes holding a toothbrush while singing welcome NEON
Nice mahilig din siya sa aso at karaoke hahaha
0:52 How is this legal?
Tactical shooter btw
I can't wait to perform drive by shooting with this character
SO FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEREEEE
oh she thick
BRO ITS NANNY NEON OR SPARK OMG
Percise gun play OOGABOOGA
Ok so tv series wen?
Oooohhu boiii😍😍😍😍
I'm very curious about the gameplay trailer  °U°
Let’s go just got back from school! Best trailer yet so hyped!
Gg diversity is key and valorant knows it
Blue Zeri :D
Hack
I wonder how Chamber met her🤔
Raze x Jett mood/ music and fast
Sale nuevo agente..  Rule34: STONKS ↗️↗️💲💲
what a MV, great job Riot Entertainment
Watch everyone says she’s op because they dont know how to counter 😂 and 90% try to main her just be trash
Wow
Yeah… might just have to throw her in my arsenal 😩
Execited
i see, Zeri and Neon are gonna be the exact same character
the new agent is filipina LETS GO LOL!
them mfs got them angles right with her
Aaaa yeee
oh how i’m going to love playing her but oh how bad i’m going to hate playing against her LMAO
Hi octane 2.0
1:42 “Controlado ko to”  Translation from Filipino: “I got this under control” correct me if I’m wrong :)
Oh nice! Lets go
I'm sure there will be a Turkish Agent coming. Hopefully the next one?
Philipina
the music and the animation is synced so well!❤‍🔥
SPARK,, REVIVE ME !
SÓ VEM
Yooo
damn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game fell off
This game really needs a show on Netflix
What country is she from
YO NEON KINDA BADD 🔥🔥🔥🔥
i hate everything about this game
Her personality and design are perfect, not to mention the fun gameplay, gonna be my main for sure :)
Run and Gun lessssss goooooooo
Zeri, but in Valorant
*slide cancel*
Did zeri change the game?   „Riot lol team“ to „riot valorant team“: yes u can copie my homwork just change it a little.
cod players rise up
you added someone ewth lightning yeeeees 😍
Lol just teased a electrical woman with same hair style... coincidence or some multiverse stuff being attempted here?
SHE LOOKS AMAZING, FILIPINO REPRESENT!
I think Riot just released the same champ on League and on Valorant at the same time what the fuck are they doing
Baka siya dahilan kung bakit laging may brownout sa Pinas. 🧐
love the ult
AAAAA
OP
Always love me some electric energy.
The most broken character I’ve ever seen
didnt know 10fps could be seen as a "style choice"
Am I the only one who saw her shooting electricity from her hands
Bro PROD on this, would be a headache watching🤦‍♂️ Mf be moving like flash on steroids watch
LEZGOW PILIPINAS!
This looks fun, +w gaming letsgooo
Ferrari peaking: The character
sage revive me, i am ray gun
When running it down *is* the meta.
Octane?
OMG SHE CAN DO A SLIDE😱
launch date?
another baddie <3
Valorant is the new overwatch
Not realistic, she was using a stinger
She is going to be a menace!!!! I can't wait!!!
Patinete deveria ser o nome
Gotta go fast
*me deranking to iron because of this new agent*
So her ult is just jett... but it takes less skill and now she can sprint   (yes I know she cant updraft but im talking about the perfect accuracy while moving)
Man she aint from Philippines no one from the Philippines would use their shoes in bed
🥵umm .... Jett?... Kay/O? .. you guys there?
if you were to use one word to describe this agent, what would it be?  mine is: insane
Dame
HYPED
Finally a character I can play
Main desde o beta
bye reyna
Finally "Hayyyy Buhayyy" HAHAHAHA!
putanginaka ang angas
What I'm happy about is that Cypher didn't die
Its a Mrs. Yoru //o_o//
Wait, does she have a tiktok light on her table? 😂
her ult…sinatraa’s new main???
what ever happened to precise gunplay man.. it’s all we want, not this 😭
Broken champ Zeri
Valorant community for the past year "running and gunning in this game is broken please fix it" Valorant Devs adds a agent that does exactly that. fml
Rip jett
Here's a cool trick, put Zeri from league side by side with a picture of this new champ. Originality is dead.
So, "Tactical shooter"
my name is NEON allen, and I am the fastest agent alive
Neon op
so a call of duty collab... sounds cool frfr
Keep up the great work btw
Maybe Yoru won't get rejected this time, especially with his new rework, I mean hey theyre both similar in one way no? Yoru's ult is running fast as f* boi and her main ability is running fast as f* boi too, both are blue as well! And both got swag
looks sick
Sheeesh, i main jett, but you guys seem to really have put some efort into this, so imma try maining her when she comes out
Ok so now we have apex + wattson/wraith in valorant letsgo
- Speed Boost - Double Wall  - a Grenade to make Players visable - a Boost where she Shoots lightnings
Reminds me of Slash from Quake Champions, I like it
Best music videos ever
mahal ni riot ang pilipinas mas lalo nakaka gana mag laro ng valo
cant wait already love her
Looks dope
Omg I was screaming the whole tome
women moment
She runs n guns, so basically any agent in the game?
Wow
Best agent
Pov: Cod players
Reminds me of powder somehow
Apex legends looks different today
"Gotta go fast" Literally sums up her entire character and she literally is just SANIC.  But in all seriousness good job on her (Vanille Velasquez) for getting this VA job this will literally open so many doors for her in the VA world and working on a riot game and not just it being valorant as popular as it is, just being in a riot title is an achievement in itself and with her already impressive VA work this opportunity will only make her an even more amazing VA.
Rule 34 artists...........ASSEMBLE
“You can’t just add a lightning gun into Valorant, it’s a tactical shooter!” Riot: “haha, Neon go brrrrr”
That laser looks OP until you realize most Valorant players cant track to save their lives
i know she isn't even out yet but i can already tell she's going to be busted.
Chances are she'll get nerfed. People are going to complain about the running and gunning and RIOT will be faced with a choice. Make running and gunning viable just to allow for future agents to be less restricted or stick to the original project.
She’s such a cool character! To bad the game is trash now
I watched it like 1k times. Wow
PROD after seeing NEON (😏)
tracer in valorant sheesh
Music🎶🎶 🥰
Every e-girls new main
Are we gonna talk about the fact that she has 5 abilities?
To nerf her out I'd give omen the ability to teleport faster and buff phoenix a little
Fun fact: she won’t look as good
promoting precise gunplay
Low frame rate made me un-easy lol
1:12 ahh shes from the Philippines 🇵🇭
It feels like I'm watching Arcane..
Run and gun technique: *exists* Riot: we could make a religion out of this
PROD's gonna loove this agent.
Ok here’s the like button if you think she’s FINE 😌
This awfully look alot like the new coming champion in League of Legends.
LITERALLY RUN AND GUN BTCHES!!! LEZGOOOOOOO
just creamed myself
She is so cool I am definitely gonna use her as my main the southeast asian representation we love to see it 🥰
ye i wanna main her so bad
esta nerfeadisima
LETS GOOOOOO
homegirl can slide cancel
This will break Valorant
Nah that's broken
she has a finger gun
players: report run n gun developers: code a character that has run n gun
Why another duelist? We already had 5 duelists, but only 4 of the other ones. This makes no sense, Riot!
Filipino pride lets go
Her finger lightning reminds me a lightning gun from Quake 3 a lot
Mago eléctrico al 15 🤑
I'll consider spark as my Birthday gift 😍 5th January
Apex legends xd
best voice sage 😍
my main sheeeeeeeesh
she is fire
Mano que top 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Cool agent that I’m excited to see, but I hope agents like yoru, omen and others are balanced and revamped as well
valorant when they said its a game based on guns  *raze comes in valorant when they said its a game non based on run and gun *neon comes in
Aşkların en güzeli, en özeli.
POG! Very cool trailer
Is she an initiator? If she isnt I think she's an duelist initiator hybrid. Maybe even a duelist initiator controller hybrid. She looks like she had everything in her kit like phoenix does. I honestly cant tell what she is. She has walls, she has stuns, she has a sprint ability, also has an ultimate where she shoots lightning from her fingers.
so its athena. they made athena from overwatch.
ngl she looks sick af plus she filipina, but damn ultimate run and gun agent
Well i found my new main
Kontrolado ko 'to!!!!!
I like how she said 0:35 “Hayyy buhay” you’ll hear this phrase every single day in philippines LOL.   It means she’s just tired or exhausted.
10fps trailer
my new main
run and gun new meta I guess
New main for sure
omgggg
I absolutely love the ending animation when the Episode name pops up, everything flies into the screen. It reminds me of previous trailers (Retake is my favourite trailer for that, when the ending happens with yoru's hand tearing apart and revealing the REFLECTION title) Same thing happens in this trailer at 2:29 I will also add that I love Valorant logo and it being different colour everytime based on the trailer. PERFECTION!
shes so bad
We need an Indian agent with the ult being spicy curry bomb
Yoo she just used an upgraded Phoenix Wall?
she a secound jett xD
she's gorgeous!!!
Nerf pls
riot nerf she asap
y no 60 fps :(
Imagine sprinting at full speed then electric slide cancel, and whip ur gun out 🤯
Valorant can you do her walls more like electric? That looks like fire:/
Valorant and apex collab l
Sooo, Zeri and Neon are the same basically?
Riot, dont kill cypher :(
Holy shit that's cool
everyone: "fix run and gun pls" riot: "hold my beer"
fortnite in valorant
Showing off a new character in a montage is fantastic!
I see, Your character persues skill.
i feel spekal now that there is a character from the philipimnes
OMG SHE LOOKS AMAZING I CANT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nooooo call of duty players are coming
something i thought about. 👍🏼👍🏼. let's play
1:13  GILAS PILIPINAS!!!!!!!!
Aaah alas RnG meta 🤣🤣
love the energy and electricity
Are you simping son?
My god the next LoL champion is also a girl with electric abilities, did they just like run out of ideas?
this agent might be the downfall of valorant
riot x 88rising? lets goooo
She turns into a chaos reach warlock when she ults or what?
Wow
nah this is unfair, she can slide and also shoot people and has a way to entry better then every character? How do I counter that
"Precise gunplay"
Rayy gunn!!!😂😂
1:58 why is that a thing
Lessssgoooooo!!!
Hello yes
My laptop is not powerful enough for valorant 😓
My Girl 💕🥺
riot really stepping up their visual game now that they full on produce animation shows! wow
So a new agent gets a slide cancelling and run gun, while omen just teleports for an entire round and fucking dies immediately.
So we gonna talk about how op this is?
Hands down the best trailer yet, I love seeing the interaction between characters and how their personality shines through, 10/10, riot you've done it again
Looks broken af. Thanks for listening lmaooo
Song is by Ylona garcia hell yeaaaaaa
holy shit
Ok I might main her She looks so dope 😍
WOW PIKACHU
Neon - Valorant Zeri - League of Legends  Two New Similar Characters at the same time?
Pero que buena música
omggg

THIS SO SICK MAN LETSGOOOOOOOOOO RIOT NEEDS TO PRAISE THEIR EDITORS THIS IS SO AGKDJGDAJPGBNSB{DS
I'll call her Zeri
Apex legends?
run and gun agent LETS GOOO
Imagine just chilling at plant site then suddenly Neon come in busting through with her double wall and her sneaky slippery sneakers. Guaranteed to burn your eyes during midnight session.
What in the call of duty
So They just add Octane to the game... *Sick*
Actually made a better pheonix :(
Valorant at this point is just fucking messing with us at this point, an ability that lets her run and gun(as if jett wasnt enough), slide cancelling, and an ability that practicallt makes phoenix even more dogwater. Not to be a downer or anything, but she's completely unhealthy for the game.
TANGINA YESSSS
YES YES YES YES YES YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
well fck. i already cant wait till shes nerfed into the ground
gunfire reborn?
Finally, Next season im gonna do Spectre to Immortal with Spark!
schmutz!
I'm so happy they put Emperor Palpatine in here
fortnite xd disparar corriendo,  grande riot
Shes a beast
🇵🇭🔥🔥🔥
Imma buss
Ok, but no one will talk about how she is just ZERI the new adc in LOL... but in valorant?
Valorant: Nerfs Stinger because of run and gun Also Valorant: Brings up an Agent who has run and gun abilitys  Haha that'll be funny
Wow cool it’s Run and Gun
Neon is absolutly amazing, I bet it's gonna be sooo much fun playing her!! ..BUT THAT LOOK AT 2:04 I CAN'T 😩😩
Sheeeshhhh
This trailer is mad, well done riot. Hard work pays off , i can see the hard work you have been doing! True example of devs. hearing and listening to what community says is the key to success for such kind of games, where every aspect matters. although cs and valo are different but i see that valorant's future is bright and this is just the beginning! well done again Devs!
Octane 2.0  When are we going to be able to wallrun?
spectre rounds boutta be insane with neon
Amazing
i am in love with you
DAMNNNN
They're actually just embracing the run and gun now
Kontrolado ko to
Chamber: Reyna, I need you to corrupt her Sage: Not on my watch! My duty's not over!
AY LETS GO!!
Plantita si neon hahahaha
"Project a is a tactical shooter. Its competitive. It has precise gun play."
Duuuude, I can't wait for her Spotify playlist frfr
CANNOT WAIT LETS GOOOOOO
FINALLY THE ELECTRO WIZARD
VALORANT u stole my mind i thought that there will be agent that can do a coridor with walls (two walls at the same time)
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Oooooooooow
run and gun will be the new meta once this agent is released
Amen
Stop omen Abuse, R.I.P. Omen my man died 3 times in this vid 😭

She looks like zeri ngl
YO! she is connected to the league character just like a fucking thought that’s so cool the new league character also has electricity powers that she can’t control very well and her bio talks about her causing power outages and short circuiting circuits because she just keeps electrocuting stuff on accident it’s so cool they are connected!!!
Zeri and spark copy my homework thingy
Omg i love her! Maybe my new main💖

berkuk diye mal bir arkadaşım var bu karakteri acmak icin para verecekmiş kendisine sevgilerinizi yonetirseniz sevinirim
Riot: trying to nerf run and gun and fails miserably everytime Riot: well fuck it, if you can't beat em, join em
This is what I need in valorant
'" no more run and gun" "precise gunplay"
Cameraman knows his job well :)
Rebibe me Sage
Cool video
esta potente la cosa

so much for the precise gunplay.
PERIODOS
Yess Neon looks so fun! But so fast! Can’t wait for Episode 4!!!
yezzir
Sheeesh

"Hay, buhay" relatable.
So are neon and zeri related dimension wise. Cuz they are both basically electro.
excellent choice of artist
i don't even play this game yet am watching this for some reason 👀
SHE'S SO FINE
mommy
i think riot is trying to make us hate playing phoenix, i dont like it 💔😞
Riot: "pRecIsE gUnPlAy
Finally, an agent where you can be like Darth Sidious
I guess there will come a point of time when the og agents will be kinda obsolete as the new ones become more prominent and practical.
nerf this
ESA ULTI ES MOISES
so OP
Ha I like it
n jogo mais
fodeu o jogo
what's with this new Valorant logo?
this is just amazing
From quake dammm
Song is lowkey fire
I like how the very first thing they show her doing is running and gunning with a bulldog and hitting every shot
holy shit this trailer made me really hyped about Neon. Good Job Riot.
Ja kurwie bedzie strzelac z palca i robic wślizgi
Rip jet and his #1 mobility
Booooooeeenas
So this is why Chamber compare her to Jett... she's basically a more OP and  unstable version of Jett.
looks cool
this shit is CRINGE
she will be nerfed after 24h hours xd
Mine!
It's about time they added a thicc agent!
Run and gunner ?

Sprinting and sliding? Are we playing Apex now? XD
I'm maining bye Jett :D
YESSIR
Yo this bout to be sick
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
oh and there we go. Damn, valorant had a good run, but Riot just gotta throw balance out the window again
Türk bir ajan gel riot senin25 yıl bir oyuncun olarak
octane
Sage: "race you there?"  I would have lost if if sage immediately put up a wall as she walked causlly away
I hope this new character comes with a phoenix buff
Step aside Jett your time is up.

Her neutral special is RUN
I’m pretty hyped no cap
Run and gun gonna get super fast xD
I love it I love it I love it
30hz
Please don’t give prod more mobility
reminds me of tracer but not idk Hahahahahha
What does "kontrolado ko to" mean?
More run and gun......
I feel like her and raze would be good friends
MAN THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE
Lol killed Cypher  first again xD *Another one bites the dust*
O no a gun n run caharacter
Nerflendinizzz
Dumpy.
Controlado ko to means it's under my control if someone was wondering
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
speedi gonzales llego al valorant
Don't nerf Jett just make another Jett with more power full abilities
Neon looks SICK.
Why is this trailer in 10fps??
Jett Dash or Neon Slide You can only choose one
I'm maining her. No doubt.
so abilities are:  bouncy orb that concusses(???)(lineups??)  double fire wall(sad phoenix)(you enter a run animation so i dont think you can shoot while in the path, unknown if it applies to other agents)   slide(maybe? unless its a passive like jett's or part of her e)  finger lightning and going fast(wth?)(getting a kill "recharges/charges" it, as seen in the clip where she runs down hall and gets sova, so its either like reyna ult or just asthetic)  a sprinting ability?(prob her e)(im assuming its toggle to turn off, and probably needs kills to get recharged)(actually this and the slide might be the same ability)
i like it but now its overwatch
her character's personality is a happy one and I am sad she has to get in to the angst >:( Notice how only hers trailer is hype one compared to others..
Precise gunplay
so cool i wanna main her buh bye killjoy
When u add "Jinx" ?)))))))))))))))))))))))))   rly I want Jinx in VALORANT!!!
1:02 Welp, another trailer, another Cypher dead.
love it , let's go . this is what I was waiting for
WOWWW
PROD is really NAs last hope now...
"Race you there?"  **proceeds to wall her off and sprints it**
F YORU, GG EZ W SPECTRE
A zarya ult hmm
Speeding through the competation!!
OCTANE!!!
I love the song
Can't wait!!!
There better be the iconic "Bobo" or "tangina mo" voicelines.
Taking rng to the next level
Pilipino represent!!!
Isn't she going to be a League of Legends Champion? She looks like the Spark of Zaun.
The first clip you see precise gunplay LMAO 😂
does anyone know when she is gonna be available to play?
Loved it ❤😍 thankyou Riot and Valorant
Ə
WHO IS THE VOICE ACTRESS ?
I died a little when Neon's shoes were on the bed
She remind me of Jolyne
fml
when they say i cant run and gun
15 fps trailer
Yo but we are like getting the same champ in league
God curse the instalockers!
Everyone when a new agent comes out: "My new main"
"precise"
Wow this trailer was beautiful
thx for 30fps)
Can’t wait for all the octane mains from apex to play her.
YOOOOOOOOO CYPHER DIDNT DIE THIS TIMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I can already tell there is gonna be a rivalry between Neon and Jett
Winston Pog
Se acercan tiempos oscuros...
re piola
woah I didn’t know fortnite and valorant had a collab
"hay buhay" typical filipino when they're lazy asf
100% of the time Im going to use the run ability and die instantly because the enemy headshots me
echo and smuga ? :0
Jett mains are crying right now
Not funny
phoenix and jett on crack= Neon
This is cool.
Lintik "controlado ko to" means I'm in control or I can control this
Say Helloooo to run and gun boyyyy🏃‍♂️😭😂😂
destronará a jett como el personaje mas rapido?
Fetch ?
looks liek a fun agent that I want to play
THE BROOM
1st to notice she's from Philippines 'cause of the (I think) basketball uniform on the wall. P.S. must I say special agent trailer as always?
I AM SO EXCITEDDDDDD
Ah, frick here we go again
She can slide, she phases, and shoot electric bullets? Yoo. We got wraith from apex here but better
Lets goooooooooo
everyone instalock Jett so basically they made another one😁
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Jett got competition
She looks so sick bro sheeeeeesh
Filipinos have entered the chat
So her ult is making her own runway? Wow
good night, Jett...
🇵🇭❤️🔥🔥🔥
This trailer got me hyped up soo much!!! She looks so fricking cool
Sana all
Finally a moment of cypher didn't die first.
I'm a neon one trick its done
Tactical Shooter, whitout dmg abilities
Well gg games fucked this gunna screw so much up god the cod players
time to bring out those quake arena lightining gun skills back
budget apex sliding☠
LOOKS AMAZING I just got back into the game and bought some skins so I’m excited!
god i hate how braindead it looks like you play this character\
Is that a coincidence but she kinda looks like Zeri, who gonna be a new champion in LoL
We know yoru is being kicked out soon😂
I LOOOVEEE BLANCEDD AGENTS
New main
oi oi letss goooo
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE OMG
BROKEN
OH SHIIIEET
She hasn't come out yet and I'm already shocked.
1 fps trailer
yo new pfp is off center
It'll be fun getting sprinted & slide and gunned
Wtffff game changer
Naysuu
Valorant: abilities don't kill. Also valorant: our new agent shoots freaking lesser beams out of her hand..😂
🇵🇭 🇵🇭🇵🇭WOOOOOOOOOOO
low budget trailer or what
Fucking Epic
I love her
.....i am done.....What is this.....it look very hard top play but also very dumb. Don't know what to think about her. My diamond lobby will suffur
cant wait to watch neon mains speedrun into the enemy team and die
loooooooooool valo is fucked right in the beautiful hole
This character reminds me of that new character coming in League
Yo this agent is made for PROD no cap 😂
eat vegetable
seems to be op, love it :D
She kinda looks like the pre-release champ in League, they said she was gonna be an ADC.
ai meu deus nao quero trair a sage
Riot is so stupid ffs. They are doing the same thing that they did with LoL.... Super fast loaded character who changes the way the game is played. Nice
Hello my new main!
I wish VALORANT would add Like Dorms for Us to Visit Anyone and could customize our Own room, Great Work on Neon VALORANT!
I just hope valorant wont add too many flashy characrers. I think it might ruin the tactical slow and steady approach in the game. Neon skillset seems a character from apex legends that play fast pace.
the real run and gun is here
Такое себе
HAY BUHAY
phoenix mains punching the air rn
Did they just… did they just turn running and gunning into a character?
Ayooo we got fucking zeus right here
She bad asf
*YESSSSS IVE BEEN WAITING!*
Valorant: Operation run and gun
ok now just imagine PROD on this agent lmfao
Di mani pinoy bay haha
running and gunning does not lead to headshots. FAKE ILLUMINATI AGENT CONFIRMED
that's also insane i'm gonna main this broken champ
When we will be able to try it out ??? xD
Yo this is sick
a character i can finally do run and gun?!?!?!
Looks like I’m quitting valorant
I’m actually in love 😍
I LOVE HER
Hay buhay ❤️
Prefer chamber
ok but that run animation is so ugly LMAO😭😭😭😭
Just run and gun boys, run and gun- Madagascar penguins 2022
why are yall releasing the same character in league and valorant? how does ZERI look any different from NEON
Oh nah I can see people doin some crazy ass movement with her
*Sees new agent trailer* Me: “Oh. Yes.” *Sees her abilities based on run & gun* Me: “Oh. No.”
Music just fits so perfectly with the whole animation 🔥❤️
Hi my next main
new ability: run?!?!?!?
Time to run n gun and not get yelled at! ❤️
Yeah add more rng agents 🌝
oh my god Oh my god Oh.my.god Oh my god! OH MY GOOOD
Omg
This trailer was amazing.
Cracked agent
what im i watching? apex or something, coz she slide like wraith lmao
Kinda weird that they release an speed agent in valorant and at the same time teasing a mobility adc in league with her design
great cant wait to have to have my crosshair in three different places while holding a site   raze - crosshair high  jett - crosshair head level but already on site neon - below   sites are going to be so hard to hold
If W key was an agent
wtf is that ult
prro qlazo se trae la nueva agente 10/10 Main Neon
anyone pick up on the action between the song, and the way she looked at phoenix. Imagine.
jetts gonna have a hard day
I’m other words, Precise Gunplay is definitely something riot threw out the window
oh she's filipino  my only problem with valorant is my wifi and some bugs
nice now i want a Roomtour of all the Rooms of all Agents .... good job Rito
Run and gun personified
She looks amazing
Female Killua. I need her asap.
SHE DOES KARAOKE LETS GO
Can’t wait
Finally an agent made for me
Tracer
bat ampanget ng animation nya dito?
Sprint signature, a dart like thing that concusses an aoe after landing as it bounces, and a wall meant to w key. As well as an ult that mimics what riot might not wanna do for the sake that they already have Jett in the game.
idk about her ult since you can onehsot her with the right weapon so over the time damage doesnt really make sense idk
Epic
I’m begging valorant for a phoenix buff, why does she get double wall! I’m sick but ima still pick him
Instantly my New Main if slide is a passive
She looks like she plays like a CoD character. Sprint/slide peeks will be pretty nuts.
she’s SO CUTE AND COOL HELL YEAH
Zeri
Chamber trailer was better than this one
every filipino is losing their shit rn the whole singing thing is so true tho
I think, according to trailer part where Sage revived Neon on top, her ulti ability doesn't depend to only orbs. Maybe she also needs get killed like 7 or 8 times to use it, not sure.
sheeeeeeeeeeeeesh
not enough cancer with reyna and raze, we need EVEN MORE duelists pls
I will be killing myself if I get slide cancel killed in valorant
Main main !!
DAYUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tracer vibes anyone?
Song is bop!!
So tracer and wingston combined?
We all know the Stinger Is not that accurate at least not for me 🤣😂
Thats so op?
Really sticking to their guns on the "abilities can't kill," thing.
Any Neon instalocker XD
yeah riot take run n gun to the next level
Here we can't control our recoil due to precise gameplay of valorant, now what do you expect that a speedster will add in that kind of precise gameplay.🤔🤔
From Run & Gun to Sprint & Gun now huh😆
jinx
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I loved it !!!
octane 2.0
GOOOOOOOOOOD
My new main.....
Tell me you like RNG without telling me
pinoybaiting at its finest
I'm main Neon from now ksjsksjxkdkzkzk
Found my main
An agent with literal finger guns. Nice
+W agent for me
I love it! The more possibility the merrier!
She seems pretty lame probably gonna be useful only at low ranks
I L O V E I T
This would be my perfect character to play with sadly i dont got a gaming laptop :'(.
MOVEMENT PLAYERS REJOICE
Oh, her ult is a YuYu Hakosho refference.. Which is highly popular in the Philippines back in the day! Well played Valorant! Well played Rito 💎
Sova mains be like: wtfff just happened
jett mains after seeing this trailer:  *I don't want to play with u anymore*  u = (jett)
lassss goo
New meaning to running and gunning. I feel like all the judge mains are going to have a field day with this agent.
re op
hermoso
Precise gunplay
Awesome
omg its a movement duelist. here we go again. pls dont make it as stupidly op as jett thanks
the most unrealistic part of this vid is that she was standing on her bed...   WITH HER SHOES ON
This is bad
i would like to remind all the people that say that she is broken that we thought the same thing about yoru
Ngl I thought there was something wrong with my phone but it was the video
7fps diggah wenn wollt ihr hier verarschen
pilipinas mag ingay!!!!!!!
I like speed :)
Her ult looks like echo’s attacks 💀
Precise gunplay
OMG I AM SO HYPED FOR HER AND THE HYPE WAS WORTH IT!! SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AAAAAAAA ❤️ I AM SO EXCITED TO TEST AND USE HER IN GAME!
Finally, an agent that has run and gun built into her kit. Time to spam Spectre.
her ulti becomes winston
Where is her chopsticks weapon, poke out the eyes of the enemy
Controlado koto
Looks like a very competitive agent👍👍👍
this game..
she looks insane
sheeeeeh lesgooooo
q xuxa
Her utility tho
Karmaşa ilk çıktı 😎
Even League's most recent upcoming champion is Electric based and actually looks quite similar.
Sage : race you there  Neon: r u kidding me
she goes ss2
Is this trailer in two fps ?
So shocking!
Oh sick a character made for the run and gun LMAOOO what is that ultimate? She’s gonna ruin this game.
looks like they are running out of ideas lmao
ok 60fps
¿Cómo romper el juego?: El personaje
walak sho hayda
Every Filipino gonna be instalocking Neon for the culture 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Epic😍 can't wait
another
She’s perfectly balanced
i'm one step closer to playing titanfall 2 on stable servers
:>
Soo... we have a new jett? That can stun like breach... make walls like pheonix... and on top of that is all a rail gun? Ah yes, balancing.
Pinoy Pride amp HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Damn girl 🔥🔥🔥
"Hay buhay" 🇵🇭
new sliding mechanic coming to the game?????!!!!!
“Precise Gunplay” “We Nerfed Run and Gun”  So anyways here’s some girl who runs with finger guns, have fun!     God Neon is gonna be funny as hell lmao
Apparently everyone is adding sliding to there games now
Ok ok, first of all, LOVE THE ANIMATION! So Sick! But also, please don't overly spam agents like you do with League. This one I am ok with though.
Valorant kadın ajanları neden bu kadar güçlü :D harika bir ajan oynaması çok zevkli olucak
When is she getting released ?
Que buen soundtrack
20 fps
Y add more heroes with speed lol  The hit registration is already shit for agents who uses speed like jett nd raze.. still riot is releasing more broken heroes
An agent that can run, valorant players can’t relate anymore
Bo3 rush?🤔
I hope they added the, "JETT, REVIVE ME JETT!" as a voice line.😂😂
RNG :(
WHAAAAAT
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Каво 0_0
I guess shes replacing jett
Honestly i dont really like the graphics work , apart from that i thought her design would be a bit cleaner . And lastly why does she do apex and fortnite dashes lol
Valorant players:  run n gun is BS  Riot : aight Here you go run n  gun the agent.
Neon makes me nostalgic about Overwatch
My guess on her abilities: C: 1:20 *Double Fire wall* $200 (1 charge) Q: 1:14 *Stun Grenade* $250 (2 charges) E: 0:50 *Sprint* (Recharge every 45 seconds, Gives 8-10 seconds of speed, able to slide like in apex) X: 1:53 *Finger laser gun thingy* (7 Orb cost has a total of 6-7 seconds of usage before it depletes)
Made for running and gunning 😈
that "haay buhaaay" 💖 I can't wait! 💖💖
Yoru+Jett
Wow this agent actually looks fun and not broken
a years ago i played valorant bcz i love jett so much, then i get borred cuz i play so much game. now neon my reason to play valorant agian fo fun XD
1:02 wish my stinger did that
people: run and gun so busted pls fix it Riot: run and gun fixed people: an agent that runs and guns?!?
You have summoned the Filipinos!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
YYEEEEEEEEEES RIOT SAYS FUCK U ABOUT RUN AND GUN
FINGER GUNS!!!
Yay a print and slide character now valorant will feel like call of duty
Wtf
and Zeri is her sister xD?
Valorant's new Filipina agent neon trailer.   All the Filipinos around the world: we've been summoned.
Wonderful!
I think this agent is pretty ilegal
I'm calling it now this is about to be the most annoying agent to play against when your a defender
what about yoru buff?
run and gun nah we got slide and gun
It's like Jett, Phoenix and Yoru in one.
gg, rompieron el juego gracias
Pinoys rise
"Hay buhay" common filipino word
Woooooooi
Jett 2
finally a new agent that i won’t just unlock then immediately forget about
wheres the apex players at they gonna love this champ
Yaa that’s what I want in Valorant ⚡️⚡️
Cypher main gonna have a field day against this agent.
Run and gun can never be nerfed enough
sheessshhhhhhh
can you guys please balance chamber better before you release this shit storm of a character
Jett Mains to Jett: I don't want to play with you anymore
UNLIMITEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDD POWERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
so she has speed which looks like an ability, sliding, that double wall thing and the flash like thing which bounces off walls and the ult, so im guess the sliding is apart of the speed ability or is it a passive like jets slow fall? (sorry if i worded this bad)
MEU MAIN
Já Te amo Neon ❤️
Yeah project A will be precise gunplay
Riot Games: We are nerfing the spectre due to run and gun Also Riot Games: releasing Neon who in the trailer can run and run headshot with a vandal.
actually broken
actually broken
gg uninstall all this game.
run n gun god speed ?
They should add that broomstick as a Valorant Melee Weapon lol
Bruh i see the memes coming🤣🤣
run and gun going on another level
"abilities aren't meant to kill"
God I can't wait for the R34 to come out for the new valorant Agent
Excited for the lore of this agent tho. the way she said "Kontrolado ko to" which means "I can Control this" says a lot high hopes for the story on how team Valorant got hold on such an agent
THATS RASIST NO GERMAN LINE IN THE END NOT PLAYING ANYMORE joke
So FCK hyped the ult Looks insane
Tf she doin watching phoenix
🤔
Seeing what seems to be a filipino character, I’m hoping for the “putang ina optimum pride” voiceline rofl
I like her
Wall running let’s go
cool but why make it 10 fps?
Tenz’s new agent for comeback no cap
Finally! The Ultimate Running Gun Champ!!!
İTS THAT A ENTRY ????
Oooo la la... Interesting!
Xd eco is that you?
Can anyone explain the words during her ultimate transform scene pls
This agent is getting instalocked every round I can already see it

agents from all major regions complete. waiting for yoru rework, and Indian sub continent agent.
Hyppeee

Why the fuck does every game need to ripoff overwatch
OMG SHES SO AWSOME!!!
SPECTRE RUN AND GUN OKAY LETS GO
How many abilities she got? 8???
this is cool asf I'm def maining her
she looks cool. It's also pretty obvious that they're struggling with power creep a bit
I think I'm in love
I just Have the fealing that she will be overpowered D:
BROOOOOO
You could have just told us the new agent was the flash
I saw Sage in Brimstone's room
So they made Octane?
no more jett instalock lol
Jett on steroids
That wall is damn op.
LETS GOOOOO
When it Will be come
People will instalock her and still refuse to entry 🤡
Valorant copied my name 😂
Vai leve uns Nerf na boca =D
Yesssssss
She’s a runner she’s a track star
İ mean great looks good but another duelist? Cmon im low rank so i hate duelist cuz almost always people insta lock 4 duelist and i have to take sage or skye cuz those 4 idiots will die otherwise
0:54 im not the only one thinking of cloudy with a chance of meatballs right now right?
Soo COOOL
If Phoenix and Jett had a baby:
NEON TE AMOOOOO
cant wait
Yesssssss finaly
Dude she’s going to get instalocked so fast I’m never playing the agent
LESSSS GET IT
LESSS GOOOO
dude this looks sick
Wow is electrics
Ganda putang ina
Riot: Abilities Create Tactical Advantages to take the right shot. Also Riot: Show's neon's ultimate  Fans: Wait do u guys know what ur doing.         Riot: Well Yes but actually no
OMG this going to be crazy
PANALO! 🇵🇭
Mmm yes, valo devs adding the inner codm player into a filipina character
wonder if you can run that fast with a odin itd be so funny to just like run out with a odin and just destroy everybody
she literally went godspeed
Damn
This ain’t Cod my boi😑
NICEEEEEEE!!!!!!
Haaay, buhay means OOOH Life (loosely translated: life is hard ) which means she is just like me. A hardstuck silver player. And KONTROLADO KO TO means I am in control. Like me, I shout at my teammates as if I'm in charge.
dibs
I'll have to buy v points again
omg she has blue hair  She's sonic
this gonna be good
Valorant: tactical shooter with ability that doesn't kill or injure
dude thats so sick
yo that ult was a bullsack
kARdEşİm SaLsAnA
Thats amazing
Noicee
If you cant fix run and gun  Make a character that is based on it. Smart move😂
What is this ultimate?? Freaking overwatch???
Nice one Riot.
Wow
She s kinda cute, not gonna lie
Mommy NEON
She is just so cool, I can’t wait
she looks so op
At this point, Valorant should start their own Anime 🔥🔥
sheassh
fuck this game
She actually acts like a young person like the way she sings while decorating her room and actually looks like a filipina teenager im really impressed
at 1:47 she’s saying “kontrolado ko ‘to!” which means ‘i can control this!’ or she’s at control.
literally a running n gunning character?
unistalling
Run & gay😭
That ultimate remembers me some gesture back in 1942
Wow Tagalog
Şaki 😋
Kay/O: Ultimate CSGO Agent Chamber: Ultimate Overwatch Agent Neon: Ultimate Apex Legends Agent
She's a Filipino?!😮
this video is fake, she should have taken off her shoes when she entered her room
I LOVE IT ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
ABSOLUTELY CRAZY!
Female sonic the hedgehog?
The Flash + Tracer + Palpatine! :O
I don't know who it was but I saw a comment on a random valorant video of someone who was guessing her abilities and he nailed it perfectly like he already knew he also said source: trust me bro so from now on imma just trust who ever says trust me bro
Bet she's initiator
MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS
Is this a run and gun Agent? Well done Rito.
She's so cuuuuuute 💖🥺  I can't wait to play as her
Let’s goo, a new character
As a filipino the accent lowkey sus, but she doesnt really talk that much
My new main
Needs a buff or radiants will kill him instantly when he tries to spirnt to them
JETT ile vurup hızlı kaçan bir hero daha
Music, bop. Design, cute. Abilities, powerful. Agent, W.
valorant is already seeing powercreep despite only being out for a relatively short time. as we see more and more insane agents who all have a gimmick and try to do something innovative, the game will grow farther and farther away from what made it great in many’s eyes :/
i love her
LOL PRECISE GUNPLAY
pocas
Wrath of Apex legends
🇵🇭❤️
dude how many fucking abilities does she has
I think i have a new crush
Is the sliding usable skill or is it like jet's passive?
Her abilitys look like wraiths and octanes from apex legends
entertain me girl
Wait, the molly-stun thing looks VERY interesting. If you pay attention you see it causes the stun where it bounces AND where it lands...
"Hay buhay"
🛐🛐
Run n gun
Did she just run and gun with the bulldog.. such a precise gameplay you gave us riot ahhhhh
I smell running and gunning
WTF IS THIS CHAMPION. IT LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOD
A filipina? That was unexpected
The ultimate is literally arc warlock super from destiny 2
Get some tracer vibes from her hahaha
So from what I can tell: Passive - power slide Q - speed E - stun nade C - double Phoenix wall Ult - finger guns
I feel bad for Phoenix. She is just basically signing on the fact that he is completely useless now unless Riot buffs him.
This just kill the " tactical " in tactical shooter
[NOW PLAYABLE] Tracer | VALORANT
Fire
In the scene where she puts 2 walls up i would pretend to do that in real life like its an invisible barrier. Ik its weird... but the agent looks sick
“To be clear, in Project A, shooting matters. You don't kill with abilities. Abilities create tactical opportunities to take the right shot. Characters have abilities that augment their gunplay, instead of fighting directly with their abilities.” - Valorant CEO (Oct 16, 2019)
Hey everyone hates run n gun  Riot: lets make that an agent
FILIPINO REPRESENTATION!! <333
did she just say kontrolado ko to? in filipino language?
SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE PLEASE MARRY ME MOMMY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
wait why she looks like the new league of legends champion?
HOLYYYY FUUUUCK SHE'S LITERALLY EVERYTHING JETT WISHES SHE WAS🤩🤩🤤
SLIDING?!
pinoy pride putangina 😭
nice run and shoot tactial shooter les goooooooooo
my next main agent
I LOVE HER SO MUCCH ALREADY
H  Y  P EEEEE
octane in valo?
Riot game is taking the *run and gun* phrase too literal and im not mad
why is the animation 5 fps?
run n gun fixed brings out a agent specially for run n gunning gg riot gg
Instead of a run and gun nerf we got a run and gun agent
lan ilk türkçe gösterdi karmaşa yazdı sonda aq
NEW AGENT : ION
Zeri but blue :D
OMG ... WoW i love it
Now the REAL question is who's the cutest shock slider : Wattson or Neon
Wtf , so coool ! ❤️💥🔥
It’s all fun and games until sideous g slides on you
She literally switched to made in heaven mode
the hsape is bad
time to finger some opponnents lets go
JAGOAN NEON
HAYYYY BUHAYYYY
new agent > old agent (a lot) :D great agent for pinoy and run and gun lover  gg goodluck have fun guyssss
Finally! Filipino representation!  I like the Karaoke trait lmao
Made for prod
i've just got bored Getting headshot from Run & Gun and yet you guys just created a champion for that shit good job
Character Reminds me of rpg metanoia for some reason
Gotta love some Pinoy representation in games!!!
WTF WAS THAT DOUBLE PHOENIX VIPER WALL
So its a better Phoenix Wall?
Oh yeah!  I'm gonna play the fuck out of this Agent.
You already know she’s a lesbian
her name isn't Zeri? Surprising  (this is a joke bc both the new league champion and Neon have similar features and model)
You can already tell this is gonna be stupid op, agility, info, damage, zoning, crowd control (etc) all in one kit.
i think neon has a passive like jett
Hey Riot I just wanna say, U know my friend hate "Run & Gun"?  ("Lanjiao la F*ck u Valorant run and gun me!!") That's what he said
run and gunners are defo winning
OMG!
In valorant, abilities don't kill people. People kill people.
Zeri and Neon are suspiciously similar…
I love this rng
Ahh yess. Run and 100% accurate lazer
Oh my GAWD <3
MY NEW MAIN CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!
Mukang meron akong bagong ii-sculpt!
i cant tell can she rez her self or was that the sage next to her??
"Run and gun" the character
PUBG MOBILE sliding crouch .
its looking so cool
Song makes me chill and gameplay too
Absolute menace to society. Riot really outdid themselves this time. How could they do this? I can't believe this. I'm literally shaking.   Neon is wearing her shoes on bed. wtf
I'm weitng
New waifu is here
Great, now Phoenix is now even more useless than he already was. Thanks Valorant!
such a sweet trailer though
lets play overwatch
SIICK
what's with this High Guardian Spice dialogue
THATS INSANE THIS IS SO SICO
Jett kabahan ka na
Fuck that ult man god damnit
ULT IS SO BAD
My type of character
Now that's called rng
Valorant should also make an agent called "Cardo Dalisay" at this moment 🤔
You see her broom? That biii Filipino on my momma
Taking precise gunplay to whole new level
maaaaaaaaaaan. maaaaaaan. ok I guess.
when phoenix had a kid with jett... beautiful... can't wait
Nice... the definition of run and gun...  Well played riot games. we needed it  as if it wasn't a thing already.
So Who's gonna be neon main now?
That was first time when i was really "shocked" by a new agent.
MOMMY
Rng taken to the next level lol. This was sickk asf
oh boy i cant wait for another killing ultimate...  and "precise gunplay" moments
Jett got competitor
Perfect now i can finally run and gun ppl down with spectre and call it actually tac shooter gameplay, i honestly think its a bad addition to the game
Lez go LA TENORIO!!!!
Curious to watch this after Ylona Garcia’s post. After watching, hindi ko padin gets kung movie ba to, series o video game. Hayz!
She doesn’t sound Filipina lol
Run and gun. Slide mechanics. This agent came straight out of Apex.
Wow this agent will be so balanced and will not be instalocked at all 😭😭😭
OMGOMGOMG
Apex legend player : 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
sheeshhh
Meanwhile Yoru : Apna Time Ayega (My time will come)
Phoenix sad 😭
Best Agent?
the agent maybe decent but the trailer is lame af
FILIPINO AGENT AAAHHHH
Not at all excited to play against this agent super annoying cringe character I'm sorry but it is what it is
People impressed with new agent but I'm impressed cypher didnt die
Why is the video on 15 fps?
May Filipina na sa valorant
Hey can someone tell me what Neon says at : 1:40, maybe it's in filipino?
Valorant community: Pls fix run and gun rito Rito: Have you met Neon? AYAYA
AMAZING WJEHBQBD
Cool character but this is going to be straight cancer to play against
As someone who loves moving around like a madlad I'm buying her as soon as she comes out cuz this is sick
If run and gun is a champion.
Run and gun will be meta again soon..
WOOOOOO FILIPINO AGENT
LESGO RUN AND GUN
Aaaand call of duty agent.
Didn't league just now reveal this character but with jacket and green hair
over power wtf
OHHMYYGOOD
Now I can run and gun like Apex
1:42 Is that Tagalog? Can somebody translate? Does it say something about control? Ty
Thats soo broken
So a better jett and pheonix minus the smokes and flashes
Looks like a character from overwatch
Neon is from china  Change my mind
Skye: Hunter Orb from Spike Rush Chamber: Golden Gun Orb from Spike Rush Neon: Ice Skating Orb from Snowball Fight :)
Omg this character better then jett
HYPED AS FUCKKK
Okay, VALORANT!! Now YOU guys make an animation like Arcane lolol
is dualist ?
Amazing ❤️
I like the Arcane style animation. Gives me hope that Valorant will get a show like LoL did
rip phoenix and jett  neon mains where you at?
Jett 2.0
Literally an apex character !
So we all do realize that our duelist teammates are just gonna full on sprint to their deaths in record time now right?
pinoy pride 🇵🇭🇵🇭
yoru rework where?
that song is fire tho
ALL THE PINAYS LET'S GO BEBE WOOOOO
Why is an agent reveal trailer look like they’re trying to make a new episode of arcane. There’s like 30 seconds of actual valorant gameplay
finally a agent who's not completely broken and looks fun to play
NEW MAIN LOADING SHEEEEEEEESH
i simp therefore i main
Bro imagine how many officer earl memes the neon compilations are gonna have
How about making something other than duelists? This is the 6th duelist and controllers, sentinels, and imitators only have 4 each. And controllers (especially Omen) really need buffs. Maybe shift your priorities to other types of agents instead of pandering to the players that don't even use duelist to their maximum potential.
HER ASPIN IS SO CUTE
你要確定欸，這是辛烷吧
Fucking double wall!!!!!!!
What a fkin monster? Insane
Precise Gunplay
THATS SO BEAUTIFUL
killua ?
INDONESIA AGENT PLEASE MAKE IT
Insaneeeeeeee !!!
GUYS I WANNA SAY THIS .. WE HAVE GOOD NEWS   CYPHER DIDNT DIE 1ST BLOOD ITS SOVA NOW YAAAY
We know you have a choice in agent selection and we'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for choosing Jett Blue
Zeri?
So: She has a crash on Phoenix. Run and gun has a new meaning. She has Ctrl+C Ctrl+v Phoenix walls (in plural). But most important, she can pew pew with finger.
The more agents that get released the more sorry I feel for yoru
New agent "Rush B"
c’est aberrant
Not lying she is my new crush
SBE LOOKS SO GOOD OH MY GOD
Ok now i can feeling like i'm playing Apex
Octane
SHUT UP. NEON BEING FILIPINA WITH THE WALIS?? IM EXCITED LEGGGO  imagine the walis tambo becomes a melee weapon LOL
She is like a Pheonix and Jett hybrid 🗿
is that ult fuckin auto aim lmao
this is fuckin freakin awesome dudes
I can't wait to go super-saiyan in Valorant
Can any filipino tell me what is she murmuring before her ult something control~
filipino jett
30 fps video
Lets gooo I love the new agent all about her
YES!!! FINALLY THE PHILIPPINES IS NOTICED!! FILIPINA AGENT LETS GO!!!!!!
omfg new jett
Fokin idoits  you are killing your own characters.
what the fuck did i just watch?
her playstyle fits my boat
Sprinting and shooting is precise gunplay. I thought everyone knew this?
She broke the game bruh
day 1 buy
PHILIPPINES 🔥
So you guys promote runa nd gun now. We are all lost  D:
Walis tambo! Strongest weapon indeed! Looking forward for it to be a melee in game!!! Hahaha 😂 I tell you all pinoy players will go running away hahahaha
of course she has blue hair and pronoubns
Isaac Cervantes
Yoooo she is awesome 😍🔥
Ah yes! More of that pReCiSE gUnPlAy lesssffffgoooo
AŞIK OLDUM
i love sonic
Best duelist
Her free ability has to be her sprint without guns, then her double wall ability, then her concuss ball blast thing. Followed by her ult lightning gun shit... she has a natural passive of sliding like Jett hover
lets goooooo
laaamooooooooooooooooooo!
As an astra main I can already tell that she's gonna be a pain to deal with, dashing out of my sucks and stuns. Jett was annoying enough and now this
Can't wait for more ‘precise gunplay' ಠ,_｣ಠ
THICCKKK MHHMHHHMHHHH
So her ult is fingering people to death?
If W Key was a character
Now the "Oi i got fingered" is a reasonable sentence
Agent neon is basically a normal COD player
slide cancel?
GAME CHANGER
OMG IM SO READY IMMA MAIN HER FOR SURE
“Precise gunplay”
Damn she's sick
is this not the new league champ as well?
Jet gonna be Jealous
Nerf when?
so uh, whats Xeri doing in Valorant? i oculda sworn this was an independant homework assignment.
God I love fast paced characters so much!!
Who is Jett anymore welcome neon my baby girl
the next waifu
OF COURSE SHE HAS A WALIS TAMBO IN HER ROOM HAHAHAHAHAHA WELCOME NEON🥰🇵🇭
SHE'S SO CUTE!!
0:54 FLINT LOCKWOOD
New main
Run and Gun to the Extreme Level
Where in da gods name is gunplay let alone precise gunplay in this character, god dammit!!
NOOOOOOOOOO, CYPHER DIED IN A TRAILER AGAIN
COD players jumping right now
RUN AND GUN
She actually looks like raze sister😂😂
New COD looks nice
Omg woow jett gg:)
Do we even still need the existence of Phoenix?
You have :reyna and jett otopick I have :Neon otopick  Accept the offer ✓ Refuse the offer X
Sagee ❤️❤️ my main
This aint fcukin apex, why would u gotta do dis riot 🗿🗿
wea fea
I have a feeling Michael Reeves is gonna have a party mastering this one
I hope we can hear the "jett revive me" meme
OMG!!!! This is the most DOPE reveal SO FAR!!! 😃🤯😮🤩. Her style is awesome, such a cool character! I am just a little bit afraid that as some others, she might be quite OP at the beginning, but maybe its caused by the players not knowing tht new agent. Anyway, I will definitely try her out! :D Also, because of recent lore theories, I expect another lore cinematic soon! Dont let me down please, Riot! ;)
Broken
Okayyy... Who said sonic?
wow i can't wait for the rule 34 art!
sprinting and slide ,a double wall of fire , a ball causes similiar effect to breach e, bounces 1 time and when it bumps to something again it directly falls like a phoenix e . Finger gun Ult it probably recharges by the kill or u can use it for a limited time.
The agent looks great but somehow I feel like the are not really trying to give get a competition but rather it's feels like the are trying to replace her I guess? ☹️
great trailer as usual - neon looks good fun!!
Выглядит, как имба. Как обычно. Главное, чтобы не вышел Йору ver. 2
2 fps lez go
Pinoy fps gamers: *sees this* Valorant servers: *ded*
looks like a fun agent tbf
OMGGGGGGGG
if Run n gun  stills nerfed when she  gets implemented Neon will be kind of sheet
THICC
Mommy?
as a filipino guy its cool were getting a filipina agent but she looks nothing like a filipina girl, I think Josie Rizal is a more accurate filipino representation
Finally a new pinay agent!!
Damn
i hate this game. Runnin n shootin is more effective than tactical fighting. What a piece of crap!
"Kontrolado ko to" damn a Tagalog/Filipino Line. Can't wait to see our Agent from my Country(Philippines).
SHE SHOOTS FUCKING LAZERS. FROM HER FUCKING FINGERS. LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
new run n gun character :)
Is this Overwatch?
Apex?
Der Beste und sympatischste Trailer
Omg. I am think what now agent be big ass. Like! Xd. It's good. R34;)
Odin gonna be the new Spectre
cant wait to get run and gunned by this agent
MINNAL NEON😌
Bruh this agent looks so much fun
rip phoenix
I thick she's a pilipina or something
I already hate her
riot 'koşarak vurmak kaldırılmıştır' yine riot
"""Tactical shooter"""
this looks oddly similar to the new league champ XD?
S I M P.
Wanted her to scream Putang ina mo while ulting tho :(
herkesin yeni main herosu hayırlı olsun
Looked good until I saw her shooting lightning out of her hand while running. Yikes
Octane?
Meanwhile jett : Time to resign !
can't what to upload A video on this trailer and get a copyright calme. yyyaaaaaaa.
overwatch 2 go brrrrrrrrr
Je veux apprendre à jouer à valo juste pour elle
Jett one LOVE ❤️
Octane be like
I rarely see Filipino representation in video games, specifically a character in a shooting game. I am super grateful and appreciative that Riot is making agents from different places in the world. There's so much detail in her room referencing Filipino culture. It warms my heart and almost gets me emotional. Not to mention that she looks so much fun to play with. Thank you riot.
Is it a duel list?
Omg i lOvE her
time to shotgun only in comp games with this agent
chamber was only 2 months ago god damn they pumping these out quick
ayo chillll
Well I be darned
first off, she's hot. new main if imma be honest. love the fast pace gameplay look, and second, what's that song?
The Valorant community: Nerf run and gun!  Riot: SLIDE AND GUN GO BRRRRRRRR
WOOOOOW
Some lore with the new agent? Yesssssssssss! Such a good vibe I love it :) great job Riot
Le reza
WOOOOOOOOOOO
I dont really appreciate the 15 fps in this video
THIS IS BROKEN
yesssss siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrr , OKAAAYYYY LETSGO
They added a COD character to valorant, slide cancelling, running and gunning
Isn't this trailer done in the same art style as arcane just with a lower budget?
Killed me when she said "Hay buhay"
So I started blasting
w
song name  ?
She has karaoke, a hoop, and a walis, I’m pretty sold on the genuine try to incorporate Filipino culture into the game.
nice this is going to be broken asf..
Nerf pls
You not slick riot I see you releaseing the same champ on 2 different games
The real W key agent. Let's see NA make a comeback now!!
AYO!!! FILIPINA 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Zeri sister?
definitely a low elo character
Eula looks like a frog
I love how we now have a Pinoy  Agent in Valo :D <3😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I LOVE THE APEX SLIDE
Riots 200 years of experience might start showing soon in valorant also
PUTANGINAAAAAAAAAA MAKAKAKITA NAKO NG SNATCHER MULA SA QUIAPO IN GAME YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES PH REPRESENT! 🔥
Finally an agent for all the COD players switching over
Run and gunner's RISE UP!
Tactical Shooter
Idk seems like she needs nerf already……..
whys it 30 fps
oshiiii
This is the first time we are hearing Sage speaking cassualy with someone. Im sure she and Neon have a close relationship with each other for this. Other than that, I'm glad for her second animatic debut and can't wait for the launching of Neon as well. :)
when they add volt from warframe
she is so f cute <3
sonic?!
finally a filipino character
now this seems like something good to return to
YAS PUTANG INA NYO 😍
BRUH!
I LOVE HER!!!!!
Lesssgooooooo
RUN and GUN user:Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  One Tap user:no no no no no
REEEEEEEEEE
AHH
the electric jet ⚡
Wind ghorl💅🏻 intensifies
Ahhh another octane in another game...
Sooooo we switching to COD style now
She kinda bad tho 😩😩😩
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
bu karakter türkler için yapılmış olmalı çok kanimda hissediyorum
wait who are you?
so this is the seraphine of valorant
Riot said we can't fix run & gun so here is an agent who can do it better
Run & Gun: The Game Here comes my worst nightmare
People who played titan fall or apex: cracks fingers
F in the chat for phx
finally sonic there
OMFGGG SHE'S SO COOL!!! I LOVE HER
HYPEDD VALORRANTTTTT
Damnnn, Valorant. It's the New Lighting McQueen....
Riot is pretty much telling the players to run ang un
Oh god the ult sucks… Its just another jett ult. wishing that it was instead something like a ball that she threw and where ever that ball land it get struck by lightning dealing insane damage to allys and enemies, or somthing like multiple jett dashes
10fps vid goood
Hype
Who made this animation? OMG one of the best things i've see
Valorant is becoming more gay and more similar to free fire
ITS LITERALLY ALL IVE EVER WANTED, TF2 EXPERIENCE GOING TO COME INTO PLAY WITH THIS OML
They pretty much made Pheonix obsolete by just making a better version of him
não ta escrito o tanto de kill de shorty bunando que eu vou fazer com essa linda kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Finally, Sages slow orb has its greatest use.
PROD movement
Ignoring all the physical culture stuff, she also has a little bit of home sickness and that's what I admire the most about her character.   Because I feel like it also sympathizes with OFW's (Overseas Filipino Workers) A LOT.  She clearly misses the Philippines very much and is trying her best to replicate it. Just like our brave and selfless workers going abroad to provide to their families.  Based on her emotions while she's in her room, she might even have a family. Who knows? It'll all uncover once her voice lines get released.  Riot outdid themselves this time man.
my god i will play with her a lot ♥️♥️♥️ Happy varolant
Not sure about it. Let’s see
Zeri and Spark
She single though?
les goo
finally a good agent who agree??
Home sweet home -Carl Johnson
Sage MOMMY!!!!!!!
New main💙
Damn!
Mr vander graff
She's faster than internet in PH
aumento na taxa de players usando um patinete de 50% para 99%
2:15  T H E  W A L I S
dude im so fucking happy they made her say tagalog words here where my pinoys at
What I’ve managed to piece together:  -Run ability (Similar to Octane, maybe without an HP decrease over time) for some reason she run n gun’s with a bulldog(?) -She has a crouch slide ability, either a passive or only works in tandem with her run -A Lightning style stun/concuss that she can bounce off walls -Twin Phoenix walls, but it looks like the caviat is that while Phoenix can turn his wall, Neon can’t turn hers  -Zapp Blaster Ultimate. A run and gun ultimate similar to Jett, but it can’t kill right away, so that’s the caviat. However it looks like you can combo it with her run, so that’s a plus.  My thoughts? She’s a weird mix of Phoenix and Jett, that wall and shock Molly are reminiscent of Phoenix, but her speed and run n gun ult are reminiscent of Jett. That might be the worst of Phoenix (it’s still pretty good) with the best of Jett, so I’m not sure how well she’s going to do… hopefully we see some fun monkey plays.
1:42  she's saying "Kontrolado ko 'to"!   trans: "I can control it/this"
why is no one talking about the fact that she is literally almost like zeri from lol?
Welcome to Overwatch agents.
SOY MAIN NEO DE UNA
Precise gunplay has left the chat
*Philippines RISE UP !* 🔥✊🇵🇭
THAT ULT BETTER NOT BE SOME OVERWATCH GUNPLAY, LOW EFFORT KILLING IS WHAT KILLED THAT GOOD GAME.
can't wait for all the run n guns :)))))
broken please fix
Run n gun incoming 😢
Yesssss hyped for this one.
Yeahhh brook time for some newwwww action 🥶🥶🥵🥵💯💯💯
SHE MOSES PARTING THE ELECTRIC SEA
Apex new season
LETS GO RUN AND GUN
jujuuuuu t amo
Anyone know what is the release date for this update?? 🙂
Finally a knifing character Tune is dope though
Utility goes brrrrr
AMAZING TRAILER but she seems so OP
No way they added electro from spider man from spiderman this is so sicl
ive never played this game, but fuck their trailers are fire
i dont thing this shit make any sense
they're really embracing the "tactical" aspect eh
YESSSS
I AM THE 100K LIKER POGU
Holy fuck
the finger guns looks pretty dumb
I have been waiting for a fast agent since ages 🔥🔥🔥
the coincedence is that she and zeri from league of legends are very close in appearance
Filipinos stand up
yo a filipina!?????????????
I love the little details in the room she makes, like the little banka in the picture she puts and the pinas basketball jersey and hoop, and a traditional walis, i wish they added some boxing gloves cause as a pinay if there’s anything we Filipinos love more than basketball its boxing
Finally another character I can be interested in other than viper
Op 🔥
boy
"Hay buhay"
I would like to hear her say “Aray!” when she’s hit or “Ay nako” when she’s annoyed by someone
Tracer?!
wtf is she a filipino
is this the new call of duty character ? she looks sick ! 😱🔥🔥
They weren't kidding when the said they were going to start off slow with the agents and make them crazier as they go. They started off with a csgo styled game with a few overwatch styled abiltities. Now it's more overwatch than a tac shooter. No complaints.
cool
She’s a fucking Sith Lord holy shit
IM F-ING MAINING HER
REMOVE NEON
players: complaining about running and gunning riot: ?
kaya pala ambilis, snatcher pala sa edsa 💀
Flash in valorant
Let go finally new agent I tried  chamber but I failed
wtf is this game ?:D
God peope are going to sweat with her so hard. She'll be like the next jett
Sheeeeeeshhhhhhh PINOY PINOY!!!
Can't wait for this
0:52 That Run n Gun Tho LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
Riot: Neon: Thick Checked  Broken:Checked  Realise it
NEON waifu bait.
Her mains are either gonna be the most CONFIDENT or the most BRAINDEAD players considering they would main sonic in a tactical shooter. Either way she feels like she has one of those “if it works out, it’s an outplay” type of styles. I can’t wait.
Run and gun is meta
Opppp
VERY EXCITED!
Almost thought she's got a Tracer recall skill as an ultimate sadge
Spark + Judge = Stupid fun I can imagine zipping around the map judging people, using the smoke walls to close the distance and get em lol
Looks great can wait to see it in game!
What a entry❣️🥵🥵🥵
X-men Surge?
It’s like they promoting run and gun
Valorant : Valorant has precise gunplay Also Valorant : 0:51, 1:02 , 1:52
WM1 Gaming
Sage: Race you there? (secretly prepares slow orb and wall)
phoenix sova and yoru had a thresome and managed to get a child what a brave new world
Now people will hate spectre more. RnG for the win.
Ay Layk yor aksent wer u prom? I LOVE YOU RIOTGAMES for creating a Filipino Agent Q w Q I CAN DIE PEACEFULLY NOW. You've no idea how long I've been waiting for ACCURATE filipino representation in video games FOR SO LONG! RIOT YOU SPOILING US TOO MUCH SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESHHHHHHHH TANGINA SHET XD
sheessshhh they put octane into val
im ready to instalock
Saucyyyy les gooo
The official tactical run and gun play
Ferrari pick on another level
Time to play over watch
Самый имбовый агент
New apex legend looks interesting
omg
That agent ult is showing some darkside sith technique
New waifu yeehh
Sova : Nowhere to run!!!! Neon: *Sprints to escape Hunters fury* Sova : Am I a joke to you??!!
damn, the voice actor, Vanille Velasquez, nailed Neon's in-game voice. She deserves recognition for representing Neon as well as the Philippines. Cheers to Riot for hiring an actual Filipina who can really speak the language. The little Tagalog lines are much anticipated and were voiced out great, which matches the agent's aura throughout the game. Adding the singing characteristic, brought by Ylona Garcia's newest song "Entertain Me", showcases the traits of Filipinos that are known for. Can't wait to try the lightning agent!
Ok now 🇳🇵🇳🇵
Isnt it kinda op?
Shes a runner🏃‍♀ Shes a Trackstar⭐
Run n gun el personaje
Love that they made neon blue. Just like sonic the hedgehog. FAST AS FUQ BOIIIIII
The double wall man. Yeah, this’ll be my new main
The nod to the current Filipino trend of excessively having plants inside a room. I love it.
Azula
Grabe naman!
KONTROLADO KO TO POGGERS
I'm afraid she OP
Tracer with Winston gun 🤝
NEON COMES WITH HER OWN POCKET SAGE?!?
This game is becoming more and more ability based rather than precise gunplay 😒
Que roubado mano, gostei 🔥🔥🔥
shoutout to the guy/girl at riot that listen to this song while running and made it to be part of the game with this new character and it's beautiful characterization!!! DAMN AMAZING!
I love itttttt
YESSIR
Finally I can slide cancel in Valorant!
the definition of  "running in like a boar is rather tactical" "speed is key"
Wtffffffffffffffff
1:11 if u look at the wall theres L.A Tenorio's jersey which is pretty cool
never been this hyped before in my entire life lesgoooo!!
Tactical shooter xD
????
just another better yoru btw
R.I.P. Jett and Phoenix
I don't know if you noticed. The camera showed her feet during her ult, it's like creating a static. Maybe her ult lasts as long as you are sprinting.
DAMMMM
Ok but when do we get the other agents room reveals
If zenitsu had a gun
This is agent is gonna be busted ... and I love it!!!!!!
philippines hero avatar yes sirrrrrrrrrrr
Tagalog words "Haiii Buhay." 0:36 "Kontrolado ko to 2x." 1:36
30 fps
A dubble Phoenix Wall,  another reason why Phoenix is the worst duelist I hope phoenix is going to be buffed soon
can't wait for the incels to sexualize her.
worse than i expected
The soooooong 😱😱😱🥰
Don't you say Ylone voiced her?😳
my boyfriend was excited to wake up to this trailer so he showed me this so i'm here to appreciate <3 such a cool character design!
totally overwatch vibe man!
When you can't fix the rng problem just make an agent that fully exploits it
novo main
this has to be the fortnite version of valorant....right?
The song is an absolute banger
If Valorant Hub is not associated with you guys you should send him a strike bruh. Dude is calling himself a content creator by recording his webcam saying nothing and complaining about the copyright of the song.
1:01 Of course Cypher dies. Of course.
Gonna see a lot of judge mains
dios enel
This looks like it could make the game so frustrating no cap
MY FAVORITE AGENT I CALL IT
RUN N GUN FTW
I see a hip fire character luckily I play a lot of COD
from yoru - astra - kay/0 - chamber - and duelist again?
bro this game abt to become cod with her sliding
We love when run and gunning is official in the valorant lore
so riot actually made PROD as a valorant charecter
She seems dope
Ez run and gun now🤣
Looks like I`m gonna be a Neon Main now xd
Apex legends 2.
Basically Apex Legends movement in Valorant.
She's Jonna be like the flash just that it is valorant
This is BLOWING MY MIIIIIIIIND
wow she is very cute, congratulations are on, i loved!!!
Now I have no excuse to not entry frag
Hayyy buhay - every filipino can relate
FINALLY THE STINGER TIME HAS COME
Next an Indian agent , riot ???
Sage said "race you there" so confidently because she was going to use wall to block Neon
Count Dooku type beat
I LOVE HER!!
her ultimate it s transforming her in echo from overwatch 💀💀
XDXDXDXD
Haay, buhay.
A Filipina who likes karaoke. A bit on the nose there Riot.
I'm hyped
Sheeeeeesh a new agent
gooood
oh god!
Hike this is a replacement for the jet
Gibe us italian agent now
as a apex player i found my main
esta chevere la agente Sonic
what da fuck is this bro 😭
the dumbass in me thought she was reviving herself lmao
why is this like 2fps
Oh God damn, and thats gonna be another mechanicaly harder character...  Jett now gonna seems easy to play for non mechanical skilled player :D
This agent reminds me of myself, jaming a good ol' song IRL
Waifu material
TE MOCE SĄ TAKIE OP ŻE NIE WIEM KTÓRE TO ULT XD
Just an FYI guys the singer is Ylona Garcia and the voice actor is Vanille Velasquez
Thats just unbalanced xD
Slowly become less and less about gunplay 😔
ok so is she a fan of pheonix or why does she do 2 walls that look almost identical to his?
Finally, fast gunplay. Maybe ill try the game again
Me as a Cypher main watching Cypher die in every trailer:
AH another duelist
When they are out of ideas they mix and match older agent's abilities... Bruh
before 1M VIEWS now its 200,000
new league champ looks dope
anyways if there r people who are confused of what she said when she has her Lightning moment is "kontrolado ko to" which means i can control this. yeah thats all. also she is so pretty n fast probably jett's sister from another mister as well LOL
COD meets Valorant
sheeessh!!!!
so overpowerd rito nerf
Echo
Instalocking culture is lurking from a corner
FINGERGUN
I dont know if its just for cinematic effect but she took a raze ult to the face and didnt die.
Her room must be on one of the maps, or possibly in a new map... Also the card in the battlepass makes sense now!! (Live Wire Card)
So they couldn’t fix run an gun so they made an agent all about it….
Will Jett still say "Race you to the spike sites"?
welp, jett had a good run
Damnnn! This game is unreal!
NOT OP AF
Is she a dualist ? she seems coooooooooollllll!!!!!!!
don't you think she looks like Zeri, a new champion in League too....??? ummm what you think about guys?
cant wait for people to complain about this one 👍
ngl Chamber's trailer was more dope
fucking precise gameplay right here
va a ser de boca, no lo puedo creer
octane ? is that you
I feel like sage is the mutual friend of all agents
For April fools we better get that ugly into an actual finger gun
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeshhhhhhhhh
Ylona Garcia  Hermana de la reina :v?
Oh this bitch bouta break the game
oh no
holy shit
She's a filipino.
How to delete sova and Jett in one agent.
Wait till jett mains find lineups to fling her across the map  😂
This is what ya get for keep complaining about “run and gun “ they’re just going to make it an agent now….
my new main
instant play😎
can't wait to get rushed by neon and jett at the same time my poor trip wires :'')
Ufff electric themed Agent and another one in League Of Legends. I got you :D
Looks like Zeri
sick
Estubo buena la musica
Zaa as bayrakları ilk Türkçe ismi yazdı 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
NO WAY BETHESDA MADE VALORANT
Yes just yes I’m no longer a raze Main
Finally a character that i can run and gun 😎
"The fingerblaster"
so we just gonna forget precise gunplay and add in more run and gun, cool
Community: hates run n' gun RIOT: You son of a b*#%h I'm in!
So excited for the insta lock run and gun
sanic
I loveeee ittttttt!!! <3
LETS GOOOOOOOO 🤘
normal animations 60fps/ characters 30 xD
Thought they put Hatsune Miku in the game vvz
i thouht of the concept of speed ability and it comes true
Finaly you can slide!!!
This full RnG character 🥲
The quality of Valorant's contents are just way too good for us to handle :DD
Best agent ever.
it's like pho and jett mixed
Имба
DANG!!!!!
Damn op
Ty for a new main, riot.
that will be too op
poor cypher I thought they will stop making him die in all videos
already malding, we dont need a run and gun character please god no
What is riot smoking ?
since he agent is filipino do the Filipinos get to ise tue agent first?
she looks so powerful
I'm so ready to rage at not being able to kill her lol
Good goood ❤❤✌👍🌟
nice new agent
HAY TANGINANG BUHAY GUSTO KO MAGKA RGX KATANA
"Hay Buhay"
Time to run & gun!
I need a PUTANGINA MO line for her bro
Everyone talking about Neon Me: SHOES ON THE BED?!
Can't wait to play Val Legends!
Holy shit this is sick
Pene erecto? Yes
Riot doesn't disappoint us with the trailers 🔥🔥🔥
So they promoting RNG.
Neon: Hayyy Buhay. Probably my most used word/expression every time I come back from work and school as a Filipino.
Op gonna be useless
League's Zeri: ... Valorant's Neon: ...
YLONA GARCIA, WOW!!
Spirit Gun
Hay tanginang buhay! Takbuhan is real na.
I love her
bro i dont play valorant but i've been thinking of getting a better pc so i can run it,this character makes me want a new pc NoOW. She looks like a very fun character with a lot of utility.   (my pc cant run valorant in case anyone wanted to know why i cant play)
cute, op, and clearly gonna rival not just jett but pretty much every agent
Cancer
Breach, phoenix and jett
damn she is gonna broken ash
OK!
Bruh these mfs have made all kind of agents from all around the world the major ones but when is it Filipinos turns
Everyone: "Please fix run n gun" Riot: "What if we made an agent out of that?"
SHES SO CUTE
YAAAAS
Basically Jett but on ground.
Killua? godspeed?
Woah Immune to Sova's skills? :O
This was worth staying up to 5 AM
VAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Val devs really be taking run and gun to another level kekw   PS.: Great song btw
Научится с неё играть капзда всему
todavia ni sale y ya soy main
Translations:  Ay buhay: oh what a life  Kontrolado ko to: i can control this  Ill edit some more as i go through the vidoe
This is what happens when Valorant is inspired by Call of Duty sliding........XD
I guess she just has two phoenix walls lol
NO, pls no
ok, i might be in love
looks like shit tbh
So Jett isn't the fastest character anymore.
i feel like she was made for me
Finally octane (APEX) got a GF!!
??????
eee
Damn bro, that dump truck got enough room for the entire Payatas
BUFF REYNA
They can make a new agent but, can't rework yoru fast enough (me waiting for buff) Edit: I get that its hard so no pressure tho
love how she has faints of reyna's cloth style, including her ult
Sonic's secret wife
broken i think
Woooow she’s sick already I want to main her
From Philippines?
* Watching the character * OMG she is so cute i wanna play her * watching the gameplay and abilities * oh sht,  here we go again     ''tactical shooter''
i think this agent will be nerfed
Riot we need a sentinel!  RIOT: creates a sentinel with boring skills that are guns and nothings else.  Riot please fix yoru!  RIOT: creates a new duelist with a lot of funs skills.
Yoooo that's Sonic lol
And this process was so nice to see how she recreated her room
OMGG AAAAAAA
F the games gonna get broke
All these Filipino references. Love it. Mabuhay kayo Riot!
This character is made for me
best trailer i ever seen
ult is lg from quake
No one: Literally no one: An agent that is made for run and gun in a precise gunplay game without any hesitation *yeah it seems about right for me*
WHAAAAT
MEUDEUSSSSSS QUE LINDAAAAAAAS MEUDEUSSSSSS
New cod gameplay sheeesh
ive never been so proud to be filipino
i guess shes cool but im scared that her abilities end up like overwatch abilities such as her ultimate
Damn, I really like how they nerfed Jett and then release two agents that's supposed to replace her.
Prod will enjoy her......
wait that's keri
25 fps video :d
More precise gunplay baby lessgooooo
Riot: we fix run and gun Riot: now here's an agent that run and guns
rule34 artsits be like : this is what we've been waiting for
“You don’t kill with abilities”
did neon said hayyyy buhay ???? OMG Valorant !!!! LET's GOOO OOOOOOOOO
Zeri? Is that you?
already love her
*NERF RUN n GUN* RIOT: create a new character with precise gunplay abilities
Overwatch incoming?
yessssssss im HYPEDDDDDD
I'm hyped
jett after wathing this😳😳 why is she faster than me
I see she is a reyna jett viper hybrid😂😂
Time to have the adhd kids running at you with a specter like they playing cod
New main :D
I‘m obsessed with her already! Lets fucking go
I can say I will uninstall if this shit run and gun Andy
This is gonna be fun!
😍😍😍😍
slide cancel?
Neon x ylona just is just <3
ngl not a fan of how this vharacter is but nice ig
initiator oor duleist?
Ahhh.... Now we have a COD type character in a stop and fire type of game!
You are maining Neon because she is broken on release. I am maining her because we are both Filipino. We are not the same.
I wonder how she interacts with Cypher Trips, because I feel like she won't get affected by then when using her abilities. Cypher Trips are becoming more useless every patch
That wall ability animation tho
Damnn 🔥
She better say bobo when she gets a kill for the true filipino experience
YOOOOO THAT SLIDE ABILITY LOOKS SO SIIICK
A sprint skill, that blue ball she throws that can bounce once and form small circle giving them some kind of effect, but it doesn't look like flash, but it's indeed affect their vision, probably concuss.  Then a double wall and her ult looks like a temporary rage form of electricity, maybe.. She also shoots electricity.. Probably a 8 or 7 orbs ult..
my face will turn *NEON RED* playing against her run and gun potential...
Is this apex 😳
should have left sliding out of the game
give her wallruning
As a former COD player, this agent looks like it has that COD movement 😂
Now do an Israeli character next👀
She looks so fun and i love the design and the power! I need to get back into Valorant pronto!
mabuhay!!
Apex movement agent
2:23 "wonderful' not 'beautiful' or we RIOT xD
If she is as good as in the trailer then she will become the new meta
I'm in love y'all 😳
OMG YESSS ! Lets go so fast
LEZ GOOOO
Made for PROD no cap
So they made a specific agent for run and gun
New Main Unlocked :D
Love it! She is so cute! :)
an agent i can main lol
What is "precise gunplay" anymore in this game.. am i right? Ahhahaha
So did Ylona voice her?
0:38 "Hay buhay" tama ba narinig ko HAHAHAHAH
The best
dang, Imma play her with the judge when she releases. People gonna get so pissed
ITS ME
the wall need to nerft
No need of runing with knife
Neon finger guns go brr
This new agent might be the reason I quit val at this point.
Im pretty sure the NEON on my team won't look like this
You can tell she's a Filipina. She loves karaoke! 🤣
lol
OMG
WOW
What were they thinking???
It becomes apex...
VALROANT GAMERGIRL?-
чёт хуйня спорная
Sentido nenhummm um agente que tem alta velocidade, dash, spot e ainda barreira de fogo? Além de ter uma ultimate dessas? Wtff
in her abilities shes like controller?
goood
Hell yeah
YESS KONTROLADO MO YAN!!
Ignition, Formation, Reflection, Disruption, cant wait for ep5
Incredible, Riot your are and will be the top 1 word in Esports if you continue with this types of events, this is so amazing!
Sage being so confident on her slow orb L M A O
Precise gunplay*
สกิล op จัดๆ
first new agent that I will prob play for more then one day after release
Ja to com nojo  desse boneco '-'
а можно еще имбовее героя?
Just Delete Phoenix already
Valorant is becoming more than just a game, it''s lore is pretty damn cool!
riot lest make a skill based shooter also riot run and gun champ amazing. now them not being able to fix run and gun is just a mechanic.
What a time to be Filipino
LAKAD MATATAG!!!!
THIS Trailer IS SO SICKKK
lesh oyun
These new agents abilities slowly shifts towards overwatch kinda thingy to the point where they would forget that this is a precise shooting game. Yeah it will happen someday in the near future.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS AGENT SHES SO COOL AND OP WHAT THE HELL
Im sorry but did she just run and gun with the bulldog
REVEAL THE NEW BP😭😭😭
SHE'S GOING TO BE MY NEW MAIN
Mükemmel iyice çocuk oyunu oldu güzel ::MMh
Ult neon = Palpatin from Star Wars
i cant decide if shes insane or shit
Bume mq
Lesssssssss Go 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 slide / Sprint / Wall /:D
Ohhhh myyyy gooood😍😍😍
I will not stop playing Valorant if I get her! {once she is out ofc} :D
0:37 Shet pati ako napasabi ng hay buhay
Looks amaizing
run and gun gonna get more annoying
PRECISE GUNPLAY
Only I thought that she kinda looks like a fortnite skin?
finally an agent that doesnt look like theyre from fortnite!!
My guess will be that the slide will be perfect for double peeking with your teammte, sprint is gonna be cancer when doubled with shotguns/spectre/frenzy, the double wall looks kinda situtational but superior to vipers when trying to get entry, ult is probably gonna be garbage at high elo compared to jetts, no idea what that bounce molly does. Overall looks like a B+/A tier pubstomper agent.
Idk about others but having the thought of being chased by her in game kinda terrifies me LMAO feels like Riot adding more stuff to increase the jumpscares in this game XD
She will ruin the game for sure
This new agent looks like a good breath of fresh air, yeah her abilities look super strong but one or two slow heroes and she is immobilized so proper use of her abilities and its the perfect agent
Site entry so ez
holy fucking shit this is cool
Ylona Garcia showed up in my Spotify discover weekly last week 🥺 and now she’s here
*I DON'T WANT JETT ANYMORE*
Okay an agent that is designed to run and gun
Percise mothafukin gunplay my boy
Finally cypher didn't die in a trailer (P.S. He is not even in the trailer.) 😂💯.
HORRIVEL
She's cute, i like her
Valorant community "run and gun issues!!"  Valorant Devs "hey, you know what'd be a good character? a run and gun character then lets show case it using judges and stingers"   VALORANT WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?!?!?!?
LET’S GOOOOOO!!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Neon  is the first cod(call of duty) agent  because of her speed and run  and gun strategy haha  lol
i am fastes ass fuck boyyyyyy man it gg this game alredy proken and whit this ran and shot lets gooo i will be so mad if it haben to me ran kill me whit shotgun am i the only one think like this?
LETSGOOO
Her and Raze would make a great duo
lol official website leaked the new champ today n le me tell champ is with electric ability, is a marksman and looks jus like her but green hair at this point its to obvious.
i’m insta locking her fine ass idgaf 💯
This looks like trash
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Its that Zeri?
also VALORANT can we please get a video of the teleporter? i’m a huge lore fan and seeing how neon might be able to activate the teleporter would be so cool!!
well well well spectre + her is gonna be epic
wish when she does her ult she says “Patay na kayo!”
Electro after get back from the multiverse.
definitely seeing this champ for the first time, definitely didn't get leaked
Ok Ik it’s only a trailer but in the beginning her watching phoenix it would be sick to see a relationship happen from them, not a cringey little kid just think it would be cool
MY MAIN CONFIRM
Heck yeahhhh!!!⚡
i dont know bruh, seems weird a character that runs and shoot in a steady precise gun game.. this is not csgo wich is true. but this is not Call of duty too tho
So this character is basically is Jett and phoniex combined. Gotcha.
i love that after the rez she is saying I can control this,is it because shes a control type agent?
OMG YLOOOOOONA
so sova jett pheonix in 1 character :) the power creep begins
Rather than release the new agent,  Why doesn't riot make the replay system. I honestly thought that the replay system is really good when people want to watch their own play to improve. Riot has a lot of work to do like fixing no agent select panel, vanguard causing bluescreen, network problem error. Tbh the only thing i could see is riot just want our money to their pocket.
sage and neon so gay!
great now when I play a game Im gonna get runned and gunned by some kid who played cod
The song is a banger, the trailer is awesome as always, the agent looks dope and her abilities are insane! Nice job, Riot.
HOLY SHIT THE WALIS TAMBO IN HER ROOM
📸📸📸
:/
I still wait for valorant mobile
Why it feels im watching on 30 fps everytime she walks at the start
That lazer beem or w/e that is on 1:54 it better be balanced cause it can turn really ugly
E eu acho que vou volta a jogar valorant
Они добавили фиксика в валорант
This is such a highlight reel agent
Did riot just anounced the same character for two different games????!?!!!?
This is soooo cool
So she becomes a sith lord with her ult. Darth Neon
It Phoenixes wall but 2 and blue
Peenoise 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
lets gooo boyss   she have a motherFuck111n caramelo dog  she is pretty She is Fast she is eletric she is fantastic  she sings She runs
ayo she kinda badd tho 😶
As someone who's played apex before, she's prolly gonna be my new main.
DA FK DID I JUST WITNESSED 😳🔥🔥
the definition of run and gun😂
OMG OMG OMG
I'm disappointed at the lack of Brimstone
cant wait
main
Real Jett da Muqabla💪
Looks like League’s new champion Zeri
sheesh thats awesome
The Sonic 2 movie looks weird
entertain me uh this slaps i am certenly telling you I'm gonna be playing her every match and playing this song in the back round lol
yikes this is....just....
Wait what ? Her wall long than phineix wall. ;-;
Another cringe agent
Ok... bye bye jett!
The only counter for her is she’s slow orb lol
Pity cypher
yoru's chick
Лена подкачалась к бесконечному лету
They put pikachu in valo...why not ?
so they combinated sliding Tracer with symetras abilites from overwatch and gave her also grenade with one of the best smokes to enter side.... Nice :D
scout from tf2
Looking like a overwatch character
PERFECT
cipher: oh no, here we go agai... what?? i'm alive
that girl a badass bro honestly, just seems like an actual savage
Sorry Jett but Neon is Mine Now 😬💜
Super sayan blue with a dash with some Moses and Zeus power seems OP to me
lupang hinirang: i sleep neon trailer: R E A L S H I T ? ? ?
LEZZ GOOOO
This smels like shit, it's better for game to go back in beta, fuck this new shit i am getting mad and mad, my brother once almost break in riots system and now ill let him damage them SOOOOO MUCH, youll see RIOT HHAH
imo git
WTF
I think she will be like yoru. Great in theory but horrible in practice
She can be the most over powered agent
"vAlOrAnT iS a tAcTiCaL sHoOtEr wItH pReCiSe gUnPlAy mEcHaNiCs"
can't wait
Hey its my girl friend
Precise gunplay out the window with this one. Expect to be run and gun.
Slide and chidori!!?? Lessgoo
I guess it will be a difficult character
Precise gunplay
SHE CAN SPRINT SLIDE OMG... INSTALOCK
I'm scared.
And LoL will release a new twintail hair champ as well.
At this point i believe that riot games is a music and animation company who also create some games to support their music videos and animations
DUALITY FORMATION DISRUPTION REFLECTION
They're making the same character in league.
Valorant Community: Buff Pheonix wall. Riot: What about a new Pheonix wall?
zeri in league will be like
"Hay, buhay" sksksksk
End of valorant!
So Kayo was for CSGO migrators and Neon is for Apex migrators?
Yessss finally a Filipino agent that Im waiting for, I need to hear some Tagalog language. 😂
SOUTHEAST ASIAN AGENTTT
the double is kinda op and broken...what the heck,,, rip phoenix's wall and viper's wall
jett 2.0
The new insta-lock, welcome to Valorant area.
no one : . . . . . . . literally no one: . . . . . . . . . green web : YES
Her ult is unlimited power
Gamer: "how can there be someone that has more mobility than jett" Riot: "yes"
Pointing fingers is Bad here in the Philippines so they went ahead and weponized it.
rip jettt
"Kontrolado ko to" directly translates to "I can control this." but could also mean "I got this!" like Jett.
Wow, the designer chief was certainly liking Sonic the hedgehog.
Cringe
A Filipino Agent... I'm intrigured.😊
"Precise gameplay"
Would be sadge to see sprinting neon get deaged
wutufutu?
delete this trash
Finger guns
Finally I can shoot without aim, becuz Run and Gun.
Riot: "Gunnning and running is not advisable."
Yo the movements are kinda like mirror edge if u know what i mean 0_0
The agent isn't even out yet and I already know it's broken
ferarri peek inc :P
Literal flash entry
MY THEORIES WERE RIGHT ABOUT HER WALL AAAAAAASAGGHHH ALSO IM GLAD SAGE GOT TO NEON FIRST!! I DID NOT WANT CHAMBER TO CORRUPT HER
(╥﹏╥)OMGGG
Pikachu X Sonic
insta locking this agent
ñ
Ok 🙄👍
apex in valorant pog!
Cake
why do I want to see a cinematic trailer of her and jett going up against eachother lmfao
Neon mains huh?
Ultisi: Tedaş A.Ş v1 :d
love her microphones
She can slide She can run But most importantly She has a finger gun.
The New run and gun meta
Now with her it feels more like overwatch and apex lol
So she’s not Yeri. Got it. :’)
Dope!!!
"hay buhay" and "kontrolado ko to" in the trailer is just *chefs kiss. So proud being a filipino and putting a filipino agent in the game just makes me so proud. great job riot, and btw please get my banned acc back hahahaha
That was a COD slide!
I smell an over power agent
who's her VA?
Sonic is that you?
perfect agent for PROD
WOW!
I see she loves her karaoke, she’s def Filipino
ALR LESGO SHE FILIPINO
thicccc!
"riot nerf run and gun pls" *proceed to make run and gun agent*
ult's probably gonna be broken
I think riot hyping up the whole community in the philippines not just the new agent
So she can sprint n shock enemies and is the double wall her ult?? Sheesh.. looks great overall but can she rebibe like jet ✈️
Shes like chamber because she has her own weapon as an ability
why is she powder
Omg! Wow 🤯
Sage: "Race you there?" Neon: "So you've chosen death."
This is a mix of apex and overwatch with boring rng gunplay unfortunately
All i understand about her is run & gun and grohk in paladins "Surging with powerrrr!" that kinda vibe...
is no one mentioning how she wore her shoes in BED??!?!?!??!?!?!??!
I can't wait for all the match dodges because they couldn't pick Neon
neon is my wife
another female agent stolen while male agents remain rotten
not sure how i feel about this one, feels like they’re taking the tactical aspect out of the game. wasn’t a huge fan of chamber but this takes the cake, what do they think this is call of duty or something? sliding? lmao
What is this ultimate? best Ultimate In Valorant?
*Laughs in Emperor Palpatine*
Combo of phoenix and Jett !!! Excited 💓💓💓
2 jetts now
the dash is ok but the double-wall will broke the game
POLSKA GUROM
Lmao
Even the FPS represent filipino
this animation has about as many frames as i get in game
Oh! No Otso-otso???
Kontrolado ko to ...... meaning i can control it
Morena <3
bro fix the game code is saying -81 for the past two weeks
run & gun, double phoenix wall to cut an entire site and an laser gun xDDDDDDDDDDD
she locks extremly op
Precise gunplay, abilities don't kill
AHHHH SHES MINE
Congratulations Rito, you made a monster Thats an really op "run and gun" agent, even compared to jett
me: RIOT REMOVE RUN AND GUN riot:
200 years
Can't wait to see people in my games try to slide + op
The ultimate run’n gun
She's my main now Heheheheh
pretty mid agent and just full run and gun. riot games pls do better
F for Jett 🥲
only the true Neon Main will be able to instalock her... You must be fast like her... You must BE her... may the battle in the Agend select screen beginnnnnn....
Okay so from the video here is what I have gathered:-  1) I think her C ability has two parts one that can cause her to go real fast and slide.  2) She can do a one or two bounce like sova and then shoot a ball of electricity that will stun a area after a short amount of time, so this is her Q.  3) The signature ability E is she can raise two walls of electricity as you can see above in the picture, like Phoenix wall but MUCH wider and it goes both sides.  4) Her Ultimate is she turns into a fucking electric shooting bitch with tasers hitting enemies and she goes fast.  She will be a fucking nightmare with the RNG and delight for Apex mfs who were part time janitors before discovering the game.  P.S:- I just wanna take a moment and tell Riot, your team of devs, animators, editors and a LOT of other people who work diligently on this game day and night, trying to make it better for us, has once again won my heart. Thanks for making, maybe not a masterpiece, but a beautiful and fun game.   BANGER of a song.  New Year. New Act.  New Agent. New Rank. Old me :)  GGs.
Sage: let's race *Walls neon and throws some slow orbs*
Neon's kits summarization +Speed Go brrr +Mini brim ULT +Double Phoenix wall +Laser gun pew pew
THIS IS AMAZINNNNG!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I can speed run from Gold to Radiant!! LOL! jk
It felt like chamber was released just a day ago and we get another agent already!!!! M exited
Hoping she'll say "Bobo putang ina" when she kills someone
More RnG? you became exactly the thing you swore to destroy
The last hand ability is kinda weird, but overall it's very nice. I just wish the animation had more than 5 FPS, because my head kinda hurt watching this video.
RNG with a bulldog excellent my boiiiiiiiiii .........uninstalling..............
The Yasuo of Valorant. Time to go 0/20
so good!!!!
Prod you there ma boy you see this ?? this one's for you
when can we select this agent? we need update urgently
Sonic and Flash combined also haves Synmetra skills bruh
bro why xD
will RUN AND GUN.EXE? imagine it will be easy with this new agent
pho gets even less picked now
Cod slide and lg from quake? Damn bro sign me in
My money gone already
Insta lock incoming
Hell nah we playin apex now?
Wow! I can't wait to run into my death quicker now!
Finally! apex gameplay in valorant
i love how from being a copy of cs its shifting towads being a copy of overwatch
Valorant team the best /// yan napapala ng parating may bagyo idinamay na pati Thunder power hahahahah tapos sabayan mo pa ng snatcher na kinabibilis tumakbooo DA best  tapos idamay mo pa ang mga marites na maka birit yan biritera tuloy si NEON  oh em g I saw YLONA's Posterrr sya ata ang kumanta ng SONG Galing
HAAAYYY BUHAYYY
türkçe neon yazmamışlar    siliom  ben  cs kaçar see you
Thank you riot for filipino inspired agent.
Not gonna lie, watching trailers like these makes me wish for an Arcane-style show in the Valorant universe
ylona garcia voice actor??
this might be my new main besides killjoy and breach. I already see so many set ups with her especially because of her speed and slide. She alone will change the entire meta of the game if she's chosen on a team. I can tell the valorant anime might just rival arcane, these characters have only been around for a year or two with snippets of lore and voice lines to flesh them out but the characters are all so memorable already. Cant wait to daily binge missions to unlock her.
I can already see the jumpscares and memes about Neon rushing to you like Bloodhound from Apex lol
so fcking cool 😍
Prod watching this with 1 hand
potang ina angas
The Voice actress is: Vanille Velasquez👈 wellplayed Riot. I knew how you would be picking the voice actress.👌💯
this agent is boof
so she is spectre in human form.
💙🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭💙
Phoenix wall 😭
So hard
WHERE MY OVERPROUD PINOYS AT? :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
finally i can use my call of duty and battlefield skills to run and gun
YOOOOOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥
waaa
pov: marshal and no scope is same
Why is the video playing in negative fps
Ah yes, the Run and Gun Agent 😂
wtf riot! y love her, but... broken 🦍
Community:Fix run and gun Riot games: lets make an agent that is fast and can shoot while full sprinting
Oh no. This is bad guys.
I have a simp for her like bruh
Goin full Apex Mode real quick with Neon
Jett, Viper, phenix and breach: What are we here for?
Jett and Phoenix would never...
Be welcome to valorant: COD edition
"precise Gunplay"
balanced
It's so weird seeing actual Filipino characters in a game so popular as Valorant, I actually love the representation.
-.-
OMFG 🤩🤩🤩🤩 THIS IS SIIICKKKKK!!!!! I LOVE HER ALREADY 😍
Many players will create account again just for this agent😁
I could smell the day one nerfs.
Plantita si mare
"Hay, buhay"  Me everytime I finished my homework and ready to hit the sack
Sheesh. Watch me do a Moses Red Sea entry with my 300 KPH COD slide.
New agent?; No hermano it's wraith from apex legends
Sus
So basically Valorant stole abilities from Tracer, Octane and scouts and mixed them into one character…. Really innovative from Riot games lmao..
I didn't think i'd ever hear the words "power creep" and "FPS game" in the same sentence, but whatever ig
Pinoy agent idea comes from Snatcher sa Quiapo
AHHHH SHE SAID "CONTROLLADO KO TO!"
she kinda cute
I already can see the players in HK servers rushing to play her, including me. PH Represent 🇵🇭
the character is very good but the character introduction and animation are very bad
The best!
aint this the new league character
Precise gunplay ....
cod gameplay be like
1:13 she’s from the Philippines :D
seems like roit has a theme for both of the new charaters in val and lol
paladins/apex/overwatch vibe
another agent trailer where it just trashes the raze 😄
If Echo and Tracer had a baby, it would be Neon
Nice new apex season
No comment. I fucking love her
0:50 Looks like an ugly af SFM animation
Double wall, wow.
LoL:Hey, can i copy your homework? Valorant: Yeah but change it a little so it doesnt look  obvious LoL: *Zeri*
Philippines > other SEA countries
AAAAAW, I WANNA TRY HER SO BAD NOW
A B I L I T I E S    D O N T    K I L L
I think her abilities are these: 0:51 sprint (E)  1:02 slide 1:15 stunn (Q)  1:20 Double Wall (C)  1:54 Ult (X) I think the slide ability is like the "jett floating"
this is gonna ruin valorant, this is more like an overwatch character instead.
The microphone part lol, u know you will have a great competition when there's a pinoy contestant. Laban Pilipinas
i need a netflix show now but not not with that framerate tho❤️
electro wizard ult lmao
Eskiden koşarak öldürüyorlardı, şimdi drift atarak öldürecekler.
Hmmmm......Vipers got competition it seems. (¬‿¬)
Her running animation from enemy vision looks soooo fuckin dumb
sooooo gooood
I have PTSD without even experiencing the trauma
Run fast, hit fast, win fast.
Phantom and Spectre players will love her
nerf miner
The PROD agent
her ult gives me overwatch flashbacks
change her eyes to blue
10fps
Iron Players Be like *Headshots neon no sweat cause you already know why.
1:44 Laban ko to! (This is my fight!)
Neon ult like écho abilitie in overwatch
precise gunplay
Bye phoneix and omen
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
New Fortnite Skin ?

filipino gang!!!!! lets fucking goooo
Nice song GOT A NAME ?
Iron man 4
Tactical Shooter.
playing apex on valorant now eh
RUN AND GUNNNNNN
Can't appreciate enough how this trailer is done beautifully. Great animation synced with a piece of amazing vibe music while introducing Neon's personality and playstyle!
I hate this
What in the zenitsu is this and why do i love it
SHE’S FILIPINO LET’S FUCKING GOOOOO
The only thing not filipino about this agent is that she has shoes on the bed!! 😂😂
apex is here xd
The New Jett ✓
Wtf is this
From the trailer we all know she's kinda broken
Neon with the Killua Godspeed
tactical shooter
LA tenorio represent
So glad this agent can move so freely while Omen has the worst ult in the game and a very slow teleport and both of which sound like 2739 nuclear explosions went off in the area so I can’t be a sneaky boi
So her ultimate is just a short circuit?
Valorant and LOL both getting lightning champs
She's so beautiful
What is this LMAO
It has precise Gunplay
If she really was Filipina, she wouldn’t be wearing her shoes in bed…
sprint, slide, a concuss it looks like? a better phoenix wall that she can see through? unless there was a sova i was missing (i missed the sova). if i get run and gunned in ranked ill finally be able to quit this game. if i wanted to play octane id go play apex
Spectre Neon will be the rage factor the second she comes out
aaaaaaaaaaa me corooopopppppppppppppp
FILIPINO AYYYYYY
Finally Cypher can live🤫
Congratulations.. we have a Filipina Agent! 👏🏽 Philippines Representttt
Precise and accurate gunplay and shooting mechanics they said...
what the fuck is this agent lmfao am i playing quake
MOMMY SORRY? MOMMY
Her beam and how her fingers look as she ults look a lot like Echo from Overwatch lol
Sheshh
SHESSSSH
THAT EP4 BANNER IS JUST TOOO OPP
*Sees trailer* Me: Im scared

Everyone :- she is going to be broken  Meanwhile me :- what if prod mains her 🤫🤫🤫
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
''In valorant, abilities don't kill'' Pulls out a laser out of her ass and proceeds to shit on the enemy team :")
New speed duelist? With run and gun ability? Take my money RIOT
Dubbed By: Vanille Velasquez
Damn I thought Zeri was special to LoL...
"Hay Buhay" "Ano to?" "Kontrolado ko to!" Ylona Garcia- One of the Big 4 of Pinoy Big Brother The Karaoke- Filipinos are known to be belters of karaoke The sing with a toothbrush- Filipinos often do this Walis tambo- A broom for inside the house The scenery with coconut trees- most beaches in the Philippines have coconut trees in them. You could find coconut juice stands all over the philippines. The jersey saying "PILIPINAS 5"- Filipinos love basketball every town or subdivision here in the Philippines have them. You could even have them at the side of the road.  The basketball net and ring- An ultimate must have in the Philippines.  THIS TEASER IS FULL OF FILIPINO REFERENCES
you surely will get jumpscared by her at some point
who see the arabic word تعطيلل  😅😍
Insta locking would be a deal now.
welp im switchin to phantom
wtf riot
CoooL
Nerf...
The fact that they put so much detail about Filipino culture.  The walis tambo(broom) and how she sang  because most of the Pinoy are incredible at singing.  Thank you so much riot, for doing this i think this is the first time that there's an Filipino character in shooting game.
C : bouncing shock bombs (stun + molly) Q : quick movement / slide E : shock walls on both side X : shock laser  Quick movement or slide can be mobility ability like Jett hover 🔥
when i hear the Filipino part, it was surprised
One word - Disbalance
ita time to play apex
best character trailer yet
gg run and gun agent press w
Her ult voice line be like: "catch me if can taaazzer..⚡"
Jett v2
Fix your fucking game first rather then bringing new agents
15 FPS
judge and slide hahahahaha
New gun?
I am sure this is gonna be fun 😂😂😂
My new main :)
Abilities dont kill!
This is the new agent that will be instalocked!!!
After chamber and now this I’m glad to see that riot is getting a bit more crazy with the agents, the last thing we need is another smoker
Apex legends players : My time to shine
imagine getting jumpscared by her 💀
The way she was walking or 'sprinting' was kind of weird looking lol, but the wall ability looked pretty sick to me.
HOIYL IS H IHNAWPÚON TSAIPOÚ
Agent for apex player specially for octane main LOL
today is my birthday
This agent make me uninstall this fukin game
Is there a reason why the animation looks so choppy?  I mean it's a nice trailer but compared to the other ones Riot released the animation here looks kinda amateurish.
Zeri's lost sister?
I think she would combo really well with yoru, change my mind
Jett on steroids
This agent is saying pretty much "F*ck off jett" in 65 different languages
is this a new fortnite season ??
Sonic the hedgehog UwU version
“Precise gunplay”
R.I.P Phoenix 1/5/22
so, Apex legends movement character ..... this is gona tilt a lot of players haha
Ахрененно
Capital City yow
How is this shit balanced 💀
Me: Mom, but I want Tracer. Mom: We have one at home. At home:........
so now we got quakes LG and cod movement
ow why they put ylona garcia's name? curious xd
Yo this is sick
So excited cant wait to explore her kit... taena at first na  cricringey ako sa kanya but later on i love her imma simp now she thick too!!  btw i wonder Im so excited about the new battle pass concept i wonder baka futuristic skins this time?
so what your saying is, a person that makes run and gun even more annoying, great
palpatine
that wall is illegal .....
omg im inlove with the new agent! it'll be so much fun playing her.❣
Imagine a filipino using vacuum cleaner and not using walis name 1 filipino sleep with thier shoe on god damn im not angry im just  disappointed
wooo
As a viper and a reyna main think I found a new main she looks like a good mix of fragging andblocking off line of site
neon will def reduce the pick rate of jett
this agent looks more annoying than Jett.
RnG is buffed. All good
That wall is what I was hoping for a very long time
OMG IS SHE FILIPINO
Now i can finally say this character is literally made for PROD, with her run n gun and fast entry ability ,PROD would be the best player for her, also he is our last hope.
Finaly i found my favorite main agent.
Caraaalho, que foda, não vejo a hora de nerfarem ela kkkkkkk
Im sorry but that sage did not wall before the res, 5/10
Valorant is getting fucked by each new agent they add the recent agents are quite fucking op while the  original ones are just getting more and more nerfed if they wanna made things op then buff previous agents too give sage a buff give Reyna a buff cypher omen brimstone sova maybe if they did that the game would be quite fucking fair as all the agents would be close to same power level as others
I can’t stop watching this trailer. It’s so good ⚡️
cant wait to see PROD turn to a god with this agent
more run n gun xddddddddddddddddddddddd
smh
jett 2.0
WTH
RUN N GUN ???????????
"precise gunplay"
tf is this riot
I just want to see her vs chamber
Ohh
JET GG
Ugh trash   *pulls up rule 34 reddit*
sooo... just octane?
Man, anime Sonic looks amazing
nice, the run & gun wasn't annoying enough NOW WE HAVE A FUCKING RUN & GUN CHARACTER
Welp, i guess this going to change the game they call "made to be competitive" run and gun whit slides?? A fucking wall to both sides and a ray gun. Ok then now tell me how to play against this?!
Bruh there’re shit coming out of her finger 💀
omg
amazing man as soon as they kind of balance out the game but keep skye and breach broken now we are gonna be sitting on site and be playing against an eco round and get blinded and have some random mfer not running and gunning but SLIDING AND GUNNING us down
how to neon:  press w
Is it just me or some1 else to find her cute and the way her hairs r tied up too??
Pinoy
TAPOHA MENÓ, QUE MINA IRADA PQP
run and gun, here we go
So, Neon is the start of Valorant's own KDA along side Jett, Yoru and Phoenix?
I am scared
precise gunplay in full sprint
they just combined 3 agents into one big agent
Looking like the next poster child that unsurprisingly also has a passive
broken af
She is gonna zappa us to death
I love you Ylona Garcia
Hmm so maybe abit like sobra from overwatch
Say bye bye Jett
Ngl she kinda look like zeri the new league champ.
Me, a Filipina val player: I wanna cosplay her now
so can i copystrike you? XD
Why is her abilities so packed? Lol
INSANEEE!!!!
me estas diciendo que hay un multiverso lol - valorant
i feel like her ult will be able to kill easy groups of enemies
Olha o famoso "patinete" no trailer kkkkkk
she looks cool as hell
This kinda looks like Jett 2.0 with all those movement abilities and her ult...  Let's see how this plays out
Nag Tatagalog gagi
POOOOOG
Goodjob riot
Zeri is that you?   League of legends: "Zeri - the spark of Zaun" Valorant: "Spark - Neon" What a coincidence...
She's sooooooo cooollllllll But fun fact  Neon : get ready I go fast ⚡️  Kay/o : enemy suppressed 🌚
Can’t wait to get out insta locked :D
This is fortnite?
Neon acc sick af
RIOT TOTALLY FORGOT VALORANT WAS ABOUT PRECISE GUNPLAY.....ANYWAYS HYPED UP.
Also, i think she's the duelist initiator everyone had been waiting for.
Looks like she has sprint slide and uh the breach thing
My new main is here. I still love KJ.
Finally an agent that perfectly describes run n' gun and precise gun play
jett tiene una gran competencia ahora jajaja
philippine music represent!
Finally I will get to play Jett because now all the jett mains will instalock neon.
Haaay buhay.
I'm happy to see cypher in fact did not get shit on this time around
bruh so excited
broken asf
poor omen died 2 times this trailer :(
she look like she from fortnite
its phx and  jett's daughter
Di nagmumura? wala di yan pinoy hhahhaha
looks  fcking broken she shoots lightining
This is the Best agent??
Mommy
I thought when I saw her "That is some Yugioh hair." Then I looked up her type... She _really_ is here to d-d-d-d-duel.
Valorant ft.Apex legend
YLONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
What in the COD is this
Sheessshhhhhhhhhhhhh goosebumps
Guess I finally found who to main ._.
Run and Gun is now a skill, lol
my type of MAIN
SHES SO PRETTY OMG
run and gun
riot riot riot
Tácticas Shooter🧐
that "hay, buhay." gives me chills HAHAHAHAHAHAHA this is going to be fun!
The tagalog voicelines is so cringe idk why I'm from philippines tho.
tangina pinoy pride
finally the trailer where Cypher doesn't die first hah
oh ok, she from Philippines, she have a fire path in 2 way, it will let her entry better, a bosting skill, and a skill make enemy slower. Her ult is she will turn in a pikachu and shoot electric from her hands,  after she eliminate some one her bosting skill will recharge. And she look so THICK
GANDA NIYA GAGO
I CANT WAIT SHE LOOKS AWESOME
Better than Jett or wot
YLONA GARCIA
Valorant kaya mahal na mahal kita!!!! Gandaa nya!!!! Hoyyy!!!! Whahaicjaish
I know why I left this game a few months ago hahaha
That's definitely what we all needed (no). Run'n'gun character increases the existing problem with that. Reducing the importance of crosshair placement even more. And of course, broken peekers advantage abuse. Riot will ruin this game sooner or later, with this amount of characters.
HOOOO0000ooooooly shit❤️🔥
She is so cringy haha
bro i am HYPEEEE she might be my new main
DAMN valorant copied cs u brought  zeus !!  noice
another overpowered mf
She looks like she belongs in overwatch or something
🤮🤮🤮🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
"If Run and Gun was an Agent"
Riot just add Apex legend's legend to the game
Mikemmel
There's actually no way. shes pheonix, jett and yoru at the same time
raze move over I wanna zoom slide now
1:20 Phoenix: lo eliminan de una manera epics
everyone: "dash is broken"  riot games: *makes another dash character*  everyone: *surprised pikachu face*
Yea yea so my friend noticed that she kinda looks like Ylona Garcia and "coincidentally" Entertain Me is Ylona's song
really playing to how big of a demographic the philippines is for their game with this one
Omg I can't wait!!
Where that spotify playlist at for her
Lmao she becomes a riskrunner when she ults
i cant wait to see the r34
ayoo this character got double phoenix's wall
This character will be nerfed I think Just look at her😱😱😱😱
Nerf Please!
mine
Damn another cute one for the walpaper
The VIBE
run n gun is coming back confirmed
This game has officially become overwatch
damn
Soo now we got valorant Tracer... sounds cool
karım
why tf does she have a fucking bandaid on her nose
tf bro is this apex
That's sick but character design wise the first glimpse is wayyyy cooler looking than the original end product design
she looks like she could be a very distant cousin of Jett's.
AYO cool asf might be playing val again because of this
A girl version of killua
im no simp but she bad af
Wait why is it arabic in the end
broken agent
jogar que nem doida com ela sim ou claro?
Filipin de elektirik mi varda Filipinli sonic yapıyorsunuz adam gibi çar yapın
EXTRA THICC !!
so excited
OMG
PROD is gonna have a field day
Minha nova main, foda se
THICCCCCCCCCCCC
i wish if was 60fps
Never think id see the day thered be a filipino agent in the game
My new main
heck yes!
Crazy entry potential
Wow a filipino character finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"enemy flash entry" While waiting for the flash to end Enemy Jett: prepare for trouble  Enemy Neon: and make it double
Will this be a new map??
THE ULT IS SO FKN COOL
HOLLY MOLY THE WALL. LASER GUN. SPEED. LIGHTING. EVERYTHING IS HERE⚡
The devs are madlads for adding Quake’s Lightning Gun to Valorant
Mommy Sage UwU
Mfs just took run and gun to a whole different level
Ah yes, they made run and gun into an agent
Instalocking all 2022. I had to come back to watch it again.
that trailer went ham
มึงมี ฟินิกทำไม
Feels like echo in ow
i love everything about this
The new Neon is sooo thick
Какие нахер стены?! Вы ещё скажите, что если зайти в эти стены, то можно оглушиться. И без того кт пушили, а сейчас жопа начнётся.
Sick
Fun trailer :D
Sick
I already know Im gonna be annoyed by this but also be annoying with this agent lmao
Wat in the actual fuck did I just watch😶
cant wait to try her out
Bro, this is gonna be one of my mains. ALSO 2 WALLS?
Seems nice, but man that song was joice seemed weird
This game is so trash.
idk man i think this trailer is really far from the chamber trailer based in visuals. for me as a viewer thou
0:46 valorant verse confirmed :'v i love it ❤️
so bad
BRO IMAGINE HER SELECT CHAMPION SCREEN!! YOU HAVE OUT DONE YOUR SELF VALORANT GOOD JOB!!!
nice zeri spoiler from League  Hah ım sure new champ ll be same like her :P
Sheesshhhhhh insane agent 🔥
Imagine you're there just chilling in a corner then all of the sudden Barry Allen here just runs you over with a fucking Vandal.
op.
omw playing apex on Valorant
I can already imagine her running around with a judge
HYPEEE
omg dude she has a wall,a slide, a stun (daze) and a freaking electric hand
cool character desing Valorant, good job!
FAST
Finally a agent for prod  Our battle will be legendary
Run and Gun lets goooo
Imagine, use her and buy judge for entire game and just go hit and run... f*ck
Jezu Neon kocham Cie
New character: run and can put the knes in your face Yoru needing a rework: oh no i cant teleport makes to muck noise
RNG 🗿
goodbye jett
AAAAA-
Phoenix, jet and chamber all merged together
putanggg inaaa
They really took the exaggeration of the gun play being precise with this character...
Ugh proud to be pinoy!! 🤧♥️
That clip on her nose is bugging me
wow
Finally anime waifus as a playable option
Kayo will make her quit being an agent
Killua vibes ?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
new main
She is so cool. She's my fav now. Her colour makes me feel something..
FINALMENTE DISPARAR CORRIENDO 2.0
Finally a champ made for the adhd community let’s go
LESSSS GOOOO
Valorant hits us with 1 dollar store flash (Just joking i like her♥️♥️)
first impression when she ult it's moira ult ngl😎👌
The raze rocket into sage wall at 1:52 for extra color in the video, yall never fail to impress with the ideas in these cinematics 🤩
1:20 tf?
Neon got a dumptruck ngl
LOL
Definitely gonna instalock this hahaha ... new instalock agent
OVERWATCH 2 IS OUT!!!! NO WAY!!!
Another reason for me to never touch the game
I can already see the warzone sweats slide cancelling with this character now
Lol the first text was Turkish, Riot is the most English game brand that cares Turkey. Turkish people love riot and its games because of that.
Zeri?
Prod: :0
Ela é literalmente igual a nova campeã do LOL
Lots of excitement for this character!!!❤
PROD gonna like this!!
If run and gun was an agent
she is a literal laser beam
wow she is cool
I hear some Filipino voice line everytime she cast a spell or she speaking I love it riot
sooo shes basically the epitome of the Run and Gun
FILIPINO REPRESENTATION LESSSGGGOOOOO been waiting for this day
After loosing 10 games straight 0:36 How Filipinos avoid tilting 1:43
damb
she shooting with electricity nice ult :D
Don't know if anyone else picked up on this but, in the stun demo on ascent B, where the orb bounces off the wall by the door it also forms an AoE, looks like wall bounces make stuns?
Viper got a competition in thickness.
teammate 1: hes to the left teammate 2: i got him i got him such dogwater teammate 1: nice teammate 3: uhh guys? why do i hear zapping? _ZeusOnSteroids  ︻デ═一  ⨁  MikeHawk_ _ZeusOnSteroids  ︻デ═一  |-->>  TTVProGodGamerXx_ _ZeusOnSteroids  -⌁⌁⌁  ImAlreadyJett_ _ZeusOnSteroids  -⌁⌁⌁ ⨁  RoadToSilver_ dead teammates 1 and 3: JUST RUN BRO DONT LOOK BACK dead teammate 2: DEFUSE WHAT ARE YOU DOING DEFUSE THE BOMB REVIVE ME YOUR SAGE YOU HAVE YOUR ULT REVIVE ME IM REPORTING YOU JESUS
we already know whats up....  its gona be another leblanc.
Nothing special tbh i had expecting something more...
Finally slide cancel in valorant
APEX Legend players: YES YES YES
what? is this Overwatch game?
I am in love 🥵
Pinay
Dude this so crazy this means that Ylona Garcia is canon in the Valorant world lol
run and gun charcter o boy
At this point riot just realized the fact that they can't fix run and gun. So they made an agent around that it.
bye reyna welcome new op agent
RIP OFF AOCTANE
KTÓRY PAKIET W LOST ARK KUPIC?????????????????
Pilipinas pog
A fast Agent in Valorant. A fast champion in league of legends 🤔. Can anyone explain this to me
holy shit my new main incoming?
nerfa sapoha riot kkkk
i guess we all know what "various sites" are going to do with that lightning finger.. ._.
Fix Run n Gun pal dont make it easier by making the new agent
MARIUSZ UDZIANOWSKI
Anyone else notice that when she pulls up a video of phoenix hes sliding and making fire at the same time could this mean hes getting a new ability or a rework
She looks Hella goofy man, especially her abilities, I feel like a character if anything but tactical, you sprint, slide and zap people with homing electricity, I feel like every agent riot acts is gonna be worse and worse from this point onwards.
Riot: Introduces a Filipino born agent into the game Also Riot: "Why are there millions and millions of ppl from the Philippines making accounts?" "Putangina that was our plan"  Philippines: "Magandang Gabii Bayaan. There is a Filipino character in popular game VALORANT."
Holy shit Riot the filipino pride rn!!! can't wait to abuse this agent in compe lmaoo keep it up
How many days till she comes into the game?  My wallet is asking if she could come faster
Bruhh I'm going nuts out here
I hope she has a tagalog quote
KURWA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ROZUMIECIE MNIE?????????????????????????????????
My friends are already fighting for  who will main neon
inanılmazz
Interesting, riot just teased a new zaun champ in league, calling her spark of zaun, her abilities are based on electricity as well. Plus, they had the same hairstyle but different colors.
Faster, stronger, hotter that is what a Jett main can want.
Ufffff épico
New character can charge my phone bet.
Neon with tita sage 😌
Hand as a gun im sold
I‘M IN LOVE! THE CINEMATICS, THE GAMEPLAY AND THE MUSIC?!? STUNNING
LOL! PO POLSKU BYŁO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She was suposed to fk off Jett, not Phenix !!
"Project A is our character based tactical shooter, it's competitive, it has precise gunplay." :]
My name is Barry Allen...
Instalock agent in the house
Never thought I would get to be glad that I was born as a Filippino from Manila! But I grew up in the US since I was 2 years old but I'm not just getting that pride!
Binks is joddddddddd ba

Shotgun useless with that lightning
"Kontrolado ko to!"
Cant wait to fastpick and die😀
Finally, i thought you never going to add this type of character
bruh the walls are tooooo op, u cant put her in the game shes gonna break valorant
this is becoming more like overwatch now ngl
A vacuum cleaner? WHERE IS YOUR WALIS TAMBO?!
shes gonna be so op with spectre lmaooo
Phoenix + Jett combined = Neon
So u can run and gun?
Patinete elétrico? 😅🤭😂
Now I know why I keep spending money on that precise gunplay I really love this, turned out great
I just love how Riot embraced the run and gun mechanic and made a whole agent around it XD
this is really unique!!
she brings the "Run and Gun" to another level
THE DOUBLE WALL OH MY GOD
I literally just started learning to use raze and thought I'd main her, but now this comes out. Jesus christ.
Wheres Cypher?
ZA RA LHOU
Neon Supremacy 🛐
Porque siempre tienen una nalgotas
DAMN THE REVAL WAS FAST THXS  RIOT :)
what can u expect for mobile game lol
Brooooooooo wtf this is disgusting dude, she can shoot with her fingers while sprinting, like come on
So nervous to kill her but cant wait to play her
so gooood, valorant is on a different level
Güzel bir karakter
0:52 me on my way to buy operator after 3 eco rounds and die instantly to a vandal headshot.
nerf
HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL NAHH RIOT
MABUHAYYY TAYO MGA PINOYYY
It's getting more like overwatch
This yoru rework looking sick 🔥🔥
Run n gun, yeah? Looks fun!
Did sage really asked her to race her lmfao.
Salve, siamo la Riot Games, e tra poco non si chiamerà più Valorant, ma Run and Gun simulator. Buona continuazione!! Ps. PORCODDIO
finally
So a better Jett
Run and gun,sliding and shooting with magic that doesnt require skill. .  . This is direction u wanna go Riot???????
bruh jett and spark will have the best anime battle ngl
FORTE
2:18 ahahaa the walis tambo such a nice detail
Yoru mains start sweating
She and a spectre = SAD
Sonic ?
FILIPINA 😫❤️
I think one of her abilities is precise gunplay while running
She literally can take sites and win gunfights all by herself just be sliding in and running and gunning with her ult.. I bet she's going to be seen every single game.
wow I already love her
NEW MAIN
NIGERUNDAYOOOOOOOOOO
I dont like the ut at all it seems like moira from ow whit boost movement and that is a problem bcs it would be very difficult to aim and make damage so the camera will move
NAH NAH NAH I DONT LIKE THIS AGENT
I was going to get Raze next, now not so much. She’s 100% my next grab 😍
She`s hair looks like ukrainan flag)
So from the looks I think she's gonna be a controller?
Slide cancelling like this is warzone wtf
ih, meteu essa?
Cool, they put Apex legends in Valorant
she’s hot -a lesbian
we are wait turkish agent
shes gonna be so op jett has 2 movement abilities and is the best agent cus of it
😳😳😳😳😳❤️
Neon while reloading : Pota reload
yooo that wall gave me the chills
Run and gun is at another leval now.
MUUUUUUUUUUUITO FOODA E A OMESMO TEMPO ENGRAÇADINHA CORRENDO KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Smite collection part 2 confirmed?
Someone is gonna decide to main her and change their name to palpatine
gooooood
1:03 Ah, yes as a cypher main how do I not expect a trailer of cypher being headshotted with 2 stinger bullets being a mile away in his best map, Icebox.  10/10 trailer. Great job, Riot
codm player pala toh eh
OH NO AUTOLOCK HERO AGAINNN NNOOOOOOOO
Uh, riot was turning LoL characters into Valorant ones when they have to come up with something new i know but... this time they did not even bother to make a new appearance for the new agent. Exact details of Jett, Raze and Reyna combined. Details on gloves, tank top and belt are sad :( Why lazy work riot why. You can do better than anime girl appearance all boys would simp.
Stop copying nagisa's character design
Tactical shooter
What to say Valorant team never fails us in the animations they present 10 on 10 guys.
bruh this is literally titan slideshotgun meta and chaos reach from destiny2
türkler instaloka hazır .d
Oh my goodness 😫😍
HOLY SHIT WTF???????????? Lezzzz GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Time to move back to cs after seeing this run and gun from vandal in their official video and character shooting laser from her hands.. who needs gun anymore lol.
Че у неё 5 абилок?
jett?
:O
Definetly my new main agent. Looks so much crazier than all duelists for sure.
Ñ
what's the music :0
great work !
Nice Trailer! BUUUUT: more running and gunning! make this shitty rng a utulity? you must be kidding.
The animation of the last trailers is incredible... but the music OMG
I saw the voice line at reddit and.... that's not game that's art man
my new main
SO DAMN HYPEDDDDDD '
Tactical shooter
OP
I don't think this game is going to remain "tactical" after this gimmick -_-
Please let her be gay… we need more characters to represent LGBT communities.
0:52  U see speed ability  I see made in heaven ability
Essa personagem ta simplesmente INCRIVEL
Riot: we don't want run and gun in the game and are addressing the issue  Also Riot: Here's an agent whose whole thing is running... with guns...
This is so big that Valorant changed its logo for it
Kinda of reminds me of if sage has a daughter????
She gonna be op and broken af ain't she
Oppppp
Wait can she run and gun or is that the classic cinematic effect?
holyyyyyy wht a intro video🥵🥵
why  sage and neo was  at 30 fps at the end ?
PROD IS GONNA LOVE THIS AGENT
She's gonna be so brokem
AŞIK OLDUM!
The song tho..
"Haaay Buhaaay" HAHAHAA
The perfect run and gun agent for that sweet sweet precise gunplay
Personagem dahora empresa um lixo...
Um novo tipo de patinete?
Could have made her thiccer 😂
Cant wait for the Rule34 version
tangina bebe ghoorl <3
DETAIL: Neon's teaser is animated with 12fps, not 24fps (or so I thought, it looks jaggy, skippy). Once the music starts to play, the scene is similar to Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse's last scene where Gwen is calling Miles. Aside from that, the art and animation style for this certain trailer is different from the previous trailers.
An entire new meaning to "Run & Gun"
Oh yeah , now I quit valorant.
Precise gunplay
Man i cant wait to think im gonna have a new main and immediately get clapped
They even made her sing which is really amazing, cus most Filipinos can actually sing really well..
True definition of Run and Gun
Sage: race you there? Neon: *activating her speed* Sage: *slows orb*
1:20 Wait wait wait... does her double wall HAVE SOVA WALL HACKS?! If that's not a teammate sova doing that, her walls are insane
Can u slap me back with a comment or like Valorant official?! Lol 🤤🤧🥰🤣🤣
a much op ughhhh
Thanks for upgrading the Run n Gun 👌
I find resemblance to spellbreak
Valorant is becoming Overwatch bro
yOu CaN't JuSt FiNgEr YoUr WaY oUt EvErYtHiNg
Philippines Represent! 🇵🇭

0.5 fps ?=)
SO GOOD FILO REPRESENTATION 10/10
She sounds like jett
"Ginusto ko 'to"
Apex ??

pqp patinet ja e ridiculo agr me faz um agente q patina a mds kkk
shotgun neons incoming
OMG
5 fps
ya boii she can RNG and Kill with Bulldog Ez
sage wanted to race lol
Get ready for the Neon lurks ><
Come on Riot. Give us a valorant anime after arcane
cool
chegou o patinete ?
Pinoysss were u at?!
I guess her dash ability will be similar to the speed buff ability in snowball fight
Double wall seems pretty situational ngl. But I like how it has a lil tunnel vision motif since she's all about rushing in super fast.
Riot só tá fazendo personagem bonito, credo!
Flash from DC comics but alternative timeline
SHE BE THICC AF
Omg ylona garcia
her slide reminds me to warframe ^^
hype as shit holyyyy.//
"Abilities dont kill..."
"Kontraldo ko to, kontrolado ko to"

Zeri? No Neon? No, Zeri? No, Neon?
OK, can i already say that i am main?
Drift drift drift
"Precise Gunplay"
welcome to overwatch
yo this is NAs character no cap
well fucking played, love valorant for this
Thank you valorant for not killing Cypher too much this time
can we also talk about how this song is fucking awesome
the official champ "run and gun" 🤣🤣
They made the run n gun a real thing
No hindi at last
Looks like Zeri?
her run reminds me of michael scott
Im quoting straight flash 1 liners while playing her!
Run and gun gonna make me quit this game forever...
At first I was like: "Oh! She's a bit tanned. She looks filipino." Then she said, "Hay buhay!" and I was like: 😱😍😍
Shes not in the game  and i See know the instalocks and im Main Spams
Cant wait for Valorant to have an Indian origin agent
omg Philippines represent
best agent trailer so far😍😍😍😍
WHAT A VIBE
we're so screwed bruh ;-;.... they better make yoru busted istg at least make me feel the need not to keep going and not drop him for her bruh
Yikes she looks ridiculous and makes Phoenix look like a fucking joke, do something about him already 🤦‍♂️
She looks like she has 5 or 6 abilities LOL
what is this, fortnite?
I N S T A L O C K
Waiittt it speaks Tagalog?!?!?!
anak ng putang ina here we GOOO
GUN N RUN AT ITS FINEST
The Flash Vibes ⚡
this hero boutta be broken af
That finger gun bruh is this Echo from overwatch?
riot:fixes run and gun also riot:
RNG meta
"I think Chancellor Neon is a Sith Lord"
Her wall is just a better phoenix wall
IM SO FUCKING HYPED
Ahh, the usual singing using the toothbrush as a microphone, most Filipinos do this
She looks real cool, but with that double wall we can say RIP to pheonix lol
i think it’s this kind of agent super to play but when he is in the other it’s awful 😭
this is broken and im here for it >:)
Neon ults: Controlado ko toh (I can control this)  Me: UNLIMITED POWER!!!!!!
She is literally looks like Sonic
NO HINDI. NOTED VALORANT  WELL F U TOO
i didn't fight my place in the agent roster but now i sure do lol. maining her for sure
Welp I know what PRODs going to main
Prod is gonna go crazy with her
lets gooo as an octane main im happy :)
Ohhh her ult is inspired from chitti aka Rajnikant "the legend" 🤣🤣
As always, Riot knows how to make an entrance.  Don’t know how this is gonna play out though.
Riot: Skills don't kill. Me: Yeah, sure.
riot powerscaling go brrr
damn 9ass
is that for real?
Feels so bad for phoenix no buff
Running gunning agent out! Finally 😎
Surely she wouldn't be as strong in game as she looks in the trailer, right guys?
Time to play Apex Legends in Valorant
Just run and gun, with a laser to boot.
How ironic that a Filipina Agent has electricity abilities, meanwhile our country, the Philippines, suffer so much with power interruptions. Still, I can't wait to try her out! AND SHE'S SO CUTE! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Her room screams Filipino representation, and her trailer shows how young or Gen Z she is.
Fun fact: cypher didn’t die this time.
Nooooo waytyyyyyyyy
do I smell?..... Broken?
what apex legend doing in valorant?
i think neon is biggest fans of phoenix because she only watch phoenix clip
And Cypher dies again...........
sick
I wish valorant well make more episodes it was amazing i think a new agent not neon like agent 20
Art director in this game is chefs kiss
0:52 NO CAP I actually dreamed the Same to same ability that she just did .
Bye have a good time this character it look broke us hell. And the she got two Wars
Great, we have a new emergency generator for those blackout days.
Filipinos right now are hyped with this new character. We loved being recognized and taking part with these kinds of foreign works. Mabuhay!!
FLASH AND IRON MAN HAD A SON AND ITS CALLED Spark
ferrari peek to the next level
Bro She just took the job of like 5 agents
Mommy Sage like always making sure the young agents are okay.

Yo she speaking Vietnamese ? 0:37-ngủ thôi (means: bed time) In valorant Bitexco' tower (which in HoChiMinh city) have been hit by a lighting
Wtfffff nice​ gilr
Ya karmaşa'nın ilk baş Türkçe gelmesi ayrı gururlandırdı🙂🙂
Fix running and gunning? Nah, let’s make a running and running agent.
Octane?
Zeriiiiiiiiii HYPE!!!!
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS
So, rng is legal now ☹️
"hayy buhay" !!!!!!!!

She Will be The best
so when can i play her???
zeri and neon very very look alike
OK now we need a Sri Lankan Agent 😊👍
Lol tagalog haha
IGHT NOW IMMA SHOW YOU GUYS WHAT  RUNNING AND GUNNING LOOKS LIKE SHEEEEEH
Filipino Gang i love that they have a filipino accent too  Hayyy buhay means- hayy life  Controllable ko ito means - i can control this or im in control or somethin  which means her backstory is something with her power being too much for her???????
She's so cool omg I already love her and the agent trailer is so satisfying to watch
So sick damn
Nakuryente Yan sa grounded na mic ng videoke nila
DAMN! NEW AGENT IS SOOOO COOOOOOL
she's instantly meta no cap
Blue Zeri?
hyyyyyyyyyyped
jett 2.0
she will ruin the game  i know xD
I dont know about the agent but valorant is really working hard on songs lovely💗💗💗
LMAO THE BROOM
This Music is a Bop🔥🔥🔥
Hmm finally.. RNG Agent  *being sarcastic*
Broken
Wtf is this?
Lobotka >
...run and gun
She is sick but I swear to God riot is just making more and more op agents and nerfing the og ones more and more
are we all agree that chamber and neon's trailers are the best.
Didn't they just Removed Run & Gun? Now, it's Run, Slide AND Gun?
Thicc
So she doesn’t need a charger for her phone…
Ayyy, cant wait to play 5 duelists meta with yoru's rework coming with neon
"Hey let's just put all the other characters except omen in one!"
Очередной +w герой
She looks op
wheres she from?
They talk about nerfing rng but after this what shall we say 😑😑
im worried about that double wall ability, kinda feels like stripping identity from viper/pheonix wall
MEU MAIN
Ah yes finally another thicc agent after chamber
Finally, us apex players will have the perfect agent KEKW
she's going to be nerfed so fast
WHAT IS THIIISSS THEY LOKI PUT IN AN OVERWATCH CHARACTER
it would be cool if the walls were slightly see through
Nice killua ult
new op is loading...
Great start for the year 2022!
1:20 Phoenix: "Am i a joke to you?"
why is this in 20 fps LMAO
Now the game will become more precise
so whenever she casted an ability she run faster r8?
holy hell she is definitely annoying! and that's good :D
mommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorrymommy sorry
Welcome to the NEON meta
Call fo ditiuty
feels like shes op
Kontrolado koto 👊👊
so they ain't jokin' that this can rival jett???
jett+pikachu
cool
nice one <3 <3 Kontrolado ko to
E   in the second 0:50 I think it must be her "E", which when triggered, it gives a higher movement second that comes back when she makes a kill    Q  at 1:14 minute and a kind of concussion that bounces on the walls like yoru's bang, which leaves an area where the concussion is applied and ends when it hits the ground  C  at 1:21 minute, and for sure an improved phoenix wall that must be like not all the other walls in the game, where you go through it, it will take damage, I don't know how much more it can take hahha  X and at the 1:54 minute we have the MOST BROKEN ULT IN THE GAME SO FAR, hahahah and literally a stun flamethrower spec, which I don't know for how long but I can see that in my competitive matches I'm going to have a real headache. with this doll hahaha  passive: And to finish I was thinking that this skid in the 1:02 minute was an ability but as I had already counted 4, this "ability" must be like the jett's fluctuation, as if it were her "passive", I just know that it's going to be really cool to slide around like in fortnite hahaha  what do you think? talk to me :)  edit: just saying, everyone knows there's a story behind the valorant, right? well i think the new agent has a crush on darling fenix haha ​​and do you know the best part? jett also seems to have a romantic interest in fenix, but i think i don't think it should be more for a sibling relationship i don't know hahaha
I wonder how Jett is feeling right now...
fok jett..jett ka maka bhosoda.knife lady gonna be shocked mid air.electricity >>>>>> air
people asking for nerf rng  valorant  : 1:53
So Valorant and League of Legends both release a young female electric/tech character with bright pastel colored hair and the same hairstyle, at the same time. Is Neon going to be a Zeri skin?
Instalock Neon will hit different ngl
Tbh her abilities are like arc abilities of a warlock in destiny...hahaahha if u know u know
The new waifu in valorant :)
Apex players like this XD
soo run and gun is gonna be a bich now huh
wtf did i just watch
call of duty X valorant X apex . keep that shit
Make a character from Nepal 🇳🇵 😻
octane
hey vamos fazer uma cotinha pra comprar um pc novo pra Riot conseguir fazer esse trailer a 60 fps mano ta parecendo eu rodando o jogo aqui em casa kkk
1:38 sounds like LAKAD MATATAG
İlk dil olarak türkçeyi tercih etmişler!🇹🇷
nice 30 fps animation
Why? Why they make the gunning and running a character...
Another agent to instalock also cant wait for rule 34 full release hehe
Finally we got Chamber's Mom🤣
wait wait hold the FUCK ON... Didn't the next league of legends champ that just got leaked called Zeri look almost IDENTICAL to spark? I'm not the only one seeing this, right? I mean switch the color of their hair and it's almost the same person, right?
Omg! This is Awesome! Philippines! Whoo!!!
it's the new run and gun
Bye viper ,bye Phoenix, bye jet ,we don't need you anymore ...Neon is too op she has everything ....the viper walls were overkill
Okay its a classic shiny valorant agent I get it. BUT WHAT F HAPPEND WITH Precise gunplay and abilities dont kill hillo riot games is this a tactical shooter or ur new fps copy of league of legends?
Okay so she plays Quake essentially
номано так
Ok but the song>>>>>>>>>>>>>
😂😂Feels bad for Cypher.Always dies  1:03
1:19 phoenix is crying right now
damn... I'm hyped
what does bohi(what she says when watching phoenix not sure how to spell) mean?
run and gun hass ben a issue but BOOOM THEY MAKE AN AGENT WITH THAT FREAKING SPECIALIZATION 😆😆
she looks insane, that slide has to be her passive. Also note that her grenade bounces twice and concusses on each bounce. You can see the time in the middle of the impact of the nade
Kda skin for her pls lmaooo
Now viper has a challenger i guess   IFYKYK 😏
when Neon said "Hayyyy buhay"... I relate to it 100%
I think her surname is Bonifacio because it says on her jersey “Bonifacio 19
hay buhay
Mea raja
PH Represent.
PILIPINAS 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Precision gameplay my ass, a fast paste character in a precision base shoter is basicly the dummest shit ever
Call of duty agent?
perfect agent!!!!!!
"Hay, buhay."
Phoenix Crying Rn
I'll be seeing alot Neon zooooming around the map now
the real MVP here is Sage for that wall blocking Raze's ult
soo exited
WOOOOOOOOOW
I don't like this, seems very run and gunny
She’s already my favorite agent.
THIS FKCN AGENT IS SOOO COOOOOL
Petition to buff omen!
her stun will affect both the places it bounced off from and landed to
Run and gun nice, keep doing that shit
I think she's too op
leş
so the game supports rng now lol
Hell yeahh now some COD movement.
Finally, high-mobility character that Valorant has needed for a damn long time...
LESGOOO NEON!!!!😯
lmao if the opponents have a kayo then she's lowkey useless 😂😂😂
Can’t wait to see what PROD will do on Neon
parang codm angass
Thank you riot for indirectly replacing my boi phx
finally, sage in a cinematic...
Finally Jett old version is back
This agent will be Jett's nightmare...
Neon and Zeri both have electricity theme coincidence? i dont think so =))
Where’s the shorty skin,  BRO I NEED IT
HAYYYYY BUHAAAAY
elas tem um caso, anota ai
I am hypeddddd 🔥🔥🔥
Why does her ult remind me of over watch's echo
Welcomte to Overwatch.
yeah gg shes so increadible like brooo HOLY SHIT SHES SOO SICCK AHHHH
stop, riot! i hate the game, why you have to make me think that i love it every video you make?!?!?
Codm charcter lol
Bro this is almost exactly like Zeri wtf
finger guns
sevdim
Its like cod
If i shoot laser and opponent do just one tap vandal man seem ult is not good
People are still sad that Cypher dies in Retake Cinematic while Omen died 3 times in this one trailer
This has to be probably one of the best trailers riot has put out for an agent...wow
Damn she kinda bad.
FIX THE SPECTRE BEFORE RELEASING A SLIDING CHARACTER PLEASE I DONT WANT TO DEAL WITH SLIDE AND GUN NOW
neon goes apex
ok.. if you get phoenix, make him a girl, give him double the power, this is what you get
Gives me Into The Spiderverse vibes with the Animation style. The whole animating on 2s. Love the music, look forward to playing her.
this is gonna be prods main 😵‍💫
she can sing??? most accurate filipina character and the jersey and the basketball ring at the wall ooooooh i love it
Here's the trick double wall and then RUN🏃💨🏃💨
ANOTHER THICC CHARACTER🥵🥵🥵
Another duelist fot instalockers to not entry with
Omg I’m so excited I freaking love Valorant
Bravo to Riot Games for actual Filipino representation like oh my god I can scream Pinoy Pride and not sound obnoxious? There's just so many things in the trailer, especially Neon's room that if you were a Filipino you'd go "tangina Filipino nga sya". The accent is on-point, Ylona Garcia's music, the basketball jersey frame, a frame full of medals(achievers lang makakagets), and a lot of subtle things Filipinos would immediately catch onto!
Oh cool they added Octane from Apex
i can see the ferrari peeks now!!
valorant gon be cod with this new agent
Ok so run, stuns that fall from the sky, TWO WALLS and a zap from fingers ULT. And I'm pretty sure she has a passive that gives her firing accuracy while moving, which will be very broken.
i want her to step on me but she already has sage
Sister Zeri league of legends xD
lol
VALORANT deserve a series
Slide cancelling 💀
Its. Ekko?
someone pls translate 1:40
0:53 , bro even the dev's know Run and Gun is Broken...
*Sad and insecure Jett noises*
omg first sage animation :D
So she's Filipino
THIS IS FUCKIN ZENITSU
sizin yapacağanız karakterin
dude 2 fps
boi she thicc
awesome design. Is she gonna share music with Raze?
Time to uninstall this game
waifu
finally we have octane in valorant
Unlimited POWER
If this agent can like wide swing at the speed of light she might be broken no cap
Interesting this is similar to riots other new champion as well is there a theme?
Riot fixes the run and gun issue by replacing it with the new slide and gun
slide canceling. what ever good shooter needs.
Fun bit of detail: In 1:42 Neon says, "Kontrolado ko 'to, kontrolado ko 'to" in the process of getting ressed by Sage.  It translates to: I can control this, I can control this  Maybe in her lore, she just aquired these powers and is actively trying to properly utilize them.
UNLIMITED POWERRR . . . . . . also intoducing Apex Legend's slide
valorant devs: * nerf jett and still OP * also valorant devs: * make a character even more broken *
Yoru + Phoenix?????????????????
THANK YOU FOR THE INCLUSION RIOT!!! THE LORE IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This character: *exists* Low elo run and gunners: *insert troll face meme here*
mommy
Jett Thiccer Jett
Lol the run animation at 0:53 looks so wonky
This is like apex with octane
Oh shiet its time “im fast as f*ck boi”
Its me or she looks like the new leauge champ?
WHEN
finally, jett 2
next slide please
rng new meta at this point
even though I'm looking at how cool she is, yo she got a fatty respectfully 👀
sonic looking a lil different here
so her ult is basically a rapid fire gun that has no recoil and has 100% accuracy even while moving...  that's dope
Теперь убийства на ходу станут нормой?
It's the overdrive ability from Bo3
Thank, but we need a 4K video, cuz everything I see is pixel now
That's a freaking trailer!
More.!
jet op por tener un dash y ademas de que en este juego se puede matar corriendo, riot games: que meta a un personaje que te mata corriendo y deslizándose dices
holy shit this agent reveal trailer is amazing and she seems OP af nice one
I guess the slide is passive ability?
Best trailer ong
So cool 🖤
ok she is BROKEN
Ah. The "immeasurable love for singing/music" trait. Classic detail. Shoutout to miss Ylona for the banger song💖
I guess im fall in love with her🥰
"HAY BUHAY" HAHAHAHAH cute naman
Faster Faster!
i thought we didn't want run and gun, now we have slide and gun. good job riot
Gar kein Bock.
This is just overwatch
filipinos kept run and gunning on our region that they made an agent just for them
She is op
hahahaha this game is going downhill so fast
The Filipino references made my heart melt and I'm glad they didn't do the stereotypical Filipino accent. Pretty sure this agent is gonna piss people off with her abilities lol I'm inlove with her already
as a Filipino, masayang masaya ako na unti-unti nang napapansin ang mga Pilipino sa larangan ng video games (I am so happy that the Filipinos are slowly being noticed in the field of video gaming)
Extremely good animation! also shes another mommy
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?
run and shoot literally
SOOO COOOL
SHE IS SO BAD
Tondo thingz
First legend can run fast in gane
Flash + (octane no drugs) + moe = this cutie
PATINETE VAI REINAR KKK
So cool.
finally overwatch 2 here
Juego de mierda
She's so beautiful
what a trailer
I need this
Imagine hearing gas gas gas while playing her Neon:I am speed
damn phoenix on a whole nother level.. this gonna be insane
0:35 That Phoenix clip is actually NOT from the Retake cinematic. This is new.  Big brain Riot dropping a cinematic teaser in an agent trailer.
ah yes fast as philippine snatcher
this bish look so op holyy shi
Illegitimate child of Pheonix and Jett
OP PLS NERF
Release date?
nice... it's a pity that the game still doesn't work as it should :)
This is gonna be game breaking
1:13 what is she a filipino a FILIPINO?!
i like that the agent now faster than Jett is from the country that made "Rebibe me Jett"
Finally getting shaft from Quake
What does she say when getting revived?
Omg it's dope
Wow
No way shes beating a vandal tho. as soon she comes around the corner with her ult shes getting popped
TANG INA ETO NAAAA
How is the wall not broken? Considering that it is not the ultimate, That shit is beyond OP.
Taking Precise gameplay to the next level
WoW
Ok riot I think you guys got lazy because her and the new league character look similar
well broo we are done  gl playing against her XDD
its my eyes problem or the vid is 30fps?
dont tell me its accurate when she surf
ok so now we can shoot people with my laser hand , cool...
time to create new account huh ?
look's like a wing's club character
Valroant never stops making my day.
I see apex now
Run and gun but cooler lmfao
Is this apex legend now???
the soundtrack is so fire
ok so we now have emperor palpatine in the game, while runing and having "Unlimited power"... Nice
super excited to get slide canceled ON!!!! LMFAOO great video though ong
AYO WTF WAS THAT PHOENIX VIDEO????
1.5=60fps
ABILITIES: one seems to be a  double  phoenix wall.  her ult seems to change her looks like the way reynas does. Not sure if her shocking the opponent is an ability or part of her ult.(checked and it seems her ult is what allows her to discharge through her fingers and kill opponents)  Then most obviously we see her ability to move faster, including a SLIDE! Edit: on second watch  i see she has an ability that bounces once and activates in a circular radius and anyone inside that radius gets concussed. I slowed down the video and it seems she kills the opponent right as they get concussed so its hard to see
She looks alot like the new character they are adding to league of legends 😳
HELP IM SO HYPED IM LITERALLY FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW AAA HAHHAHAHA
SHES SO COOL HOLY
Damn this has made a smile on my face I want to play that game again very good cinematic great !!!!
GOOD
Hey look,its a new battlefield specialist.
phoenix uses fire smoke* . neon : lmao so lame
can't wait for the rule 34 artists to be as fast as her.
I'm speed
New main
They are basically promoting RNG
Sage -Race you there... Neon- ya sure........   😡 fku Walled me
Cannot wait for my plat 1 teammate to cost me with this new agent 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
nice precise gunplay, sprinting towards sova. proceeds to spray and pray and still gets the kill. Fun :)
YOOOOOOOO!!

Get ready to be abused by judge with this agent
I NEED IT
To the people that will main Neon  I hope you like the taste of the salty tears of players that complain about running and gunning
WHERE IS THE INDIAN AGENT BRO!!
Finally an agent for run and gun!! 😂😂
REBIBE ME JETT! 🇵🇭🔫
she not asian if she puts HER SHOES ON THE BED
One of best trailers
she looks cool omg
Delete this shitty character(phoenix main)
wow..more run and gun!
I just only know she is cute 😅
RUN AND GUN LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
i love it!!
A ult that you can run and gun with no movement error, a knee slide that you can keep your weapon out with, precise gunplay gone out of the window with this one, she is going to be insanely OP
Looks really balanced for sure nice job Riot HAHA!
can't wait😪
Wow as in wow!!!!
BULLSHIT
Bruh moira
Riot should implement a 2 week ban for new agents in ranked. This is gonna be so disgusting.
"tactical shooter"
que isso cara já não gostei
Exited to be playing apex in the riot launcher
Stop this is sick
Minnal murali⚡
SHE SLIDES?!
If the accuracy while in the speed boosted state is improved this agent seems kinda overpowered, especially for people that are much more mechanically talented.
Did i see FULLY ACCURATE WHILE RUNNING??????
So we have dealt with run and gun for quite a while now and they add the true RUN and gun character. Nice
100% gonna be busted
As a Filipina, I love the detail of her singing (we love singing). All my family members have a karaoke machine in their homes. I found my new main and a reason to hop back on Valorant, thank you Riot.
When Sage revive Neon and made wall, that partnership was too dope to look
Sage is so wholesale at the end, loved it
to be honest this agent looks kinda op from first looks BUT the wall has only a small gap to entry through and enemies can walk in it from 2 sides so you basically need to check all angles at the same time except when you have sova ofc. the stun looks cool i wonder how it will come in play. the sprint and slide will counter snipers 100% and also me who cant shoot on moving enemies never the less im really excited to see how fast rotates and flanks are gonna be now
Lancer from Rogue Company.
Riot, I'm silver...I CANT EVEN HIT A STILL STANDING TARGET PLEASE
finally, Jett 2
I think she realy look good
Imagine when she dies and says "Jett revive me"
REAL WTF DUDE
que merda de ultimate é essa
OMG I LOVE HER SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL
Valorant got tired of being called a CS clone, so they made her ult a overwatch mechanic, and her other abilities apex mechanics.
Yup another instalock duelist :>
Whaaat her ult turns her into azula? Maybe I should start playing this game
Man that dual fire wall...forget it pheonix
why the f does she look like that tho, the most weird looking character lol
it looks like flash in the dc universe
Sliding from Fortnite ong
riot never fails to amaze us with their animations💕
wow
I said this game would be perfect if there was a slide. I'm excited, Thank you!! 💕
Neon's "kontrolado ko 'to" gave me goosebumps!
Ахеренно, Боже как же это круто!
"Hay, buhay." 0:39  -Neon
run and gun as an agent
she is so cute..
why was cypher not the first to die?
Players: fix run and gun Riot: Run and Gun agent go brrrrr..
god damnn

You guys made it more casual seems like a trash run and gun character
An agent made for run n' gun! Finally!
Static shiv on an agent? Lool.

Finally a cinematic with Sage in it, her voice is so soothing 😍
OMG, i love you riotgames!! thanks for this awesome trailer, her  abilities looks very very cool.
Guys her ability looks really strong but wait till the actual gameplay I have learned to not trust the trailers
Valorant its not a shooting game anymore
Let's go.....Apex !!
Y r u running?
imma be mad when I get run and gun aced with a spectere
You've accomplished a lot in such a short time in two years. Bitek is not only doing this, you have made games that appeal to everyone with your nine different games. I play your Riot Games games with pleasure, in my opinion you are the first in games. I WISH YOU SUCCESS IN RIOT GAMES
cant wait to play apex while im playing valorant
Türkçeyi ilk sıraya koymuşlar bu sefer. As bayrakları as. :D
Tam da imtahan ərəfəsindəykən…
Wow another agent to insta lock ,
Everything is cool, specially her ult is basically like captain marvel ❤️❤️ and her designs are inspired from sonic hedgehog but again cypher gets killed in the video 😂😂😂
BROOOO DAS MY NEW MAIN
Thanks Riot 😉
wow
Apex legend?
this is an incredible clip! I'm waiting for a series or a film on Valorant. That would be as cool as arcane!
waht a sex character just lob it <3
my new main
Me encanta que la animación sea fiel al juego, ambos a 5 fps
dummy thicc
Amazing trailer, can't wait to main her for three months. One question though, who are those 3 mysterious figures behind Chamber?
only me like the music here ?
Spark woulda been a better name but hey new COD MW agent ig
1 year ago: this game has precise gunplay Now: THIS BITCH GOES WEEEEEEEE
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
pogchamp
Woah! Didn't expect a Filipino agent. Nice  one
yoru + pheonix and run and gun..?
Seeing her flame wall makes me very sad for pheonix 😥
It is very awesome I can't wait to us it at last an agent which I like the abilities
So I take it that Ylona Garcia also voiced her? That’s so cool!
yooooooo shes form philippines
This is sick oh no wait RUN AND GUN IS COMING...rip
run and gun, really?
Killua god speed
Какая ты классная, неон!
wow riot really outdid themselves again. arcane, chamber, now neon!! also rip jett 💀
new jett and pheonix is useless xD
omfg its so goooooooooooooooooodddddddddd
Already a headache wit rng now have to death with this too
Meanwhile yoru's bang blind himself and is loud asf
phoenix wall, speedy heely's, concussions and finger guns. nuff said
Thanks Riot, this makes me want to go back playing CSGO.
movement, stuns, walls and an ultimate to use instead of a gun. has everything i like from other agents!
Damn these valorant chicks got 🍑
so basically destiny 2 warlock with top tree stormcaller ?
Best trailer for now.
If I can actually play her efficiently I might main her instead of Brim
Maybe a Phoenix buff since doesnt her duble wall just make pheonixs ability just a wealer version
Thank u for giving us a pinoy agent!
Shooting lazers now 😂
Sage: Race you there?  *Proceeds to wall Neon inside her room*
Let's Go Valorant India Players
Bruh fuck this so much
HAYYY BUHAAAAYYY
SHE BAD AS HELLLLLL
I SIMP
The 'W' agent
0:50 after sova dies, she seems to use her skill again and faster? So the more she kill the faster she gets?
I wish ALL the new agents revelation videos were like this
Loved every Filipino references in this teaser, thank you Riot Games!
Gas Gas Gas!
This just looks crazy to me im so stoked, thanks riot!!! <3
RUN AND GUN 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Still gonna main jett
SHE’S LOOKS SO BADASS AND COOL + THE FACT THAT SHE’S FILIPINO. DAMN I WANT HER NOW
How to deal with running and gunning Blue button: Remove acurrance while running Red button: Make and agent

ВАУ
Ok I am happy 😊
Oh god don't bring this cringe KDA music shit to Valorant too
KILLUA MOMENT
Filipino voice lines💕
Wait... Filipino????!!
im done with valorant once but this .. this really make me want to go back
MOMMY
nerf pls
sage is so cute😂😭
I think i might have finally found my main 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i see her as pheonix jett combo wich sounds rlly fun and can we just appreciate how coll she looks damn
(kontrolado ko ito) in 1:38 means (I control it)
Thankfully cypher did not die again this time im grateful
Sage: “I see you have made a few changes …. Now put that shit back”
pov: one of the developers saw the sonic movie a bit later then the rest did
Ayo mind blown
"Hay, buhay."
Nice, another instalock agent
Can't wait to try this agent.
So heres her kit or what i think A speed boost basically a Sprint Itll prob be her main E ability.  Baseically Enter a sprint mode but you cant run and gun. I think her slide is a passive it def doesn't feel right if it was an ability, Her Q acts almost like a Yoru's blind side flash but it doesn't really flash. You can bounce of surfaces and i assume you'll be able to change how many surfaces it can bounce off of and it seems to give a stun area. Her C is the double wall self explanatory blocks sight line and Creates cover all that stuff. Her Ult i think is her ultimate Run and Gun She has sprint and is able to zap enemys to death.
Open the video, like before watch xD
hay buhay? FIlipino Character?
Woahhhhh 😳😳🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah shes getting nerfed
this looked cheesy
i feel like she’s gonna ruin the game, idk man
GOOSEBUMPS GRABE!!!
Guess is this sentinel or wor? 🌚
r u sur about that
Broken
Neon: double wall Meanwhile Phoenix with only one wall: *sad skrrra noises*
Bruh what is that wall
Finally some filipina agent, when you turn it on Riot, You turn it on. Good job!🇵🇭
0:53 precise gunplay
0:50 me after eating the 5 vitamin gummies
Sprint, slide, Zeus hand of death,  Moses's staff and walls of water, yo is this valorant? I thought it's SMITE new game mode
Kelipente kandhari😌

Brim's stim beacon: Why do I even exists?
Finally i can slide in the enemy dms

Taking run and gun to the next level
Man this is so dope even the Jett mains are gonna play Neon more then Jett
I love how no cyphers were harmed in this video
SHEEEESH
Cool ability, that slide better not break cypher tripwire or we have jett problem 2.0 again.

And the power creep begins
AGENTE DOS PATINETEROKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Team: lets rotate Neon: *im fast af boi*
what in gods might was that
wwwhhhhaaaaatttt shoooting laserbeams !!!!!!!!!
Oh shit! Ylona Garcia!

For the duelists autolock and for the simps. Two in one bundle.
LETS GO FILIPNOS YESSSS FINALLY SOME REP
Only thing that concerns me with this concerns me with this character is the races to instalock her first LMAO
Bye jett😂
I love her already
Prod found his main.
she is fast just what i needed to go to immortal and beyond!!!!
Ultinya ngeZEUS mantap
riot daha op bir karakter yapamazdı
Oh na's last hope gonna abuse this so hard
Gun for entertain me song please 💜
So is it just me or does this character have so much resemblance to the released League champ Sheri??? Even Sheri's nickname is the Spark of Zaun.  Also rumored to have been designed by the same dev, August...
She better say putangina in 1 of her lines or im gonna cry my pilipino pride away
Her ult looks nightmare
RIOT if u read this pls make the series on Netflix already, VALORANT deserves IT
lets go my main 100%
PHILIPPINE REPRESENT LEZGOOO YLONA!!!
tambah broken ngentit
PHILIIIIIIIPINASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Valorant and their cinematic trailers 🔥💀
Oh, wow, it's zeri but in valorant, nice.
Блять это че за варфейс
Ah yes. The slide and specter
Istg this gonna be so broken,spec run and gun ;-;
Valorant never misses with the trailers/films
ELA TEM SLIDE? mais um cod?
okay somebody tell me 1 reason why she ain't broken
she is a vibe
she seems broken... and hella fun too
WTF.. I checked it twice if this is real.   Cos I was doubting that this might not the verified Valorant channel but omgaaadddd 😱😱😱😱😱😱
broken toh pare sheesh
First Chamber, now Neon... Riot is really wanting FPS players to conquer Valorant don't they? :D Look at those skills... Fully focused on gunplay rather than skills themselves. Perfect!
Rng😭
She is going to be kinda broken
"hayyy buhayy"
holy shit
agents are getting crazier
Wtf
Of course she has to be a singer ❣️
OMG OMG OMG I LOVE HER OMG OMG OMG
what does she say tho??
HOLY SHITTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO excitedddd. PHILIPPINES REPRESENT!
AHAHAHAHAHA Ima abuse this agent
Looks OP
JET 2.0
They just made Prod's agent   We are in danger
THE RUN GUN AGENT
Peenoise Represent 😎😎😎
inb4 all the attention seeking content creators are in comments
thanks for the rule 34 material!
Finally a character i can rush b with properly
You are required to use this agent with the spectrum bundle to get the full enjoyment.
Is she also voiced by Ylona Garcia?
When you combine COD  and LOL mechanics into an agent with no creativity: NEON
Sage character is just Waifu
Hay buhay..... I love you agad.....neon
Edan brou
u gotta lover ability prices of other agents after this shit, also buff phoenix please its useless
The team behind these trailers 🙌🙌
Quebrou o jogo já
wowowow wht was that !!!
Is she duelist?
winston meets tracer
If "jett rebibe me" aint in any of her voicelines... i wont buy any skins riot
Taena Filipino pala bagong agent.
2:22 just like you sage
Wtf is this she fuking strong
oh my god I love her
nobody: remove run shoot rito: add neon*
To be honest, I think I know how bad the yoru were. Especially, fake out. Each agent has their own attributes, but I don't know the yoru. Lmao🤣🤣
Holy this is a disaster, can't wait for the 12 year old on Adderall in immortal to shit on me with this.
Slide ile bize kaycak gibime geliyo
Rn looks op, not gonna lie
PROD CHARACTER
Finalmente Jett 2
Is that not a bit OP though?
a lot of people are worried about her making run and gun and “precise gunplay” no longer a factor, but consider that without proper cover or team support, rushing in usually means getting headtapped way faster than you can get your gun out
I'm gonna start playing duelist just to Main her
dico solo una cosa. WOW
bom
Riot executives : So how do we fix rng and OP weapons ? Riot developpers :  Make an agent guns as abilities and another with rng sliding abilites abilities.  😂
i wanna play her so baddd
agent made for prod
AHH SH** fracture 5 man rush take is gonna be even more annoying oh god put up that wall ability throw that stun trap breach stuns canteen side reyna flash top right of wall ability kj goes for plant and then u got that chamber hold spawn angle after plant gg i must obtain this character and push to immortal this act or episode which ever one it is.
I'm picturing Neon asking Jett some kpop or kdrama related topics since shes Korean but Jett doesn't like her because of her speed
Sheeeeeeeeeeesh
Jett has some compitetion......
She's cute
1st ability - slide and run fast ? Not sure like Jett  2nd ability - double wall like pheonix  3rd ability - Concussion like breach maybe  Ultimate - light charge weapon shit like chamber
Jett ; Finally , a real opponent  Neon = Jett v2 ( Rework )
Now I can play apex in valorant lmao
FILIPINA JINX
This animation looks straight up fan made...
PINOY PRIDE BABY
Can’t wait
Great now I can rush and die on site even faster!!!!
Valorant : * did some thing about cinematic * Cypher before action : greeting where am i gonna die tho?
Money out
tipico omen rata con odin XD
0:37 SAME NEON " HAYYY BUHAYYY!!! "
everyone: patch run n gun literally riot:
​2:21 ngl kinda sad sage says 'its.. beautiful' instead of the iconic WANdaful
My life will be complete if they gave her a voiceline going "REBIBE ME JETT!"
NO cypher harmed in making of this trailer xD
💀💀💀
Angas putik kaso wala akong pc o laptop HAHAHAHA
A speedster I see
good job I can't wait to play her after this trailer and ARE THOSE THE NEW USAIN BOLT SHOWS
SHE HAS A WALIS TAMBO IN HER ROOM AHAHAHAH
I've been imaging that double wall for a long time it finally came true
Is that a power slide im seeing? Is that a Moses wall im seing?? Charge  me an extra $20 for those skin bundles please.
new main👀
This is broken
mano vai toma no cu eu vou jogar ranked vai ter que enfrentar o pb correndo, o warzone atirando pqp vai toma no cu
WTF IS THIS?
man i feel bad for yoru kmao
this character already needs a nerf
fortnite slide? adding web-shooters next 100%
she is initiator i guess   she has a concuss  a sprinting ability  a wall and  her ult is a gun
the double wall makes phoenix so intimidating LMAO
This character will not be fun to face...
paladins 3 kekw
Zeri?!
wtff'
mommy?
Kay/O still the strongest tho 🗿
Is the best agent
Precise gunplay
Serious question: Does anyone even still plays valorant?
Pinoy representation is finally here and she's GORGEOUS!!! The Basketball Jerseys, the aspin with the bangka on the beach, the walis tambo, the academic medals on the wall, and the bamboo furniture... They absolutely scream Pilipino! They nailed her room, and I LOVE her design! Can't wait to insta lock her and get cursed at by my teammates :D
feels like a "fun to play but not high elo" character
Why riot games promoting run n gun
She's giving Azula from Avatar the Last Airbender and I MUST main her
AYO LET'S GOO
Im dissapointed
ah yes another agent to simp on, goodbye viper- i don’t want to play with you anymore 😎
WAYTOODANK
This is VALORANT finally embracing that it’s just a Run and Gun Simulator 😂
Neon release, Jett main died, Vandal died, Phantom supremacy <3
ultimate skill : GODSPEED
An agent with piccolos beam canon Wait I thought sage loved Sova but now she simpin neon
TIME TO PLAY VALORANT AGAIN
This is so cool cant wzit
Yay another Jett definitely what we wanted :))))))
wooow
Is league and valorant sharing the same character?
LETS GO LETS GO LETS GO TUTORIALS SOON
I can already predict this character will be a cancer in spike rush
THE FLASH
I can see all the Jett and Phoenix main retiring from their role to master Neon.
Is she in the game rn or next season
she looks insane
wtf are u flash?
oh wow
call of duty.
daam she is cute
Neon release, Jett main died, Vandal died, Phantom supremacy <3
Sage being the best mommy as usual
cikis tarihi ne zaman acaba
PROUD PINOY LMAO
I was gonna complain about the low FPS on this trailer but then again this agent is from SEA so its just being realistic :))
New main
Riot trailers are always so sick
THIS TRAILER IS CRAZY
ylonaaaaa
does she fart?
Goddamnnn 💙🇵🇭
Hay buhay indeed

I THINK IM IN LOVE
Nah bruh they Gotta nerf judge now 💀 imagine using neon sprinting and sliding to get kills using judge hell naa 😭 n
broken agent
bro she's so cool and pretty, her powers are DOPEEE!!! well done Valorant
i respect that Gilas Pilipinas Jersey. 1:13
Riot: we need to stop Jett. Also Riot: lets Destroy Phoenix, Chamber, sage and create a partner for Jett in ALL matches.
Is this agent gonna be imbalance?
I didn't know she was a Filipina until she renovate the room.
Finally a Philippino agent
Why do I feel like she's gonna push into a site and end up getting caught in the Cypher's trap then die
broken champ, riot needs to remove this champ
Woahhhhh im really mindblown by this
But where is her pridgider? Does that toothbrush have Colgate? And I need to inspect her bathroom for a pale and bucket to make sure she's truly Pinoy.  In all seriousness, she looks fantastic!
Neon main btw
poggers :)
New definition of Tactical shooter 😂😂
So much animation for a champion O_o okay. But why can’t the new league champion who looks so similar can’t look like this? This here looks better the hairstyle and she looks more adult than the league splash art. (And don’t fool us Riot these too are almost the same character)
OKAY NEW MAIN BABY YES
NEW AGENTT LESGOO
Wow
Finally we can entry b site on split without using sage wall
Apex legends?
She is solid
Found 4 ability + sprinting skill 1) Blinding (before death) 2) Charge clouds  3) Double (viper like) visible barrier 4) Electric shock
balanced
Tactical shooter
Seams overpowered af
She my new main.
THIS AGENT IS SO FUCKING SICK HOLY SHIT!!! :D
YAY APEX CROSSOVER
Fuckersss work on valorant mobile... taking decades to release
Oh so she's pinay. Love it!
The era of run and shoot has come🤩🤩
The first ability runs like lightning, the second ability throws a stun grenade, the third ability 2-way neon wall, The last ability strikes lightning towards the enemy
This is my Maine

seems trash asf
Me who plays apex: Finally, I can play Valorant too now.
This is sick riot I love you for this
I'm a noob of valorant
She looks fun to play. But I'm on low sense and I can already see me trying to flick to her during her slide and running out of mousepad space 😂
Guess i'm maining neon... bye jett...
bawal ang BASTOS!
THIS IS SO SICK
kerennnn banget anjir karakternya
Expectations: Sage revives Neon then places a wall to block a Raze ult  Reality: Sage revives Neon and dies while still reviving
Valorant is growing!!

Electro: I am full of electricity, no one can reach me. Neon: Hold my beer.

Fat copy from overwatch lmfao
Wow, this agent looks so cool
Of course she sings. Looking forward for the potang ina voiceline.
Disrupção aparecendo como 3 palavra 💛💚 🇧🇷

Ok so..   Super fast Phoenix wall Zappy finger  Balanced agent moment
Nah you telling me this agent can run n gun with low recoil? 💀
This agent looks way more badass than any other LoL hero. And the song sick too,
nice
god i love how Riot's trailer never disappoint us.  *still feel bad for Cypher though.*
This is just an Anime Character!🔥
run and gun to the next level lets go valorant
Fk riottt
Beautiful animation, beautiful trailer.. That's gorgeous
is she voiced by Ylona?
Okay what??
She's speaking tagalog?
What in the CoD did I just watch
i was shook from the tagalog
0:42 ... I would actually pay for a phone like this, where you can toggle the front cameras in or out.
literally made viper useless with a single button click 1:19
IM PLAYING VALORANT NOW
way too oop! found myself a new main
my nova main
Aspin Gun Buddy when?
Cancer
I thought this was apex
ok ok this game is broken
Eyy 🇵🇭 getting some representation
yes that's it, just need a THOR OR IRONMAN - maybe.
Wooo Pilipino pride HAHAHA
watch her be loud as hell
Whatsap mga pinoy
we got run and gun specialist
KAY/O mains: *no.*
Sage is such a mom
KHE?
I think marshal got an update Or what is that sniper rifle she's using at that double wall?
looking forward
HAY BUHAY
Neon's energy is aaaaaawwwwwwwwwww 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ylona Garcia on her wall 🤘🏻🔥
Tracer 2.0
1:20  Phoenix : “wtf ??????? not cool riot im already down bad”
ta ok lançam um boneco que faz tudo e a porra do yoru so da tp legal :)(
Zamn she's 12
Her ult will be so OP.. You don't even have to aim perfectly to hit the enemy
Neon and spectre the perfect duo
Spectre .... Run ....Spray .....Repeat 🔄
Wow Ylona Garcia!
Community: pls nerf run and gun Devs: new character can run n gun, slide n gun, shoot fucking lightning out her fingers
ye to bijli maarti hai
So valorna is just overwatch now
RUSH B VALORANT EDITION 0:52
I will destroy valorant with this agent
Am I the only one who remembers how awesome was Yoru's trailer and how much he actually sucks? :>
but is a neon dualist ?
nerf
lit
Ok I think I am too addicted to this game already, why  do this to me Riot :)
YOO
this champion + specter = ggwp go next
FILIPINO PRIIIIIDE
Please make a VALORANT tv series like ARCANE!
the agent we didn’t know we needed.
From day1 I have never played Jett and I regret it till day cuz she is superb agility , finally my comeback time. ♥️♥️♥️ Love 😻❣️❣️ you valorant , love you neon
Coolest agent trailer goes to!!
she cute  new main
Finally i can take my iron 2 run and gun plays to the next level, Thanks Riot!
Plot 🌚
yay another agent u cant hit because she out gun and runs you!!!
Not edgy enough
They made ferrari peek an agent
Why her ult is like deku
Oh god not another speed based agent
Well were playing Fortnite now imagine now using shotguns with that agent
Epico riot
Her saying "Hay, buhay" is such a mood
lazy riot games brings the same champ in league and in valorant
its gonna be interesting to see how she could be usefull
SHEESH
so an octane, with basic apex movement, ult thats an Echo beam, and better phoenix c, with some other ability aswell?
I can smell the Neon mains running in with a spectre. Im terrified
killua was my fav anime character, same ability ..  this champ fits me
Balanced
LETS GOOOO
This looks great.. but please.. do not turn this game into Overwatch. There are already too many things that stun/slow you in the game and the run and gun aspect already looks like it could be pretty tilting for the player to die to. I love this being a shooter with a bit of flair, not an all-out s**t-show like Overwatch became..
Why does Zeri and Neon look so similar , both are electric, both have the same hair
neon: creates double wall phoenix: ... am i a joke to you?
the filipino rep in this trailer >>>
Pinoy na pinoy. Tangina ambaduy hahahaha.
oh my lord, judge users ffs, New meta.
It's BEATIFULL 🤩
Crazy fuck in Love
Run n Gun, here we go baby ❤️
I LOVE HER damn let's go play Valorant now
I hope the new agent's power is the key to Philippines's electricity problem :P
2 phoenix walls
damn boooi she hot
I love it 😁
SHESHHHH FINALLY THEY LISTENED TO US AND PUT IN SLIDE CANCELLING. In all honesty, i love seeing representation of all cultures. That's a W
neon: ai buhay me, pinoy boy: *could this be one of my people?*
The broom in the background at the end that every filipina mom has multiple of 💀💀💀
Riot has given up on run n gun. They started supporting it!! 😂
hay buhay is such a filipino mood
she takes precise gunplay to a whole another level
that dumpy
Yooo adding apex legends into valorant might make it an actually fun game. Gonna try it out
she kinda bad tho
So this is the new call of duty ? I see I see
The Tenorio #5 Jersey for philippines 🇵🇭 I like the reference
When valoeant meets overwatch and call of duty:
how long it will be released??
Hell yeaahh another character to use wirh judgee
people who cant aim on run and gun people or those who complain and hate it braise themselves. The zoomers are back to make fun at your aim again but this time its intended
seems kinda broken, ngl
Natagpaun kita Run and Gun
just a few Tagalog translations here 0:37 : ahh Life 1:46 : I am in control(of this), I am In control(of this), I am in CONTROL(of this)
SAY BYE BYE FOR JETT OP PLAYERS ?
Passive to maintain accuracy even at run and gun I guess? Wall that cover both sides but slim? good trade for me. bouncing concuss too op at first glance and ULT that have both damage and slow? daaamn!! Glad its a Pinay
we still got chamber and sage to slow this sonic down....hope so
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS!!! RUN N GUN!!!! Bruh jett and neon can just run and dash in with walls and smoke to create so much space
Finally apex legends
This is my type of agent i really like shooting while sprinting
Is she the Imperator of Star Wars? Why tf is she shooting lightning through her hands.
What? Zeri from League of Legends? What are you doing here?
I'm sorry yoru.i think I have a new main
Run n gun goes brrrrr
ang cuteee
Lol the broom issa mood
Welcome my new main
PLAYİNG OVERWATCH
I think Riot erased the term "balanced" from their dictionary
I wonder how Neon player can run and gun in this game (especially with a stinger), all the bullet will fly into heaven or ground lol
Finally a Filipino agent
yay
"To be clear, in Project A, shooting matters. You don’t kill with abilities. Abilities create tactical opportunities to take the right shot. Characters have abilities that augment their gunplay, instead of fighting directly with their abilities."
BRO NO WAY SHES FROM WHERE IM FROM AAAAAAAAAAAA
слава богу она не негр
Spoiler sage lose the race
New valorant motto: Precise Run and Gunplay
the ferrari peaks are going to be insane on this agent 😂
<3
0:40  No Manila-born person would ever be caught wearing shoes while on a bed  gg fake Filipino
finally better than viper and omen 😏
1.19 U think ultimate is it
pls give me name of this song
This is the: GOODBY PHOENIX's WALL BUTTON!
Riot: we won't be making new duelists for some time *realeses chamber* alright that will be enough for now
As sage got control here did something happen to brimmy boy?🤔🤔
Old agents: montage of gameplays New agents: fully animated Latest agent: _THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS_
Yooooo chills on the "CONTROLADO KO 'TO" part oh my god
this is amazing!!!
So she's the same concept as Zeri of League? Is this going to be a trend where they release similar champ for both games
OH MY FUCKING GOD.
AAAA PERO COMO QUE DISPARAR CORRIENDO...  Lo voy a tomar, pero me ofende muchísimo :(
Good music :3
I assume she would be jett's rival
Laban NEON! PUSO!!
This is so SICK
zeri = neon
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Finally an agent that you can have a chance of popping off with then you rush in to throw the round.😂
That's so cool..
sinto que estamos fodidos...
nicer jett?:D
noiceeeee
Run and Gun? Auto aim Ray ulti? Wtf
Killua looks pretty good!
She sprint, she attack, but moqt importantly she entertain me ! ( And fucks my RR)
I hope the double walls is actually one of her skills. It would be so damn useful. Kinda hoped they used Ruby Ibarra's Us though but Ylona's music is actually good.
Oh my god already neeed nerfff
e
NOT THE RUN AND GUN CLIP
Her ultimate is like that of warlock's stormcaller from destiny 2 which is very cool, can't wait to unlock her <3
pew pew
there r gonna be alot of whiffing and jarso and protatomonster will be rich by showing this content
i was jus telling myself that i would play thi game more if it had more movement charachters
I find it funny Valorant is coming out with Spark the same time LoL is coming out with Zeri (The Spark of Zaun). Someone overheard "let's make a lightning character" and said "WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!"
this will be the best agent
so run & gun is real now.. does she have line like " putang ina bobo" ?? hahahhaa
Swagapinos….rise 🇵🇭😜☝️
Before was some Leauge player getting CSGO-ed now its CSGO player getting Apex legend-ed Edit:specially Octane mains
Nice, a filipino agent. Ironic that she's electricity based with all the blackouts going on in the country...wait a minute.  I guess this explains all the blackouts happening in the country, it all went to Neon. JK.  edit: also, I guess this is the first Agent/Champion released in both lol and valorant, different names but both have the same look and theme.
me fui
she is so adorable
AAAAA YLONA GARCIA YASSS!! 🔥🤍
She's playing overwatch while everyone else is playing cs
Nice Agent to promote precise gunplay
Porfect
I like when riot make a powerful,  innovative,  lore full, agent like chamber, yoru, kayo...they give us hints from 4 month then teaser then trailer.....and when they make copy, useless, non innovative,  mixer of multiple previous agents..example:skye...  they drop trailer with gameplay instantly ..and neon is one of them
WOW
I wish Ylona Garcia the one whos singing is also the voice actor of this agent because they look kinda the same too lol
CRYINGGG 😭😭 RELATIONSHIP WITH JETT IS OVER HELLO NEON
WOOOOO
slide like subzero
my new main watafak???!! broken
Female Filipino Octane in a nutshell. Minus the Jump pad and the stun thingy
poor Phoenix maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan 😭😭😭😭 I love her tho, and the whole trailer
yay thank you valorant another op character
يادين امي علي الجمال
No hindi title? Riot ?
Joline Kujo? Oh, no, just neon
Zeri and Spark the same person?
Killjoy's project's power source is here
Jett and Neon and the movement demons and I’m all about it
NEW MAIN
i love her
cant believe you can play apex and quake in valorant
❤️❤️❤️
taking "run and gun" to a whole new level
me likey !
100% getting nerfed shes so op
did she just said "hay buhay" ????
Poor cypher, can't catch a break
Trailer song is a bop 🔥🔥🔥
It's beautiful
Chamber >
Türkçe en basta lannn
these guys just don't know how to balance the game
Did Riot trying to kill VALORANT at this point? I think they are.
thank you valorant
totally not cancer
i already know this is going to be unbearable to be against. lol.
valorant and riot just embracing the whole run and gun precise gunplay meme mow huh.
basically pikachu
Damn she might be able to compete with viper thicccness bois im i right :)))
"haayy buhay."  neon being a mood
finally a character can run and gun  tks titanfall and call of duty for the ideal
Hay buhay
WHAT
finally an absolutely broken agent
Ninja?
I'm so confused. I thought I was watching the trailer for the new League Champion. Fuck. How do I keep getting here?
the game is on its way to being overwatch 2
Riot: Run n gun removed😀👍 Riot again: Fast run n gun agent😅
Ahh when will riot bring in more useful agents
Philippine agent🇵🇭🔥
Wait… is she filipino?????? 😱😱
why all time riot make us suprise i love with this aget=nt'
damnnnnn boyyyy
New fav
OY VOLTA BAT NASA VALORANT KANA?
Sonic with Run n Gun, dual Blue Viper wall and Echo's beam as ult 😯
Looks like a Skilled Ultimate Ability like Symmetra Ability from Overwatch
YAAS YLONA GARCIA FINALLY GETTING THE RECOGNITION SHE DESERVES 😍🔥
As a spectre main is this champ made for me?
Boia
Wat the frack is this agent🤪
so for her abilities, i think its a molly, double walls like phoenix's fire wall, a running ability that allows accurate run n gun and some shock discharge ult that is shown towards the end, something like jett's ult.....any other opinions?
cancer run and gun
how long before she gets nerfed😂
this agent is broken
PILIPINAS!!!!!!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
she looks like she has apex legends/ titanfall movement with those slides
yoru+phoenix=
PINOY PRIDE 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
time to go fast as fck boi
octane in valorant lol
This is good tho,but her theme song is not good as chamber one honestly(opinion)
OMG CHILLLSSSSS
Spark nerf
her kit is amazing af. her voice is cringe asf.
kinda mid if you ask me
i want see the abilitis
"Kontrolado ko to, KONTROLADO KO TO!"   Me when she says, "wag muna" in bed.
mommy? sorry.
riot going hard with new agents
God?
Run and gun 🤣
future of run and gun
Мне действительно хватает агентов, но не хватает другого контента. Я бы хотел ранговый режим 2х2, дм только с пистолетами, больше разнообразия в магазине и боевом пропуске, новые режимы. Я понимаю, что за это отвечают разные отделы, но это не важно в конечном итоге.
Phoenix wall is sadly a joke now
imagine XANTARES peeks with her
finally an agent who can replace jett as my main
No one will ever pick phoenix ever again.
É a patinas?
Abilities. 1. Run faster 2. Can slow player (Like beach ULT) 3. Two line smoke  4. Run and shock enemy with her ULT
Please tell me that laser doesn't auto target. We really don't need Symmetra in this game.
im having COD flashbacks- this is not oki doki
Shot gun op
Her palpatine ult doesn't look very good tbh, still awesome though
THICC
Man this is so sick. Loved the trailer, can't wait to play Neon.
So neon is a Filipino.
I swear to god if she can slide under cypher wires
I already love her, also her listening to ylona is Iconic
I wonder is they are gonna keep basing leagues and valorant characters off each other
Surely that wall has got to have a reduced time, that shizz looks broken
riot: abilities don't kill and precise gunplay also riot: making neon who runs and kills with her abilities
Lex is that you?
Aka the Filipino Flash lol
1:13 This triangle will affect the story that will come out.
ye ok good to know u guys, im leaving this game, peace
They really put an effort to capture the Filipino culture on this agent.  Singing, Love for Basketball and Cleaning/ Redecorating the room pinoy style.  The only thing I wonder is why is there a Walis Tambo if she already has a vacuum cleaner hahaha
This thriller looks like Harry Potter's fight with Lord Voldemort
Oras na para pumunta sa rule34
Call of Duty 2.0
I'm so glad they didn't white wash neon
looks op
Finally a agent that I could run and shoot peoples head while running like every single enemy in my rounds
what the fuck is this sprint animation xddddddddddddddddd
Is it Duelist ?😕🔥
Sooooo sick. Those two fire flame walls  can really come in handy. Her vs jet.... who would win?
nerf neon imo
hay, buhay 😮‍💨
OMG SHES FILIPINO 🥺 I LOVE YOU RIOT
Ylona Garcia 💙
wtf did i just watched
winston auto for ult nice
This aint run and gun, this is slide and die
whos voice actor ??
üfffff mainledim net :D
Where's Cypher, man!
we NEED a valorant tv series
ito yung pinoy comment na youre looking for
oficialmente no volveré a jugar valorant.
WINSTON AIM
Finally the slide tap strafe wall bounce training i did in apex can pay of
THIS IS SO FRICKING COOOOLLLL OMGGGGG
QUE QUE ISSO
WAO
im glad riot still follows their same method of releasing insanely overloaded champions that do way too much with no drawback in valorant too :)
YOOOOOO FINALLY PHILLIPPINES ARE GETTING THE RECOGNITION WE DESERVE IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY HOLY!!
0:53 . INSERT MEME HERE
Rule 34 incoming
they designed this Agent after all the employees that they sexually harassed.
OP
nah bro im about to get runned and gunned by a lighting bolt
How many times have I watched this? You need not know the answer. I haven't played Valorant in a while but I feel like getting back into it because of this omg
As a cod player i can definitly use her slide ability
can't wait to *RUN* it down it multiple riot games this year!
Basically:  - Electricity flame duo walls (similar to a race track) - Sprint ability that has a passive slide mechanic - A concussion molly that will most likely activate when thrown against a wall (?) - Ultimate that shoots a mid-long range straight bolt similar to Symmetra’s auto attack
jet still more op
Its looks like mix of phoenix and jett to me
Run and gun bro finally I can have a main xddd
Looks like new jett
ok a apex character in wrong game
YOOOOO
Vai ter patinete até o inferno agora kkkkk
damn
The Philippines 🇵🇭 getting represented out here
Yes finally Run N Gun 110%
give us a netflix series of valorant already please
Tactical Shooter 🥵
haven't made my heartpound since killjoy trailer  but this this made feel that joy again
She looks like she's the youngest agent in Valorant lore
She looks so cool and fun! Can't wait to play her!!
is she broken?
Tracer 2.0
Finally I can play zeri from lol in valorant
the double wall is insane
Dev: How many entry abilities do you wanna give her? Riot: Yes
SHEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH
her hairstyle sucks, ngl
So cool
Another tryhard hero every jett main will play for the next month when it comes out. She does look interesting though.
filipinos unite
Awesome, I like how they incorporated that she likes to sing, which is a 100% Filipino thing to do when you're alone or bored.
Didn't know Zeri from League of Legends had a sister and they would be released at the same day... Oh well
So cooooollll!!
looks crazy
YLONA GARCIA??? MY HEART IS BOOMING
Pheonix and his walls: Do I look like some kind of fookin joke to you bruv
it felt like she is jett, viper and kayo at the same time lol
so .. How many abilities has she got? 15 ??
sick
Jett mains shaking rn
literally the walking scooter, very nice
Wow
Riot after watching Flash
new main... maybe
From what I see she is basically the octane of valorant
cool
Hyperfront : hmmm interesting too 🙃
YASSSS YLONA GARCIA SINGING POP OFF ❤️
neon: running  cypher: caught you.
Seus Doentes
OH EM GEE
yikes
can riot possibly hate phoenix anymore lmfao
RIP my wrist trying to track this agent running around a corner at Mach 5
Here before an hour of release!
Looks like my new main!
This game is slowly transitioning to overwatch 2
Run n gun, yes sirrrrrr
Bu çar çok öp lan
That Run n Gun tho
I fall in love, the character, song ....ufff
I can tell she's gonna be a strong pick
pleease buff omen
octane....
Bad game please stop
My inner octain main is tingling
She feels like an agent I can finally call my "main"
1:17 idk why but this feels like a jojo scene
WOOOOOOOW
Did she just said hay buhay?
Fucking apex legends dude
ATE CHAMBER'S TRAILER DOWN?!?!?!?
Oh look, an agent who can run and gun now without any firing error. Cool!
TACTICAL SHOOTER XDDD
precise gunplay and then makes an agent that is shown run and gunning with bulldog
Literally love it
Jett + yoru + breach + sova
Shitting bricks as a sentinal player rn but she looks so fun...
she kinda bad tho
How about new guns or we can buy skin for agents
Hay buhay word of the day HAHAHAHA
Yeah it's time to move on.
Oh god no
finally someone who loves sage as much as I do
OH GOD VALORANT YOU FUKED UP
So basically Sonic. Nice job Valorant.
*_sheeeeeee's amazing!_*
She's probably the most unstable agent due to the nature of her lightning in VP  -possibly because it accumilates over time and she can only hold a certain threshold and needs to release the excess or else she would  probably explode(kinda reminds me of One for all in My hero academia) -her powers awakened recently
octane
oh wow i didnt realize how soon i found this. love the character design... but run and gunning in a tac shooter? guess ill see what she's like to play.
brutallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Looks already op, but could surely be countered by Kay/0
That 0:37 - 0:39, I KNEW IT! HAHAHAHAHA. PHILIPPINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🇵🇭💪
Wtf what happened to neon fingers, she seems to be an expert in a finger sport.
Everytime valorant uploads a video a cypher dies together we can stop this
Does anyone know what the words echoing in the background are? Right about 1:44
Only wow
Imagine using Spectre with Neon lmao😂
I wait yoru baff
RNG is legal now     Thanks Valorant
Is she connected to the new league champ?
cant wait to Palpatine hands people in Valorant
nerf ya xd
Run n Gun looking extra devious as of her release.
Bruhhhh ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Neon is When Yoru and Jett have a secret child!!!!!!!
I believe in Neon supermacy.
Lookslike she stinks doesn’t shower
już widzę te walki społecznościowe o to która postać lepsza : Jett czy Spark
This is different game same character realize? Is literally zeri
What a good song choice, another one to add to the "I probably shouldn't be listening to music while playing but I'm gonna do it anyway" playlist
Ahh  shit there  we go again
Run and gun ???? Wtf riot
LEZZZGOOOOOO
Riot put Zeri from LOL in here thinking we wouldn’t know the difference
cool
THIS IS HYPE
Average tondo snatcher became a valorant agent!!
I think we will play COD now ??
Riot: lets release the same character for league and valorant at the same time what could go wrong?
First hour ticket
Why does the fps feel so low for this
OK
Zeri’s twin????
confusion
Ok, thanks for add octane to valorant
Hyped asf, she actually looks fun to play and her design is cool aswell
Ai ai, Sage e suas amiguinha, nmrl ela ta dms o desing e as abilidades, uma nova versão da jett, nivel reyna? Ta dms sério
The run and gun is real
This wont be good for Jets ego . .
so ylona is canon in valorant universe now eh?
FINGER GUN
Я ЖДАЛ!!!
Run and gun has reached its limit
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
we can finally slide and shoot
praying she doesnt get instalocked in the first centasecond of the game starting so i can try her
i love thath
Overwatch is You? O sorry wrong Game
Hay buhay nga ba naman...
vai ca lon
Also when is the Sri Lankan agent coming around? huh... Valorant..?
Wooow me muero de ganas de jugar
I dont know WTF I m watching but the music is good.
shes so fast that it looks like she moves in 24fps
It will literally be like I echo overwatch that steals abilities and some tracer characteristics, that doesn't bother me anyway, what bothers me is that practically with that new character you can kill running, you can crouch and run, that character will ruin the game xD
Zeri is pretty cool yeah.
This trailer was nuts, well done!
finally a filipina character let's go
Sage: Race you there? 😊 Neon: 😊 Sage: (Makes a wall) 😋 Neon: 😡
uh oh. spectre time.
Man the animation on these trailers are getting better and better
Now that I think about it, do Riot have a thing for colorful hair girls all of a sudden?
looks like a cod agent
ph pride
Dang riot did it again
Ded game
I can't wait to main this agent. I didn't really like chamber(cause I suck with the op)
ehh wtf
Every shit in this trailer represent a classic filipina. Singing using your toothbrush? yeah it's common here. And I bet she's gonna get a nickname "Meralco"
Riot just released two electric pigtailed characters in two different games.
she seems like she'd be really fun to play.
Idk man, Neon's in game design looks... Eh...
gg
Name of the song
WOOOOOW! amazing!
É o patinete né cara
holy fuck
Hyoe
This shit looks fire no lie
This agent is about to be a huge dub!!!
Skill: Q is run with speed boost. W is electric dart (stun or concussion)  E is 2 fire walls.  Ultimate is laser fingers.
BRO WHY SHE GET TWO PHOENIX WALLS THIS UNFAIR
THE ULT IS A SITH LORD
hey riot foreshowing is not good man her back look like the player of current battle pass
Oh hell no.. players be buying spectre and killing everyone in 30 seconds
Remember PRECISE GUNPLAY
She looks like if Tracer from Overwatch and Wattson from Apex had a baby. Makes me want to try this game out
"hay buhay" aghhhhhhh gandaaaa
She just run and gunned with a bulldog
finally jet true rival
"hay buhay" cant wait to try her out! she looks so cool sddhfdhshf
The run and gun 😭
Run and gun main
aaaaaaaaaaaa
Cant wait for rule 34
Hayy buhay nga naman
So she can Res herself.. 🥴
I see riot carried my frame rate over from in-game
INSTALOCK TIME
Thats not bull dog valorant 0:54 or i am wrong
flash?
Khatam ab neon main
The rebibe me jett meme 💀
Nganu mana naay silhig sa sulod sa balay itawun
She seems annyoing!
ah yes the run n gun agent!
Hype ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Pinoy Pride❤️❤️❤️
Welcome to Valorant Tracer.
I’m i the only one or did she look alike the new League champion Riot gonna realease :))
Gosh she has a Tagalog line "kontrolado ko to, kontrolado ko to!"
Neon’s abilities broken down:  1. Gotta 2. Go 3. Fast
that dub is cringe tho ahahahah
I'm turning into a Neon otp
Looks cool can't wait to try
abi bu chidori yapıyo
Can we just appreciate riots work and all the creativity that goes into their trailers and cinemas. Got a whole music video and beautiful animation along with an agent reveal
why is it in 30fps :(
OMG IM SO PROUD A FILIPNA CHARACTER IS ON A POPULAR GAME!! REPRESENT 🇵🇭🇵🇭
0:31 SKIP AD
SHE GOT SKETCHERS
Fantastic, Beautiful, Cool!
A whole new level of run and gun incoming
Tactical shooter moment 0:52
OMGGGGGG WTF IS THAT ??????
💙
Is Neon Sage's little sister ?? Just wondering cause from the trailer Neon seemed to respect Sage more. Oh and does Neon admire Phoenix or does she like him????
looks an awful lot like the coming league champion Zeri. Anyone else?
entertain meeeeeee awwwwwww
눈나아ㅏㅏ
Literally Run and Gun your way to victory just like a true Filipino
The art and animation designer are so good
Nice
Accent wow!!!
F Valorant 2020 / 2022
Neon with a spectre must be a nightmare
"haayyy buhayyy"
I LOVE HER ALREADY
Kinda gives sonic vibes
MAAAAAAAAN
I can finally brainlessly push and have a reason too
*lupang hinirang intensifies*
bro she just shat on phoenix's fire wall wtf
I officially became a coomer
yoww
neon looks broken, like the cypher camera
Running AND sliding?! This really is Apex Legends!
Her Ult is literally Aimbot with legs           Cool agent tho
i feel like this agent is gonna be a better version of pheonix, like a jack of all trades
I want to play precise gunplay with her speed
dalgamı geçiyorsun cnm
damnnnn that's my type
filipino agent nice
E: dash like jett Q: phoenix + sage wall C: kayo grenade ult: hand gun
Please release a valorant movie man these cinematics are amazing
Her skills: -Stun thingy the thing she throws and forms a blue circle -the double wall  -the speed buff: with passive slide when crouching and moving to a direction  -ult the lightning beam thingy with ability to chain the damage to nearby enemies
Amazing
finally i can gun and slide
jett dead fsfs
Waiting for rule34
Uwaw 🤤🤤

Looks promising.🔥

😻😻😻
00:38 me whenever I wake up
Rip phoenix
Finally I can main a new character and believe I'll do well, while all the others I failed with
Omg she said "kontrolado koto"
Shoes on the bed? You want nanay and lola to palo you with tsinelas?
she is such a badass
I can see the nerf already 😂
I cannot wait for all of the run and gun tactical shooter clips I'm going to see in my recommended for the next month.
I need that fucking song. Where my Filipino brothers at 🇵🇭🔥
Yoo less gooo.....!!!
she is a my main
IDK Why but I'm Getting Killjoy and Astra Vibes lol
1:02 once again my boi Cypher got killed in other agent trailer
Ofcourse she can sing. 😤
AMAZING addition that's what's missing a yuro + jett agent DOPE
ok nice
What a banger
NERF
valorant is not a tactical shooter anymore
"Wanna fly, compadre? Let's fly."
corny af trailer
I can see Ylona's single will be popular because of this.  Kudos to riot for the accurate filipino accent there. What a goddamn good trailer! 💯
Ain't no way she got that much accuracy while running
op then jett
That *Hay buhay* HAHA
SOOOOOOOOOOO FREAKING PRETTY
I want know Last skill
SHE'S SO GOOD 😭
Uff that double wall was lit 🔥
might as well remove phantom or vandal recoil to be able to counter that agent. You guys embracing the run and gun now that even the Dev had to run and gun using a bulldog lol with the agent.
THE RUN AND GUN, THE RUN ADN BEAM, ITS BEAUTIFUL RIOT
the fuck is this
This is literally an agent made for cod players...
raze and jett mains are gonna love her
Killua, but female
Dang she beaten viper for being thiccest
Seni asla unutmayacağız jett
Kennen?? Pikachu???
Can’t wait for Run and gunners to instalock her
the production budget has suffered a lot ig.
NOW ITS RUN N GUB TIME.....
Sage, heal me pisti yawa

blue pikachu
Where does she from?

her, jett and raze are the best agents now to use the judge with
Bro wtf......is this valorant?
I LOVE any electric based powers so this seems super up my alley
Gimme
sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
There's so many Filipino reference. I love it 🤩
i like this valorant x apex legends collab
Precise gunplay they said, abilities aren’t weapons they said.
Anyone know how fast she is? She fast as fuss boi
era arreglar el run and gun no hacerlo canon hijos de...
She is a combat stim beacon LoL in spike rush
Was expecting an electric base agent sooner or later, similar to how Phoenix is fire based and Jett is wind based. I wonder if we're going to get water or earth based ones soon.
YOO IS SHE A FILIPINO? NOICE
No way they actually used Ylona’s song!!!!
que hypeee Valorrraaaaaaaaaaant Nice video <3.
new main
Jinx changed her image... again XD
Why do I have a feeling she is Jett 2.0?
Turn up the Lights, it's NEON TIME!
"Tactical Shooter"
erro 43
Fortnite
hopefully she doesn’t ruin the game she seems cool though
So fun!
"Hay..buhay.." feels right there
Sheeesh gave me some chillssss men
Hay, buhay = Ahh, life (like in a tired, fed up tone) Kontrolado ko 'to, kontrolado ko 'to =  I can control it, I can control it
bro. that the fuck
The double wall!! OMG
who needs overwatch now?
slide, double wall, floor stun that bounces off walls, lazer beam hand gun (ult)
Seni asla unutmayacağız jett
siii cada dia menos táctical shooter
She is literally the best duelist she has a double phoenix wall and unique abilities
Ok Spectre players you win this time...
Apex legends but it's Valorant
Killua ult
This game is slowly turning into overwatch
If neon is attacking it is more difficult to defend
She is like if jett phoenix and KAYO had a baby
PINOY PRIDE 🤩🤩🤩
so did they just put a leaue champ in valourant? or a valourant agaent in league
This looks sick! Can't wait for the release!
Okay but imagine prod on neon tho
Pls riot we want a something like arcane but about valorant story 😢😩
Omg im living her her style, her design SHE LOOKS SO COOL
Nah keep this out of my game… this ain’t warzone bruh
am i seeing more than 4 abilities?
i love how she has a both a walis and a vacuum cleaner in her room haha i love her alr
Holy shit
PROD gotta be hyped
Broken
she is my type welcome neon😘👌
اول عربي
Finally. Another Reyna release
Best agent for PROD
other agent : focus firing and give all everything they have spark : WeEEeeEe.... WeEeeEee.....
In Project A, abilities don't-
F fps
This shit straight outta Overwatch
Prod is gonna love this agent lol.
THE PRECISE GUNPLAY AGENT LETS GOO
Bout to take running it down mid to a new meaning
Pikachu ?
If this character can slide or whatever it was and shoot accurately like she did on the ulting sova at the start I’m quitting valorant and going back to minecraft lmao
oooo, Now I can die faster.
CS PEOPLE HATE HER LOOOOOOOOL
This agent looks and designed so **** good, that it will increase the community reaction time, by trying to insta lock.
ngl the 2 walls kinda like phonix walls something like its kinda overpowered.    scary.
“AY BUHAY”  Mommy
FINALLY RUN AND GUN AGENT ❤️❤️ THANKS VALORANT.. NOW I CAN DO RNG PEACEFULLY
when she says Hayyy Buhay <3 <3
I didn't understand what's her ultimate? And is the slide an ability or a passive like jetts draft ?
Run and Gun was the first thing that came in my mind
its chiting main
What’s up with riot and electricity first zeri and now neon
Straight up AMAZING 💙❤️❤️
Agent 8?
SHEEESHHHH NEW AGENT
Need The Full song 😀
C9 KATSUMI
The double viper wall is kinda scaring me
eae
Finally, another agent to unlock and play for a week until I realize I can only play Reyna and Jett because I've gotten so used to healing and dashing away after every kill that I literally cannot play any other agent
tangina lupet.
It's not only cool that we see what her abilities are, but also how the headquaters of the VP look like Would be cool if we saw more of it in the future
philipinese baby
Players: How much Filipino you want this new agent to be? RIOT: YES!   (Riot went all out Filipino in this trailer and agent)  ^_^
Bro why's everybody in valorant so thick
Animation looks muddy and song is horrible. Cool agent tho?
she will be broken lol
Tf is this
she's out when?
ok now i have my hero episode 4 i cam back to this game
Just by seeing trailer I felt like "This is the agent....."
Ok now I'm confused what her abilities are because I feel like I saw like 5 different moves, she can run faster, she can slide, she can make fire walls, she has stun things and she can shoot at people out of her hands
Dayum boi
frames left the chat
I am so much excited 😁😊
Remember guys she’s possibly underage so don’t say anything… weird.
To be honest Im only maining this agent since they actually added my nationality to the game and lore I'm super happy.
Dude…. Holy shit
😮
Symmetra from overwatch ( real )
wtf ))))It's just trash how beautiful I can't wait))))
Who is Jett again?
Okay that’s my style
but yoru???
the music is dope!
Everyone: Damn she's run n gunning Me: Her ult is like Palpatine, "UNLIMITED POWER ! ! ! "
Damn she just holds w and kills everyone what do I know that from
stop the run and gun
lio entre sage y neon 100%
omg nerf judge or this will be painful
pilipinas
Phoenix wall but double
Speeeeeeed
FINALLY A "PRESS W" AGENT, asuna will be delighted
Ielectryciti
That's  League's new Champion Zeri Same abilities
juss nut watching this, she gon be fye but niggas still gon auto lock jett n reyna lmao
look how many abilities she got
Damnnn
love  the trailer animation but rank gonna be hard
Speedlorant
imagine all the insane clips with her
Watch her sprint and slide get nerfed to the point she just jogs and lunges
Awesome
ZAAAAMNN!!!
How long do you think she'll be live before she gets nerfed to the ground? or is there posibillity of her being balanced on launch?
What’s with the double electric characters with basically identical hairstyles? I like how they look but still.
So she got sprint n slide a stun a 2 way wall and a fricking laser beam ultimate crazy trailer but hope she is not trash in actual games
2 fire walls lololol
I really enjoyed the "stop-motion" effect, this gives a fresh and new way to see agents. This makes you eant to connect with Neon
I swear the Pinoy Pride is real... first was team secret then this!!!
Riot: we nerfed jett, now she has only 2 smokes and her ultimate doesnt recover the knives with right mouse button  Also riot: creates neon, basically a buffed jett
🔥🔥🔥
mf this octane
Oh it’s Chamber, Yoru, Jett, Phoenix And Breach all as one character
SIUU
wait is she Filipino? i saw the Philippine shirt in the back
A PETITION TO LET HIM HAVE A TAGALOG CURSE WORD VOICE LINE😭😭😭
im gay but neon is not
Run and gun is love, run and gun is life.
shittiest agent i've ever seen ty riot
she looks great omg i cant wait to play her <3
Isn't she too OP
bye bye jett. hi neon
SPEEDSTER  IN THE HOUSE!!!!!!!!😎🥳🥳
W
RE FRULA
Making want to go back to valorant from Apex huh... Octane with electricity LUL
New agent: run n' gun
Hmm Apex Legends...
That wall she made was epic
precise gunplay has left the chat. welcome to apex valorant
I think i saw run and gun, call of duty, overwatch and apex in this video.
Sage: *revives* sigh I don't get paid enough for this shit
Both Neon and Zeri are new electric-themed champions in LoL and Valorant... I like it, the speedster with electric powers is a theme I dig.  And her song is good as always.
PINOY #1 LET'S GOOOOOOO
Great! "Run and Gunning" as an agent!
so technically an agent from cod? and with an ult like a minigun seeems fun
Phoenix in the trailer......  Phoenix buff incoming?
Riot: Fixes run and gun The New Agent: Literally running and gunning in the trailer
cringe
wtf is that double wall💀💀💀💀
Basically, run n gun
35 min
Ngon
i sense another F up like Yoru
After watching this Jeet  left the chat
She looks like a mix of both  Jinx and Caitlyn
?
bin ich dumm oder hat das ding 10 abilitys
Its just apex legends
ang op tanginaaaa
she is already my favourit character
valorant making overwatch 2 before overwatch i swear to god
everyday we get closer to overwatch
Oof
she’s so fucking cool wth
Beautiful
Basically if Jett and phoenix had a child
She runs like that Arnold Schwarzenegger meme
._.
OP
Bruh
where is she from? 😲
no way
Yeni ajan ne zaman gelecek belli mi ?
Hello
bet who's gonna get tilted in game :))
"hay! buhay!" yeah same neon, same.
skill cant kill an enemy
oh no
Very different agent.
RIOT PLEASE STOP IM BEGGIN U
Sick
electric champ in lol, electric champ in valorant
Lets go 💥💥💥💥
w8 so sprinting like soldier in ow xd
IM SIMPING FOR THE VOICE!!!!!!!!
Bouta slide cancel in valorant
u guyz r really aws gg valorant team
Tactical shooter
she is basically Nora allen
MABUHAYY WOOOO
Yo why they making a run gun  agent
Everyone is neon main now
It's official, Phoenix is now redundant
Sage walling after the rez?! Neon would have immediately died
No more tactical shooter? Just run and shoot
I hope they add more details and make valorant look more realistic
ANGAS ASHBORN PINOYPRIDE
I don't even listen to Pop music, but this song is a certified BOP
This is a character for warzone players
Yoru's wife? aight
30 fps
this agent is gonna be so annoying in lower and mid ladder
Shout out to all the people that trusted me
Yooo rip Phoenix's wall 💀
Holy overpowered goodness. I can't wait to try her out!
Meu main com certeza mdss
INCROYABLE !!!!!!!
I'm definitely a simp and an instalocker for her
Damn ! It could slide fast, dual electric wall smokes, and can shoot electric to enemies dps !!!!!!!! I can't wait to play her, my kababayan
Jett 2.0
So we do be expecting the elemental power ranger from duelist now huh
Run & Gun the agent
Hay buhay
Why is she and Zeri so similar? Both play with electricity and said to be very mobile. Sincr multiverses are a real thing in Vlr I think Zeri is an easter egg that she's Neon in LoL universe
FINALLY. PRECISE GUNPLAY IS HERE
why video is on 30 fps
So basically y'all reworked Jett right?
bozuk oyunn
me parece quebrado, mas nada fora do normal na riot né
Cool
Oh god another chamber
W
I wonder if you can tap strafe with Neon cuz that would be incredibly funny ngl xD
Wtf is that 😑
Finally i can run and gun with a spectre
GYATTTTT
Bro what is this run and gun
Let's welcome The Flash from the Valorant dimension xD
now we can run and gun .. iron to radiant yazzz
lol
Ah yes, A Agent From my Country PH
bullshit
Did I hear it right that she said "hay buhay"??  Nvm, now im sure she speaks tagalog lmao
เริ่ม overwatch เข้าเรื่อยๆ 555555
i can not CONTAIN MY FUCKING EXCITEMENT.
I doubt that she can take jett's place after seeing her ult. But her smoke wall and slides seems better
HOLY SHET! Neon Main!
Hello neon main here
I like how the cinematic also described my average valorant experience which is 20 fps
Sheesh
Kontrolado ko to
"And for Neon's Ultimate, we borrowed a weapon from Quake!"
Everyone is talking about Neon but no one is talking about how Sage walled Raze's ult and saved her. 1:49
halatang pinoy talaga pag may gilas yung wall decoration HAHAAHAHAHA
Damn she a fast girl huh
SHE’S SO COOOL
kinda bullshit
"Controlado ko to" i've never been so proud!! Mabuhay Philippines!
Sorry to be the hater but, this character is worse than astra in terms of fucking with the concept of a tactical fps, now me and the bois bouta run and gun and apex slide bcs Fortnite added it so riot might aswell do it too, while putting a better version of phoenix walls down and shoking mfs to deaths while strafing and holding left click. Tbh, id prefer if riot realeases reworks to brim and phoenix, omen, breach and kayo buffs AND THE GODDAMN YORU REWORK WE WERE PROMISED LIKE 5 YEARS AGO, but ye rly want to try this chracater looks cool like the vid. no cap.
Ahhh yes, "precise gunplay"
Хочу быть её унитазом
lul
The agent that screams "run and gun will always be here"
Looks epic
Yes sir finally!
1:02 Poor cypher
kontrolado ko to!!
Nerf pls
It's official  We playing COD
Get me the fuck outta this game dude. Even in the trailer she kills everyone running and shooting this game is getting ridicolous
damn an even more op viper wall
New agent: *comes out* That one guy: My new main!!!
Thicccc
Sheesh
I love her
LISTEN NOT COMPLAINING BUT WHY SHE SO THICC
Run and gun NEW meta
i have a feeling that riot ran out of ideas and started making the exact same character for two games
lakas maka main character pinoy nga siya bida bida
she is a top tier waifu
Well she's cringe a normal Filipino trait
looks like it will be OP
Nadeshot convinced them to put killua in the game lmfao 😂
Institucionalizaram o patinete fudeu
Es de bokita viejoo
So u fucks just made the same champ for lol and valorant
I love her voice its just really nice to listen to
Why does look almost the exact same as the new champ in league
I already know she's gonna be OP, just nerf her before she's even released lol
And to the races! look at all those rule 34 artist go, all rapidly breaking thier wrists in the pursuit of porn truly bootyfull!
What in the power ranger-
Wow look at that new legend. This’s gonna be coolest season of Apex legend.🤤
Jett vs Neon in a race competition 😲😲 imagine, I’m thinking Jett will have a voice line of her challenging Neon into a race
Yloga garcia in the house! Sheeesh!!!!!
I have a feeling of running and gunning
te mato corriendo el personaje
PUTANG INAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
so she has a slow, a wall that go straight and her ult can run and gun while been 100 acurrate ? wtf is this i really hope im wrong
Finally an agent that's viable for the surprise knife!
i think im in love
lezzzgooooo
Here for Sage
here within an hour
She's hot.
run and gun just like the filipino players
Being this early before sleeping geez it's 2:00 AM IN PHILIPPINES RIOT
PATINETE foi normalizado!
I think this agent will be best used as a Jett/Chamber counter if played right. Amazing work thinking of a counter to highly picked agents to disrupt the current meta!
The amount of scenes to show how thick she is lmao
SlideeEeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!??!!@@@@!@@
best character coming
Tactical Shooter. Don't get me wrong, I love this new agent, but looks more broken than Jett, haha.
We Won't Forget You, JETT ❤
I can see all the shotgun potential with this agent
Phoenix absolutely deleted after this agent launch and yoru buff
I’m so hyped for this new agent. She looks SOOOOOOO FUN
But can I tap strafe though...
Sheesh insane agent But I am within an hour 😂
WHEN!!!!???
WHAT IS THISSS
so they added Octane in a game about precise gunplay. I can see this champion being used by the likes of me a malding teenager.
Wow, this time cypher didn’t die😳
Time for precise Gun play
Already here
Yoo, I think this new agency is a mix between Phoenix, Kay/O, and Jett. very cool!
Precise gunplay sheeeeessshhhh!!!!!
It's just like... the "shoot and run" lobbyist
that wall
finally a good run and gun agent
Wait wait wait did sage really try to race wit her ??????
Gg thanks riot
riot tries to remove run and gun, also riot introduces a character which runs and guns
definitely gonna have to play this agent
Wow cypher didn't die
Idk i think her wall ability is a lil weird. Does help balance some maps tho
Bruh she is just too much wtf
0:05 she’s got some good hmm... pair of sneakers
Let's go my girl snatcher! Run and go Wild.
1:05 new map maybe
next super OP agent why
I am going to get a migraine watching prod play this agent
Riot is promoting Run and Gun
A FILIPINA AGENT WOOOOOOOO
idk not so hyped for this one,there is something wrong.
Her slide reminded me of the soap i stepped on 😌
Wtf is thisn
OMG THIS IS SO COOL
Yoooo
Yep, just Valorant taking their W's as asual
yo she have full of rng ability
The run n gun agent
Yes riot plz keep adding cute asian girls to ur video game :D (her kit is also cool)
SHESHHH
Poor yoru still such a bad agent
This agent gonna broke the game bro so op
Can’t wait to get run and gunned by a fricking lightning bolt
for the first time they animate the characters in 12 fps while everything going around em is 24/30, cool effect
que preciosaaaaaaaaaaa
Why is the video like 12 fps?
POG
cool
i dont know about the ultimate though, its more like a run and gun kind of thing with little damage, in the video headshot or bodyshot has the same damage
Labas mga pinoy!!
Some Filipino translations to English in the teaser  0:38 "Hay.. Buhay" is "Ughh.. Life" 1:38 "Kontrolado ko to" is "I can control this"
I feel like she is the embodiment of TenZ.
That double wall of hers looks fucked.
Whoa they made run n gun into an agent
yo the run n gun kill on sova tho
1:45 "I'm in control"
MABUHAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Here we goo now guys awesome agent
Portable charger goes brrrrrrrrrrrr!
zamn
Gooosebumps!!!
They fuckin embraced the run n gun
What the fuck is that Jesús christ
ich würde
Wait, is Ylona the voice actress for Neon???
Shes hella FINEEEEE
I wonder how many takes it took to get a kill run & gunning with a stinger lmao
Lets go.
Op🔥
uh oh stinky op agent

Spark? U mean Zeri? really riot u copypaste champs from lol so obvious...
Fenerbahçe kadın

Hype

We can now run and gun and call it precise gunplay.....
They really made a rng dualist 😂 , I love it.
1:20 THIS ABILITY OOOOFFF LITERALLY THE BEST ISTFG
LA Tenorio lets go
PEEEENOOIIISSEEE!!! 🇵🇭 💕😂
Fortnite valorant
Double screen wall and lightning fingertips this shits getting my excited
yes
Truly amazing. The trailer I mean.
here we go
This has the potential to be the most tilting character in the game to die for.
Oh yeah, more run and gun, is just that valorant needs
So that means judge is now Meta ? nice...
K/DA WHEN
I love that that put some Tagalog 🙏🏽
1:46, she is saying "I control this/I can control this"
Time to be a run and gun mai- I mean a Neon main!
wow i cant wait to piss people off by instalocking and bottom fragging every game
ngl i'm not impressed ....
I'm gonna be slide cancelling everyone like it's warzone
I love this agent <3333
noice been waiting
THIS LOOKS WAYYY BETTER THAN CHAMBERRR
We got our Valorant flash
Tracer x Winston
cringe trailer but she looks cool
Nearly every valorant Trailer in a nutshell: Let US Put Phoenix in
oh god oh fug
The female Flash has just entered Valorant !
BRO IMAGINE PLAYING THAT AGENT WITH THE JUDGE AND JUST SLIDE BRO... nah their promoting run and gun at its finest.
HAYY BUHAYYYY
First of all fix the f****** bug and then you give a f*** bann ?????? wtf
Finalllyyyy
I can tell you rn, nerf it.
OMYGAAAAD
Imagine PROD right now after seeing this champ =))
vals gon die
Sage: race you there? Neon: bolts out  I mean what was the sage thinking 😂
South East Asian Representative!!!
PROD's new agent
the woman on the poster behind her looks like reyna O.o
Rip my boy phoenix.
Precise gunplay Run n gun intensifies*
at this point its gonna be just another version of overwatch ._.
Will she be an initiator or duelist?
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GANDANG MORENA NAMAN
May whoever instalocks her first wins. God bless us all!
Did I hear her say “Ay, buhay”?  Is she Filipino??
Why it's like 5 fps
Is this overwatch or Valorant bruh, this ultimate seems weird but the slide and stuff I love it
At 0:05 In, you can tell she'll be an asset to any team.
Here within an hour pog
SHEEEEEEEEEESH. Check out that song guys! By Ylona Garcia. Its really good. <3
ang ganda nya putangina
gago ang bilis
yall she pinoy?
angas ay
If she goes in the water on A Breeze she better fry everybody in it or I’m gonna have to talk to riot
wow.
1:53 looks like echo from OW
Apex?
Neon is Jett with Elon Musk tech
Well my question is Where's cypher
what kind? duelist? initiator?
heal pls
Don't really like the trailer... I don't know, something feels off about it. But I really love her visual design!
Sliding while electrocuting everyone??? We need some one with rubber abilities now man
Bout to scream "putang ina" to everyone and say it's tactics
OOOOH. She’s a Jedi.
The music yeaaaah
COD X VALORANT
She looks and reminds me a lot of the new league of legends character zeri
JETT PHOENIX  PALPATINE
“Jett, rebibe me jett” voice line please
Where's that jim carrey mask gif
im going to main her when she comes out shee looks like a fun agent TvT some of my friends are coming back to valo bc of this XD
omg
ANIMAAAAAAAAAL YAAS
It's a basically copy of a apex legends character called 'octane' 🙂🙂
When does the new chapter launch?
She’s so sweet 🥺
ok
Why Riot released the same character for Valorant and LoL?
this is gonna be a balancing disaster because of the beam i think
Noice
Hmmm, it looks very balanced! Good job riot
The singer is gonna blow up !!!!
More run and gun literally
Hi
Trailer looks awesome, but i dont think that this is what Valorant needs... (Sprints, Slides, another revive mechanik...). We will see how its balanced out...
She's crazy!
i lav et
Sage: Race you there?  Neon: EAT MY DUST
ISTO ESTÁ INCRÍVEL se for boa troco de Main :3
cupcake got upgraded 😁
YES PLEASE!!!!  LAKAD MATATAG
holy man this makes a big impact to the game running and sliding
wish the trailer had more than 5 fps
She already looks OP. She's like a viable versión of Phoenix.
When the players of your game have such bad aim, that you give them ability to outrun bullets. Maybe there is some hope for me...
Okay so, jett is slow now, phoenix wall is shit now, anything else?
it's the " hay buhay" for me
So league and valo get the same champ?
it's COD but as an agent
This game becoming trash
OMG esto sera epico papus
Riot not including Indian agent because of CCP and PLA.  FQ CHINA🤮..  1:04
neon and zeri look exactly the same
احبكم شباب
i dont like where this is going :(
Pls sm1 translate sm parts for me cuz sm part have Filipino in it (pls pin it so that i can get the result i want :>)
First chamber for operator and now neon to overcome Jett
run and gun
Huhu ang astig!!
FILIPINOS RISEEEE!!!!!
bu ajan ne zaman gelecek? ::::: When will this agent arrive?
I can’t wait to slide cancel in Val 😈🥶🥵

Yo she looks absolutely amazing
Phoenix: *Has Fire Wall* Neon: "Heehee I have double fire wall"
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
is that her ultimate???  1:52
my next main
Claim skin ghost for this agent pls 🥺
evet HYPLANDIN...
Cypher once again dies...
Valorant was released like a year and a half ago and it already is going to have so much power creep
This seems like a PROD kind of champ
Nice we just got another reason to make phoenix even more obsolete
Run and gun boiz:v
so did yoru ever get a fix?
Finally agent pinoy
que doideira
As expected she sprint and slides but damn thats a literal finger gun.
Is she accurate while sprinting?
HAY BUHAY
Never saw that coming, sage being a leader that was good and neon kind of cool cadet ready to learn it's cool though great job devs
Gonna be hearing lots of PINOY PRIDE in SEA games now haha
she gonns be op
This character seems overpowered
i have a crush on her
Guess I'll be playing COD in Valorant
her double wall made phoenix almost useless right there
At this point Riot is embracing the "precise gunplay" meme
Wait she's Filipino? Yey
Zeri
finally can play apex on valorant
PROD gonna surely run her for his plays quitting jett
OMG
Pinay diff
Dude run and gun meta is back brothers
Precise gunplay muhfkers!
Sheesh 🇵🇭
Comentários BR :
I was gonna hate this character as I got Jett vibes but she can slide so, I guess I gotta play her... Yoru still main tho.

AMAZIIIINGGGGGG SO COOOOOLLLL AAAAHHHHHH
proud to be a filipino, and also a gun runner lol.

ord lordd we got sith lord.... im entertain @,@ im pumped to zap sum bitches
but why did they uploaded in such low quality
ill be in ur spawn with a judge
вау новый перс, я рад, как я понял особенность в том что у неё скорость и электричество, скилы: 1 скорость, 2 электро-импульс который шокирует врагов, 3 делает 2 полосы которые вроде ускоряют тимейтов, ульт даёт стрелять из пальцев, из особенностей как я понял это подкат
valorant community: "get rid of run and gun" valorant devs: "no lol"
Omg
Abilities don't kill ~riot
Can i slide into her dms?
I love how they let Neon sing in this trailer because techincally, filipinos really love to do karaoke hahaha

2:16 I love how she literally brought a walis tambo for her room🤣
something lgbt just happened to me
OH WOW SHE'S FILIPINO  When she was charging up her ult on 1:35 she's chanting "kontrolado ko to" ( I have a control of this)
only a minute in... what in the apex legends BULLSHIT is this? RUN AND GUN AGENT!? WOOOO WE ALL WANTED THIS FOR SURE
Neon is the definition of run and gun lol not once did I see her standing still in this trailer
Chambr is trash
brooooo goosebumps
This agent would resonate with cod players
Ahh... I see this is where Zeri came from in League. Glad to see league copied Valorant for once ;)
yes
Run and Gun
Sage: "race you there?" Is she for real lol  Sage has been getting more screentime  lately and I'm happy about it  I haven't unlocked chamber yet lol another agent?? Guess I haven't played much lately...
Wow 👀
Omg. Ylona sang her song 😍😍😍
there must be a putang ina voiceline
New Jett opponent
gae
I'm seeing the Moira and Brigg nightmare all over again... Riot please don't!
why does she have ring light, is she an influencer? That makes me very sad
I think this looks verry op
ah yes run and gun mh hm i see
Что же.... думаю все НЕМНОГО возненавидят ее подкаты.
dibs
Apex wraith main slide tho
bro what is that cmon.......... is fucking fortnite xD
is valorant know cod with the slide wtf????
*Everyone is gangsta until Kay/o says "You are powerless!"*
0:53 nice shot
Hayyy buhay and Kontrolado ko to! Makes me more excited with her other voice lines everytime she gets a frag. Lezgo 🇵🇭!
Let's go
Numero de patinetes no Valorant sobe para um caralho, entenda:
Sickkkkk <3
as a former titanfall player, this agent's mechanic makes me so excited
Finally a buff for the run and gun meta
This is epic
as a phoenix main i got intimated by her wall
Omgg
Call of Duty?
Them thighs
im so addicted to this ylona garcia song rn
hahahaha All the players complain about shooting running Valorant: put an agent with which you can kill
funny how they made almost same character in both valorant and LoL
this is zeri
We got Electro Giant from Clash Royale in Valorant let's goooo
Dios
So hyped! Glad she represents my country too 💜 Also Early gang
That's a good ass song dude🔥🔥🔥
Oh my God
"Abilities don't kill"
Nuevo main 😳
She looks so damn good but wtf riot
The new agent looks to colorful and strange, the music is hot garbage and the whole theme of doing peacful avarege things like cleaning up my room and lisening to music seems like being a radiant solger with the most powerfull powers is a fucking joke! Sorry for giving all of this hate, i love this game, chamber was good, but this caracter looks like they coud added it to candy crush.
DAMNN
An agent made for APEX LEGENDS/CALL OF DUTY Players....OOO YEAAA
Nasaan mga peenoise dito?
R & G material
She filipino 😎
Let’s be honest valorant just wanted to make an agent that can hit the cod slide cancle, also it just looks like the better version of both Phoenix and jett
Her ult is a freaking Raygun? Noice~!
agent unbalanced again i gotta quit this cancer honestly
Here goes shotgun ape in valorant
Sounds like a cool agent concept! I can see how she'd compete with Jett, her movement looks so off the charts!
yes
Excited
NEON JUDGE META INCOMING
20 fps video wtf
philippines!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She looks so broken can't wait to main her🔥Where my Filipino's at 🇵🇭
Finally a  agent where she can beat Reynas thickness 🤩🤩🤩🤩🥺🥺🥺🥺
Rip I'm definitely not playing her 😂
Yapıcağınız oyunu skm
Riot Nerf her
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Her character similar to yoruichi from Bleach, lightining and Flash Steps same as Yoruichi
😻😻😻
wait did she slide cancle?
That's gonna be the fastest nerf in the history with that double wall. As always gj riot balancing team
filipina agent ahooooo
Cypher Saved
welcome to the rng club
I sense a lot of putangina coming HAHAHA lets go Neon!
Woah 😯

Awesome ❤️❤️
Dammmmm she gonna be good
SO EXCITED.
SHE LOOKS STUNNING
wdym bro, that's sick af!!! So excited. Again VALORANT I have to say "well done" !!
Please let there be a voice line "Puta ka" or "Tangina mo"
freetea
So, Zeri and Neon huH.  Riot really wants to make is like lightning girls :^>   (Also Yae Miko coming out soon, like wth with lightning characters dud)
She’s very hype I can’t wait for her to come in game
Noiccceeee 💙
What!? Omg is very strong girl
bro which one is her ult i am so confused
amazingsssssssssssssssssss
White washed Filipino gang wya!
Pikachu of valorant 😂
Riot Always Have Good Music To Entertain Us!
this shit is fire wtf
She's like jett and pheonix's love child A sprint that helps with manueverability like jett's dash A nade/molly to throw at people like pheonix's fireball Fire lanes to help you block sightlines and get across gaps like jett's smokes and pheonix's wall An ult that you equip as a weapon and kill people with like jett's knives.  Looks like they just took some of my favorite things out of their kits and also made her tailored towards run and gunning(?) as suggested by the trailer. JESUS
WOOOOOOO VALORANT FINALLY REALISING RUN AND GUN IS PART OF THE GAME
Sheeesh
Phoenix jobless now except for the flash and bait.
I already can hear myself shouting her name she looks crazy broken
FINNALY
Im sorry, why is she like phoenix and breach had a child
Soooo...Yeah, League department called, they want their Zeri back
Riot is taking run and gun to a whole new level
meh
And here we were asking to remove rng
the specter looking hella scary rn.
panget ng quality ng vid nyo
Sage ❤❤
did she revive herself?
bruururuuururururh its so goood
Ang ganda mo naman miss
magandang gabi mga fellow pinoy (I have found my new main) salamat Riot :)
im guessing ability one is probably gonna be a toggleable sprint of some sort, ability two is essentially two phoenix walls and ability three is a throwable breach stun. and her passive is the sliding thing.  oh and her ult is an electric squirt gun or something idk lol cool agent! excited to see how she plays
The amount of people that are going  to get angry because of this slide and judge shit hahhahaha
This is my
Putangina anlupet
The song is so filipino pop, I cannot.
run and gun meta
<3
Its good on all. But what i saw this will change valorant. Like introducing this agent it lost its tactical shooting meaning, seeing the slides reminds me of cod mw
I left valorant and I came back
here
Wtfffffff
LMAO APEX MOVEMENT IN ANIME GAME
Andddddd she's literally 5 Agents combined into one. Oh boy...
hell nah this is OP
Lmao is she a pheonix simp
Sacaron el mismo campeón para el lol y para el valorant, andamos bien creativos no riot?
cool another agent that makes viper pretty useless
Yes the jett alternative😀🤡
So Jett got competition now. Plus phonix type wall but both side.😂
New main
Jett 2
Ylona and Neon is a perfect pair
Can't wait
?
sage is so cute i cant
Os trailers dos agentes estão cada vez melhores.
"Hay buhay!" "Kontrolado ko 'to!"
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT ULT HOLY SHIT
less gooo
So she is like flash
Character from ?
ylona garcia poster omg??
Am I the only one seeing the similarity between her and Zeri (league)
Kinda sad she’s a duelist. Supports are really getting the shaft when it comes to solo queue. Could really use a controller like this.
Finally a agent who can run and gun effectively
yooo
yey
Zeus Fingerrrrrr
Holy that wall looks broken
cant wait to hear her voice lines
electric double phoenix
Bro wtf its a hero shooter now
Here :D
Got my 'here within 30 minutes' ticket
:o
Neon es de BOQUITA PAPAAAAAA
another unused character
Straight up human Pikachu
have someone thought about the cypher mains, and why every agent or update to agents (Yoru) is a new counter to cypher?
les goooo
Yea I don’t think this was the right move for the game. A character completely based on run and gunning. The thing this community hates the most
can't wait to run and bucky/stinger enemies with her <3
Okay so first overwatch now we have cod sliding yup
Spark uh interesting
This is gonna be Epic ❤️
😍
sad chamber noises*
Damn average Quiapo Snatcher
Nice

You guys can take your eyes off my new main

What in the run and gun
Run and Guns with a bulldog: *"PRECISE GUNPLAY"*
Within an hour damn....
the animation looks A LOT like Arcane than it did before. I'm loving it. This is making me want a VALORANT TV Series more and more
Her powers are like Sonic. Loved it😍
you have done it again, riot, created another character that is worthy of my love!!!!! wonderful job with the trailer im adding this song to my playlist rn
so jett but better ?
Looks Bad, here's why 1. New shit phoenix wall  2. Yoru flash but it concusses 3. Promotes run/gun with the slide and her speed 4. Ultimate looks like echo from overwatch
SHES PERFECT
Bro what her ultimate is electric gun Nah this broken can't wait to play🤩
"tactical shooter" & "precise gunplay" & "you don't kill with abilities", yet here we are with a Kpop Sasuke mixed with Darth Sidious...
But she has the most broken ability of all. Sprinting with specter at max potential
No cypher deaths in this one, Finally
cool
Slide cancellllll
snatcher talaga ampota
run and gun champ
riot should've found a real filipino without the american accent
Finna be nerfed so fast
She is my main already
WOAHHH

YOUR TELLING ME AFTER THEY "FIXED RUN AND GUN" THERE GUNNA ADD A CHARACTER LIKE THAT OH HELL NAH GOLD ELO GONNA SUFFER IMMENSLY WHEN SHE COMES OUT
She looks so cool
Phoenix will kill her
That right there my valorant friends is the definition of fking dope ...

This is Zeri 2.0
This will be interesting
Is this game still a Fps game whahahha
Weed.
Wowsa nice
Can't wait for her lore. seems like she has times that she's been unstable. as she's saying "Kontrolado ko to" repeatedly meaning " I can control this " before she uses her ult. Damn Riot do a great job  with their Trailers
i dont believe for a second thats her abilities, i mean sick, i want her but imagine playing against her
Everyone gangster till Kay/O use his knife kekw

Run and gun is confirmed

THAT'S MY MOMMA!
most sexiest agent in valorant
🇵🇭
THIS IS SO GOOD!! SPECIALLY THIS AGENT IS FROM MY HOME COUNTRY.
dude valorant character designs are always so good
*Hayy buhayy, typical sigh
yep *insert the filipino pride image here*
NIGERUNDAYOOOO
Lets go Philippines!!!😍
My god, broken af. How is this agent even possible.
Meeting at Riot: Guys we need an idea for a new agent in Valorant, but also for a new champion in League. Any ideas?  Intern: What if we add a female character with electricity based abilities...... and twintails.... to both games at the same time?  Everyone:  How did we not think about that sooner? Lets just change the clothes and the hair color in each game and no one  will notice its the same character. Thats brilliant!
Of course
Jett is better 😆
de locos maan
Blown away🤩
Phoenix mains realizing there's gon be a double waller soon :')
YASSS
WTF RIOT??WHAT IS IT?
laaAag
GOD DAMNN
GYATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
SA WAKASS
I feel like Neon in a day or 2 after releasing is gonna be on every team since alot of people need to get xp to unlock her, unlike people with money
Jett be like: Career is in Danger
omg
Whaaat
Ok shut and gun is real thanks riot
Best agent presentation so far
Sees double walls of flames  Sad Phoenix noises
Can’t wait to deal with insta locks for a week

PHENOMENAL Agent Trailer, S/O to the Riot team for putting together another insanely great animated trailer
sage the real MVP, saved her ass from raze ult
seems like a very stress-free agent to play
She is cool.DAMN
Plase turkish agent

Riot promoting rng be like : 0:52
mto foda so main
I honestly thought she was japanese, but hey, filipina is even better!! valorant agent diversity is crazyyy
I actually though 1 month before the leak, that valorant needs a movementbased agent. Not smthing like jett and there we go.
Holy shoot if she peeks like that with lightning speed i am gonna be dead while awping
Why do all the girl agents have to be so GODDAMN THICC THOUGH, I MEAN IM NOT COMPLAINING BUT--
Neon will be the new meta mark my words
Hail Run and Gun
Nani Neon skill too op
Goofy ahh run animation 😭
와 슬라이딩 나올거라고 예상했었는데 진짜로  나오네
Sombra, Echo, and Pheonix mix

,🔥🔥👇
THE YLONA GARCIA POSTER
Ayoo.....looks sick af Can't wait to try this agent out!  Thank you Valorant!!! You're giving me something exciting to look out for in this godforsaken and boring pandemic
mehenga flash
did not like
quake???
1:20 doble Phoenix
eu quero eu queroooooo!!
in love
can she snatch too?
This is huge actually
whoa
Tracer?
Like a jett sister damn
THIS IS SOOO COOOOOOL LETS GOOOOO
Woooooooooooow i just impressed
OH LORD HEAVENN!!! SHE'S CUTEEEEE!!!!!
my guess for the abilities: essentially a throwable breach tremor, a double phoenix wall, and a sliding passive. burny laser pointer is probably the ult and the sprint is like a short yoru ult where you can be seen and shoot, combined with more accuracy. i could be wrong about which is the ult but i feel like the concussion ability and the phoenix wall aren't ultimates, but if the sprint lasts long enough it could be the ult instead and the laser is similar to the chamber sheriff in the sense that they're both practically secondary weapons.
Spec and stinger are going to be op with her
Ok. She's my new main now😎
Encore plus de run and gun ouaiiis
she a whole apec character
Riot can never disappoint with their animations and music, I'm a FAN!
AAAHHHHH
Let's see if she replaces jett
Omg, the animated trailer got me same bives of into the spider verse.
OYYY YAWA ETO NA
is her sliding an ability or just a thingy u get from playing her like jett's gliding

pov ult: бодя любит какиш
Precise gunplay  lmao
her third ability is a double concuss, she fires one concuss pulse in an area and then form that area it bounces again
bro i am not going to lie to you all, riot can actually make fucking trailers, but i cant lie the sprint, slide and her ult looks interesting especially when she can be a really good counter to jett
Damn shes broken!!
Spectre 2: el agente
Hope the next trailers are like this. Or give the old agents a short cinematic like this, would be cool
Yo but that dual wall was frickin epic
This is gonna take RUN n GUN to a whole new level.
im filipino and loving valorant right now
Si con este duelista la gente no entra a site desinstalo el juego y me paso a roblox
Nice, an agent with a Filipino background :)
The definition of Run n Gun
"Laban ko toh! Kontrolado ko toh!" Just means "This is my fight! I got this under my control!" She's pretty determined and strong jeez :"O
Think I’ve found a Jett replacement, this looks sick as hell

That crazy they created a character just for prod.
i can see filos autolocking neon like how my friend stated he will autolock neon immediately
Ah, yes. Flash....
run and gun intensify
Filipino agent, at fuckin last. Time to be stuck in silver again.
Holy crap this is insane
i thought we were trying to remove run and gun
Ahh finallyyyyy 🔥 🔥 🌩
Sheesh
Ylona Garcia fan right there!
Gameplay gon be feel like cod
GG GAMING
Neon rebibe me
OH! finally a new overwatch character
YLONA?? DAMNN
"Hay buhay" 😍😍😍
precise gunplay then they show run gun suiiiiii
"hay buhay"
Sage's voice is so sweet, i love sage
VALORANT: precise gunplay!  NEON: Sprint and gun
All apex players be like alright time to switch
cool
She looks so fun!!!
Second main
Just tell us its supposed to be a movement based shooter Riot
If you can't beat the run & gun, embrace it
Can't wait for a Polish Agent :D
my prediction for the abilities  Q: Left click- Thundershock; Right click- Stun that disarms the Q  E: Dash, possibly damages enemies hit in the proccess  C/X: Two blue walls that damage enemies who pass through them  X/C: Speed buff that goes off when you fire; Possibly also buffs the allies, which would make the skill worth of being an ultimate
She looks cool
You already know the run and gun idiots are gonna be happy abt this
Wow, too many precise gunplay incoming...
claim your 'fuck off' ticket here
So there is no cinematic. Like episode 2 retake. Or use for chamber for cinematic.
hoping for a putangina voiceline.
OOOOOOO MAAAA GODDDDDD
Early gang
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SHIT CRAZY AF
FIREEE <3
Tactital shooter the agent
She looks like a really interesting character
Bruh is literally from Infamous second son.

I love her already, no Cyphers were harmed in the making of this trailer
Here within 30 minutes🖐
ابيوسف فوووق
they be promoting run n gun now lmfao
So basically her initial ability is allowing her to go zoom zoom and skirt skirt. She has a single lane wall and she has two concussions. Her Ult is shooting lightning out of her hands. Finally, she's basically a Filipina speedster. I dig it.
Killua is that even you?
M-M-M mo...
When we getting Valorant the movie? These Trailers be having me emotional
wtfffffffffffffffffffffff
Copy of Phoenix and Jett!!
Di ako proud
Finally Sage is in the cinematic trailer!!!
I thought this was a tactic shooter😔😃

In My country we call this PUTARIA
Pilipinas mag ingay!

Hay.. Buhay.. HAHAHAHA omg FILIPINO PRIDE!!!!!
More run and gun let's go
Goodbye Jett, Neon is now my main
valorant waifu
she kinda bad tho
okay. You Got This..
when cod takes place in
RNG everywhere
she can run, slide, wall, concuss (maybe) and zap zap that is 5 different abilities. we probably getting the second agent with a passive next to Jett who can Glide.
no one: Neon: I'm Fast af boooiiiii
I'm getting heavy reminders of the new League Championg being released soon
Players : complains about run and gun   *Riot : oh you hate run and gunning ? Wait until you see Neon.*
They took Run n' Gun to a whole other level
Fun Scene When u pause at 0:39 u can see that It looks like Phoenix is shooting her
Todavia ni termino de desbloquear a Chamber xd
also the ylona garcia poster is so nicee wtf i love neon so much!!
00:54 did valorant just promote run and gun😳
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
uhh this is interesting
i like her design maybe she will be my new main
Remember when Kayo seemed overpowered? I think it’s the same right here. This agent looks like a menace but I think it’s balanced
Good to be early
HOW MANY ABILITIES DOES SHE HAVE?!
TACTICAL INT INCOMING
POV: me in call of valorant xd
wft
BROKEN
Swagapino
MY NEW MAIN BRO SHES SO INSANE AND HER DESIGN IS SO COOL 🥰

so she can run and gun her ullt?
Waow.!
Delete fracture from the game please
deymmm💜💜💜
Man a lighting character in league and now Valorant huh
Yo neon looks... lit! But she looks like a lot of fun to play! Can't wait to try her out!
she's definition of run and gun, help.
Valorant please add a controller pleaseee
So they added Pikachu in human form.  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
1 week after: Neon = main agent ng bansa
WHATS THE SONG THO??, RIOTS MUSIC CHOICE IS FIRE AS ALWAYS
precise gunplay
valo players : pls rito nerf run&gun rito : here an agent that can run&gun valo players : fair enough
Worrying sign when the game starts releasing characters targeted at casual players. It could be for a few reasons but the obvious one is, money just topped quality gameplay in their priorities. That being said, the character might be getting mis-represented here, and in fact; she cannot run and shoot accurately. Either way, the game already has strafe peeking to make this a movement first, aim second style game. Any more agents able to rapidly move across the map will amplify this and just diminish the other agents who will feel like a slow turtle in comparison.  Maybe she will be fun though and I am just being pessimistic, let's wait and see.
New agent looks Sick .
Shes like octane from apex, kinda
"Hay Buhay!"
My new main?
VOLTA nalang dapat
"Agent abilities aren't for kills" makes agent that shoots freaking lighting
Lezgoo filipino pride!

Donnerversteck Unbrechbarelanze
As an apex player that slide is smooth.
Sheeeesh
That Filipino Accent though... Already Accurate Plus it's true that us Filipinos like to sing by Karaoke and Play Basketball.
Was wondering a month ago that " why isn't there a slide ability or an agent with slide ability in-game ? " ,  well.. here we are ! ^^ <3
I feel bad for jett...
She's so cool
Every Filipino player right now be like "My new main!"

very cool
So good at eco rounds, just wall and rush through the site......ez plant

Why is it sage and not jett who challenges her to a race… sage asking to be trashed
They took Run'n'Gun and made an agent out of it.

Apex legend In valorant
my man pheonix feeling slept on with this new duelist. give a brother a buff aye. But damn she is looking great.
My new "run n gun" technique is more useful with her 👍
Riot games finally decided to buff run and gun
While attacking, wall entry and sage wall blocking ---> Retake difficult
The agent looks very fun to use with the movement abilities
fizeram um agente pro patinete fdsKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Yeah I main Neon since beta...
SHEEEESH
Ok she doesn't need gun 🙂🔫
Ah yes, Jett, Phoenix, Yoru, Astra and Sova in one agent.
DAYUMN WTF!? THIS A MIX OF YORU, PHOENIX AND APEX XD holy shit
“kontrolado koto”
Riot:We are nerfing run n gun  Also Riot:Neon Go brrrr double phoenix wall slide,lock on with a zap gun Brrrrrrr

Swabe YLONA IS THE VA!! Filipino reprezent

Yo! Neon will give valorant a new style of playing holy crap I am so excited to try her!
Here before it gets viral
this is so exciting
Also yoru without rework :(
Okay, they must have done this on purpose. Making Neon look and giving her the same powers (electricity) like Zeri (upcoming champion) from League of Legends. Nice marketing Rito, nice marketing
Can't wait to run and gun even more with this agent! Thank you, Riot!

Finally an agent that can compete with Jett's movement! I'm looking forward to this update.
Ohhh I might actually play this game now.
We Tokyo driftin now boys
AM MAINING HER IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LIGHTNING ABILITY AGENT
Embrace run and gun
0:55 time to run n gun
this is sounding more like COD and Overwatch at the moment, am I right?
yooo
Her ability is run n gunning
She looks good ngl
The character design and animation is on point
Precise Gunplay: A freaking lightning ray that probably has a wide range, 0 accuracy needed just mild tracking skills with enough time in the clock to sprint, slide and make an ace.
uh oh
hallo there
Hey her bag is squish squish
How long till someone figures out how to slide cancel
Unlimited power!!!!!
Tracer+Echo 🌝
OMFG
ALLREADY???!!!
too much curious......
"Kontrolado ko to" is "I can control this" or "I got this under control"
is alodia the voice actor?
WOAH
the audacity of sage asking "race you there?" to a girl who can sprint so fast like a flash while she only heals xD (I'm a Sage user btw).  Totally in love with all valorant trailers...istg they all are on fire 🔥
If she didn't say "tangina" once in her voice line, we riot.
JETT REBIBE ME
CoD players favorite agent
insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
omsim!
Ah yes a whole new level of rng
ayo cool now add some putanginamo voiceline for her.
jett lover --- sorry my jett

this was mad cringe, hopefully fully balanced like chamber.
Kontrolado ko to! = I got it under control!
Offieee 🤎
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Quake lighting gun????

Claim your here within an hour ticket here
stupid overpowered agent... run and gun.
cringe Sliding tho pubg better
🇵🇭💕💞💓💗💖💘💝💘💖💖💗💞
..
wow
She has the "jett thiccccness"
“haaayyy buhayyyy”
Bro i found the lost footage of tracer
Well that's a broken phoenix wall
Signature: Sprint, can slide by crouching while ability is active Q/C: Double wall, basically two phoenix walls, one on each side Q/C: Concuss grenade, breach stun enemies in an AoE of where it lands EDIT: Upon closer inspection it seems that it bounces once but it concusses where it bounces as well as where it lands?? Pretty OP Ultimate: Energy beam? Slows enemies shooting (edit for hatter and Chris Junianto and BirdyTheBirb, thx for pointing that out)
Finally a character I can sprint in nonsensicallly and call it tactical
great i have a new main
I wonder if her ultimate functions exactly like the lightning gun from Quake. Or Zarya's beam. Run and zap, here we go.
ITS SONIC THE MF HEDGEHOG
jett 2.0
sheeeeeeeeeeesh
im curious what country she's from? i cant figure it out and am bad with languages lol
Anyone else feel like this is an Overwatch character in Valorant?
this is super cool bro
home sweet home  it looks familiar from somewhere
dammmmmmmmmm
I like how writes "Distruption" in Turkish first
Nah you suck for adding another duelist lol
RUN N GUN MORE LIKE SLIDE N DIE cant wait to get Neon!
Jett eléctrica
New league champ and new valorant agent ... ctrl + c > ctrl v  Gj Riot )
Nice ult
WHAT
RUSH B DO NOT STOP MY FRENS :D
She's looking pretty cool.
Valorant be embracing the "Precise Gunplay" aspect of the game
She can sing , she can slide , she can sprint , she can do it all
Porfin saldre de plata 3 🤑
Shoooocks
What I see is she can create electric walls, sprint, and these circles which seems to work like Sage's slow orb. And what seems to be her ult is shooting electricity out of her hands like an extra gun. Really excited to play with Neon.
FINALLY AN ANIMATIC WHERE CYPHER DOESNT GET KILLED!
OKAY WTF I LOVE HER!!! THE WALLS LOOKS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOD, IM SO EXCITED FOR HER
Less goo rng made ezzzz, getting cod feels 🤣
If u listen closely, u can hear jett mains crying in the backgroud.

I have to main her she's filipeno too! and her design has all my favorite colors
run and gun "the agent"
here comes flashs sister
All i have to say about this is.. Yes.
Finally
overwatch?
Riot when Valorant came out: Precise gun play with abilities that don't kill Riot today: The last two agents can kill with their abilities and the last one can move like crazy and deals damage
dud this is palpatine daughter?
So a stun, speed boost, double wall thing and electric fingers
New main
e
Riot implementing slide cancel from COD 1:00 lesgoooo
This is sure reyna's brother
Sheee
Valorant i a made request.  Can u guys plz optimize the game a bit. The game is so chopy and laggy.U guys said u guys making a game that gonna work both high end and mid range pc.. but now i have a mid range pc but still all setting low i get only 40-30 fps . Plz fix that. And happy new year <3...

The song slaps!
phoenix + jett

Pinay :ooo
oh my ghaaadddd🥰🥰🥰
FIREE
I'm getting gayer everyday, huh
so basically there’s a radiant training program run by sage, and neon’s one of the first recruits?
<3
Is it just me or does it look like she has 10 different abilities?
Passive: Call of Duty sliding mechanic  Ability 1: Throwable stun orb that ricochets off a wall, causing stuns on two locations  Ability 2: Double electric walls (better than Phoenix's single flame wall). Probably lasts shorter than Phoenix's wall though.  Signature Ability: Sprinting??  Ult: Shoots lasers from her hand?!
the run and gun gonna be insane
My new main agent
She is so cuute, and she looks like a lot of fun
Jett+Phoenix+Breach
she pulled a sabo
Aight I didn't think Slide canceling would've ever made it to Valorant
damnnnn
OMG
Finally a reason for cod players to switch 🤠
Sage really want to race sonic?? Ah i see, she already put slow orb on the floor and put a wall on every side. Very clever.
This character is the real one This character is the real "run and gun" no kapp
"Hay buhay"

Okay… This is curious
how many abilities do u wanna have? Neon: yes
she might be my new valo crush lol
1st Ability: Uses a radius to stun peoplem (similar to brimstone's ult) ------- 2nd Ability (Signature E): Runs veryfast without getting weapon or knife in hand and can slide while using it. (Similar to skye's heal and viper's wall 100 thing) --------- 3rd Ability: Walls that deals damage or slows people on touch. (Also blocks bullets double pheonix wall blaze) ---------- 4th Ability (Ultimate): Shoots fucking lasers like Jett's ult. (No infos about recharging or when does it end)
jett the initiator
cant wait to lose my mind
another agent to yell "WTF IS THAT ABILITY" at every time i die

Finger bang

Ngl the ult looks abit weak. Hopefully she isn’t another yoru.
You guys might be excited about the new Agent. I'm excited about the music, absolute jammer
“Hay buhay” yasss neon yassssssss
WTFFF
I think I can speak for Filipinos that not only we're happy for this agent, but also for this banging trailer!
കൊള്ളാം പ്വോളി സാനം 🚶
Why are all the female characters super OP and cool, while the male ones are dogshit? Riot has an agenda.
I am sorry what
HAHAHA "HAY BUHAY" "KONTROLADO KO TO" HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
In the battlepass, I thought the agent with electric current might be a guy XD
Feelsweirdman she looks like mika daime
am I the only one seeing the similarity between her and Zeri (from league of legends)
basically a better version of phoenix xd
What abilities we see 1: Some kind of sprint which they can equip their gun quickly after (may be a video speed change though). Likely tied in with the slide mechanic... Or maybe it's a passive like Jett's float? Both powers seem too strong for a passive. 2: Some kind of thrown nade which has an upward pulse. Caused Omen to be concussed (effect visible on head) 3: Dual phoenix walls, did not seem bendable  Ult (based on flashyness and power): Speed boost and Skyrim style beam of lightning.
Oh god, I had to rewind and hear the "Hay, buhay." again to make sure it was really in Filipino language  and I didn't mishear it lol. The trailer is so hype! Gonna play her ASAP once she gets released for sure!
So from now only RNG no need of Aimlab 😂
“Irons hate her” “the pros hate her” “everyone hates her” it’s Neon
Uuuuuuhh i like.
New Main ?
Looks like we a got a speedster in Valorant
Lesgo

yo wtf

Can't wait for the nerfs
thank for giving me my new main valorant ❤😍
I LOVE HER ❤
Why's there no hindi at the end saying "disruption" . There's almost all other major country languages except ours despite such large player base from India. It's really disheartening.
I think this agent is the competiton between Jett and Her in the top auto-lockpick duelist, man, that is going painfull :v And I think this agent will be more choice for pro and smurf than other regular rank :v
Very poggers
If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the deadyou will be saved Romans.10:9
nice
*watching the trailer*  RIP people with 300ms reaction time like me
I'm not even playing Valorant but I'm hyped. This trailer looks so cool. Well done Riot!

Omggggg excited as hell i am so ready
She have the same vibes from Raze, loved it ♡
So i looked at the double wall and thought "hey, that's a nice ult for a duelist" ..Then they revealed the real one.
Looks absolutely insane! Might get back on valorant to unlock.
this is so cool !!!
Ah yes, another agent to invalidate phoenix
So how many abilities does she have exactly. Her super sprint, slide, the walls, the concussion, her finger gun? That’s already five.
Run and Gun? Probably from Quiapo.
Whaaaaa
Ahhhhh

😮 Kaboses ni Ling
riot out here 'patching run and gun' then straight up dropping a trailer showing of a character that has it's whole ability based off around run and gun. Thanks riot :D
usain bolt, echo beam, phoenix walls, concuss... seems balanced
bro im gonna call it shes going to be so broken
They made her too thick
Dam bro she looking fine!
Precise gunplay
To be clear, in Project A, shooting matters. You don’t kill with abilities. Abilities create tactical opportunities to take the right shot. Characters have abilities that augment their gunplay, instead of fighting directly with their abilities.
Just evolved from Run and Gun to Slide and Gun
HOLY COW
Grabe!! Ang galing!!!
Here
Judge time is near
she's gonna change everything in this game no joke
IM HARD
OMG OMG OMG  !!!!! BEST TRAILER EVER RIOT!!!

Abilities from what I can tell:  1. Slide/Sprint 2. Throw a stun grenade that can ricochet off walls and stun the areas they hit 3. Send double walls up creating a path forward for her team 4. Ult: Gain movement speed and shoot lighting from your hands
Bangladeshi Agent needed

She uhh have connection to Zeri? They both similar champion/agent
She looks fire
Damn bro Chamber just came out and now this.

I;m so impressed with valorants styles and animations , cant WAIT FOR HER<333333333333333333
Guys, meet with the real Run n Gun
Well this is unexpected shes a Filipina
Sheeeesshhhh
I have no idea what’s going on lol
Hay Buhay indeed
Riot: "This is a precise gunplay game" Also Riot: "Promotes run and gun with Neon"
that "HAY BUHAY" . FILIPINO PRIDE!
woah what a agent man
Thicccc
Super Cool
Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu dayumn.
WHAT IF SHE SPRINTS AND SLIDES IN LEAGUE YAYA?
NEON MAINS CHECK IN HERE ⬇
So Neon now got released, probably all Filipino players will rush to play her. Just a suggestion, you could have played a Filipino song instead of an English one. I mean the song is cool and good, but still a Filipino themed agent with OPM background music will be much more amazing. Also love the Filipino details in her room!
Riot is basically making u Run and gun at this point
When valorant mobile?
I'm. Neon main already
A SELF REVIVE?   edit: i didnt saw sage reviving her lmao
Ok, she looks amazing
I'm one of the first here BUTTON
Confirmed its Ylona Garcia then. I like it.
Kinda reminds me to Melody, the Vtuber
petition to give the editors a raise
they had to make her super hot so she can overthrone jett omegalul
ALL GET READY TO BUY A 390 HZ MONITOR TO COUNTER HER DASHES AND SLIDES< VALORANT GOING PAID BEING FREE < LOOOOOL
tondo speedrunner is here lets goooo
hewo
So abilities are   Run fast   Slip n’ slide  Make circles that do something   Phoenix’s C but you run fast and shoot magic

Bitch has finger lasers, slides, sprints, throws up double phoenix, walls wtf is happening LOL
OMG
I love COD
IM AMAZED AND IN LOVE OMG
sheeesh
OH MY GOD THE EDITORS ARE SO GOOD
looks like arcane but valorant
Viper, Pheonix, Neon map splitting with walls boutta be wild
"run boy run this place was not meant 4 you run boy run they're trying to stop you"
Phoenix+Jett=Neon
Wow, I am amazed. Sliding, walls, shocking.
Yo Yoru x Neon
So now we have two Pikachu champion thanks to Riot.
Finally! The strongest race is represented in foreign media!
let's see how broken is it
Valorant team: Hey can i copy your homework? League team: Yeah just change it up a bit. Valorant team:
Whoooo! She's spicy!!! ♥  Her first line says: "Hay buhay!" which literally translates to, "*sigh*, life." Which roughly means, "Oh well, that's life."  And then her Ult(?) line, she says "Kontrolado ko 'to!",which literally translates to "I control this." But would roughly mean "I'm in control."
riot is promoting run and gun  nice
my new main, 100% guarantee
is neon n zeri sisters?😂😂
she looks cool but idk what meta or maps she'll fit in
Wooooooooowwwww👌👌👌👌👌😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😱

THIS IS SO COOL
Me : Struggling to spray on moving enemies Riot : YES, A SPRINTER!
RUN AND GUN!!! WOOOOOOOOOO
Rip Jett 😁
TANGINA I LOSTTT
'Hay buhay'
New overwatch update looks awesome
She’s on the red bull
"Hay Buhayyy" Excited to hear tagalog voice lines for the first time in a big game!!
Run and gun = This agent
네온 ㅈㄴ사기일것같다 진심으로 네온들고 슬라이딩하면서 샷건 빠른이속으로 무빙치면서 칼빵할생각하니 벌서신나네
she's gonna be the next generation of OP users :)
Please bring a web series for Valorant like Arcane of League of legends 🙏🙏🙏
Run and Gun
Pilipinas finally has great representation.
I know now my new main agent 💙💙💙
Just when I was about to quit valo
laggy desync servers!~! ping 30 yet i feel like i play on 60-70 ...hit reg is awfull af ...open more servers for fk sake riot! i play on frankfurt! eu ...feels like shit , and stop punishing people for toxicity thats how they become the smurfs that destroys us ..smoeone toxic? good mute the,...in these day you can't even say fuck off or blow me = banned what a weak society
HEHE BOI
Sheeeeeeeeereeeeeesh
Looks VERY similar to the new Character "ZERI" they just teased for League of Legends
This is gonna be OP
Why just why new agent so quickly
FUCKİNG JETT MAİNS
pinoy pride
Valorant: Apex legends
Wtf yoooo
Maybe a new agent for now
riot is making this game even more popular  because they've gone all out last year
Wait what song is this?
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
Other agents:ok lets plan all things and then execute it properly Neon: i am speed
SHEEESH YESSIRRRR
PINOY NA PINOY YUNG ACCENT AHH
SO, the new agent can slide, shoots lightning, can create a no ceiling tunnel and can run super fast with her gun holstered. Everyone is maining her and insta-locking her. Jett and Chamber are still viable for OPing. Neon is more of a RNG agent. Seems fun.
Already in love
Claim your here within 10 minutes ticket here
I FUCKING FELL IN LOVE I DIDNT EXPECT THAT OMG
phoenix is crying in the corner with his shitty wall :''''(

How many abilities she have? Speed, slide, two phoenix's walls, a molly, a finger gun, there's something else I am forgetting?

The trailer was electrifying, definitely gave spark of joy.

Dude that is so messed upp🤯🤯 Lol she'll be nerfed instantly 😂
Riot literally made run and gun situation 100x worse
PUTANGINA NIYOOOO ANDITO NA SIYA HAHAAAAAAA

Looks similar to the new League Champion, the electricity theme, the velocity, the hairstyle, the new attack (In legaue the devlog says that the new champion will have a new approach to autoattacks, the same way the ultimate of this agent is a new way to attack)
When riot promotes run n gun you know its “precise gunplay”
Jod

And she will be why I play Valorant more
Its just a new jett
They literally made ”Precise gunplay” into a agent and i love it
"hay buhay"

can’t wait for people to insta lock her and hide in the back lmao
