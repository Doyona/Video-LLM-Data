what’s the BEST ari song? 😂⬇️
13:50 “Well, not THIS dress. HǍHÂHĀAAA 👹👹”
The last one was great. #2 Kylie’s green dress was ok. It may have looked better with shapewear. I’m a size 2 and wear spanx with certain dresses.
Love the purple dress ❤
I loved all the beautiful and tasteful clothes and bags. Congratulations  *amzclothes*
I really love how your taste and style are always so chic. My favorite is the  *amzclothes*  coat, it’s amazing.
Who watching in 2025
Literally no joking I was enjoying the video and meal after finishing the food i was drinking water and that pink freaking dress(harry Potter's one)made me spit the water out of my mouth like your entry and the dress like brooooo....my mom was like what the heck is wrong with you? But I can't tell her that I am watching your videos cuz she will not understand it anyways🙃btw I love your videos so much and really appreciate your time and the efforts you make for us❤ lot's of love from nepal
With the quality of luxury brands like LV declining, I bet  *amzclothes*  the quality is pretty good. I've seen a lot of videos of people complaining. Until then, these questions will determine the difference between qualities...
13:50 😭😭😭😂
Girl if you wanna be like hermonie get the gorgeous dress from universal studios it really looks like the real deal! 😜 but the last one was def the closest to the real one of Ariana’s
❤
The makeup is the MOMENT
My sexy girlfriend 💋
Lol. Sassy Cat!
All these dress companies are taking you to the bank 😂
14:35 “it’s a temporary setback, it’s a momentary loss” is what it’s giving 😭😭
16:39 OMG it’s the trend-setter skirt from dress to impress ❤
I watch you when I eat sometimes and now every time I watch you I get hungry lol
It’s giving trendsetter dress
Ariana's was cut lower in the front. I think if it was altered to that style it would have more impact.
Be aware when buying things from China for hundreds of quids that people in China often only earn 200 per month. They are so happy we pay these crazy prices.
You deserve all the success in the world lovely gurl xxx

9:55 😭✨
YALL WE HAVE THE REAL TRENDSETTER S DRESS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OMGGGG
I thought this was dress to impress bro-

A comic said her daughter asked if Jesus ever had lice so she said she just didn’t know but if he did she was sure that he would just heal himself lol!
9:21 love how she mocked kylie when she has fillers herself lol
13:29 princess peach? 😭🙏

Ur makeup is give Harley Quinn vibes and im living for it 💕
I think the last one could be for your birthday? I don’t know why I’m on a 2 year old video she’s not gonna see this
21:51
19:30 he slays 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
I actually like both Rhi-Rhi dresses and all you need is a pettie coat for it.  The Kylie one I think is nice, just needs that hip detail worked on.  Hermione’s is ok, the details just needed to match better. While not the right colour, I feel it’s nice, just would be better if everything matched.  Unfortunately, when it comes to tulle clothing, they’re so expensive because of how much tulle is needed for any given project; whether your making it yourself or your buying a custom/ pre-made and the time/ labour of making it. You’d be surprised at how much tulle you’d need to get certain looks and volume, and depending on the colour, type, brand and store you buy from also determine the prices of the base material. Then on top of all that, if you don’t already have some of them, you need, lining material, treads, an detailing materials etc. If your doing it yourself, it can almost be as expensive as getting a custom/ pre-made. Plus if your not familiar or confident with working with tulle, you can run into mistakes easily and that means having to buy more materials. It’s a difficult fabric to work with even for those familiar with it.
Maybe because you ordered five they asked you for measurements
9:54 SUCH A CUTIE CAT
i am sorry i am new but who is vincent
All of these dresses are such a waste of money 😢
Colours are off and cuts are a bit different. But I think they did a great job for a fraction of the price of the originals. I think they all fit really well on you as well. So, don’t be so critical. Green villain moment slayed!
I was still hopeful that with this price tag, maybe they don't overwork wnd underpay their staff as usual but uhm. 17:16. Yeah babes that's blood. Usually a sign that their staff is working on too little sleep, and being overworked to get their products ready. We've seen it with countless webshops like these already. Iirc my first time hearing about this was in a Safiya Nygaard video about wedding dresses from Wish.
200 hundred for that RAG😂😂😂REFUND RED SLOPPY GARBAGE DRESS
maybe they forgot to make the last dress until the week before they sent it and were like OH SHIT WE GOTTA HURRY
Hr dress was pink the liting made it cang colors
If you’d like a better Ari dress you could maybe contact micarah tewers it would cost way less and look better
its oskr(os ck er)
12:58 “you will definitely know this one” me: what is thay
The red dress look like gift wrapping gone wrong
The Ariana Grande dress is actually good
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 so funny
The red dress. 😂 you bought a $200 cat toy!! Kitty is enjoying it
you were ROBBED😭😭 ITS PAINFUL
Lol! I bet they customize the dresses so you can’t return them.
GOD IS A WOMAN
I like the last one a bit slight lighter than the og but the pattern resembles the og the most, the armour 😂😂😂 my goodness but for that price they couldn't included the gloves too
I have to agree with Vincent on that pink one 😂 looks like a dress made like for me when I age regress. Love pink as you do too Naomi but it doesn't do it for me; they did you dirty on that one but still cute dress I guess....for someone regressing to 2 years old...uh...me🤷🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️
You look sexy on the green one guurrrlll! Also rest in reeses pieces my soul at the train 🚂 part you did 😂
Best part of the video is the kittys❤
I adore that makeup look!
13:04 not me thinking it was Cinderella pink dress 😭
Don't feel sad/bad....... the dress that is meant to be a replica of Herminies dress,  isn't.  It's not even a good reproduction of "the" dress.  You are beautiful,  no matter what 😊
I hear german…😂
Ariana grande
Beautiful fun princess who is never afraid 💖💖💖💖
Your make is FIRE 🔥
Not the country boy vine reference 🙏🏼 i wish we were irl friends we'd laugh till we pee and die
You look so good without makeup specially lipstick
not the HERMIONE DRESS!!!! i am sobbing
hi
That ft emo looks weird doing this
Your makeup with the hair <3 ahhhhh
I love Vincent so much, reminds me of my best friend
Что за песня на 19:05, скажите пожалуйста?
Die Katzen sind der Knaller😂
Hermoines Looks like Barbie princess
THE ARIANA DRESS NEEDS A HOOP SKIRT!!!!!!! 🌟🤩🌟
Hermione's dress looks more like sleeping beauty's at first glance TT
Ariana Grande thumbnail >
Hdufhiensj
Its sad that they trick people so badly...imagine if you did buy the dress for something very special and spent the 500 you had saved for a year or even 2 yrs like some do, how sad would they be😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 I'm glad you will donate to someone who can't afford a dress for their prom, or maybe even a garden wedding if they don't want a white dress...❤
You should dye every "pretty but not in this colour" dress you've bought before
Oh I think I just ripped something. *scoots away*  Lmfao  You're so funny
First one, some minor alterations it could be an ADORABLE little summer dress. And personally I'd use the sash as a belt and put it in a bow.. totally cute. The second one, if it was a smidgen darker and the slit was a little less.. in your face. Would be stunning.  The third one.. looks as though someone just slapped dome fabric on a mannequin and called it a day... The forth one, what have they done to my girly's dress?! 😔 I've seen Halloween costumes with better quality! 😢 The fith and final, so floofy and cute! I think I looks quite cute on you, personally 💕
hello can you say what's the song's name 19:07 ? I can't think of it and it's crazy 😅 thank you ❤💋
Her bf is so fucking annoying and cringe bro like let her be
Vincent looked fucking fantastic though
the harry potter pink dress gives aurora (sleeping beauty) vibes
19:42 that smile tho 😍😊 Vincent you're looking good in that poofy dress, and Naomi as always beautiful in everything 😊
You look more good without makeup ❤
OMGGG KNEW IT YOU CAN SPEAK GERMAN !!! 😍
Hair and Makeup is giving Harley Quinn ❤😍🤩
Fart
$10 to customize a dress is crazy cheap
i new it was going to be in the harry potter dress
I love this videos!! XD XD XD
arianas dress was 1299 dollars its now worth 500
For the rhiana dress I totally understand why yours was of bc they make the dress to match your skin tone bc if you don't you'll end up like how I did
i love the business walk u should do it in every video its so funny xD
Love the last dress but doesn’t worth 500$
I love you
When I tell you that I’m hollering, screaming and roaring with laughter with the whole Hermione dress segment. I couldn’t breathe 😂😂😂 RON YOU STUPID….😂😂
HARRY POTTER btw I love the hermone dress I wanna have it but it is a off brand
For the Ariana dress you want a hoop skirt it's the really big ball room skirt
Watching these dresses as a tailor and cosplayer is PAINFUL
The way I laughed when she started singing the hp theme 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
You should do marlyn manroe outfits or makeup
i love the chili body slam.
I should hv one of ths...but im soooo far away....n the ship n stuff..... Are demanding A LOTTTTS LOTSSSSS OF MONEYYYYYY😢... Only in dream for me n myself 😅

That red dress was clearly Chili’s favorite.
Vincent in this dress is actually pretty gorgeous 😅
Fruchtfliege 😂
ironically I’m watch Harry Potter rn
19:22 to 19:33 WAS EPIC 😭❤
I am a new subscriber and I have to say I love you I have been binging your content
HAHAHSSHSSHSHSH I LOVE TO REPEAT ALL THE VIDEOS, THIS ONE IS ONE OF MY FAVS EVER 😂❤
oh my gosh what is the lip product you’re wearing 😍
Hermione dress is hideous, it looks like they just stick the part with supper glue
I love your makeup so much!!!! Do a makeup Tutorial!!!!
Hey why don't u do a video on your music video dresses I mean that would pretty interesting and I wanna know where u get them from 😅
the hot pink dress could've worked fine if that belt thing was also hot pinkish
15:13 caught me off guard
Her makeup is so beautiful
the cats >>>>
You are beautiful I bet you are gonna get married someday
The dresses are ugly but you look like Harley Quinn
😱😍😍
First time watching her, she talk SO MUCH
Kylies is cute ngl
You’re invited to my wedding lol
I really love the way you say Tresh and your business walk
OBST FLIEGE 🪰 👹👹 PAHAHAHA I’CANT 😭😂😂
Best sharing. I like it. Cheers
14:42  the best hermione doop
Can someone please tell me that which song she was singing at 16:56
She's really beautiful without exaggerated makeup 🥲 I advise you to give it up ♡
Omg the business walk gets me every time😂
Her clearly wearing one of Ariana’s most iconic looks and singing one of her most famous hit songs Him: *OOoooooHhHhhh My GoOOaaddd your miles cyrUuusss* Like srsly bfs don’t know what they saying sometimes lol😂😂😂😂
This girl is all types of fun
The cats had fun! Mine would had loved the dresses and to poke holes into each of them.  We both live in Germany and do any customers service will feel awesome. There is no other country that has such bad customer services all over the country.
You should collaborate with @Seamstressed she could totally fix most of these!
I thought the pink dress was supposed to be princess peach😂😂😂😂
9:55 LOVE YOUR CAT <3
4:30 maybe because you payed alot already
Ahh ich liebe deine Videos!😍
13:50 THE LAUGH HAHAHHAHAH
the level of quality is INSANE some look incredible and others just look thrown together LOL
Anyone gon talk abt her creepy face make ip
omg I would definitely be grateful for that Ariana grandes dress, my prom is coming up and I have no idea what to wear, however Arianas grande dress is one of the dresses that I would dream of it. if you are donating it to anyone I would defiantly be so happy about it :) FYI I loveeee poofy dresses.
Ari’s dress is amazing. If I could go back to my 2014 prom I’d 1000% wear this but definitely needs the gloves 😅  Ps sorry Naomi I’m binging your vids rn 🖤
ℹ love u
The pic of Marilyn Monroe on the website 🤦🏻‍♀️😭
😂😂😂 okay as bad as these dresses are the amount of hilarity and fun you had with each one, especially the hermione dress, was a pretty good outcome. Still expensive for trash but if the trash makes you have this much fun then I think it partly redeems itself lol
The last one is amazing and if you would show up to prom like that everyone would give you compliments
My moms a Taylor and even tho the dresses arent really perfect or come close to the originals, they are a good deal for the prices. Customized dresses are shit ton of work lol
what in the germanys next topmodel   Vincent said one time
i love your accessories where do u get them from?
Anyone else die when she yelled “Ron! You bastard” 😂😂
12:25 vincent looks like a tired mom trying to dress their child
These dresses looks like are made by someone who just learned how to sew and decided to start their first project with these dresses. Ngl but my mom can definitely make them look good if I ask her to make me one
"Hermione's dress" is just absolutely horrible
I really love your song...that's hot. The lyrics hit me the right way!
1 Rihanna  2 Kylie  jenner  3 hairmini granger  4  Arianna  grande  5 IDK
8:14 Omg you have Nezko phone case!!! So cute! ❤❤❤❤
15:33 you have no idea how excited i am ever vid for this ❤😂
They even threw princess Diana in the 2022 section 🤣
C’mon girl. $160 for a customized dress is dirt cheap. This price point indicates that sweat shops employing underaged kids are going strong in China.
i just recently came across your channel and i’m so surprised i didn’t come across it sooner. your videos are so spot on and entertaining and your personality and laugh is contagious 💗💗 keep doing what you’re doing, i can’t wait to see more :)! all the best to you, your kitties and Vincent 💖💖
if you wanna do a kpop ver, go to fashion chinga or whatever
the poses are giving me life 😭😭
13:49 😭
you are awesome! i love to watch you :)
The green dress was super flattering from the back, too back the front looked like....that.
Der shop be like  quelle vertrau mir bruder
I missed the business walk.
I missed the business walk.
In 15:32 Naomi found out she will be Hermione + kangaroo
Ok the whole video I can’t stop looking at her eyes the eye makeup is ✨B O O T I F U L✨😊
i can’t focus this make up is INSANE !!!!
I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time!!
who is vincent? i thought they were dating???? no? yes? is he naomi’s brother or bro??? please helpppo
Haou do you do  your makeup 💄
Can we all just appreciate that her intro was her beating up a fly for us so wholesome Naomi🥰🥺🪰
You should have tried the dresses with heels.
Ee len ye china k maal pe belive kr rahi 😂😂😂😂
You did the ugliest makeup
Lagoona blue
Ohh das erste Outfit ist vom style her aber sehr niedlich. Nur wieder Mist Qualität XDDD
Wait u speak German?
I know a lot of people didn’t like the Hermione dress but it was one of my favorites. Maybe I just really like the ruffles and the baby pink color though lol. And wanna experience that like Hermione moment like Naomi was saying, wearing her dress
18:30 "girls or boys" :³
You should really return them and get your money back.  You got robbed, girl.
So this is a site who légaly sale counterfeit... Well...
🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Wow waisted so much money on dresses 😂
your voice is very very beautiful😭😭😭✨✨ 13:02
You can get a better hermionie dress at universal studios ❤
15:13, I choked on my food🤣
The red dress looks like a half arsed wrapped present 😅
There are soooooooo ugly
The Sia bow joke I laughed way to hard :))))
Lol I see the inspiration from Mia Maple channel 😂
I’m just staring at the different elements of your eye makeup 😳
I wonder if you could dye the Hermonie dress a dusty darker pink and salvage it lol
the villan moment😂😂😂
The dress that arrived late reminds me of cindy lu when she got wrapped up in christmas wrapping paper XD
Not to be gross but Naomi has the cutest body like her proportions are just adorable
The fabric looks so cheap 🥴
* singing an ariana grande song * OMG YOUR MILEY CYRUS
You’re so unfunny it hurts.
14:27 & 14:34
Why does the Arianna dress at the end fit Vincent better 😭😭
Wenn You showd the ariana dress i Flipd auttt 😅😅
❤
The business walk is what keeps me coming back! 😎
I could spend $500 in my country and get a better dress tbh 😂 i am disappointed at the $500 dress there
That ending, though. About the prom. That was beautiful. I love you. 💕
Absolutely lost it at 15:32 😂❤
Vincent got my respect for mentioning Evelyn hugo.🙇🏻‍♀️
I’ve been watching for a while now and I need to just say, Vincent is FINEEEE
when she came out with the Hermione dress and said, "you guys will know this one" and all I thought of was princess peach
16:38 for some reason I'm obsessed with her singing in the part lol
I feel like Naomi is super biased against products from China because every time she mentions Chinese products she always assumes the quality is bad. But actually, not all Chinese products are bad. You just get what you pay for.
Ich lieb sie AHAHAHA
15:13
She was going to say stupid bit
I thought the Hermione dress looked like sleeping bueaty dress
At 12:59 your ahhhh was so good i tried it and it was like me screching a steel plate😂😂
It’s just your makeup the dresses are pretty
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻💐🙌❤️🇬🇧
Hi :)
Hair be giving nene yashiro vibes 😋😋
19:23 what is the song name 😢
Girl get ball gown and it will be absolutely "same" as arianas grammy dress
At least your cats liked the red dress 😂😂
The first one is kinda cute but too see through 😊
0:06 I died, the rest of the video was watched by my ghost.
you have been recommended to me. I thought I wouldn’t watch because I don’t know English “thank you translator in the keyboard” but after watching 5 minutes I couldn’t switch it on, turned on the subtitles and finished watching to end. you are very cool thank you for cheer up ❤️ I have to subscribe  hello from Ukraine
I love how honest you are
She's got a voice
Ok but the Harry potter impersonation was so spot on
I feel like the green dress was less of the makers fault and more of just a bad style on basically everyone
12:04 hahaha i’m dead poor baby 😂😂
Girl that makeup is a mess.  I honestly can’t watch because of it
I love naomi's dance
عجعجعج
6:15 she tries the outfits on
У вас талант в сфере макияжа🥰😍
Lmbo, even after you said Hermoine wore that dress, I still couldn't place it! .. _Wow_ that's bad. Looks like Sleeping Beauty
i actually thought all the dresses were really nice. for being a replica i would say it’s not identical but it’s pretty close (except for the hermione dress lol) but everything still looked very good! the prices were insane though
I love ur music and u are such an amazing singer
Omg I think that was me who sent that
hermiones dress with the straps pulled down looks like auroras (disney princess u know) dress waoow
✨ 15:32 ✨
as a queer person, i just wanna say i was so happy to hear you including the possibility that a boy would like to wear those dresses as well as you talked about donating them; we love an inclusive queen
The best thing about the last dress ( the one that arrieved last.. 😆 ) was the Cats! They had a ball there 😜😹💃🏼
For the green dress, it does look to be the same pattern for the top half. Although without seeing the seams on the sides and back it is hard to know 100% if it matches. The biggest difference is what you said: plastic surgery and then the side seams or back seams likely made it more fitted to her shape. She also appears to have the more fabric bunched up on her torso so the dress may be lifted up more on her  You could add some foam padding to the dress if you really wanted to have it mimic her body shape more.
I got like the same body shape apart from the chest 💀
0:17 me trying to explain why I’m itching:    Btw I was on holiday recently and I don’t have lice I think my scalp became easily irritated
German moment
I'm laughing so hard and how far gone the herminies dress is..the only reason I knew is bc you were singing the song
$200 😱😱😱 the boobie pads super exposed.
The second dress does look like it fits well and the color looks the most accurate
I love the celebrity dresses oh but they charged $130 for some see through cheap material oh no
I like how Vincent just randomly lies on the floor and just accepts his fate
❤
“Focus on me. F-f-focus on me” I thought you were having an IT/chicken moment. It startled me a bit. 😂
absolutely LOVED the make up!! such a talent
Heyy! I was just wondering if u could do a video on trying dresses like bridgerton, like victorian rich era london dresses?
Ariana grande dress my fav love you
I thought the Hermione’s was a princess peach dress haha
Je t'aime le meilleur youtuber j'ai ta chaîne et ton maquillage est fantastique🌸😭
wenn du deine stimme dunkler machst (z.b. brim ariana kleid) dann hörst du dich an wie morty in rick and morty als die eltern weg gehen und rick & summer ne fette party schmeißen und zeilupi (oder zeitlupius?) faxen mit morty macht
The last dress is actually really pretty
That red dress could actually be fixed without too much trouble. It really could be pretty if the bows got a proper fluffing, the top was fixed to lay right and the red things hanging at the bottom...those just need removed. If you cant get a refund any seamstress should be able to make it wearable
Tbh thought the first one was supposed to be see through as a legit moment at first 😂
Maybe the person who made it knew it was supposed to be pink in the book? Either way I’m weak
15:26 u literally kill me every time 😭😭😭
I like the Ariana dress because it matches the hair.
The first purple dress wear lilac cycling shorts underneath! That’ll be so cute!!
I actually LOVE the first dress , if I could afford it I would deffo buy it
A mass-produced knock-off that costs $130 is less impressive than a haute couture gown that cost $150K? Amazing!
YOUR GERMAN ???
Okay but you fr look like Harley Quinn vibes in the pink Hermione dress
15:13 I’m dying 😭
the train sent me
That green looks AMAZING on you!  I don’t mean the dress…I mean the color
Not the Hermione dress 😭 At least it looked like the chest pieces were pretty well made, but how hard is it to have accurate colors.... and to actually put enough LAYERS OF CHIFFON, OMG.
I mean....the green satin was pretty but lacks boning like Kylie's dress. I love an emerald green satin. $500 on a dress means I have to 💗 *LOVE* 💗 it and that gray tulle just wouldn't flatter most ppl. All these folks in the comments talking about what a "steal" a custom dress is for $500, yeah right. With a pin sticking out of it. You could buy an off the rack dress for the same price that would look WAY better on you.
the hermione dress is just sad😭
The Harry Potter segments is amazing 😂
dress#1 could be used as a bikini cover
Why do I get clown vibes
I just love the cat pouncing from behind the end table as if the dress was something dangerous and he needed to sneak attack it. The cat doesn't like the dress and always listen to your cat.
14:29 could dye it maybe?!?
There is so much potential for all the dresses. A seamster really needs to get paid at least the price you have paid to make you a custom dress. Especially with custom measuring. But it seemed like they were in a hurry. The Hermoine dress would have been nice with a decent colour too. I just think these seamster should sell for quite higher price and then really take their time on the finishing touches and finding the right fabrics.
16:37 ATE THAT SHT UPPP
6:10 💀💀
U look kinda scary
0:19 same I don't thinks it's lice though cuz it's getting to my neck,ears, and even my back.....I need a doctor
🤣😂- Im OBSESSED with the BUSINESS WALK!! 🚶🏽‍♀️
I thought she said guess bitch dress it is-
Why was that whole Harry Potter section so wholesome and funny as hell 🥺🤣
The one at 1330 makes you look like a Disney princess 👌🏽👌🏽
I'm actually pleasantly surprised. The dresses still look nothing or at best only marginally like the original and for the price the quality is definately way too low. BUT it could have been so much worse!
Dye the pink dress
I will forever sing that part with.... ain't got no fish for surpriiiise
the hermoine dress just looks like a rip off sleeping beauty costume
17:05
Turqin qursineeee razdrajat qb tawadin🥰🥰
Kakashi tattoo?
if you dyed the last dress purple it would look lovely ngl
I love how you sing woooOOOoo
I almost feel like these are from Wish.
Du weißt nicht wie sehr ich mich über das ariana kleid freuen würde aber ich komm nicht aus berlin </3
Am I the only one who thinks that she looks like hyuna at 10:41?
HAHAHAHAHAHHA ICH SCHWÖR DU HAST SOOO EIN HÄNGERRRR HAHAHAHA DIESER HERMINE TEIL HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I NEED THAT ARİANA DRESSSSS!!!!
This was so bad but so funny I definitely think this website is illegal
Naomi gorgeous voice! She can actually sing i can tell.
I just love you and Vincent! You guys friendship gives me life. Seriously I will just throw on a video and just laugh. Thank you Mama 🥦
Celebrity dresses from 2022! *shows photo of Princess Diana*
"They could probably be sued...for....everything" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
15:39 this part naomi  is my spirit animal
Ur welcome thanks
I feel like they had a perfect replica at Universal Studios cheaper than that. Yowza!
You paid 1240$😭
Ain't got no fishes to fryyyy
Lmao, the way Vinsainto dancing in "Ari" dress at the end :')))))
You’ve spent 1150€ omfg
I WANT THAT ARI DRESS
The blue one is IT for you and the hair color
THE ARI PART😭😭😭😭😭
SLAY GIRL MAKE A WHOLE HARRY POTTER SERIE
SLAYYYY
LMFOA
NAOMI I SWEAR U GOT ME IN TEARS
15:14 help I’m scared
Next video: trying to buy celebrity’s actual dresses
Why did I think that the Ari one was Cinderella’s dress
How did you know I was looking for your nipples? 🤣
I think, the Kylie Jenner dress was sone very well.  It's just the difference between what it looks like on the body of a lovely, natural woman and the plastic design of a modified woman, who is probably wearing a lot of shaping garments underneath it.  Also keep in mind that hers was professionally pressed, and yours was straight out o' the sack.  That makes a big difference.  Press that and accessorize it, and it would look great on you for a special event.  That red one looks like it was from 5 Minute Crafts.  "What do you do when you have to go to a gala event and only have a hot glue gun and an old shower curtain?"  That was bad.  I hope you got the money back.
Do you resell clothes🤩
I'm here for the first time after watching Mac's video he did from your inspiration and so far I gotta say, delightful stuff!
hey I'll take the Ariana dress 😏
Oh wow Naomi got ripped offfff 💸💸💸
to avoid copyright law suits creators have to have at min 13 differences within the imitated creation.  so dresses on these knockoff sites will have differences.
Well we know that pink one if you ever want to be Princess Peach you got the dress and all you need is the gloves and the crown
Maybe the customized option meant that they're gonna make it from scratch with all your measurements??? And the other one, the reason why they asked is so that they can possibly alter the M size to fit you much better????
loveee your makeup
Why is Vincent giving me Klaus Hargreeves vibes?
15:13 💀
the "HAHRRY POTHHER" part from below had me rollingggg
my scalp is dead🤌🏼🤣🤣
No ones gonna talk about how her makeup looks so goos and thats not 1 time ALWAYSSS shes so pretty<3
She needs to wear platforms or heels when trying on the dresses. It gives me anxiety when she steps on them, I dont want her to fall!
15:14 this is just nightmare fuel, thank Naomi
When she started singing harry potter I was honestly confused. Then she revealed it was supposed to be Hermione's dress....😮‍💨
My broke ass cannot handle to see you wasting *that* much money on these pieces of crap! Seriously they look so cheap.
The real Ariana Grammy dress costs 100-300 thousand dollars so for 500 dollars I think that’s ok 😭😭
I was always jealous of the pink dress the girl wore in “my date with the presidents daughter” I always wanted that pink dress. But now they sell that exact type of dress on every cheap fashion website 🥴
The last one was really pretty
Was I the only one who understood "Male exchange" instead of "mail exchange"? 😫
THE BUSINESS WAAAAAAALK
Love your makeup it’s so pretty
literally the minute you came out in the green dress, my brain went "EVELYN HUGO" lmaooooo
🤌🏼
The Rita Ora one is horrible, but the og is as well so... They nailed it lol
That green dress is stunning on you. It fits well also !
I just can’t stop laughing 😂 the energy of this video it is so chaotic that I just love it 🥰
I love your videos!! Your amazing:]
Naomi! This look is super cute! What did you use for the lips? I really like that combo
HONEST TO GOD IDK HOW I FOUND HER but im NEVER LEAVING 💓🤪
you gotta do that business walk thing again😂😂😭   Update: she done that at 15:33😂🤚🏼
Lmao the air punches had me laughing sm 💀💀
lol i got my prom dress off that website and it was actually the christina aguilera (from burlesque) dress that u showed on the website. the quality was pretty good and i was very satisfied, mainly bc it was a unique dress and i didn’t spend $200+
LOL i actually ordered my prom dress from this site, I got it from the prom dress section so I didn't get a celebrity dupe, they had their own designs, and it was actually quite nice!!! I mean most people were paying $500-700 for their prom dresses and I paid like $120 lol so it was pertty good lol
When you did the business walk in the Harmonie dess, I died. 💀💀💀
I love the red dress
Hey Naomi i wanna dye my hair in a fun colour but I can’t find bright colours in dm etc, so where do you buy your hair colours ?
The pink gown , 😱ive seen Hopescope wear that .. i just forgot the title of the vudeo... Is the exact pink gown she wore .
I've been watching this girl for 2 years and i am still confused if Vincent is her boyfriend or gay friend.
I think ur supposed to wear a corset with the green dress
You always make my day ☺️💕💕
TRY SHEIN NEXT!
IM SORRY 500 DOLLARS KDJXHD WTH
that chili at the end💀💀💀💀 im dead
Hello Naomi you should get a few outfits / shoes from Sugar Thrillz 🫶🏻
Hello Naomi you should get a few outfits / shoes from Sugar Thrillz 🫶🏻
Shiny cartoon dresses is just latex clothes Naomi lol. And fetish shoes.
No one:  Absolutely no one: Naomi: shuffles in Harry Potter
I SAW THE ONGINA MOMENT
“They also cat-fish you on the time” that have me weak😭
The song is awesome, and the music video is just flawless too. I loved it! This video was also so great :) Your makeup is this video is *chefs kiss*.
the Ariana one looked stunning! so expensive tho
“Evelyn Hugo” YAAASS QUEEN
I'd love to see a review of the RocknDoll store! They ship worldwide :)
Omg ur phone case is amazing
Omg I can’t believe how much you spend on essentially glorified garbage … it’s both iconic and horrific
I would say that maybe if we compare the prices you have paid with the original prices. They are not too bad.
So I was wondering if you could buy from VampireFreaks ik its not your style exactly but I think it would be cool if you tryed some of there clothes
The Sean Paul impression. I’m dead 😅♥️
Why are you not broccoli rating anynore???
Vielleicht bei dem Rihannakleid noch einen pinken kurzen Petticoat drunter? Dann steht es richtig ab, wie im Original und man hat mehr Stoff, was den Poschi bedeckt :D
I just noticed something. I was in Croatia last week and I was at a bar in senj and the bartender looked like Vincent just with a buzz cut
Make more cooking vids plsssssss!!!!
Loved this 😂
Loved this but what we need more, is Vincent in more dresses
wtf cringe
13:27 why does this dress look like princess peach's dress XD
They turned poor, poor Hermine and turned her into Aurora.
Vincent kinda slayed though in the Ari dress 🤣
The Hermione dress gets better the longer she wears it lmao
The Ariana dress is really good! LOTS of tucked fabric, that takes time and effort to sew ($$$), LOTS of fabric ($$$), and it captured the silhouette quite well and the color looks spot-on through my screen. If they sent the poufy underskirt with it (I think I heard that right), then that's even more fabric, more $$$. I'd say that's worth it as a dupe. The armor-boobs honestly serve decently well in place of a corset to give it that structure in the bodice that it needs. The fit is good. If you have a crinoline to put under the underskirt to really get the volume, I think you wouldn't be disappointed buying this. I reeeaallllyyy hope the seamstresses got paid for their time and effort, and no doubt at least half of that price is the fabric alone.
Gonna be honest I actually dislike the hermione dress from the movie to begin with lol. To be fair, I'm just seeing it now, I never watched the movie. The copy is WAY too pink, the dusty rose color was saving it a bit. I'm impressed with the amount of layers for the skirt frills, usually in Wish-quality garments you'd see like 3 frills.
The first one would be cute for $50, you can wear a nude slip underneath, it fits nicely... for $130? Like you said, for that price you could hunt clearance sales or consignment shops (I mean if the fabric is garbage then $20, but I'm assuming the fabric is a decent quality)
I wonder if they didn't have any ready-made dresses in the styles you ordered (in an M) so they figured "might as well just custom make it". that's my best guess
When you got Vincent to do the OOHHH YEAH 😂
Your facial expressions give me life.
I think the Hermione dress could be re worked into the CUTEST dress for a Ren Faire!!!!
Please do a ROMWE haul:)
I really miss the makeup tutorials 🥺
You’re one of the few creators who I’m comfortable listening to in front of my parents
Hermione's dress straight up looks like the pink Cindarella dress after the step siters tear it up hahaha
you just gotta love Vincenterella <3
I hope you sent these back!
Dear Naomi, Just to let you know after finish the new video on every sunday Im gonna rewatch all of your old videos. If you skip one sunday.. well its a marathon everyday for me until you upload a new one. Love you !!
Ich hab das Gefühl "Oscar" wird nur im Deutschen gesagt. Im Englisch sprachigen Raum sagen sie den offiziellen Namen "Academy Award", oder nicht?
Omg that red one that you said you wish had stayed lost??? I was cackling !!! Lmfao 🤣 🤣 🤣
14:42 my favorite part😂
They might’ve reached out to you about your measurements because you placed a large order and they assumed you were doing a review
You should recreate those with your local seamstress, they would probably do so much better lmao
🚫📹
my DREAM was to have ari’s grammy dress 😭 watching you live my dream through this video
my biggest flex is that i own a yule ball hermione dress from the harry potter tour in london
Dieser letzte punsh zur Fliege 😂😂😂 Und der Blick vorher 😈😂😂👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Can you bring back the 7day of mukbang (if that's how you say it )
the moment that she realises her name spelt backwards is i moan
I would ask for a refund for all except the last. Especially the one where you can see the cups and there was a pin! Not worth that at all!!!
I think the green one needs shape wear and it.would look awesome. Think its one of those dresses that need you to have an inhuman body
Absolutely dying at Princess Diana being in the 2022 section 😂💀
This girl is super annoying.  Couldn't get through the video
You should dye the Hermoine dress!
Evelyn Hugo!!! 😂 I love it. You’re hilarious
Und dir chinesischen ZwangsarbeiterInneh so: ☹️
The Sean Paul part took me out 😂🫣
Where did you get your pink anime girl Tshirt?? 👀
Du supportest Kinderarbeit, dir ist das hoffl bewusst🫠
fruity fly
The longer I look at Hermione’s dress the less I hate it so I mean
500 for this?!!!
The minute I saw the Hermione dress I thought “this dress needs the business walk”, and then she did it. Iconic.
LMFAO PLS “EVELYN HUGO” BIT WAS SO FUNNY, THEY DID NAOMI WRONGG, but like vincent as celia now??
Naomi singing Sean Paul was 100x more palatable than Sean Paul singing Sean Paul.
Lol you're so beyond cute and funny😂😭
13:51 💀💀
I mixed up Ari's and Rhianna's dresses and thought the Kardashian/Jenner dress was Christina's from Burlesque
I would love to have the Ariana grande dress😭😭
I LOVED THIS!!!!! Had me laughing thanku.
"Dresses of 2022"  Literally a picture of Diana 🤦🏼‍♀️
oh yes the amazing song we all know and love; Best Mistake by Sean Paul
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If nobody thought about 🐔Micarah Tewers after seeing the thumbnail, this will be me)🐔 Naomi, darling you need to meet her so bad🤘 P. S. Cool' makeup, fan of the new song bthw ❤❤❤
Wait.. I can’t be the only one who accidentally read ‘assh*le circumference’ rather than ‘arm hole circumference’ when Naomi was explaining the customization part 💀
I absolutely love that Vincent only got interested in the first dress once Taco was wrapped in it 😂🖤
I think most of these designers even if you had the tens of thousands of dollars to pay for the dress if the person isn’t a size 2 (I am not) they don’t want to dress anyone larger (not all, but many) so this is a way to get an awesome dress for those of us that are bigger.
well, not this dress HA HA HA HA xD
Das make hat was von nem clown
They know Evelyn Hugo!!!!!!!!
damn i would want that ariana dress but for 500 dollah crazy. no im a sad broke bitch
what is the songs she sang at 19:21 ????😭😭😭😭
Kannst du mal ein Video nur deutsch reden
Buff fliege HHA
I just hope you can return that
I thought the pink dress was Cinderella’s pink dress
ARE you VERY NiCE i LouE you ❣️🌻💘
I’m sorry but $130 for the first dress? It should not be see through…. LOL a few more layers of toole would have worked lol
So viel Werbung echt krass
Omg your new song is sooooooo good! You killed the video... well done 👏
Before Naomi donates the last dress, Vincent should recreate the Harry Styles photo shoot for Vogue with it! It looks perfect for that shoot
Naomi is actually so fine
Not me not recognising any of those celebrity dresses …
For arianas dress the top half was the same material at the real dress...
Oh and 34+35
Love ur makeup
The Kylie dress is so pretty
Your makeup is.. MAGICAL. I have never seen such magical and beautiful makeup look, GURL!! 10000000000000/10
Content suggestion. What if you try to salvage these dresses to make them look good and celebrity worable?
looove your new song and videoclip en bucle!!
Wenn man denkt, der Business Walk kann einfach nicht besser werden... Und dann sieht man die Lippe dazu <3
Naomi possessed by the cast of Harry Potter and Vincent ded on the floor 🤣
Please do a photoshoot in that last ari dress ... somewhere in a flower field or something 🥺🥰
You need to consider a photo's lighting, contrast, saturation, etc. I would never compare it to a photo especially if its a celebrity photo.
The business walk is my daily bread and water and air and light
kylie’s green dress was the same, it just doesn’t look the same due to the body shape
I love the Ariana dress! My absolute favourite of all time🔥
The hermoine dress has always been my dream to wear and when i saw it?...I did cry
naomi plssssssssssssssssssss do more cooking videos pls
At 0:07 she looks so confused HELP😭
Who else here has On Our Own constantly playing in their head? Me for sure <333
The hermoine dress looks like a cheap costume lol
사랑하 나오미 언니 <3
aww the lavender Rihanna dress is so cute on you. Kinda wish the color was more on point though lol
unsubbing
You look so fucking cute TF
i lowkey think you should try to dye the hermione dress the right colour :)
13:51 I died 😂😂😂😂
Wait isn't it counterfeit of designers dresses like... I recognized a Elie Saab dupe there and...I think it's still illegal to do that. I mean not only shady but really worth of...you know...jail
I understand everything i can speak German and English
15:21 "there is something that needs to be done in this dress" me a dumb bitch: "cry on the stairs?"
Omg, das Ariana Kleid war das aller schönste 😍😍 Omg, will jetzt auch dort bestellen 😂😂 Aber das ist dort ja voll die Glückssache, ob da was Gutes bei raus kommt oder nicht 💀  Mal wieder, wie immer, ein sehr unterhaltsames, lustiges Video 😂❤️ Ich liebe euch beide einfach!!! ❤️ Und liebe es wie eure Katzis immer mit machen 🥺❤️
It's been a long time since I last watched your video, and for some reason now your accent sounds different and so weird. i think you sound like Yelena from Black Widow .. no offended but you sound so cute tho
"what can you see.... Oh 😳😧"  😂😂
The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo reference 🫶🏻🫶🏻
☠💀 Angryhanna 💀☠
If nothing else, the tulle dresses are great cat toys!
I was actually anticipating the business wall the whole time lmfao
Naomi weee need foooodd Videosssss 😭😭😭😭💟💟
Das video ist woooo funmy wiedwr mal ahahahaha - liebe ja wieder chili und taco ne! Hab im oktober abiball imd wird mich SO UNGLAUBLICH DOLLE freun über das Kleid!!!
Like the first and last ones!
THE BUSINESS WALK AT ITS BEST
Oh, my god, that eye make up is so cute! 🤩
naomi should do a video where she DIYS the dream Hermione dress!! dye it, customize it, fulfill the fantasy!!
Ich hab die ganze Zeit gedacht das dein Ballerina hopsen fehlt und Zack da war es 😂👌
Aber schlau, maßgeschneiderte Sachen sind wahrscheinlich gar nicht vom Widerrufsrecht betroffen :-) oh maaaaan
I would love that ari dress
I was waiting for the 15:33 moment 🥦
Vincent you have great taste in books if you have read “ The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo” ( 9:15 ) that book is AMAZING
Ok hear me out...the Hermione dress looked like it had inverted nipples 😂
They sell the Yule Ball dress at the universal parks, like EXACT replicas, at Harry Potter world
I've been watching you for years and I still can't figure out if Vincent is your roommate or boyfriend. Lol maybe I've just never seen the video were its been addressed.
I was happy to know that you gift these dresses and it's not just a waste of money. That's sweet of you.
love your content
OK...the Sia "1, 2, 3..."  KILLED ME BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
15:14 😂😂😂😂😂😂
What in the Germanys next top model
if you bought them from micarah tewers they'd probably either be cheaper or just worth the price really because hers look awesome
Sighs…. How to be a fruit fly? 📝
i always wonder what happens with all those clothes she orders :D
the whole hermiony scene got me creasing lauging for about 20 mins hahhaha
miss maam was really feeling her oats in the areola grande dress and honestly, im living. pop off wig snap the chat sis for me
Ich frag mich immer wieder ob Sie sich auch mal  "Content" von anderen Youtubern anguckt....Vielleicht merkt Sie dann mal endlich was........Gut im Futter is se ja, bei dem zwei Kinnen!
Laura Lee used a website that made celebrity dresses and they were spot on plus at a great price!!! You should look that up (I'm sorry I don't remember the name!!!).
The only wearable dress was the ariana one
I LOVED HERMINE SM 🤣
The hunt for fruit flies in the beginning calls for Funny van Dannen! 😁 Every fruit fly makes me sing this song: https://youtu.be/Yug4Oe9UabQ  🪰🪰🪰🪰🪰
18:25  You should totally wear it❤
okay but NO WAY YOU ARE GERMANNN ayyyy
WHY DOES VINCENT LOOK GOOD IN EVERYTHING?!!!! like whenever he randomly wears something you ordered it just looks incredible
Yo, those prices. 3/5 Dresses look absolutely ugly. And the other 2 look either way cheaper than 50 $. 👀
Are you an Aries?
2017 is really old to you? honey… it literally wasn’t that long ago
not me thinking the pink dress was aurora's dress from sleeping beauty😭
Well at least she has a TON of options to wear for Halloween, with all the clothes she tries on. 🤣🤣🤣
the hermione dress is diabolical.
Noch mehr Werbung ging auch nicht 🙂
The harry potter spoof almost kill me
The Kylie dress at 9:20 DEFINITELY had boning and structuring in the bodice. The one you got does not, so that might be another reason why, despite it fitting well, it doesn't *look* like that sharp silhouette she had.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.    !…..
So we were all obsessed with Hermione’s dress?
The Harry Potter tangent..... omg lol
They should have at least thrown in the gloves for the Ariana dress..
Wie sieht dein Augenmakeup immer so uunmenschlich krass gut aus ?
No wayyy I literally watched goblet of fire like and hour ago (also I love u)😌
DYE THE DRESSES
I'm always so happy to see 💅🏼the business walk💃🏻
I will never tire of the business walk
Naomi this is why you're my favourite lmao when you were showing the Hermione dress, literally one of my first thoughts was, "damn I hope she does the business walk" but I couldn't figure out what bUsInEsS you'd be attending to with it so I thought my wishes would go unfulfilled. This is what I get for doubting you, you're a hero <3
Also you look amazing in the last one x
Your content is honestly the best your so funny x
YOUR MAKE UP 😍😍😍😍
“YOU’RE EVELYN HUGO” OMGGGG I LOVE BOOK REFERENCES LMAOO BUT THE DRESS LOOK STUNNING ON YOU SRSLY
But honestly... it's a look on Vincent. Like. Damn near perfection.
I think the first two look decent. And so does the Ariana Grande dress
I wish all these were in the next music video and you’d only know if you’re a broccoli 🥦
This is the first video I watched on this channel, and this is such a vibe.
Can we just appreciate Naomi’s makeup. She puts so much detail into each look and they all are amazing
Your new music video is the best one so far keep it up! The production of it was so good.
Otherwise I can give you some tips to fix all the dresses
Hi naomi, I love you and your videos ❤. I was wondering if you can give me one of that dress so I can fix it, and if you want you can have it back.
Okay but the singing for the Hermione dress was unintentionally gorgeous
and bitch i need a new ari song too
u definitely need to wear the last one someday!! looks great on u💗
Love the video
That's my girl right here
They butchered Hermione’s dress, but the last one looks amazing
12:04 🤣
Watch 19:43
Also the pink dress reminded me of something one of the evil step sisters in Cinderella would wear lol

I love the Ariana dress but that’s it. I really wish they had done the hermione dress justice some person would have loved to wear that to prom and feel like a million dollars.
Next video idea: let Vincent change the dresses. So they're wearable
Wenn du das letzte Kleid nicht möchtest, nähe ich es gerne um
i really enjoyed this video
I think if some of these dresses were taken to a tailor they’d look nice. The Kylie dress would look better with hip pads, and the Ariana dress would look better with a way bigger hoop skirt and maybe a petticoat on top
ok yall but just stop at the 15:15  😭😭😭 one of the weirdest thing i've seen today
Not me sitting in burgerking and geting my food stolen
You can wear purple under skirt.Duh
I love the ariana's dress
JJHouse makes wonderful dresses and they fit very well!
Maybe they personalized everything so you cant give it back aahh
This is hot garbage.
6:29 waaaaahhh 💖
Her makeup always slays- so creative and adorable just like her
I LOOOOVE your make up ⭐️👌🏻👍🏻
But they are like much cheapper that the celebrities have like paid more money of those.
Voldemort, Hermione... Who's next? 🤔
The green Kylie Jenner dress was a perfect dupe and looked amazing on you - you were just comparing yourself to a body with heaps of plastic surgery that was also wearing a tight laced corset so that’s why it looked so different. But I think it was really well made and looked fantastic on you and I lowkey wanna buy one for myself now
Hey Naomi, dein Musik Video ist auf Youtube ultra schwer zu finden, wenn man "On Our own naomi jon" sucht, kommt immer nur das Bts Video. Erst wenn man weiter unten auf der Suche etwas aufklappt, ist es zu sehen. Das kann nicht gut sein für die Reichweite :/  Aber vielleicht war das ja nur bei mir so
Make that 👗 dress purpal the last one
I knew exactly what was going to go down at 15:23 💀
The last one😍😍
I’m proud of myself for guessing Rihanna’s immediately when she came out with it on, I just thought as soon as I saw it “this feels so Rihanna” lol
BRO AT 13:03 THAT DRESS LOOKS LIKE PRINCESS AURORA’S (sleeping beauty) NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND
I just want to say half of the population in Israel is watching your videos just want to say you're amazing Creator I love all of you videos I bought your book and that's it😘😘😘
Everytime I try to say “The oskars”, I always think about my classmate since they also have the name “oscar” lol
I love how she still talks about her new song and I’ve listened to it, it’s AMAZINGGGG, but the point is 😂 she doesnt make her new song her whole personality!!! It’s so refreshing tbh
Pink white and blue programing..like a certain flag...stop brainwashing the kids...it's trending next to minecraft videos FFS!!!!
Everytime i eat broccoli i think of naomi. And then i say... i give this dish 3/5 brocollis because there wasn't enough broccoli to be a 5 haha
i would never have recognized it was hermione’s dress, even with your singing of the theme and me loving her dress as well, i had no idea LMAO
very comedy and cuteeeeeeee😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
What a mess
Naomi, despite all those dresses... For me you look like Sadie Sink ! (Idk, something in your face looks like hier)
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL WHOS THE BADDEST BISH OF ALL ITS NAIOMI ITS NAIOMI
do i want the ari dress so freaking bad? maybe
Loved your new music 💞💞💞💞
The last dress was GORGEOUS and when you’re tired of that color, dye it!
It is surprising how many humans do not feel they have the divine right to experience an abundant life. This is so sad, when you consider that true abundance isn't something bought, or given, it is something that is shared. Till at last we rise forever in the arms of perfect love.
I can’t with your impression od Jamie Foxx … I nearly choked 😂😂😂
I have legit got packages from china within a week
Wear a white tutu underskirt under and that first one is cute. Not worth 130 bucks. 😆 but cute as heck if ut was 25. Second dress,, a bit of tailoring and corset or girdle and it woud be lovely, not for 160. The Ariana dress is exactly like the original. I never liked the original tho. Lol. But it looks perfectly like the original. It is possible the dress was to boost your boobs up?  Trim the booby pads on the red dress. It loojs lovely on your body. I am never going to speak if the Hermione dress. Ever. Love your content.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.         !.  !.
Hi Naomi I love you content and I was wondering if you would try out the app cider I would like to see what you think of it
I'm glad u made this video. I was going to order a dress from there for my wedding. Now I will order from somewhere else
I actually got my grad dress on this site in 2014! It turned out so good and fit well. Plus it doesn’t hurt that it cost like $100 when everyone else spent hundreds on their dresses!
Who else thought of the pink dress as Zelda and not Hermine... Also... a blonde moment... I thought she was humming the Halo theme xD and not Harry Potter. lmao.
Bro, what's really such a stitch up is almost all the dresses you chose, Micarah  Tewers made by herself and it looked a thousand times better. The people from the dress shop should have just followed her tutorials, they're so simple idgi
Maybe they make it look off so that they dont get sued
I never clicked on a video so fast
❤ those cats!!!! They enjoyed this video a lot!
You talk to much and all none sense 🤢
u r invited to my wedding naomi<3
while is hilarious...
I started doing the business walk every time i walk down my hallway and I’m getting some gains 😂

at least the cats liked the red dress 😂
So....this is the new......huh.......nope
U put lip stick around your mouth and it looks amazing if I put lip stick around my mouth I look like a clown
Wtf the dresses are so crappy
YASSSSSS! The BUSINESS WALK! It gives me life. Lol 😂❤️
The first one was actually really cute. I could see a gamer girl type wearing it
part of the reason the kyie jenner one looked so bad is because the original had structure in the bodice instead of just fabric like the dupe
Actually, the last dress, the Ari dress, I think it would look amazing with a petticoat under it to give it more volume! :D
“RON! YOU STUPID B..ASTARD!” TOOK ME OUT I CANNOT STOP LAUGHING
NAOMI😂😂😂wat such of intro was that
IN THE WORDS OF MY DEARLY DEPARTED DAD (WHO DOES NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS CRAP TODAY, "THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM"!🖕😠😡😨😕😮😯
This was my introduction to you and I'm in love. Thank you for sharing!
13:50 PLEASE
I knew the bussiness walk was coming 😂😂😂
Rihanna dress would be cute with boots and a harness make it like a cuuute glam alternative look
Liked for: Your beautiful Harry Potter vocals ✨
✨She’s giving me 🦖-vibes in 11:15 ✨
Do you know which colourful eyeliner she's using? I'm still searching..
You are gorgeous, fun, expert at changing your look, your singing range is off the charts, love how you change up on the videos and the best is your personality! You are the best!
Guuuurl, i thought it was princess peach s dress XD AND ITS HERMIONE S !?
The whole world needs to just loosen up and do more " business walk" no matter where we go! You and Vincent are THE BEST!!
Taco and chili add so much to this video 😂
00:05 idk why but you looked like a Furby
✨Vincerella✨
Uh oh sorry but NONE of the dresses look close like the original.. only the last one is recognizable..
Me: why is Naomi running so weird  Realizes it's Vincent 😂😂😂💀
It kind of looks like used toilet paper or paper towel. But you don't have the gloves. The gloves are what pulls it all together! Lol
Are you German ? Such pretty dresses ✨
Every video, I wait for the business walk.
If you’re making a part 2 please try the Selena Gomez from the grammys or met gala 2017
Maybe you could make a video trying to dye the Hermione dress if you wanted to would be fun maybe
Bruh to me the Hermione dress is giving princess peach reject😭😭
The first one looks like a fairy dress I like it
these are actually very pretty
ITS #39 TRENDING AAAAH

15:13 I’m DYING 🤣🤣🤣
at least the cats loved the dresses 😁😸
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
Fruit fly prolly from Vincent’s bananas 😅
Naomi Jon doesn't realize this, but she's curing everyone's boredom
After seeing the first 2 dresses,I think, its all about the underwear. Ein rosa / lavendelfarbener Unterrock unter dem ersten Kleid, wie bei Rihannas Original, und Shapewear/eine Art Corsage unter dem grünen Kylie Jenner Dress und ich sehe beide an dir 😍
I can't I can't her voice is horrible her makeup is yuck nope can't do it not going to subscribe nope nope no way I can't stand her voice no too Goofy
I sew and I spent the whole video thinking of how to fix the dresses, but I like a challenge and I’m a bit of a masochist.
:))
Business WALK
I am so sad, that you didn't ordered the green Christina Aguilera dress from burlesque :((
The cats are enjoying all the dresses though
sad
The one dress I'm dying to wear (as a person who REFUSES to wear any kind of skirt/dress etc) is Baga Chipz 's bag puss look. I would wear it EVERYWHERE!
Watching your videos relieves my stress. You make me laugh❤️
Look who on trending?!?!?!? Congrats!!
I always love how Naomi spends so much money for these kind of things and then her first thought if she doesn't need them is to donate and giveaway them instead of selling them for a cheaper price. I know she actually earns money from YT and other things, but she's so genuine and I'm so proud and happy for her. she deserves the world and Vincent too💙
UR PHONE CASE IS SO CUTE
Tutorial on this look omg😝😍
Strewth! You look like a retired drag artist!!
Harmione's dress was the worst dress ever, but the other ones were not too bad
Omg I CACKLED badly at the Hermione dress bit
Why do i keep remembering Emilia Fart when Im watching this video lol!
The only thing I think about now is how similar Naomi and Max from the Stranger Things look 🥰
omg i made the mistake of watching this while eating and I choked from laughing so hard
I like Naomi Jon Wishing you happiness and success always thank you good night 👍😍
I’m getting so much Amanda seyfried vibes from Naomi in this vid
13:51 u are so done with this sh*t aren't u?!?
Im actually in love with the Ari dress and it’s perfect on you! But it’s sad that u don’t like it. And I hope you can give it a way to someone who loves it <33
Pls someone tell me she bought that blue dress which Selena wore
the ariana dress would be perfect for uni graduation omg
I need a free prom dress ...
I wanted to say, ‘this is a great option for people that can’t afford high end.’ But my beautiful prom dress was made well and cost less than the first dress. Many of these are so high price, and made so poorly, I can’t picture their target demographic. They could be cute with alterations or good slips, but that adds to the cost. I truly can’t figure out who their target audience is.
"oh you're Evelyn Hugo"  and all of a sudden i am here like yeeEESSS he knowwsss like i wrote the book or something 🤐
I actually laughed at "angrihanna" 😭😭
I gotta say, your makeup is amazing!
Am I the only one that noticed how clean their floors are!? Two people and two cats in one apartment yeah I see no hair on the floor. I'm so jelly!
Has anyone told you that you look like Sadie sink? (Max) from stranger things
Okay here's thing: Despite China being the source of many a cheap piece of clothing,  there's still a bunch of mid-tier brands that get their clothes sewn in there as well (or Banghladesh or India) usually under pretty awful conditions and awful pay... so I've started to wonder where *exactly* those clothes come from, because clearly they're still handmade (considering the amount of color selection and even the ability to enter your own measurements)!!  Like, *who* made it? What province in China do they come from, do they work in a big factory or a store?  I've also read that these online store fronts often have a bunch of smaller sellers who only make specific items, so that might explain why you get the items all shipped individually- there's no central place where all dresses are made and shipped off from.  imo videos like yours are enlightening in the sense that it shows that getting custom dresses like these for relatively cheap will result in meh to good results depending on how much money you spend,. They're still cheaper than any handmade celebrity dress replica would cost you here in Germany though!   Also, that makes me wonder what those smaller tailor stores you see here would tell you if you came to them with a pic of 2017 Rihanna and asked them if they could recreate her dress😂
Micarah Did it for 20 dolars 😆
The way you slipped in the ariana dress omfgggg😂😂😂😂
Naomi Jon x Hopescope collab???
I knew that walk was coming 😂
the first time I saw the Kylie green dress, I also immediately thought of Evelyn Hugo hahaha
there are a lot of missing undergarments in this try on oml, crinoline, slips, shapers etc... the blue dress and the short one in particular definitely require a petticoat or crinoline, and the green one needs a shaper under it if not a corset. it's not really fair to them if you aren't wearing the proper underthings.
They all look like unfinished tailored Disney dresses
The Hermione bit took me out oh mein Gott 😭😭😭
Whats the website i do Drag and i wanted to maybe have one customized
Micarah recreated the Kylie dress better than this website
15:30 not me cracking up imagining Hermoine doing the business walk down the stairs!
Micarah Tewers would make these dresses 10x better :D
Give it to a nearby high school or college for people who need prom dresses but cant afford.
Just wondering...what's happing with all the dresses? You got an extra apartment for them? 😂
You get a wedding dress then tie dye it... Duh! 😆
I think you need to give this lavender dress to taco, he’s so excited. 😂❤️
seeing hermione's dress made me wanna binge harry potter again
Hey Jenna 😊 Hope you’re doing well. I knew you’d be here haha
i really like your videos but i feel like these outfit videos are so problematic. it appears that these dresses were made under horrible conditions - made in china, for that price and you even found a pin in there which all of these points clearly indicate that the workers are under a lot of pressure. we shouldn't support this. ultimately you can do whatever you want to do, but it's very ignorant to complain about the quality of these dresses when they are obviously made in compulsory labor.
I thought that you forgot the business walk
I do think the last one is beautiful but doesn’t compare to the original one. The others were fully butchered !
L💜💙💛L
For second dress that (bow?) detailed needed to be higher.. in waist.. then it would look better.
IM CRYING “RON YOU STEWPID BAAASTARD”
How did she know 👀
don't get me wrong, these dresses are sad, but that's what I've been making ballgowns for years and that's exactly what I could do with a budget of 200 euro :/
Your video is my comfort zone of the day💗
The Ari dress was the best but for $500??? Omg!! I actually screamed!!🤯
So much money for such bad dresses! 🤧
Wear stuff you like that looks cute on you and stop giving a flying fudge about what some celebrity thinks.  Most of them have shit taste anyway.   The rest of them will flash every party of their body for all of us to see if it would get them some followers.
OMG ily you so funny
Just watched this 1 on fb and watched it again here 😅 anyways like i said u need to start ur own make-up line and i just wish they make a naomi dolls 💋💄
Mega geile Idee mit den Kleidern und dein Makeup ist wieder on fleek 🥹❤️
the sean paul impression made me wake my son up because I scream laughed XD
I think your hair grow really fast ... Am I right ?🤔
why does the green kylie dress look exactly like the one micarah tewers made?
"evelyn hugo!"
15:32 I waited for it 🤣
Maybe these aren’t supposed to be like super wearable , maybe like cosplay or dress up, halloween
I missed tresh and hey broccolis so much❤️🤭
15:15 love it hahahahah
Warum siehst du aus wie ein Clown 🤡
The way you start your videos is legendary
your makeup looks bomb af like always❤
Well, you're back to playing with the eyeliner again.  You had been doing better, but you must have had time to kill.  So sad and distracting to see you playing Etch-A-Sketch with your face.
15:33 what song?
"Wrong spell" lol 🤣
The Ariana one is pretty good!
I feel like the kylie jenner dress could ve worked if the top was part of the dress was tighter because it looked perfect down the button on Naomi it was just big on top
lol why’d I think the hermione dress was princess peach for a minute
Your lip combos are always the best
The whole Harry Potter part 😂😂😂
Naomi !!!! This post was needed babe thank you for the post 💕💋
why have you got trisha paytas' name in your tags for this video lol
you should see if vincent can fix them and make them better that would be a good video
This put a smile on my face, love you & Vincent! And taco & chili of course 😻 last dress wasn’t too bad, looked nice on you…& Vincent 😂
our bestie came to us!!!!!!!!🤤
Phewww I was getting nervous u weren’t gonna do the business walk 💁🏻‍♀️
Love your videos but girllllll it took half of your video to even get to the first look lol smh 🤦 idkkkk
Why doesn’t Vincent do a follow up video of trying to fix or at least make them Naomi wearable? - if you guys can’t return them… who knows they could make an appearance in the next music video
19:36 get it vincent hehe 😏
How ARE you 😉🤠😜🌹💍🌻💘
Love the new single!
You are so funny lmao 😂 I need to make my videos exactly like this 🤣🤣👌🏼
What will you do with them after this video, I'm curious to know.
The Ariana’s doesn’t come with the gloves?
"What in de germanys next top model" lol vincent had me dying 😂💀
hi im sorry for the self promo but im a tiny channel and i just changed my niche so im getting almost no views which like kinda sucks so if you swung by and left a like or interacted in some way it would literally mean the entire world and a half to me. also naomi i love your channel and your new song is a massive bop<3
12:20 That dress looks like cinderella's dress after the step sisters ripped it off 😂
literally LOVE the makeup look naomi! your so talented, i could never
I appreciated the Evelyn Hugo reference SO much 😍
it’s the way i tried to guess every dupe before when u tried them on and got every single one wrong lmaoo 😭 they look so different
I love it when you do the business walk 💜💙💜💙
Vincent knowing Evelyn Hugo made my whole life
Put hair masks in your hair while you wear wigs
The ari dress is so cute 😍
Can you even send any back to get a refund? And since they were suppose to be replicas yes they were still way to much $$ for what you got 😬
You are 100% invited to my wedding in November! 🥰🥰 There, now you have at least one invite!
i apprecriate that you said girls or boys, instead of just girls 🥰
Hermione‘s dress looks like auroras dress lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Vincent should make a hot ass jacket outta that Ariana Grande dress!!! 😭 😍
I wonder 🤔 Perhaps they made the dresses look different so that they are still recognisable, yet legally distinct? Maybe it's a copyright measure? Or they are just a bit shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The business walk BAAAAHAHAHAHAHHAA 🤣 I was waiting for it!
Laura Lee did a similar video.  hers were amazing.  maybe find out where she got hers and you can try again.
your make up i a masterpiece,i’m amazed with every look of yours! queen🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
I love how creative you get with your makeup nomie
Heidi‘s lied hat mich gekillt 💀
Girl don't be shy about your undies showing through dresses. We almost see your whole vajine in your music videos! Kekeke
You should do flips of the stuff you get that you dont like
You look SO CUTE with your hair like this 😭😍😍😍
the hermoine dress COULD technically be redeemed, if you bought some plum colored dye, dilute it, and then dye the dress
The first one would be hella cute with fishnets under it and platforms. maybe a leather jacket or a knited sweater.
Yes!🥹   Please do more 7-day cooking challenges I’ve binged through all of them now🤣❤️
what do you do with all the things you buy that arent useable?
The last one is nice
You’re song is amazing! I’ve been jamming to it since it came out (mostly in my car 🤣)
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY TEUTA MATOSHI DRESSES BC THEYRE BEAUTIFUL AND SO ARE YOU PERFECT COLLAB
VINCENTDERELLA
Never seen kylie’s picture with the green dress but she looks stunning
i just love how naomi laughs to her own jokes and making us laugh in the process 😂
Harley Quinn vibes from the first one with your hair and makeup it’s perfect
Honestly the Kylie one with a little cinch would be a great dress
16:48 😭😭
The On Our Own video was amazing!
Idk... the first dress isn't THAT bad ... despite the flaws. You could wear something under it... some lavender boyshorts or a lavender mini skirt and a matching tube top. could easily sew the tube top into it so it doesnt move around. but yeah for the price they could have at least lined it. xp
My favorite youtuber.I love you naomijon.stay gorgeous  and funny.Your song makes me feel like a bad ass hehe
fffucck finally a try on video
DAMN ARIANAS DRESS IS SO GOOOODDDDDDDD
I thought when you were wearing the pink dress you were supposed to be aurora
If you keep any of these - what about having a local seamstress alter it to make it more wearable? Like that green dress. (Or clothes from another video… like “making questionable clothes work for me”.)
You're like the only person I watch on YouTube whose videos I actually enjoy no matter the content  Also ariana's dress looks kinda authentic and cute also Rihanna's is nice you just gotta wear an under skirt 💁🏻‍♀️
Try to dye hermiones dress a darker color!
also I love that you're thinking of donating them for kids proms ❤
You should definitly try to copy the celebrity pictures with the cheap dresses 🤣
I love how much fun she has making these videos
this video made me laugh so much ☺️
Gosh you are so funny😂
@naomijon  Love ur vibes lol u remind  me of me lol
girl next time just ask micarah tewers
You're just frickin adorable 🖤
The color of the Ariana dress looks great with your hair color though!
The Harry Potter skit was everything I dreamt and more!
I really missed uh naomi ❤️🥺
can u buy actually high quality ball gowns :3
Im watching this drunk at 00:29 in the morning (UK) I love your videos I hope you’re having a good day gworl🫶
I think they wouldn't be sued because it's pretty hard to protect creative rights when it comes to fashion
ich finde ari kleid garnicht so schlimm, würde das kleid so tragen
Omg can we just give a moment to give that make up look a round of applause cause it is giving for sure. Make up tutorial please
not vincent casually lying on the floor 😂
100% screenshot 15:15 😂😂😂😂
I saw someone else do this (i think it was Mia Maples dont quote me on that) and there dresses looked much better. Almost exact replicants.
the first one is GORGEOUS I WANT IT SO BAD
du könntest die selben kleider ja bei einer schneiderei in Auftrag geben und mit den kleidern von der seite vergleichen^^
Thank you for genuinely making me belly laugh and snort like a pig. 🐷 😂
Naomi!! Could you please test the crystal hair eraser by mybleame 😭🙏 I’ve been thinking about getting it and you’re the only reviewer I trust!!
Naomi what happens to the outfit you buy for video purposes? Where do they end up or what do you do with them? Surly you’ve run out of space- right?
Obsessed with your voice and laugh
I wonder what you do with all those clothes you ordered. I hope you do something sustainable with them because you have lots of videos trying on lots of clothes. 😄
going crazy really want that top
anyone know where the tops from in the beginning?
where top from you wore in the beginning of the video !?
That has nothing to do with wigs
Not worth the money at all. Hope they get sued....
Micarah Tewers would make better looking dresses using chicken feathers and some bedsheets
You sometimes remind me of Jenna Marbles and you know what? I absolutely adore Jenna Marbles. I love a genuine character 💚
The Harry Potter dress looks more like sleeping beauty’s dress. Or at least more then Harry Potter
Most of them don’t look good at all even though they’re dupes. They could do better. Only the Ariana dress was nice
You should teach us how to business walk lol, also i love your videos <3
Definitely not worth the money
I always wait for the business walk
The green dress would actually be nice if it was tailored properly. The top just desperately needs to be fitted, maybe add some structure to it. That Hermione dress, though? No. Just no. And the weirdly visible boob cups on the red dress are just hilariously bad!😭
The Harry Potter dress 😂😂😂
The Brighton experience for the last dress. ❤️❤️❤️
I hope you returned all these dresses otherwise what a stupid stupid waste of money …….
We misss youuuu 😍😍
love the makeup
Omg 😂😂😂Lachflash 15:13
I really! …… Utterly! ….. TOTALLY! …. Enjoyed, this video and ur concept! But it honestly makes me wanna cry adding up all the money u spent on all these dresses! ESP bc we all know ur never going to be wearing them again! And most likely no one else will ever wear them neither unless in return con Someone else into buying one of them! And even if u GAVE them away … I know I can’t honestly see anyone ever liking any of them enough to actually wear one of these to a special occasion neither! … except for the LAST DRESS 👗 that is! It’s just sad knowing all the wasted money! Wasted fabric on the suppliers behalf! Sigh! I’m just envisioning all that tool at the waste plant aka the dump, taking 300 yrs to disintegrate! And I can’t help but think of all the starving people that that money could have fed instead! Or all the struggling families out there…. That that grand could have been life altering for them and their entire families INSTEAD :(  But I honestly did enjoy ur video tho too
The last dress in my opinion (the one no one asked for😂) is the best and mosttt identical to the original dress❤️
Ok I def tried looking for ya nips in the first dress 😂 sobthatvwas funny when you told us to stop looking for them because I guarantee we all were! Your cat hiding inside the green dress was the CUTEST!! 😍 Oh, to be a cat! The Ariana dress is HANDS DOWN the best! I love the bpob armor because it helps shape is so much better. They did a great job on that one! Your music video turned out amazing and I loved watching the making of it! Looked like a lot of work, but also a lot of fun with awesome people! Also this video was fun! You always come out with banger ideas!
You could use these for Halloween costumes since the have a DIY vibe. The pink on could be Aurora and you could make a vampire thing out of the red ribbony one with some blood and glitter.
This was a funny video. I laughed a lot. Especially at the Harry Potter scenes 😂
Would be a cute series to try fixing these dresses! They seem *fine*, just slightly off enough to make them ugly... Vincent make it happen!!!
wow yt really got me in a dark corner of youtube algorithms I gota get tf out
Every cat I’ve had loves pouncing in a pile of tulle. I got them like 10 yards and balled it up. Endless fun and it keeps them out of my fluffy dresses! 🐈‍⬛🐈💕
the green one really needed the shape wear
Okay but when Vincent wore the Ariana dress it kinda reminded me of the one Harry Styles photoshoot
I don't respect blatant plagiarism, but considering how many thousands of dollars the original dresses cost and how many hours likely went into them, I think the results were pretty good! And honestly with how much work it is to make a dress I still think the prices on these were pretty low (likely due to underpaying the workers). It just seems so expensive because we're used to Shein prices, where the quality and craftsmanship is significantly worse than these dresses appeared to be. You would NOT catch me making a custom fit dress for $150 😂
I’m pretty sure in the books, the dress was periwinkle-
Ich weiß nicht was du meinst ich finde fast alle sind mega gute dupes!!(außer Rita und Hermione) Und das Kylie Jenner Kleid ist halt wie du schon gesagt hast logisch, dass es nicht so aussieht because of plastic surgery XD btw you look so gorgeous in all of them
wait vincent read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo???? this is the best of both world!!!!!!
Wait was the lice comment a joke?
weird that they have good costumer service 😆
You can darken the pink Harry Potter dress with soaking it in black dye
can u teach me how to do the business walk plz i wanna do it so badly
Please come to my wedding with the Ari dress on this winter 💖✨
10:42 💀💀💀
Ich heirate nächstes Jahr bist herzlich eingeladen ☺️🙏❤️ mega video übrigens
Remember when Naomi said she will never dye her hair blue ?
The Harry Potter SENT ME Naomi you’re too good 🤣🤣🤣🤣
TRY DYING THE HERMIONE DRESS
They all Look not Good :(((
lol princess dianas dress is from 2022? where are they keeping her??
"On our own", you can't even know how much fun I have listening to your music!
That hair & makeup 😍😍😍😍💙
Wieso erinnert mich Vincent an Harry Styles im Ariana Kleid?😂
I really want to see a series in which Vincent recreates Micarah's famous dresses tutorials and Naomi wearing them 😅
You look beautiful in all the dresses
15:13 lmao! the ariana and kylie dresses were pretty but the rest were not it and def not worth the money. you look beautiful regardless and your makeup is always amazing!
Ich frag mich, ob man das Hermine Kleid nicht sogar färben könnte...dann wären zwar die hellen parts auch dunkler, aber wenn es anstatt neon pink eher so wie im Original wär, hätte es evtl Potential...maybe :')
Hey Naomi, kannst du versuchen das Herminekleid violett zu färben ? 🤓
At least with those prices, the dresses are hand made, so you know where your money is going.
harry potter dress could look better in a different color .
please please PLEASE tell me you got your 500 dollars back??? You could actually get a proper wedding dress on WISH for 500! wtf
honestly if you layer the last dress with more stuff underneath so you can make it more puffy, its a pretty damn great dress. Also the first dress i would die to watch it go punk with big net pants and some huge boots (either dr. Martens or like the big emo/punk shoes) with a dark eye make up, edgy hair and some nice accessories and some gloves... its a 10/10 for me 😋
I have a really good product for your skin. My skin is literally the same and this changed my life. My skin is matt AND hydraded! Super 😎  "Eucerin - mattierendes Fluid"
You seem to never run out of ways to do your eyeshadow and liner, SLAYING every video 😍😍
Where did you buy the green/yellow wig cause it's amazing
Let me guess, you’re polish? 😦
Ich hatte heute den beschissensten Tag von ganz 2022, jetzt nachdem ich dein Video gesehen habe gehts mir wieder viel besser! Danke für diese premium Unterhaltung :)
You completely satisfy the video content I NEED to see on youtube 😂😂😂😂
Wie toll sie geschminkt ist! Ach wäre ich doch 30 Jahre jünger.....
Absolutely loved your song!
For un moment i thought the Hermione dress was Aurora dress from Sleeping beauty or the pink dress Cinderella made that her step sisters destroyed...
"Can you see my...........PAAAAANTIEEEEES?!"   😂💕
Vincenderella 🤩
Fucking crying at the “angryhanna” :’)
No offence to you Naomi but these are very ugly dresses. Your make-up is divine I love it ❤
I need an actual photoshoot of Vincent in the Ariana dress
I was so disappointed in Hermiones dress, the color was sooooo off and the rest just looked cheap 😭😭
I Love your Videos…Do you ever do any Make-Up videos?
You are so “F” ing funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Would you wear white?… you’d probably wear beige” is the biggest shade to Vincent 🤣🤣
Ive always wanted to wear arianas dress and ive never had the courage but if i had this. Id love it so much, and she my fav artist so like... i get to brag!! Love you broccoli queen!
Does anyone else thinks of Micarah Tewers .because she made almost all these dresses. Or just me
“Would you wear white? You’d probably wear beige…” the read of the century 😂😂😂
Okay coz ive ALWAYS wanted that dress xtina wore in burlesque its the best dress ive ever seen
You look every dress bad
My hangover cure
Omg... Im looking your video and my boyfriend starts to sind "mirror mirror on the wall......." 😂 instagram make him do this 😂😂😂💜
You and your uploads really get me through the week. Also the longer hair looks so good on you
im drunk watching this and omfg im enjoying
I wonder if they also have a dupe of lady gagas meat dress
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO YAYYYYYYYY
You should try the ink box freehand marker and give yourself some tattoos! They stay for about a week! Miss the chaotic, everything escalates at the end, videos :')
i could use all that money right now and i would be happy
*Queen luv ya* 💗
I absolutely adore you. You and my son are twins in personality and both have amazing voices. He is 22. I never thought I meet another Isaah he is one of kind... but I was wrong.
Sia moment in 11:42 ... i am crying :DDD
why did i shout out barbie when i saw the bright pink dress.
I think you and Vincent should do a collab video where you try to fix the dresses! You can talk over what you want to add or take away from the dresses and then show the recreations!
Tust du eigentlich die Sachen wieder zurück schicken oder behältst du alles???
the ari dress is a slay- you can tell she liked it by how long she was messing around in it lol
These dresses are ending me 💀 that Hermione dress was tragic 😂😂😂
Das dritte hahahah. Wie da einfach nocj eine Nadel drin steckt😂😂😂
She's so chaotic. My brain cells can't hold the chaos most of the time 😂 love it. I'm not fashionable by all means. Just love these videos. It's quite entertaining and fun to watch Naomi. Vincent and the cats are bonuses 😂
OMG Love your phonecase
Naomi: Who am I?? Me: That’s a secret I’ll never tell xoxo gossip girl
15:16 i literally played like 3 times lmao it was the best HARRRYYY POOOOTTERR
My boyfriend has no idea who you are and has never actually seen any of your videos, but he was in the room as I was watching one one day, and since then he will walk around the house randomly saying “time for the next outfit” in all the different voices. 🙃
Tell me why when I saw the sewing pin I automatically thought “at least we know they were making it customized to your size?” Lol
Im curious where u get the inspiration for ur makeup.of u follow some fun ppl?
i actually really liked the ariana one ngl
15:35 at 0.25 speed... Trust me 😂😂
the last dress was amazing ❤️
I think they customize it for free because you bought a lot
Lmao the pink one looks like a really bad kid's Halloween princess costume! 🤣💜
why does vincent look good with everything
I laughed out loud at the Rita Ora dress
You look like a sexy clown 🔥 in a good way though
Naomi I'm getting married in november if you wanna come to the states lol
The dresses were all very horrible but your sarcasm made it hurt less
ily u should do more food vids plz!
i was having a really hard day and this really helped my mood, god bless Naomi
Omg i laughed A LOT  Thanks
Thank you for getting scammed for our entertainment 💕
Omg they are hideous
The rita ora dress reminded me of cruella
You couldve got the actual Harry Potter dress at Universal studios website 🤣 for like $125
8:14 the Nezuko sticker :D
😍
Das Ariana Kleid wäre sicher mega für Fotoshootings!!
15:15 What my coffee sees right before I drink it
IIRC I've seen a YouTuber who sew ( I forgot their name 🥲) that did Hermione's dress way better than this. And I think it was part of their "budget" series where they create dresses at a low cost.
I guess you could donate the dresses to a theatre :)
Wäre cool wenn Du dich mit Upcycling Youtubern zusammen tust, die die Kleider pimpen 😀
The business walk gets me every time
I missed you 😿
You should try crazy shoes from like Wish or something i love you trying random things!
I’ll take the dress, I have a prom coming up!
Ahhh I love tcd - I've gotten three beautiful gowns from there for under 200 for proms/balls
The Hermine dress is giving Sleeping Beauty 😂😂
I don't think these are all that bad compared to dresses people from different channels put on. I guess, it really depends on what you're looking for, I guess.
Why does hermione’s dress low key looks like rachel’s bridesmaid dress in friends
"You're Evelyn Hugo"  SAME THOUGHT HAHAHAHAHA
Omg girl your makeup 🥵🥵🔥🔥
Your energy gives me life!
13:50 the laugh-  I died from wheezing so hard💀
Your hair has huge Nene from Toilet Bound Hanako-Kun vibes I love it 😭✨
I wonder what you do with all the clothes you are left with? do you send it back?
"RON. U STUUUUPID BASTARD."
Even tho she sang the Harry Potter theme song I still could not figure out what dress she was talking about
I love ur makeup 💄💋
You should go watch minions new movie in Arianas dress!!
When you said "There's one thing that needs to be done in this dress" in the Hermione dress I just said "yes, the business walk" and I cracked up when you really did it, omg 😅
probs an den Postboten von Naomi xD
LOL I think I got my prom dress from this website. I wanted Rihanna’s 2013 Grammy’s dress and it arrived so fast (to Canada) and it was actually perfect, I loved it
Random video idea for a food video. You could eat and drink different colors every day for example yellow on Monday and green the next  day… of corse with out adding any food dye :)! Anyway love you videos 💖
500 dollar...du spinnst ja 😂😂😂😂 hättest das geld besser gespendet für kleine, arme Katzen...Hunde...oder Dosenthunfisch 😂😂😂😂
i got grounded for saying “tresh” literally everywhere 😀 idk if im mad or not
the makeupppppp
wow you look stunning
Still sucks that a bunch of racists botched your music video over some braids. 😒🙄🙄🙄🙄
In the pink dress ypu kinda look like Princess Peach from Mario😂
15:58 ...ja aber es sieht nach wie vor aus wie von na 5 jährigen 😂 guter content...hab mich köstlich bep*sst 😂😭😂😭😂 aber ernsthaft: kauf doch nicht so n mist güüüüüüühl
TBH I feel like aliexpress and those websites selling products that made in China are spamming people from different countries, these prices are just nonsense and the quality are also horrible, but people normally get good quality with nice price on local Chinese shopping website and apps
El vestido de Hermione!? Wot!?! Estallada
I would rock that Ariana dress at my prom 😎👌
probably the customer service replied so fast because you were the only one ordering from them lmao
E assim que faz lei da atração😄
you just need Micarah Tewers to be for friend so you can have celebrity dupes dresses
The last one looks awesome!
i think they actually did a really good job with copying the dresses especially for that price point!!!!!!
Bruhhhh u the most inspirational human 😫❤️
Hermione’s dress looks like it came from Euro Giant 🤣
I think if you can copy Zendaya you have made it!!
The last one is stunning 🫶🏼😍🥹
We need a new 7 days eating video girl 💅
You could wear the last dress and go to Mac Donald's😂❣️
Wow!! I really liked the Ariana grande dress!!  Too expensive,but it's nice
Not comparing what so ever... But you and your videos remind me of Jenna Marbles 🥺🥺
your song is so amazing
i have fever dreams of you change the profile picture here on youtube lol
Need tht dress of Ari just yo go myself singing in the rain her songs in the streets of Zárate, argentina haha
They sure did butcher hermione’s dress
🤧🤧🤧 trash 🗑
I lovvvve the song. I can't start the day without listening to it. Thank you for the master piece ❤❤
Girl what are you saying you look absolutely GORGEOUS in these dresses and THEY DO FLATTER UR BODY PLSJFJ you look like a movie star
Als jemand der selbst näht, muss ich dich fragen, was hast du erwartet? Du kannst diese Kleider nicht mit dem Zeug von der Stange vergleichen. Sicher sind die Löhne in der Textilindustrie crappy, aber sie werden durch die Massenfertigung auch noch mal gedrückt (im Verhältnis pro Kleidungsstück). Ein einzelnes Kleid anzufertigen ist in der Vorbereitung fast genau so viel Aufwand wie 10. So ein Kleid zu nähen dauert sicher ein paar Tage. Da muss man eben auch noch Material sparen, was dazu führt, dass das Kleid durchsichtig wird und sehr billig aussieht.
I like the shade of purple the first dress is but it so thin and see though but still cute.
I love your videos. They make me so happy. Is quemo day and this was sooo much fun to watch this morning lol
Hey Naomi 💚 Würdest du die Kleider auch weiterverkaufen? Ich wurde auf nen Fake Gala Event eingeladen, dass blaue Kleid würde da echt gut passen :)
What do you do with all those outfits ?😂😅
Such a wholesome moment Vincent helping you with your red dress and then the model back breaking pose 🤣🤣🤣🤣 had me cracking up this video
Why do I still mistake you for actor of Imogen in heartstopper. Love you look just like her
Hermione's dress was atrocious, but that last one was super stunning! Definitely won't be using this site though 😂
Do you actually have lice? No offence you just said you do but I'm unclear
I realized they forgot to gloves on are dress🫠😅
Naomi as Voldemort wearing the Hermione dress would be perfect 😭
Ilysm Naomi you put so much effort into your videos & music 🎶 🫶🏻 it truly makes me happy you’re going after your dreams & killin it every time🧡
the evelyn hugo reference 🥰 love it
Dresses from 2022: Princess Diana and Marilyn Monroe ...
I missed you...
I can’t stop singing on or own it’s such a good song 🎵
Angriana💀💀💀
You can totally see your nipples in the first dress🤣 need more 🥦 cover ups... Lol
girl.... you're buying replicas of dresses that cost thousands of dollars for only 100/200... of course the quality isn't gonna be great idk what u expected.
15:15
The lavender dress is so beautiful🍇💜🟣😈🍆☔🟪      And the mint one also. I love it!💎🌨️🌁🌬️🎟️🔟🔘🇰🇿
These are autrocious 😂
You sound so different from these videos compared to ur music videos xx
✨FRUCHTFLIEGE✨
Your Nina Hagen was showing in the ari dress 🤣
Naomi, i would like to invite u to my wedding and i would love to see u in the arana gtande dress.
But the Marylin Monroe dress wow I want to see that 2:58
On our own is so so so underrated ! I sincerely hope it blows up (honestly i hope the tiktok algorithm would make it more popular than it already is!!) But mad kudos to u n ur team for that bop!
I love u Naomi Jon but i feel like ur videos lately ur being more cring and less funny like ur personality previously. Dont lose yourself for content. Just continue being your beautiful funny self. We miss that!
XDDDDDDDDD WHERE SHE PLAYS HERMIONE
19:55 Everything looks good on Vincent
Love from India x
I love your videos you should say hoyyyaaaaa in your q videos , can you do a colour food challenge with Vincent
Why did she remind me of hocus pocus and not Harry Potter 🤣🤣😭
i just recently found your channel and have been binge watching your content now for days. so excited for this new video! ty for always being so real, genuine, goofy, gorgeous....love and light.
I think the ari dress looks quite good for a dupe
You made the most boring topic só fun. LOve you!
OMG IM EARLYY THIS IS A  MILESTONE
vincent definitively could make something out of hermiones dress - get rid of t he flabbertyflabbies, give it some nice straps, it could be something! thanks for killing your bank account for us!
Dresses made by under paid child and woman, turned into slavery, so yeah, I would cut myself a finger if they were not from some summer camps in china. Stop this .
vielleicht kann man die kleider an (schul-)theater spenden?
Bei juckender Kopfhaut helfen mir ein paar Tropfen aetherisches Lavendel-Öl. Ist gut gegen Pilzsporen und so. Desinfeziert. Liebe Grüße und danke für deinen tollen Content <3 Viel Erfolg
Hopescope hat auch schon solche Videos gemacht. Liebe solchen Contest ☺️
AHHH YESSS ICONIC THUMBNAIL OF 2022
11:59
I think the Kylie dress wasn't off BUT Kylie had shapewear on underneath. It's a classic case of "is this dress fire or is it the body shape of the person wearing it that makes the dress look somehow good"
omg can I get the Ariana dress lmao my birthday is on the 20th of July and I wanna woosh everyone away
i need this dress fur csd in muenchen
All the quality of Halloween store outfits.  👌
that's the video I wanted you to try and you did it loves you queen❤️❤️❤️
No one’s talking about how fabulous Vincent looks once again ✨🤩💖✨
I love that green dress, it's what I pictured when reading Atonement. I love that colour in a satin finish and wish this colour and finish was more readily available/popular
make a video tasting clothes or random things from Shein ✨️💕🔥💓
Girrrll, die Frisur steht dir so gut💕
RON!! You stupid… BASturd HAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Can we request Vincent reaction shots? (He’s got a camera too)😂💜
I want to know this websiiiiite 🥹
Man findet in our own music video so schwer auf Yt. Ist so als würde es der Algorithmus verschleiern ufff das kotzt so an weil ich liebs und schaue es mir gerne manchmal an für den vibe
“Oh no Ron spell” I can’t tell you how much I cried while laughing at this 😂😂😂
Now you need to collaborate with micarah tewers who can actually remake celebrity dresses well on the cheap. She makes the patterns, thrifts the fabrics and sews it all together and it’s mind blowing. I feel like both your energies together would be amazing!
when i was a kid, a museum near me had a temporary harry potter exhibit, and i got to see the actual hermione dress up close, and it was so gorgeous !! so to see that recreation,,, it’s less than stunning let’s put it like that fmbdbfbfbd
Your music video was EXCELLENT🔥🔥🙌🙌
the sewing pin 💀 💀 💀 💀 , the underpaid overworked seamstress chinese lady has HAD IT.
The Arianna dress was really cuuuute
I just realized that you went back to the iconic 2018 Naomi hair! One of your best haircolors
We need a Vincent Trying on Naomi's dresses montage.  I still remember when he would BARELY show his hands in the video, hence his social media narration that's become the staple XD  babies!!!!
sorry but the harry potter part got me laughing on the floor😭
That Hermione bit had me laughing so hard 😆
I wonder if they would accept the return when it is custom made - in all high street stores you can’t return anything after alteration 👀
I love the last dress the 4 first dresses was crap lol 🥦 I ❤️u Naomi we yours 🥦🥦🥦🥦🥦❤️❤️❤️  🌮 n 🌶 the loveliest cats 🐈 🐈‍⬛
I would love a video of you trying Coexist berlin, please.
i love u n ur music ~~ letsgo kweeeen
Prettiest broccoli 💚
This video has a huge viral potential... and I hope it does, Naomi puts so much money and effort into it she deserves it!
My dream is that Naomi cosplays Harley Quinn one day
Naomi is givinf massive 2016 Harley Quinn vibes with this hair
I now this has nothing to do with the video but i just want to tell u that i really like ur song "on our own" it sooo good it is my favourite song pls keep it up 😭😭💖💖💖💘💘💘
Hermione’s dress looks like aroura
Vincent-"I think you have a great figure" Naomi-"Why do you look like a cow"
Naomi ich MUSS wissen, von wo du diese Nezuko Handyhülle hast!!!😭
your mouth flapping while dancing in the hermoine dress has me PISSING MYSELF RN 15:32
just gotta say, you look absolutely, drop dead gorgeous
the face at 15:14 is now my new discord profile picture. xD i died laughing from this OMG
Do you never return the clothes you try on?😮 I mean it’s honorable that you’ll donate these dresses, but they’re so expensive 😢
I LOVE the last dress, I want it in black 😍
I feel like I have seen Micarah Tewer DIY at least two of these dresses lol and her’s looks way better
If you do want a good hermoine moment, they sell it at  universal studios online lol I seen it at Hogsmead when we went
so glad I found ya channel love it lol....side note...completely lost it at the bow & SIA comment lmaooooooo
why you are so cute and sweet 😭😭💕
You should do more makeup videos! only if you feel like it ofc:) i really enjoyed your testing celebirty makeup lines video !!
No one commenting on her lice
What do you do with so many clothes at this point 😭
Honestly I think this review is quite unfair. These dresses were made for a fraction of the price of the originals. Expecting a $150 dress to exactly match it's $20,000 counter part is just completely unreasonable to me.
14:20 omg! Not even close! 🤣 lmao nooo!
Do you actually send everything back that you order or do you keep the things ?
U just made my day 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I just didn't felt the Hermione look. I thought of Dolores Umbridge immediately 😂🙈  Such a funny video ❤️
I love your eye makeup naomi.
I have been so bored on YouTube, been waiting for you to drop videos, thank you for blessing us with your face and curing our boredom❤️
17:07 the way u tripped reminded me of that one wish video where u ordered dresses and u fell wearing the red flower dress LMAO
Lol naomi trying to be nice the dresses look like shit but they fit me so good lol you crack me up the Ariana dress was the only one that was anything like the original
Please make part 2 and buy the prettiest dresses from met galla 2018 ! For example Gigi's or Aris
Nooooo the Yule Ball dress was soooo ugly DX DX DX  You could buy an actual replica dress from the theme parks for about the same price -__-
Noami is getting long hair again 😍😍
Im a child i dont have that fun like her😫
6:15 the video starts here thank me NOW 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🎶 Ain't got no fish for surprise 🎶- I thought you were going to say 🎶Ain't got no fish left to fry🎶 🤣 Love your makeup, awesome look per usual!
All dresses look gorgeous... Just some little alterations, steamer, a spanks and heels!!! Maybe not Naomi style but with proper production they look amazing!!! 💚🙄😻
I love Taco and Chili 😸😻 They’re always a great inclusion in the videos!
imagine what you could get if you got 'real' dupes for the same price
like before watching
i love fashion but cant do it to save my life so im watching it instead
Other than the color, the Hermione dress isn't really that bad!
you can buy the Hermione dress from harry potter shop idk if you have to go to the studio to get it but i saw it for sale there
U look georg hun slayyy
You complaining about the "boob armor" made me giggle. Especially since earlier in the vid you mentioned wedding dresses. If you were to try wedding dresses on you'd realize they almost always have "boob armor" in them. It's annoying honestly. Lol
PLLLEWAASSEE STEAM IRON THE SECOND ONE THE GREEN ONE
Tha Harry Potter section had me crying lmao
The Harry Potter pink dress looks like Cinderella’s dress after her stepsisters ripped it apart. 😭😭
Ngl the Harry Potter scenes had me dead 🤣🤣
Most iconic duo ever , podcast would be fab 👌
Für die Kostümsammlung im Filmpark Babelsberg, Potsdam 🤩
Naomi's makeup>>>>>>
Actually really liked the first dress 👗🔥
Incredible job on the On Our Own video! 👏👏👏👏🥰 You can be so proud. That was alot of work. Beautiful results. 😍
Makeup and hair are on point!! 😌☺️😚
i love those kind of videos
jaaaj! freu mich immer so auf deine Videos! 🥹🫶🏻
considering the originals cost thousands of dollars and the knock offs cost hundred of dollars  their not bad at all. we also have to keep in mind that our body proportions are not the same as the celeb who wore it, so even if we had the original dress it would still not look the same on our bodies. although i feel a couple of the dresses were made by memory and not looking at the reference photos LOL
10:04 Not Naomi putting a diesel horn sound and then steam locomotive sound after that :D
69 😜
Lol Naomi really be punching air- 😂 anyways slayed lol!
you‘re amazing!!!😍❤️🥦i couldn‘t wait for a new videooo!!!
The introduction got me, i'm ded, like your scalp x)
ihhh läuseee
YES
I laughed throughout this whole video! Love you twos friendship! 💛
Naomi, du bist einfach zu witzig!!! 🤣 best YouTuber!!! 😍🤩
about the introoo... would have been a good time to refer back to why the MV was postponed and raise some awareness for people who might still not understand the reasons? like you made a whole video explaining it, so can we be adults when referring to it instead of just brushing it under the rug 😭
Even my first guess was Evelyn Hugo for the green dress haha
9:55 new soundtrack saved 🤌
I NEEDED THIS SM
I feel like the Kylie dress can be fixed - to me the biggest difference is the bodice the knock off doesn't have any structure to the bodice while the original seems to have a corset inside, you still managed to pull off every look though
i waited the whole week for 22:08 minutes happiness
Min 13:50 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I want her in Anime cosplay again🥹
Gorgeous as always naomi
Very hilarious and raw , that’s what I like about you 🥦🥦🥦🥦
59m ago

Thank you for taking a dive into your bank account for our entertainment and curiosities
Broccoli 4 life
12:37 i need this level of confident in my life
THAT ARIANA DRESS IS JUST
it actually looks decent,just don't look at the original💀 also kinda pricey
I cannot believe one of the dresses had a pin still in it, love that. ✨😌
Ari's dress is definitely a keeper
9:19 …thats my secret ill never tell
OMG IVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY
Hi from California 🥺❤️
I already watched it .. its super amazing love the song
Girl you hilarious. So glad I found you. Actually I saw one of your edits with Little mix 😭
I just love you Naomi! and all of your song are amazing but I love more the Naomi and On Our Own
Rest in peace Tecnoblade 😔❤
The Hermoine dress is giving original Cinderella ball gown vibes & im here for it 🤍
Thank you for Your very entertaining videos 😺
Naomi quit music please
I had a little hope seeing the first one that they could be acceptable but... it just gets worse. Naomi this ain't at you level
her makeup never fails to surprise me
Your face when you do the business walk 😭😂
Fuck me sideways I honk laughed at you sliding.
Maybe they offered you to make the size custom to you so you can’t return the dresses
So funny with the cats… I can‘t 😂😂
are we gonna do the business walk in any of these dresses lol 💜💋🖤
The business walk my all time favorite 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love her for doing the things I would do but can't because money 💸
why don't you try to dye the "Hermione" dress. 💜💜💜💜
I can't explain how big my smile got when Naomi did the business walk🤣
ITS EVELYN HUGOOOOOOO
Actually On Our Own is my fav track of yours . It has been stuck in my head since
Omg ich musste so lachen am ende. Hahaha du bist echt so witzig lol.
LOVE the try on videos!! Thank you darling!
Naomi never fails to entertain us 😂
This saves my sunday
The make up🤯
In every clothing video: "Why is this so see through..? 🥺"
13:51 😂😂😂😂
Deiner beiden Mietzen sind einfach zu niedlich! Chili hat so ein süßes kleines freches Gesicht. Kaum auszuhalten😁🥰
LOVED THIS VIDDDDDDDD but we want the 7 days straight or any food vids 🥺🥺 love u anyways tho <33 ur broccoli 🥦🥦
In terms of them reaching out afterwards to get your exact measurements, it might be because it's such a large order and they assumed you are doing a video or review. I'm not sure if you have your real name on the order, but even if you didn't, it's possible that they just guessed it would be for something like this.
Well the first one was cute and the Grande Grammy dress was cute.
15:32 The business woman walk!?!? I actually lost it laughing! I'd missed her, didn't think she'd make an appearance in this video... so glad to be proven wrong 😜💋🤣
Vincent's photoshoot had me cracking 😂❤
GIRL THE MAKEUP THOUGHHHH I LOVE IT❤️👹
I miss thisss
The kitty under the dress...omg so cute.
These videos are my favorite, followed by the cooking ones. These make my day a guaranteed happy one!!
I  love this video😂
new camera?
Too funny the cats inside the dresses are the best
💚💚💚💚 love a good business woman walk
All that money for the colored Tresh bags!!!You are so funny and beautiful.I love you Naomi and Vincent and kitties too.🙂🌠♥️🌠♥️🌠♥️🌠♥️🤣😍🥦
I actually really liked the Kylie and the Ariana dresses they were so gooood!
Early<3333
You're videos makes my day honestly .I love you're energy so much :'))
You want to see "how good they copy the dress...." but you don't even have the original to compare them to....
Naomi Jon... you are HILLARIOUS!!! I have recently just found your channel and i am obsessed. you and your adorable fam (kitties plus Vincent). My bf and I enjoy watching your videos. <3
I missed your videos !! Such a great surprise to see you again
OMG ANOTHER VIDEO YAYYY

I really love you Naomi , as a content creator, as a musician and as person !!  you are amazing !!! I just wanted to know what do you do with all those clothes? i mean the ones you dont wear anymore , of course.
EARLY!!!!
😭😭😭
Im up for accepting any of these if you are going to Donate! i could use them for Drag!
Is everyone doing Hopescopes videos now???
The Harry Potter moments in this video had me literally cackling out loud 😂 Also I would be so sad if I thought I was getting Hermione’s dress and that’s what I got!!!
Absolutely Love you Naomi 🥦 💚
This is the earliest I’ve ever been.
naomi looks like rhea norwood
Omg the queen uploaded
Nur Naomi  kommt auf sowas 😭
They butchered Hermione’s dress, but the last one looks amazing
Always pumped for more Naomi content 💕
I LOVE YOU!!!!
I think a great idea for a video would be to buy cute dresses/clothes from sustainable shops that are not located overseas so as to reduce the amount of clothes bought from unsustainable firms💕 P. s. love your vids btw
The German rage killes me everytime
Your single "On Our Own" is on my everyday playlist - can't stop singing it  ❤❤❤
omg wait you should try glowing up the dresses
Can some get a Naomi business walk compilation
Love your channel and your music keep doing what your doing queen! ❤️
aaaaaaaaa your makeupppppp is always SO PRETTYYYY💖👏💖

how about a video from vincent upcycling the dresses you don't like. for example he could do something with the third one
Thanks for posting this. I really needed a pick me up. I just found a tumor on one of my rats and I’m absolutely devastated. I know most people won’t understand but these are my babies. Im so so sad. But I appreciate a little distraction. ❤️

I was just binging your videos and then I saw this newly uploaded video! Such a nice surprise!
I love my Naomi sundays💚🥦
I think Hermione was supposed to wear something pinkish in the books. The movie got the colour changed. So maybe they thought they want to stick to the book version 😂😁
Proud to be so early. 🤪✨💅
The makeup is to die for 🥵😲❤️
what’s the BEST ari song? 😂⬇️
Yes!!! Love these!!!! Business walk!!💃🏃‍♀️ Throw a tiara on Vincent and they are ready to go to the ball!
Thinking will not overcome fear but action will.
HALLO NAOMIIII 🥰🤚

What was that intro 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Naomi in puffy dressesssssss 😁😁😁😁
I can already tell that I don’t know which celebrity wore those dresses 🤣 cause I have 0 interest in those kind of things
Missed u so much that I began rewatching all your videos lmao
tulle dresses are so flowy and pretty
The past couple of wigs 🤣🤣🤣
i need you to collab with niki
I’m not gonna lie Naomi tryna hit the fruit fly sounded like when ur fighting in a game like zelda and the character is like “HAA.” while swinging their blade
Did you know fruit flies spend most of their time drunk off of the fermented fruit they eat, live about 3 days, and commonly die of constipation? RIP🪰
My queen!!! Love the makeup here.
YOUR MAKEUP IS LITERALLY SO PERFECTT
Love ya girl
Hey Naomi I feel like ur video is being shadowbanned by YouTube  cause I was searching it and I couldn't find it until I opened ur chanel. Love u

Gurl your makeup is gorgeous
