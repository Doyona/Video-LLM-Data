26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; ---HOLY BIBLE

Why are all these tough ass rappers so quick to disrespect their own people that's not oppressing them but they are afraid to talk about their own oppressors you knew booty in the dick ass rappers is cowards.... And you are scared of those that look like Donald Trump... You would rather rap about sending death to your own people than those that send death to us.. you a coward we going to treat you just like bigots

No one out there Does it so well..  Got Me in My feelings Now Ridin on this Beat I know I Do Well I was stuck  sitting in a Cold Cell too Couldn't Shake off hat Awful F*c*in' Jail Smell I had to do Something New Thought Hard and then it came to Me  Gucci Did it, Why not Me? He Got out The Feds and kept it G He put the Lean Down It was the Percs For Me Opened up My Mind and found the real me  Thinking Right and Working With a mean Bark, and a better Bite I had a New Bright Future, a Better life in Sight Now I saw it Clear with my Goals set True.  Stay Business Minded and Business Ready. Always watching ,Always ready.  Stay out that Jail Cell at all costs  They always tellin' you  just what to do, trying to be your boss Steady Fighting for something small and Petty.. Now I stay Free to make my own Moves ,  My own Decisions. No F*xkin CO Actin tough and walking hard They really Softe inside and Scared as Fuck. Big ol' Bullies bossing us around, tell us what to do and always yellin' Thank the Lord I Don't have to hear that Bullshit Line "If You Don't Like it , Don't do things to Come to Prison, don't be out there commiting crimes. Fuck All COs and All their Prisons.  Now I stay Grinding Hard and keep it Steady No one can Stop Me cause I Stay Ready I had to Climb up from the Bottom just like You... Gucci Mane Came Out the Feds Strong and Focused  Straight Bossed Up and I took notice Watched you handle Business   I followed what I Now call "The Gucci Laws on how to be a Boss and Conduct Your Business." How to Be a Boss , stay Successful too Now I'm Flossed up and Loving Life Gucci Mane I have You to Thank.  You Saved a Life,  You Deserve much More than this Thanks its True You tought me Stay Business Minded amd Business Ready Helped Me Become a Boss  Now I stay Strong, I stay Ready  Gucci Keep it Goin' Stayin' Tough You at the top and it'll stay that way till Gucci say "He is Done, that's enough" Keep it 💯 as you've done through time Your Lyrics Heavy And Flows So sick and intertwined  Sometimes It makes me lose My Mind.

Everybody is a rap expert these days. Mfs downloading beats, how to rap apps got the game messed up.  Nobody is talking in metaphors and punchlines in real life. Nobody is talking like eminem in real life. None of the rappers shakespeare. In real life all we want to know from a female is if she effn with a dude or not, most dudes not driving Lambos or trackhawks we dont have cuban links, all most dudes need is a fire beat, real life lyrics, thats it. Gucci and BG as well as a few others understand this. Steak and Potatoes is good enough. I dont know when we went from mumble rap to algebraic rap. Even now dudes still trippin over wayne saying g's move in silence...lol. yes the G in lasagna is silent. Stop over complicating rap for no reason. Creativity isnt bad, progress isnt bad, but stop acting like if dudes not coming up with a new name for money  theyre trash.    Its that regular everyday talk that last the longest. I personally think Gucci best song 16 fever, straight to the point, no need to decipher the lyrics.....bg cash money is a army,  even wayne go dj, rap ghostface and E40 the only regular rappers with unique vocab.
Bg needs everyone backing him. I waited 20 yrs. He served folks atl in bmf sta tus.... he deserves all the purple hearts  #turk
Its good to see B.G. rap
Bro B G on my mic the tlm 103
This is trash. Period.
🔥
Trump 😂😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/V7FfnaTqeRs?si=vuarmyKJpDjNt-dp
Clone gucci needa tighten up
Hiters only
Side note: Gucci deserves more recognition for his efforts and contributions to rap. It occurred to me a while that he is probably the MOST consistent rapper we’ve ever had! I mean literally. That man is always putting out new music. Quality music too! Even when he was locked up! Not too much he solid and always collaborating with his peers and putting on new talents. That’s commendable.
Gucci Mane has a song in the club, he is a boss of the club and he orderd girls to take money from a cusomer, can't remember the title 😢😢😢
B.g doin FaceTime while gucci talking on the phone #epic

I’m from the old school when the Hot Boys was shaking up the world. I Love BG and Gucci, but tbh it sounds like GUCCI PAID BG FOR THE FEATURE and Gucci didn’t “let” him get on his shit, Gucci just ain’t got it no mo and BG still at the Top of his Game!! All Love
I LOVE BG and Gucci, but Gucci’s verse was weak as hell tbh, but BG saved the day. I applaud Gucci fo trying but he just ain’t got it like that no mo. BG, now that’s a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY!! I still love Gucci, but he could’ve done a little better on this one. All Love tho
https://youtu.be/6rwbdWUKSB8?si=FtyYVMkYH_KSNz6a 🔥🔥🔥🔥
When did they film the video? Glad to see they know about B!

6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. HOLY BIBLE
HOLY BIBLE---5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

WE LOVE YOU BG 👏🏾🙌🏾🤎 #BG #WeloveyouBG
Man it’s good seeing Gizzle doing his thing. B.G. been in heavy rotation in my playlist since way back in the Chopper City days. That “comn to get ya” with Bun B and Juvy is one of my all time favorite songs but so many BG songs from Uptown Thang to Clean Up Man to Heart of the Streets I’ve always loved his music and I always thought he was the realest Hot Boy. I too went through a stage in life where I was an addict and how he kept it real and never tried to hide it I always respected that. A lot dudes out her addicted to lean, pills, coke or whatever and be fronting cause when I was growing up in the 80’s & 90’s you made fun of the fiends. Never get high on your own supply was a known rule type shit but BG was one off the few who kept it real about his mistakes and I always respected that of him. Man did his time. Didn’t snitch on nobody, didn’t get no lesser sentences and stood tall ten toes down. Cant hate on that. I hope he crushes the upcoming year and let these young dudes know it’s still pressure out here from the old school Gen X generation of rappers who added so many HOF’ers
Damn this shit go hard !  …” pause “
MAAAAAAAAANE IM SO HAPPY U HOME BG!!!!! WELCOME BACK!! I HOPE ITS A SMOOTH TRANSITION💓💪🏿😎 god bless always💓
Good shit Gucci keep it up shits so good 🤙🤙

It's good to see Gucci Mane give BG opportunity and showing em if anyone can stay sober and stay out a cell and not have to keep f#cking up that if Gucci mane can change for the better ANY BODY CAN Gucci mane is real stand up guy for wanting to support BG and work with him cause alot people who change for the better want to act like they to good to work with with you or forget that they was that same person in getting out jail or coming off drug's they want to act like they too good to extend there hand out and show a brotha there's life worth living without getting high and going back to jail Gucci mane gets double salute for not being to Boujee to want to reach out with BG & give him away of opportunity and of way staying out of jail!

Go BG I love the locs
Sorry af
I'm proud of these artist giving bg work but he ain't what he used to be. And it ain't noting good about destroying your community and then just because you don't tell that you get some kind of celebration when you come home. I've been to prison.i didn't tell but after doing all that time i see why everyone tells, it ain't noting to brag about and that's facts
This is definitely 💯 a hit song
Oooouu this shit hard asf ok B.G. I see you nigga this here smooth 😎🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
CC center
GUCCI WE LOVE YOU
This for slow ppl, this make other races look at us as s_____ and n_____ . My own young black potnahs just motivated them to do some crime or stupid. Cause he seen some dope users and dealer's on YouTube. Na he 23 caught a body with J's. In jail for life he killed our friend of jealousy. Stop being dirty, wanna be a G for Gabage.

What is the definition of the hood? Drugs, violence, murder, sex, gangs, incarceration, and felonies. Everybody are claiming they are woke but they are really sleep. We all are products of our environment. The brain will feed on everything around you. If your brain feed on trash, you will be garbage .If your brain feed on gold, your actions will be golden. (Fact) My page will tell it all.
Man please 🥺 keep coming like that right there 👌 that sht was dope......!
Love BG. Love Gucci. LOVE this song.   But we can’t just skip over the fact that Gucci was on a regular phone call and Gizzle was on FaceTime lol.

B. Gizzle came home gassed da FUCK up. Never thought I'd see B.G got than Juvenile.
I've been making music for 10+ years and finally started taking it seriously the last couple. I been compared to Pouya, Mac, Eminem, Peep, and Creed (1st alternative rock song dropping soon) I consider myself as versatile as it comes and I know what my potential is worth, just people aren't giving me the recognition I deserve and I'm hoping for that to soon change. I promise I have music for everyone and it should be heard. I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to make my dream come true. I appreciate everyone 🙏❤️
Maaaaaan, Back in the days, Gillie da kid told Lil Wayne during the beef he had with Cash Money : " BG is your real father" now i understand why after all these years !  BG is the last of evolution of Lil Wayne from a Pokemon's perspective.

Jesus stands and knocks on the door of your heart, answer before it is to late. Psalm 91:14-16 14 “Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him;     I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. 15 He will call on me, and I will answer him;     I will be with him in trouble,     I will deliver him and honor him. 16 With long life I will satisfy him     and show him my salvation.”

OMG 😱! I hit the play button on this video thinking it was a ‘cover’ of Chris Stapleton’s ‘Cold’. Boy was I WRONG - this is just annoying and noisy rap imo! I’m going on 70 now, but always have, and always will, 💖 ALL genres of music - but THIS IS NOT MUSIC to me, and it actually hurt my ears to hear less than even a single minute of it.
@guccimane 💯💯💯

the beat is weak, I like both artist but this beat aint it
Poker face we never bluff😤
Hello there, I just wanted to share that Jesus Christ loves you and died for your sins so that you can have a relationship with God the father and be restored. If you want a relationship with God all you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is lord and that He died for you! And turn to him and repent of your sin. You don’t have to live life on your own anymore! God will change your life forever, I promise there is hope! He did it for me! There is a God and I am His witness. The choice is yours, have a great day :) God loves you so much! Jesus gives eternal life when you accept Him ❤
So nobody peeped Gucci was on the phone and B.G. was on FT 😅

I love you Gucci for this you was waiting for this wasn’t you ❤❤️‍🔥
Surprised/glad BG able to flow and sound like “now” after doing that much time.. a lot of rappers come home and don’t be the same.. Bobby Shmurda an example,, he made a comeback but his style changed and that sh*t just wasn’t it..
Gucci brought rap better when paired with a rapper (BG) that can actually rap. I feel like he doesn’t feel like he doesn’t have to go hard when he features with these young guys that have no  Cadence
Shit Too Real .....this track hit different return of the 80s baby ....Swear

Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

"It sucked being locked up in prison, but now listen to me rap about how I'll commit more crimes to put me back in Prison. Also, kids, hear about how drug dealing made me rich and wealthy before I even became a rap star"  People try to tell me that rap isn't a toxic problem in the rap community. They promote black criminality.
🍽️🧠

NOW YOU SHOULD DECIDE  Hello friend, do you know that there is life after death and heaven and hell fire are real?   Your decision today will determine where you spend eternity after physical death.  Soon it will be too late to make a decision to accept Jesus Christ and be saved.  No matter how far you may have gone in sin, God already did something to help you.  He gave Jesus Christ who knew no sin to die for your sins so you can be forgiven and treated as though you never sinned.  It is now your personal choice to either accept or reject Jesus Christ and all He has done to save you.  Please accept Him now before it becomes too late.   Say this simple prayer   'Oh God, I come to you in simple repentance. I agree I have sinned and deserve judgement but I am glad Jesus died for my sins. Today I accept this payment and confess and acknowledge Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. I declare by faith I am saved, forgiven and declared righteous.   Hallelujah!  Congratulations and welcome to God's family.   Join a church in your area, read your bible, give time to prayers, live to please God and tell others about Jesus Christ who saved you.
He did the video wow
He on house arrest he can only be at the studio

I was in the Orleans parish holding cell when BG came in w his young fall partner. His fall partner disappeared and a lil while later b g got on the phone and I overheard him trying to get his fall partner to take the wrap some kinda way. I thought about telling him the phones were monitored but mind your business is something I already knew Couldn’t help but overhear the conversation. Pretty sure he took a charge for that attempt. Dudes among the best rappers in my book. That was a long ass time  ago glad he’s free. Hope he keeps out the streets this time. Keeping it that real leads to prison every time wo.
This cold asf

I don’t like the beat.. No disrespect to Mike Will Who Made It” It’s just the production should’ve been more legendary and street worthy.. It didn’t fit the subject matter  nor narrative at hand.. It was to simple” felt like it was meant for a female artist like Megan ,Sexy Redd or Glorilla” 🤷🏽‍♂️

I’ll be the honest one. Gucci needs better beat selection and maybe even a damn ghost writer at this point. Bruh is not sliding
“Better be able to see your hands if you ever try to approach me” -B.G
BG on point with it
Gucci forever

BG back yes I wish I could get my shot and sign a contract I would put some stuff down on the track let me tell you .
B.G living legend..happy 4 u dogg
The mix of this beat is horrible. These new 2020s beats hit the speakers wrong, the bass is almost trying distort my s23+ plus speakers and they dont distort ever. MAN PUT THIS NIGGA ON SOME MILLION DOLLAR SOUNDING PRODUCTION!!!! Everything he rapped on so far sounds like basement made music!! STOP!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Smashed Out My Old Teeth”  B.G. 🔥

B.G Is Back this the one that shows you
🔥!!!
Dis cold 🥶
🔥🔥🔥
That shit is dope man 🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Damn I fool myself.. I thought GB & Gucci mane wouldn’t sound right but this here is a good match
Gucci don’t waste no time
You remember when Shyne came fresh out the pen and everybody was excited that he's back and than shortly after disappointed at how he changed and how wack his output was? I don't know what happened in his 10 years sentence but prison definitely broke Shyne's voice and spirit as rapper. Not the case with B.G., he still got it like he never left. He sounds like it's late 90's/early 2000s. Only thing changed is that he looks like Bob Marley now.
The beat is ass 😂
That that was Cold🥶Brrrr!!!!!! the old Gucci is definitely back!!!! That flow was hittin Gucci definitely looked out on this one for BG It’s a Fed party for sho!!!!
🔥🎤🔥💯💯

Floating to this
Aye Gucci Man Made That Nigga Come Rap Fr!  Aye shout out B.Gizzle, I doubted You for a second. This won't get on My playlist but I'll advertise it and listen to it.
Man I thought Gucci was advocating against gun violence but he turn around and make a shooting song
Damn did even recognize BG. This song fire. Verse was clean. "Better be able to your hands if you try to approach me"
The amount of asskissin in the comments is unbelievable! This is trash honestly istg I would've told myself this if I ever dare to have a thought of dropping lyrics like this at the same time with what these new rapper's is spitting some true art, I feel extremely disappointed on behalf of everyone involved in making this that's not it bruh go back to the drawing board that's ear pollution.

like who needs reminders of jail, for those that's been in and want to stay out, nobody got the time to hear it or think about it. even though society is jacked up and think its cool to murder people  or whatever. if you never been in, dont go because it is hell. you pray to have  your freedom so why glamorize it? i just dont get artist these days.

This music is trash and leads the youth of colored astray to violence, gangs, drugs, pimping and prostitution, and worse. These "rappers" are criminals, nothing more, and if you think that's "cool", your mind is still stuck in a juvenile/primitive state that severely lacks intellect.  Claim You have "street smarts", but then can't keep your ass alive, or keep a family or take care of your kids. Wake up you fools. Please.
Gucci The Goat. But y'all already knew that., Burrrrrrrrrrr

😤😤😤
Wish this song dropped about 20 years ago 😢 would’ve been classic
Drizzle Murd freestyle. I couldn't believe it. Caught my main opp eating? At a restaurant with his bae. Left him on the ground crying little baby teething. Just another ordinary thing for me I being dropping dudes for no reason. Mercede's clean tho copped one for every season. Hotter than the Miami championship Heat pull up glance at your gal then wink wondering what she think. Hop out lob a shot yea shoot a tre for three only like fine chics in see through bikini rivals those fella's weenies haha almost said Weezy. That whole time I was thinking about Nicki Minaj hahaha she's pretty. Unique. My favorite part about her.
All right B.G.
❤ #Guwap
