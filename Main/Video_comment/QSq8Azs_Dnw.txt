female tyler the creator...got it
❤❤❤
😍
Love her
Her fake cough in one in a million the whole performance in ❤❤❤
That shawty lo part was hard
i feel like i was in the crowd after watching this,Mariah and Latto really❤🎉
❤
The guy on the ground should shut off!
If you haven’t seen LATTO live!!! you are truly missing out!
Didnt sing a single word just played a second voice every now and then even when her mouth wasnt moving
I fall in love again, every time I❤❤❤ watch this video +!!
latto never disappointed
Garbage
this performance is everything
Wowshe an amazing performer 😮
Was this the one Teyana choreography?
I have no idea who he is
she got that energy!!!
Ice spice could never
She’s so adorable and talented!!!!! You’re loved @CocoJones
When your diamonds hit like this, you don't never see the shade
LATTOOOOOOOO❤❤❤❤❤❤
What’ the whole grocery store set up ? I don’t get it
The shopping bag outfit is creative
I got cHILLSSSSSS
I love her i was smiling the whole time she makes women feel comfortable to be any way they feel like it !!
You can’t compare ms spice to this…look at her stage presence 😍😍
She wasn't rapping half the time... gotta learn 2 sing and dance.
💯🙏🏿😎
❤🎉🔥
🔥🔥.
She's pretty
She ate down the whole song
Latto looks so pretty
This set I'd definitely reminiscent of Lil Kim's "Crush on You" video with the set of the performances each in the different colors red, blue, yellow and green! Shout out to the Lil' Kim for providing new female rappers with the blueprint!
I smell fish🤤
This is cool. Especially once she learns to control her breathing it will be even better.
❤eerrrrrrdd
Why she lip syncing?
Meh
I❤and the love for you
Not me coming to the comments to see if anyone said anything about ice spice 😂😂
idk why people dislike her and her style and personality. Girl is a top stage performer. writes her music as well as uses other writes too like many but this is all who she is she authentically herself . i been watching her since before she had a music career , been watching her since her mother and father been her managers and helping her get up with Jermane Dupree . He is who founded Latto and she won the big show case on that huge competition. competing to get signed and work with Jermane Dupree and she won it all. I know she’s made him super proud . Hell i’m soooo proud of who she’s become and where she’s going to continue to go ❤only Up and let’s not forget she’s such a sweet person for real
Kilt
something about her feels cheap and inauthentic
G. H. B
I was looking at this and Ice spices performance that was near the same time, personally I think Latto brings more stage presence to the table like she really belongs there. Ice spice just does her little twerking but Latto really got out there and Owned the floor and had fun doing it, idk but ice spice had a really less playful,  interesting, slow stage flow and was awkward a stage presence. Latto really commands her audiences attention  with a nice flow. I was on the edge of my seat when I first saw this and was like wow, what is she going do next. (Latto really did her thing with that bad b energy)
Why is no one mentioning the granny with the huge bouncing butt pushing the red buggy 😂😂💀
I love her😢❤
Shes the baddest in the game. ❤🎉
I keep watching this over wnd over because its so good🥇
No one can ever say LATTO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PUT ON A SHOW!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Like latto❤😂
Mid
I love how nowadays most musicians don't even try to lip sing.
"Boring/basic" (awards so antics) 😞 💤!!!
She forgot to lip sync thought out her whole performance…. But glad she had fun ig.
Check out KeShai Royale 5 year old female rapper
smokin on dat gas
This is me when im at a werkplace i just wanna twerk it out
Terrible
And I like the fact that she can still command an audience without getting damn near completely naked.
She can't rap vocal , FOH she a nicki hater thooo 😂😂
NEXT TIME ACTUALLY SING
hay
Gr8 performance...shiiiddd, she even threw the bag landing perfectly 1:11 😅
Look like a talent show, air band type situation. She wasn't even rapping. Idk.
She literally stops rapping along when she dances like most of y’all fave rappers and singers ….
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did she say any lyrics or just dance for this set?
Dude said she forgot to lip sync? MCscuse me?  You can hear her in the mic, don't come at the queen, cuz
She a dancer ok got it
She needs to work on her stage presence she shouldn’t be out of breath she need a coach
She from Ohio
It’s giving that so raven lol
BET. The most racist network that will ever exist.
Latto been having stage presence I don’t know why  people  said she didn’t because she been doing this since she was little
🤣 LATTO GETTING IT SHE WAS HAVING A BLASTT
That was the worst performance that I have EVER seen.  When what's her face did that on Saturday Night Live she was laughed out of the industry.  Why is this not happening now??!?!
Disgrace
Always come back to this every so often. One of my fav performances!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible choreography performance but by not actually singing your song that doesn’t look good.
YASS Brand New!!❤❤❤ Get it Latto!!!
I like her. Not my music. My daughters  generation lol.
OK, Latto!!
She did a nice stage show. I hope she gets her lip sync together.
0:57 WHEN SHE MISSED HER QUE I SCREAMEDDDD
Why is she lip syncing?
Killed it I loved it!!!!
What's with her playback? Part of the performance she is not singing and the other part is tired voice.
These females are performing and I love it S/o to Coi LeRay , Latto , Megan  y'all girl dance rap and put on a show
This was one of the wackest bet award shows
Very Corny.. but she makes everything cute tbh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🩷🩷
She be outta breath
Latto❤
Can't believe these punks comparing Ice spice with Latto.
She so bad ❤
You Did that latto “ Hellafide Creative I created New word Hellafide let’s Go ❤️❤️❤️❤️☝️☝️☝️☝️🔥🔥🔥
I loved her performance she never disappoints 😃
That was GOOD Latto
Where she at?? On the FLOOR?? Damn😅
Yeah she raw fa this 💯
I give her a A for effort but they were trying way too hard to hype this mediocre song.
Lost....
I like thisssssss
She ate❤😘😍
She lip singing  This no performance
Latto is giving me TLC vibes with the broom, I recall them doing something similar in a performance ❤️🔥
She can dance and she killed it but she let the background vocals carry her jus so she can dance like what’s the point if your saying 2-3 words a verse
Sound Horrible
I cannot be the only person who thinks Latto looks like Pam Anderson
0.40 had me cringe as fuuuk 😂
Somebody tell Ice Spice this what talent look like lmfao
🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒
GO LATTO‼️🎰🍒🍀🎰🍒🍀🎰🍒🍀
She lip singing!!
I get so tired of low-hanging fruit, low spirit rap. How many times we gotta talk about bitches hating, niggas wanna eat you out, and how wet your P is. Damn. Can we get more little Simz (gorilla & Woman go hard), Koffee, Rhapsody, etc. Her lyrics is basic, and she rebranding after she got called out for going by the name “mullato”. On some real talk,y’all women don’t want more for y’all selves than to keep glorifying the same stuff y’all get mad about in real relationships??? I was really hoping for more from this vid. Think it’s time I take a YouTube sabbatical, and go read some books/work on my energy/spirit.
Great performance but it was too much dancing not enough rapping but I enjoyed it
She threw that RX bag perfect
This made me want to go run to the store
We still waitin for saweetie to give a performance like this
She's a great performer
I loved her performance. ❤️🤍
her DJ ate
I love her she can big energy frfr
She really has been putting in hard work 😊😊😊 love her ❤
😂@ 00.56  Almost a wardrobe malfunction
Wish that she actually rapped live not the “live” playback.
Omm she ate and left no crumbs
This is nothing to watch!
Her performance gives me chills
She was enjoying herself that's why she didn't care about lip syncing. You can tell she was feeling it. I love this
Did Anyone notice one of the PRINCE BROTHERS FROM HOUSTON IN THE AUDIENCE???? A LOT OF NERVE
Gotta know how to roc da 🎤 and rhyme Ova a beat. Real MC know this.
Love jet but you got roc da 🎤  and dance without a backing track. Real MC
Listen to Gladys Knight on and on and then come back and watch this we are living in sad times😢
How do you win an award for best new artist but dance the entire time...  cute hair
Love the performance but wish she’d made more of an effort to actually lip sync the words lol
It’s the granny pushin the cart 🛒 for me 😅😂😂😩🤷🏽‍♀️
This is enough to win great job big big latto
I love Latto. I love Put It On The Floor. She couldn’t have made the lip syncing more obvious in this performance😂
Why does she keep sliding her finger under her nose? I saw her doing this in another performance too.
Well, the stage presence was ON  but the MIC sure won't. I don't understand lip synching when you're a rapper. I understand she had choreography in this performance but it wasn't enough nor was it intricate enough that she would need to lip sync.
Miss mamas always kill her shows
Well Done ✅❤
She’s awesome
@jermaine should  be kicking  himself
I love her she gives the other sisters behind her jobs
She couldn’t even lip sync the prerecorded live track lol
I felt like i was watching a Target Pharmacy commercial cute
Nah this performance was trash lol
This is terrible. I love this song, but she isn’t presenting herself as an artist. This is such a bad performance 😩
Ummm this isn’t how it looked liked and sounded like live , it’s like she matchin her lyrics but she’s not at the same time but she was matchin it perfectly live so I’m confused asf
Baby came to work! ✨
Absolutely not no maam
Shes like a ATL Jurnee Smollet lol i couldn't put my finger on it before. I love both 😩
It’s the Nicki subs and winks for me. 🤭
She was forgetting to mouth the words 😂
Teyana got all of them together
Latto is so so gorgeous🔥! She ate this up!
She played the track the whole time lol I cannot
Who’s  idea was it for her to use a live backtrack and not move her lips ?😂
Im forever a BARB 🦄 but there’s no denying that latto is SEXY😂❤️‍🔥
This was actually kinda fire!
She did that 💯!!!! Allot of effort put into All choreography. Dancers were amazing It's going to be Sagittarius season all rest of the year because of Latto She didn't disappoint🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Okayyy scratch offf lol
She barley rapped
Lip syncing.
She did her thang🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love me some Latto
Damn yawll gotta lip sync to rap too lmao
ATEEEE🔥🔥💕
This was so wack…. When Nicki Minaj performed or even host the crowd went crazy and wild… it ain’t been that since they banned her yrs ago but now they trying to beg her to come back, but she’s not going too….she good!
Bet this is trash  you only have D F G artist coming to your award..and then you crown her best hip hop female artist 😂 for what?!!! Wtf
Trash
Keep that same big energy 🎉
Latto to fat losing breathes and even sing right😂  ice spice on the other hand sexy and perform way way way better than  latto and if latto wants to look thick I suggest latto start eating them oats and get off the floor with all those cups of ramen noodles and be classy stop eating noddles on hotel dirty beds 😂
she killed it but the sound guy messed up
This Brittany Spears in the 90’s level !!!
Somebody get me the drummer’s name!
Did she get sick
No one noticed the bars she threw shots at nicki she rubbed her nose like it's giving coke 😂 she is shady and clever lol
Been down with Latto since the Rap Game. She did the right thing not signing with Jermaine Dupri.
Yalll lying, she don’t dance she jump
It’s like watching Beyoncé, Britney, and Nikki all in one, that was a amazing preference
Promote the single sis.
I like that she actually danced and enjoyed the performance and didn’t just focus on being overly sexual. Good performance!!
This is so corny. It's like Kevin G from Mean Girls. Everyone knows she's not really a hard-core street person. 🤭
damn they really tried they best to ruin the beat huh smh
Good, except she didn't sing/rap a single line.
The pharmacy bag landed perfectly back in the shelf. 😮
She did her Thang !!!
I love that she performs now. Yes choreo!!
Her choreo is sick!
BIG LATTO
Over a million views with 21K likes? Yikes! I would love to see what the dislike numbers look like.
I remember a time when rappers would ACTUALLY rap in concert. She (like many others) is halfway rappin’ and poorly lip syncing over prerecorded vocals. That’s a NO NO!
Big  latto .
Maybe I’m too old now but I don’t get it.
❤
The creative direction for this performance is…perplexing.
Weak and wack smh hip hop today suck
Typical female rapper performance their all the same.
She had dj lit in the background 😂
Ma’am you are not singing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not the Eastside stomp, not giggin😂😂 minus the actual live vocals this was solid & im not a fan
My favorite new rapper
luv this Nikki you thru
Ok chick from the south!
She barely rapped the song
Yasssss😍 I love it when artists put on a true performance. Acting✅ props✅ dancing✅ She did that👏🏽 The rap girlies are really coming with their different strengths and talents. I love to see it ❤
Lol
She definitely keeping the females in the game at the moment. Sexy but not raunchy, feminine with a lil edge. She definitely understands the assignment. 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽
She has great stage presence
I’d definitely rip her out da plastic 😂
I appreciate the audience🎉
Ummm please actually SAY THE WORDS & don’t allow the track to perform 80% of the song 🤦🏽‍♀️
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💪♾️🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆👏🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
GHETTO !!
ok bet
The Biggest!! 🎰❤️🎰
Idgaf , EVERYONE of these ladies ate!!! With the exception of Ice spice I can not understand how people are praising her when she has the most mediocre performance of the night. On that video most the comments seem fake and bought. Most praised THE SET… I like ice spice but this is showing , something isn’t right with the hype around her. She’s talented yes but her performance was literally a rehearsal… no personality no stage presence all mechanical……
😍
The lip syncing is annoying.
ICE WAS ROBBED ……….
Who is she lol? 😂 BET is 🗑️
Lip sync flop😅
How you got a cordless mic and still not rapping  all the way through
Lip syncing on fire damn mami 🥶
Respect clothing and great performance. A baby!!!!!! I am a fan
She do need to work on her sound it be so off
Big latto 🎉
If we going with a track and pre-taped vocals, you gotta remember to move your mouth and not stick out your tongue when you supposed to be rappin.....But I Love You Big Lotto!!!!!!
I wish it was live
“EAT MY BOX OUT” WHAT? SMDH 🤦🏾‍♂️
I love Latto
This is awful
Omg this is so fun NOTHING BUT ENERGY lovin itttt❤❤❤❤❤
Get it Latto!!!!!
Miss piggy 🐷
She didn’t rap enough
The record in the background takes away. Sometimes its off. But I like Latto she looked like she had fun
What does it mean to put it on the floor?
She boring
Her voice sounds forced when raps it’s like she’s really a proper girl from the suburbs trying to act hood 😂
Great performance! Latto
Yet another performer I've never heard of. 😢
Latto turned me to her fan again   Her performance /Energy is on another level  She came a long way from the rap game
born performer.
This isn't the best it's certainly better than when she was with Mariah Carey but I don't understand why she won't just sing the stuff herself it's definitely a cringe-worthy performance but definitely better than Mariah Carey one
Singing and dancing simultaneously is not as easy as folks think.
The coi leray part was sooo clean 😮
wow I really cant believe yall thought this was a great performance..this was pure garbage...tired of all this STRIPPER RAP BS,,
Her DJ understood the entire assignment 👏🏾 great performance Latto just wish you were rapping !
Audio track playing in the background lame terrible performance
🗑🗑
Love the “sniffing” references about ole’ girl… 😂 I thought that smelly cat line was about her… now confirmed 🤢😅
Was any of that audio live? It didn't look like it was
Anybody else see that bag land on the shelf when she threw it 😂
Great performance!!!
Nicki somewhere like ugh I really am the problem 😂😂😂
was she even performing at this point? 🤭
Folks with ADHD get how this could happen 😩
Disappointed wish she would of did this without her record playing
Why isn't she actually rapping she's just dancing.
I love her but I hate this performance 🤦🏾‍♀️ she did not come through I did not want to see a dance
Cringe
Love me some Latto
Better on mute..
the foreshadowing on here 😂😂 "say she gotta problem, imaginary smoke"😂😂🔥
Ice Spice did it better
This was awful
She’s growing.
Best she ever did
Perfect ❤❤❤
Love Latto since from the South! She deserves all her success AND MORE!!!⭐️👏👏👏
God please let her & DaBaby do a album together
the stage presence
Wshannenin
🗑
She gotta start rapping … she wasn’t rapping but singing with the track
She's wack. I guess the talent standards are really low nowadays. She rigged that competition she was in back in the day. She got privilege because her mom is white.
Boring
Let me pop it off 🎊
She ain’t come to play 🎉
This is horrible 😂😂😂
She can't rap WWTTFF 😂😂😂😂😂
They don't even bother to lip sync with the track anymore 😂.
Latto using all section on the stage performing on BET AWARDS. What a wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PERFORMANCE
This was too much. Too much lip syncing
🔥🔥🔥
Nice and clean! She didn't do THE MOST! She did what she came to do and did it well💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾GO LATTO👏🏾👏🏾💜💜💜
Why did she give up rapping and just let backing track play?
It’s the confidence for me 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾♥️♥️ she did her MF thang 🔥
Yess lattoo
she sooooo badddd 😫
Ok Latto with the walk it out😂😂😂 she did great and wasn’t just rapping❤ very entertaining!
This was like a theatrical play lol
She need to work on her lip singing
How about yall tell Arms to put it on the floor 🤔 🤣 😂
This was stupid
These rappers are not good...
🗑
Im sorry but so much surgery just to end up boxy is not good. Where is the hourglass she paid for because this appears to not be it.
She’s a dancaaaaaa but sis Atleast try and play along with the lip syncing 😭
Booooo
What’s up with the bags thrown on her at the end? I didn’t get that part.
Cute dance performance but she needs to remember to actually perform her song.
BIG LATTO 🥹🥹🥰🥰 your supporters are so proud of you, flourishing 🎰🍒 BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT. BEST FEMALE RAPPER AWARD🍀🏆
She's a good dancer
🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰‼️‼️‼️
She should up unfortunately YoYo is old school and doesn't need back up music 🎵🎶
Lol so nobody noticed how she threw the bag perfectly on top of the shelf? (Well no perfectly but it landed 😅)
She was barely rapping though. She just danced the whole time....I didnt like it... it was giving stage play.
Great performance but I think she forgot she was there to rap not dance
She did her thang ; yesss lattoooo congrats; and that is my favorite hair style ever !
It's a good performance but Damn don't rely on the backing track... ruins the element
She lost weight l and looks great!
Amazing performance 💐💐
Plastic or not, she fine
Lmaoooooo at least she can’t perform a lil. The raps is weak though
she looks better than ice spice all around
At first I thought she was really choking on the smoke 😭😭😭
She fya bro
Bless her heart the degree of talent is decreasing in these last days how you make songs and absolutely say nothing that makes sense unbelievable
Lol.... 😅😅
If she couldnt rap and dance she should have just rap because i wanted to hear her vocals. Not see her do whatever she did because thats not dancing. Then her weight is weighing her down. Just rap girl, you good at it.
I thought maybe she was having a microphone problem but NOPE, she sucks at live performances.  I watched another video posted by TMZ and all she does is dance.  Yikes.  Just bring Meghan back.
I hate when ppl lip syncing 😭
She so cringe lmao
She performed..that's what's up!🎉
Love you Lott ❤❤music
The dancers are on point 👉
DJ VON mixed the hell out of this record 💿
She try too hard for me!😂 all that dancing to prove a point that ain’t valid she could barely keep up with the lip Sync
“Hey Siri Play Princess Diana by Ice Spice & Nicki”🔥💕
I was just on Cochran today
The celebrity so boring it makes it shows cold . They need to bring actually fans in the building that will make more noise and cheer them up
Latrice I’ve been a fan from the beginning  Love you
YES MA’AM LATTO!!!!!!!!!! 😭👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Love her!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
She hit dem OLDLANTA MOVES I remember lotto from them old clayco days when she used too throw them PIPED UP PART 1 an PART 2 PARTIES shawty came ah long way from dem days and dis ain't nothing new she been raping since day one she finally getting her recognition an PUT ON 💯💯💯
Latto was 🔥
She deserve it 💯💯💯💯💯
Rapped 1/4th of the song, backing track too loud, choreo was too rushed. She’s a rapper, she should stick to that instead of trying to do a Beyoncé performance. Very messy set.
on me she ATEEEEEE🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
Great performance she ate that down
how she make that prescription land on the top shelf though. . .
One thing about Latto! She gon give a show I loveeeeeeeee it !!!!! These rappers better take notes and PERFORM instead of walking back and forth and bending over or twirling your hair every five mins! 🙄🙄 being lyrical is always top tier but when you can actually perform and put on a show that’s a another level !!! Glad these girls getting stage presence !!
This is talent??????
nah 21 savage wrote this song for her fasho
BET IS RIGGED IT WAS NEVER LIKE THIS DULL BACK N THE DAY WE HAD IT POPPIN THESE RAPPERS TODAY ARE SLOW WITHOUT SHOW OR TELL  REEL TALK
🔥🔥🔥
she rapping over the vocals yuck rap the vocals without the audio
You can tell they prioritized the budget according to popularity…. Ice Spice had the whole NY Subway in her set. Latto had paper and plastic bags 😂
WHAT KAREN DOIN 😂
OKAY CHOREO she killed it!
She killed this Nicki somewhere choking and latto  looks soo pretty
we wanna hear Latto not the noisy dj like stfu
The crowd dead lol
I’m so proud of them! I feel like they can do solo things but they can become a duo and use a picture on every show of Takeoff
The sound mixing is so awful
lip synced the whole song..
I love how she did some dances from my day
But its nice too here there live
Who does 1M plus views on a performance in 1 1/2 days smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ latto a star
Nicki better tho😏
Not to objectify her AT ALL or sleep on her talent, but I just wanted to say I LOVE her beautiful face, hair, and body. She's just all that.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Embarrassing, she looks tired
She ain’t even rapping tho. The record in the background doing her job for her and y’all talking bout she snapped.
man she could've at least tried to rap..the performance was good tho😂
one of the few new rap girlies i actually LOVE
Thickest janitor ever!
At least she had her background voice, and didnt lip sync. Bih ill need a breath too.  Bruh what would be cool if she did a cartwheel or flip.
Yall they selling Palmolive dish soap??
Is it just me or is that one piece of confetti stuck to her foot the entire performance annoying lol. I just wanna rip it off 😂😂
This the clone Nicki was talking about 😂
How you lippin a live y’all b trying man then your mouth was closed while your live part was going and I’m talking about he back track
She did terrible at her lip singing. Shout out to Ice Spice who rapped her entire performance live!!
Ermmm, are we not going to speak about the fact that she wasn't rapping  live??? Love Latto, but if you can't rap live, what are we doing 😂 I'm here for the dancing, but she's a rapper.
Give all the real women Artist Ina game a black eye
, 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto is hot af 🥵
What I saw was her in a garbage suit...then in an outfit that wasn't anything special+ she failed to  lip sync rap lyrics while dancing and performing. I'm not impressed and I never hate on AUTHENTICITY AND REAL ONES🤭 Let's keep it 💯. It appears to me as a viewer that her strings are being pulled and the Puppetmaster didn't REMIND her to rap/lip sync for 3 minutes🤔. BE YOU WHOEVA THAT IS...I DON'T SEE THE REAL YOU
Please I need assistance I was affected by the earthquake which happened in turkey and I lost those who where precious to me I am just 17year old I would have really loved for you guys to help me with anything you can offer I beg off you
Let's go ❤
🎰🍒🎰🍒🎰🍒🎰🍒🎰🍒🎰🍒
she's such a performer, i love seeing her have fun while performing too!
She's a great and talented performer but I would of liked it without the lip singing and to hear her raw vocals.
Bet was trash...
Why one of her dancers look like Mercedes from p-valley??😭
*She-ET.*
Idk It’s Just I Can See 21 Savage Performing This From Cadence & All 🤔😂
Best hip hop...😂😂😂 who's latto? That voice is sh%#
That was 🔥🔥
Not big latto fan but this was so much fun to watch!! Good job!!! Saweetie could never 😂😂😂
World famous dj von and Latto did it
At this point why you have a mic!?!!?!?!, lmfao😅
🩵🩵🥵
amerahh ateee with the choreo!!
Latto was literally the only female performer with rhythm this year tbh.
Damn girl you giving big big energy with this performance. Fell in love minute by minute 😍. Love the face expressions the most !
This was an entertaining choreography routine. There was no rap performance in this. I think if she practiced doing her lip-sync WITH her dancing, she'd be a much better performer.
WTF HAS BET BECOME
Why didn't she cash im on Cardi! She looked like Britney Spears lipsyncing.
She look so beautiful 😍😍😍😍
This performance is like a lip sync battle performance not really a live performance saying words when you feel like it
Not her lip syncing hahahhahaha
YYYEEESSSSS MAM, THIS IS HOW YOU PREFORM!!!🔥🔥🔥
Y'all be hyping these minimally talented lames up. Hip hop is in trouble 🥴🙄 Nikki will be a grandma b4 someone else surpass her at this rate lol
She definitely sending shots at somebody
Umm its a no n cardi vs harder
Beyonce needs to come get her. She's very talented!
🤢🤮
YOO I LOVE LATTO! SHE NEVER DISAPPOINTS! So energetic and fun! She looks gorgeous 👏🏾👏🏾
her presence 💅
Periodt and this the best I seen her let’s give Teyana Taylor her props for getting the girls together
Def better than Ice Spice lack luster performance🤷🏾‍♀️  Chile was still rehearsing! She just got thee elite push being her. Industry plant axx. She seems sweet but Just don't push FALSE talent on us.
ATL HEAAAUUUXXXXX👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😩❤
❣️❣️❣️Left It On The Floor ❣️❣️❣️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💋
Does she ever have the mic on? 🙄
Good job lattoooo
Love her
What is this trend of women rappers insulting each other's V? You never hear male rappers talking about other men's D's. Do better ladies...
now this! is a performance!!!!! yes ma’am
Trash
Oh I like this for her!!
Amazing award show performance!!! 😍
I LOVE HER ❤
❤❤❤❤ her...and she kept her dam clothes on... true Queen
she has amazing stage presence!! she look so comfortable up their she was ready to perform 😂 i love this for her ❤
Different generation. No meaning to the music or performance. TERRIBLE
Fabulous now that's lyrics that's beef don't be chicken put it on the flo!!!
AND ATEEEE
Video was better, going to see it right now.
Latto had the better performance idk what people talmbout
The height is really not there. Nobody cared about this song until a Cardi B hopped on it. And now Cardi B is back to minding her business. And no I don't like her at all latto is trash and bet is also
This song is too hard 🔥  I hate they put all that extra sound in it, cause the song so perfect like it is.
It’s cute but remove the lip sync I like her voice instead
mic out ?? 😅
she is a rapper ?? 😅
Yeah, it's definitely given EBT awards. Notice how none of the icons don't go Anymore, but I'm not going to name Them It's very much giving. This is what we had to Settle for.
Coi had best performance she killed it latter shitted to
I luv the performance the best one so far
The lip syncing was awful. How do you stop rapping to a lip-synch like it’s not happening
The band did that tho!!!!!!
Voice over?
I want to hunch you so bad 😢
So we just lyp synced the whole performance 😭😭
She ate this one thang
I've realized that I only care for the female rappers that can PERFORM! She did that!
Whatever
She killed  that performance @ the bet awards 💯🔥
She barely rapped
Boss
🔊🔊🎶🎶🇹🇹🇹🇹🔥🔥☝🏿☝🏿
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
GOATED! She really den did better den anybody who ever touched rap game 🥹🥹 I’m so proud sis
🔥👑💪🏿❤️💯
T Marie and Sa-Rock are two females that can rap way better.
So proud of her!!
Y’all can hate on Latto all y’all want but the stage present and lyricism is there!!!! 🔥
I guess we dance more then rap these days
Lmfao so now rappers are using the studio record as the background and then also lipsyncing to a prerecorded live track acting like she rapping live.. all you gotta do is say the words sis... its not like youre singing a song.   Lmfao these new artists really don't have no stamina and breathing technique.   Yall gotta stop drinking and smoking all that damn hookah if its that hard
This right here is a performer

So much hype for this when Janet Jackson performing wayyy better and harder than this at ancient years old. Its just plain sad that this is "talent" now. Damn.

Yarsss Lottooooooo you smashed it on the floorrrr 🔥🔥🔥🔥🌟🌟
She did that..  watched her on the jd show always liked her… I guess he me dad isn’t in the pic anymore.. but I loved the acknowledgment to everyone either way.. cute performance 💙
❤🔥
She not evening rapping no way this girl did not deserve to win the award
She would have killed if she was able to perform the lyrics. I heard the voice over more than her. She does have stage presence and can dance.
She so damn pretty❤beautiful bi racial women....
Represent for the Southside Lotto!!!! 🙌🙌🙌 Hit that pool place one time!!!!
Ice spice can def learn a thing or two from Latto lol
She did good I just wished she sang more
This is what you call A PERFORMANCE!!!! Latto came and put on a WHOLE PRODUCTION!!!! TV WORTHY I LOVE ITTT😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I rewinded so many times
This is what music is now 😅
My God man 😅
🚮
This was really cute.
Trash
Mmmm it was ok
She horrible at lip singing & i like. CARDI part i thought she was gone pop out
She just need to remember to keep rapping during her performance
Not a fan I will pass on her and her music
The best show hands down! She didn't even have to show all her skin! It was perfect! Actually, not showing to much made her even more sexy!
Why she ain't signing horrible 😢
Latto out here killing it and putting that work in!!! So proud of her it’s your time to shine❤❤❤
Big fan since the rap game
❤❤❤
Wow! This was mid at best . I swear y'all hype anything up . She wasn't even singing half the time . 😂
You can’t hate on this performance she killed it
😂😂😂😂😂 it took 10 rap girls to try & replace Nicki & it's still falling flat 🤢 we need the original. Not the scratch off. 😊
❤
Booooooooooooooo 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Well done. Grown up performance with fun and energetic dancing.
I love latto ❤❤❤
She really can’t dance and she is Lip Syncing
Lotto did so good!!!
LATTO put it on DA floor ❤❤❤❤ dat was fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🚒🚒🚒🚒🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is that GRANDMAAAAA 2:22 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Latto got all the star quality ! Love her
Lotto ate the while plate. Quick branding idea she better sell that outfit I guarantee it'll sell out in mins.
Who’s rapping for her though? Cause she definitely lip syncing
All the talent in the world and they got trash like this on stage smh
Awards get worse every year
She look like ANGELA WHITE❤
Really enjoyed the choreo and transitions! Really creative performance😊
Laptop didn't cum 2 play props
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
this is just awful
I Love latto🥵🔥
Wtf is this.
She did really good….makes me wanna see her in concert
I see ice spice, sweet as lemon , but I pick cinnamon sweet as sin, with rum, but the classic rum, take a shout as you inhale then exhale, yeah then blow a kiss at your truest love,❤❤❤🤴☯️👸🤝👸☯️👸
Okay 👍🏽 She Did That!!!
Was her mic even on?
Ok but did she forget to lip sync??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chicken heads dancing around like salt shakers that’s what the games been missing yeah right
Ummmmmm something off I wasn't feeling her on the performance 😕 I'm sorry
Great performance 👏 👌 And this isn't my Era at all. But who besides me thought she was choking😂
They calling anything on BET music these days 😢
I'm a Latto fan since Rap Game but what's with the new girls dancing and not even pretending to lip sync then throwing in a couple live sentences lol
Loved that she did the original version. That kitty line is hilarious!
Talent without nudity! Love it. Much respect Latto!
Trina vibes
I dunno.... She always misses the mark for me... Her voice sounds horrible live and the dancing looks hilarious.
Not everyone can do what Beyoncé does on stage or even wants to. I mean Latto’s performance was not bad. I don’t understand why she get’s so much hate.
Dancers lit😳🤪👏👏🥰 I missed the awards…watching replays now😳 Let’s Go Latto!!! Stay original don’t let no one change you🤩
Ummmm did she forget she was supposed to be lip syncing? She up there just running and dancing. Lol
Do the A TOWN STOMPPP!! OH YEAA
Two thumbs down. No lyrical skill. Just bouncing and sounding like a man. What's good about that performance.  She let her music play instead of actually rapping.
SHE ATE THAT, the beats and transitions were on point🔥🔥
"I'll spend that 500 before I ever trap u" 😂😭😭😭
went from Michael Jackson & James Brown on stage together at the BET Awards …to this 😂😂 culture dead ashell
Mama didn’t miss NO rehearsals! I know that’s right!!
🔥🔥
Well this was just a dance routine over the track, not a legit performance. I’m a Latto fan but she gotta perform more authentically without so much backing vocals really takes away from it and just makes it a dance routine.
This bish at a drug store
Jesus loves all repent for your sins ❤️🙏🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You did well Big Latto!  The dance was lit, you must have had difficulty breathing with all that energy because I mostly heard the background song and little from your voice. Such a great performance.
Ok latto 😊❤ u did that
Her being able to for tell her future as a janitor is gold 🤣
idk why its such a trend to hate latto… but she ate this ❤🎉 im proud of that performance
Good performance but say what yall want Ice spice rapped all her lyrics during her performance.  Lol
Even the props understood the assignment like how the bag ended up on the shelf ?😂
I’m good
She killed that performance❤
She's not a good live performer.😢 Meghan is so much better.
LATTO ATEEEEEEE DOWNNNNNNNNNNNN🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😮 where is the song
That’s my gurllllll❤️❤️❤️
B!tch Latto zero stage presence 😢
She lip singing!!!  Why the female can’t just tap like the guys!! All that dance got her off 😮
But she did her thing tho
So she forgot that she was lip singing wtf 😂😂😂😂😂
She definitely did put it on the floor 🎉
Our culture
Are 🔥🔥👌🏽
I’m sorry but this is trash
I ❤ that she pays a lot of homage to Southern rappers ogs and new ones and she’s actually a good performer, goes out there and has fun. Now if she linked up with Teyana Taylor and Aunties production man she’ll be next level!💯💯💯🤷🏽‍♀️
Is she actually lip syncing to her pre recorded vocals? lmao latto wtf!
The bag she threw casually landing perfectly on the shelf
She actually did good
Big Latto
Lmao she got caught lip-syncing on a pre-recorded track ?  Nah Ice Spice cleared tonight just for her live perf
The total package! ❤
Latto killed the performance period.
I enjoyed this performance latto did good
This is hip hop this? Im done 🤣🤣🤣
Lotto stole the whole show 👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥
You can tell she’s having fun! This was great LATTO!
She isn't even rapping
Garbage! This generation is trash
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stop and she’s wearing a plastic bag as a top😭
Wow i’m officially old cause i don’t get it 😢
LOVE LATTO
🚮
Now girl wtf that big  azz cart on stage, I mean who's idea?? Besides that eye sore she did that, baby the way my lungs would collapse trying 2  dance yet dance & sang chile more power 2 u eliens.
She did a very good job i wad pleasantly surprise
🗑️🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
She hit every move but her lip singing was way off
🐷
❤️‍🔥🚦❤️‍🔥❤️
😂
🫣
Good she is starting to look more natural and her age
You know what she’s having fun on stage. That’s the point. 10s.
She’s good-looking She can rap She can dance!!
The performance is nice. The backing track while she jumps in and out rapping is annoying. She look good. Her dancing is way better. The song is ok.
Rip me out THE PLASTIC ❤❤❤❤❤🎉😅🥰🤩🥳
Why 😂😂😂😂
Latto really came a long way as far as her performance…Good Job
Latto’s stage presence is out of this world 😊
I thought she was a rapper. I would prefer an artist actually perform their music and dance less. She always has the track playing in the background but this time she had her live vocals prerecorded and didn’t even lip sync too then. Very weird
She always looks Good! asf & raps with good Bars🔥🔥
Issa no for me
We used to have lil Kim and now we have this lol God save our generation
on go like grizz💥s/o tee grizzly
I h8 her
She did great but at the same time it’s too much dancing and not enough rapping for me 🥴🙄😂
She made that for Nikki Minaj. Imaginary Smoke. Lol. Lol.
I'm convinced most of the comments are bots there is no way
damn that girl....getting big
I love this song & performance 🔥🔥❤️‍🔥 Is it just me.. or did any notice she was doing get silly & the walk it out dance ?! At 0:40. I was like ayeee she’s bringing the dances back 😂
Where is DJ Cassidy?
lmao uhhh😂
The way her shirt is suppose to resemble the “thank you” grocery bags😍😍😍
Shots at Nicki or nah?
The lip syncing ruined it
Y’all always talking bout she out of breath but now y’all mad she didn’t rap???
Energy and facial expression while dancing love it !!!
The performance is almost there. Wish she would sing without the track. The track is distracting.
Latto can really dance
Not 1 crumb left
LOTTERY TICKET HAD NO ONE ACTING BRAND NEW ….The EBT awards haven’t been lit since 2018
So baddd wtf
She killed it 🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️
It’s the Nicki disses she was throwing for me! 😂😂💯💯
If these artist practice like Beyonce they would be 100 times better , that means dancing singing an working out at the same time
She killed this ❤❤❤❤ BIG LATTO BIG LATTO 🔥
Her stage presence is amazing!! The crowd dead lmaooo tbh the whole Award show was but Latto did good
I liked this performance but gurl....  Next time don't rap if you ain't gonna rap the whole song 😅
Y’all caught the Nicki sub right 😂
Proud of her!!!
very good performance
Love you latto ❤💃🏿
I think she thinks she’s Beyoncé
Regardless of the hate she knows how to come through
Ice spice >
I like the effort she puts into her visuals! She cool
Nothing to say but, she did IT.
SHE ATE?????
She like cardi b entertaining but rapper will never be
Is this what won smh
She killed it
Damn Latto dud her thing! Imagine if Cardi B would come out as Surprise!🎉
Big Latto!❤❤🤧
What in the Square dance is this bs
How @LATTO sucked in this, she didn’t sing nothing, that performance lacked  entertainment and didn’t want leave me wanting more. That’s maybe the last performance in awhile you’ll see of her. That track isn’t #1 material
Lame
Latto kilt it Fr🔥🔥🔥
Love the outfit 😍 🔥
Ok she can't sang and dance 🩰🩰🩰 @ the same time. Maybe she's needs to Work on her dance and Voice control to Kp. the Stammer working Properly
I mean I loved the dance. But miss ma'am didn't even try to hide she wasn't rapping. She said yall gone get these dance moves dassit
The best performance
Why is the thumbnail her throwing up the sign
So proud of you Latto ! Remember when you were a kid ! Now you soning  bitches ! Job well done lil lady😊1:40
It’s a lot of jumping & not enough rapping 😭
Teyana Taylor got her toes bleeding 👏🏽 the choreography is really good
That’s the only song she had to deliver and got an award for that nonsense 🙆🏾‍♀️
She might leave every one else behind
This song ain't bad at all but go on... giving tic toc thirsty
She was so confidence in her performance and that’s what made her KILL IT! You ate Lattooo
very unimpressed and underwhelming.
I like this latto. You did good this year and really improved your craft. It’s noticed. Good job.
I love how she’s paying homage to Lil Kim by the green, blue, yellow and red backdrops, like in the ‘Crush On You’ video!♥️
Why are they tryna label us like we only do rap music we got jazz country we got it all what's up with that...
Latto did her thing! Best new artist
Killed it. ❤
I ❤her❤❤❤❤
This what I need from ice spice I like when the rap girls give shows like singers and performers
she killed that❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Those back up vocals tho lmaoooooo
I can't stand this lady acting like she is ghetto but she really ain't. And top of this she forgot the lyrics.
This reminds me of when she was on the rap game couldn't rap then and cant rap now.
LATTO ALWAYS BRING FIRE🔥
Garbage
Latto smoke that good gas and forget the lyrics to her whole rap song 😅
Waste
girl
Even Ice spice is eating her up in views lol this award show is a joke . She’s better but ice spice bet award performance got more clicks and views lol you can’t make this up
These new rappers can't rap a whole song live without being all out of breathe on top of failing to rap full on live!!! How you lip synching a rap???? It ain't like you got to hit notes.
No talent nowadays.
Rest in peace shawty lo
Pre recorded vocals. A lot of artist do it nowadays
Did she forget her own lyrics 😅😂
Best performance of the night. Then boosie in the crowd with his lawyers after coming home. Again
❤ girl you killed that.
Latto❤❤❤did the dam thanggg
That 'let me pop out' part 🔥
Real talent is definitely a thing of the past
ATL stand up. Sorry Meghan it's over for you but you had a good run.
she was better than Ice Spice!Her sound is raw!!!
She never wrong for me ❤
Y’all mad that she’s lips singing like did y’all see her Coachella performance be for real!!
She forget to sing
🏃🏾💨💨💨
Can we get the live audio please 😩😩❤️
Lmaooo not Nicki going to pick up the script 😂😂😂😂
Is someone else rapping behind her?
BigLattooooo!!!!! ❤
I love this performance
And I heard bout yo kittyyyy
Time for Beyonce and Latto collab
All the ATL dances she incorporated!!
Asake deserve the bet awards
Killed it. I think people don’t understand that sometimes the track is playing for the dancing part, she’s not meaning to lip sync in that moment.
I hate the backing track it’s annoying and it takes away from thier vocals
Love it
This is one of hwr best performances. Dont even matter she forgot the lip sync. This was LIT
Put it in the trash 🗑️😂😂😂
old girl
0:56 she def did smtn
This would’ve been perfect if she actually used her mouth to rap her song ? She just danced the whole thing 😢
Best performance hands down y’all just hating cause she pretty bf fr
WHO IS RAPPING?!?!?!?!? THE LIPS ARE NOT MOVING, YET I HEAR VOCALS.... I cant
That smile at 0:57 was cute because I looked like she heard them scream the song out. 😍😍🥰
All I can say is true performing azzzzzz guhhh lol 💛💛💛
How she won best rapper and don’t rap she da be not even lip singing
Latto ate
now she is a stiff dancer give me a break bearly rap any lyrics has no stage presence female rap is in the trash like this song
This was kinda Wack 🤷🏿‍♂️ She always looks the part but this performance was jive 💩
She always bringing over her music you never hear her doing it on her own that really sucks
Ice Spice did way better !!!
Hate to be that person but the way my ocd is set up.. I was too distracted by what’s stuck to her shoe.
Ice clears her in every way 🤷🏽‍♂️
🔥🔥🔥⭐️
my girlllll🥹🥹
True definition is sex sells 🚮 🤷🏻‍♂️
Mannnn this so hard it’s a souf thang 💅🏾❤️🔥💪🏾
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
Love Latto
This was awful
This was terrible
Cardi
Go latto I got chills baby !
Not gon lie this a 21 flow
Turn off that freaking background track! This concept is fire 🔥  the energy on point, all of that greatness being over-shadowed by the annoying background vocals. When you are playing at this level and want to reach new heights, stuff like this gotta be under control. This was happening  to the Migos; well Off-set and Quavo for a min, too during their set, but then they fixed it. I think it was a sound control thing. Yall gotta chill with those reference tracks. If you slip and forget the audience, know your shid and will def help you out.
American artist cant even come close to jamaican artist when it comes to live performance they forever singing over track😶
The choreography popped off 😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉
IT's a no for me, pass
Hmmm
Anyone know how tall LATTO is ?
Love me some Latto! She really is THAT girl now.
Great performance
RIP ME OUT THE PLASTIC 🔥🔥🔥
Get out of satan system and get in God system before it’s too late
🔥
Big latto ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
She's so Corny I'm sorry I tried since rap game she just ozzes cornball trying to hard
Please the lip sync isn't giving 😂
No Public Enemy No Nas No Common No Rakim Allah No KRS1 honoring HipHop for who?
I’m so Proud ❤️❤️ CLAYCO STAND UP
Ayyyyeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥 Latto Delivered. She worked. I'm so proud of her. She deserves her spot and her time. Y'all better stop playing with her. Atlanta business ❤🙌🏾
She a rapper who dance but can’t rap and dance at the same time…..Ook😶
Latto Killed it!
Lattos new fan base is straight nicki haters🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow from the Rap Game reality show to the BET damn Latto you came far
She’s fire 🔥
Wtf
Some ppl just hating shes dancing and tryna rap at the same time its her background vocals but her mic on unlike some of yall favorites ijs 🤷🏿🤷🏿
She looked soooooooooo good!!!!
that audio was weird, do better BET.
I SPEN DAT 500 HUNND BEFORE I EVER TRAP YO😂😂😂😢😅😅😂😂U# COLDEST SHYTT EVER ON HER SHYTT😂😂😂
Okayyyyy Big Latto, I'm an official fan!!!!!!!!
Damn everyone in these comments section DELUSIONAL
The background louder than her voice, like... Really? She is so mediocre. Black artist quality has been decreasing, bring back 20s.
That look like some old Ciara type dancing and choreography she used
This was one of the best performances of the night!
What’s the point of performing and you not even singing 🙃
She looked like she had fun throughout this whole performance 😊
It’s always Latto for me
Best performance of the night! She was actually performing and not just standing up there.
I love Latto but its the lip synching argh
I see a lot of "she killed it" comments. She didn't even rap half of the track, and when she did it was over a vocal track. The bar is getting really low for these live performances.
It’s crazy how it’s a conversation, as to whether or not a rapper is live or lip syncing. At what point, did rappers start using backing tracks? Growing up, that was a conversation, reserved for, pop stars.   I enjoyed the performance. To be honest. I used to find Latto, underwhelming. And I thought she would start to lose steam, at this point. She’s clearly growing.
😍💨
Ugh I just love her. Love the dancing !
Yessss 🔥🔥🔥
21 better never slip up .. onG
This song and this performance is tired and thru. On God
Lip synching
Yawn. How you can’t even keep up with your own playback is beyond me. This is acceptable for 2023 though according to the comments smh
So for the dum azz that said she forgot to lip sync, it’s called a back track but she was rapping live , and if you listen to the crowd was singing along with her at certain points and cheering ‼️‼️‼️‼️
Not a fan of the performance
Latto came with all the ATL original dances. She did not disappoint
Ate🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dumpster juice
I love how ice spice is in the audience during this
This song sucks
The dancing was great the lip syncing was trash. Yes i know shes not Beyonce but it was only 3 min. Practice practice practice.
Love her & the energy, I just wish she kept lip syncing so it didn't mess with the performance
I hear her back vocal track better than I hear her. Garbage, the girl stops singing every time she dances. She needs to practice breathing and do some cardio.
Another hit for latto congrats for latto ❤❤❤
Wack AF. Lip singing. One person who has best performance and doesn't lip sing: Megan Thee Stallion😊
Everytime I see Latto perform o just think about that dance seen in The Rap Game and how hard all the kids was dancing 😂😂
🔥🔥
Talk about piss poor performance. Clean up on isle 4 lottos career. Get it together 🤦🏻‍♂️
She ruined the event.
Idc, IDC WHEN TF DID RAPPERS START FKN LIP SYNCN'?!??! And did a ish job at THAT??? Chileèeee. You just really embarrassed yoself. For reals. You BIG MAD STILL????!?!?!?😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂The Queen would NEVER!😂😂😂😂🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
She killed et
Love me some Latto
Her performances are getting better and better.
Brilliant performance she gtta remember to mouth the words even if she’s not live but that was dope af
Love including shawty lo🩷🩷🩷
Be honest, who else was waiting for Cardi B?
I hate when they rap over their recording !!!! Freaking perform without the voiceover!!!!
Somebody else noticed the woman in apink dress and white shirt?😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
DJ Vonn is amazing he should be in every latto performance
The dancers was dancing okay !!!!
She killed it and her stage presence is amazing❤❤❤
That crowd was dead af 😂 had this been nicki the crowd would have said every single word.
Did dattttt n i was scared they wasn’t going to pull the janitor fit off quick enough 🤣🤣
They keep doing the coke thing😂😂
I mean if ur gonna lip sync you might as well just dance the whole song and not run around
I love this❤❤❤❤
Yikes
Who???
We know they are lip syncing but someone forgot to Latto she has to pretend to be rapping with the tape
She doesn’t have stage presence like ice spice
Good performance but pretty sad that she used her moment to throw shots at Nicki.  I pray Nicki continues to pay her dust because that’s the only reason most people are paying attention
Latto has really grown on me! I love the creativity here. She forgot to lipsync lol but still SOOO ENTERTAINING!!!
Someone really gotta teach her how to lip sync💀
I believe her mic was off the whole time💀💀 cause even the parts where her vocals sounded live she was busy dancing instead of rapping💀💀
Terrible,
Trash
Lmaooooo
I like the fits and the performance. Better than just popping azz
AMAZING 💖
At some point can originality be a part of the show, every body keeps doing the same thing.
Most ppl cant breath and dance she actually performed but its a reason most rappers rap then dance a little . She chose to dance more than rap cause these are really twerking songs . She killed the dancing
Yes lotto slaying as usual Pooh the haters keep hating but she still blowing up they can’t compete when they never could compare to her they irrelevant and in competition with they self and the 🐱 still giving 🎣
❤😢🎉🎉❤❤❤❤😅
Ok latto love the performance
Go ahead girl.Go ahead girl.Go ahead girl.Go ahead girl.Go ahead girl.Go ahead girl.Go ahead girl. 👏👏 CHOCO-LATTO 🤩🤩🤩
I’m sorry but this chick can’t perform lip syncing the whole time and not even lip syncing? 😂
You can tell she’s lip syncing. But stage presence was there!
Great performance Latto❤😍✨
This just not it 🗑 🗑
She did that! I just wish she rapped more with her choreo....but that stage presence was ON IT!
She got to much going on
I like Latto set on stage it's about time for me to go to the grocery store now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She lame smfh!!
Best dance performance did she even remember to sing
SHEEEE ATEEEE OMG
She ateee and left no crumbs as usual!!
Latto better RUN that Ticket Price UP 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 Best Performance shell be just FINE.
A whole mess 😭😭
Is this what y’all call a great performance???!! SMH
Sooo is she a rapper or a dancer? I'm confused
Super dope performance! Also s/o to Teyana Taylor with the fire choreo and artist development!🔥🔥
The only thing that would have made this performance bigger than what it was if she would have brought out Omeretta and did the Sorry not Sorry remix Omeretta had the industry going dumb with remakes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did she forget to lip sync ?? She barely was rapping 😭
I like Latto, but girl you are supposed to sing, and display your talent.  Not ripping off clothes and dancing to the track.  Are you the star or a backup dancer?  Pick a lane.
We need someone to help save rap please god send someone quick, please
BIGGGG  LATTO!!!
I love it Latto … that was a performance
SOOOO... NO ONE GONE CALL HER OUT FOR THE HORRIBLE LIP-SYNC? OKAY!
not her wiping her nose to diss nicki lol 0:29
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
R.i.p shawty lo
Why the backing track? Just rap! 😂 and that’s really the difference.
I love latto been a fan since forever
Ayeee latto was walking it out
A lot these new artists need that Mathew Knowles training
Very creative
So we have Two BET Hip Hop Awards now.
Lol comments full of bots! She’s one of the weaker performers of her generation.
LAATTTOOOO BABYYY PUTTINNN ON THE FLOOR FOR DEZE HOESSS 🙌🏽🙌🏽💜💜🔥🔥 MY FAV IDGAF
TRASH
Yesss
latto killed it
All I can say is Ayeeeeeee
Horrible
She did great!!
Would've been perfect if she just had a mic instead of that headset but 9s across the board 👏 👏 👏 ❤
She can’t even rap live
Ummm she forgot to lip sync...and again just like the other performances of the night....it's all been done before so yawn dude
Lattto...killed itt...❤
I’m so mad they put her in that outfit… her outfits been fire last couple of months and I can’t believe they did this on her biggest stage
she clearly can’t rap and dance at the same time 😞🗑
She forgot she was lip syncing 😂 it’s all the meds
She did that!!!
looking like mariah carey in the flesh.... yes miss lottery.
She killed it. What a performance!!!!!😍😍😋😋❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
Playback
How did y’all think she got Big Latto! Cause I used to call Retta, Big R 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  SHE’S A COPY CAT, THESE HOLLWOODER’S DONT HAVE NO SAUCE B!$H!  ISNT LATTO FROM CHARLOTTE? HAHAHA  IM A HOUR AWAY! OOOP NOT MY TROLL DONNA 😘😘 HAHAHA  PROB TALKING TO ME IN THIS SONG BUT I WANT ALL THE SMOKE 💨😘😘😘  PLUS THE HOLLYWOOD PEOPLE THEY MAKE UP TROLL ACCOUNTS, U CANT SAY THEY DONT! WE ALL KNOW BETTER THAN THAT AS WELL! OOOPS 😅😁🤣🤣🤣   I think she finally matched the words up to her words finally at the end, she got it 😳😅😁😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
What’s up with the targe’ cart tho ?
Hey was the best
Can we talk about the dancers killing it  aye
a very poor performance😢
Those white pants were doooooopppeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why these performances not like the old new artists gotta get in they bad there performances be boring
Ayeeee!! Imaginary 🚬
This so so very 🔥🔥♥️♥️ With Latto performance at the 2023 performance
0:58 Nice Outfit. White looks neat.
Okay Latto!!!
This trash asffffff
Yawn 🥱   weak lyrics and nothing original to see. All the beats sound the same.smh.  I'll take Kim, Fox anyway  over this
She did that. Definitely entertaining
No
🥰❤️💛💚🇻🇮
This performance is giving Aespa's winter and ningning lipsynchinv the high notes in that one stage. Lattos give good stage performances speaking for myself when I watch her. Unless it was a dj or another background vocalist it sounded like she pre-recorded her live vocals
THIS WASNT GOOD AT ALL! They should just cancel the BET awards. These songs really not good. 👀
She ate
You can hate all you want but she killed this performance. You did it Latto👏🏾
Aye down south winning! 🔥🔥
Atlanta stand up! so proud of her! her stage presence has improved so much! you can tell she really wants it! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto always been my fav!!
she can't even keep up with her own song and she's lip singing
What kind of weird Trash is this😅. WTH. She wasn't even rapping half the time. Props were off. Talent is clearly based off looks these days cuz that was trash
I hate the performance version of these songs. It make it corny
lATTO MY GIRL
I hate these back tracks! Rap the fcking song!
Latto the white girl!
I'm a fan of '90s artists, anyone like me?
Lip sync mess
I love the dancing and energy, but the lip sync, not so much.
Ice Spice’s performance >>>
Rubbish performance. Trash music
Love the energy
Who was the smelly kitty line about?!? 😂😂😂
....
The Haters in these comments are Funny 😂😂😂😂 Best Female Rapper... Remember that
i swear to God nobody is bumping to this song. no flow,no swag,no cadence just a feel good song for the losers..
Just wish she would actually rap🙄
Lip singing to the track. She was clearly unable to keep up with the track because she had her tongue out of her mouth most of the time.
Uh oh, not them getting rachet in Target 😂
latto BEEN working. i think about all the beef she had when she was younger on the rap game and she doing better than everybody that had something to say about her. that’s how you do it!
She slayed frrrr
She trying but,,, Nikki goin to end her she keep taking shots!
Showing them why she won
Let’s goooooo Latto!!!!!
The performance was great as far as dancing but friend you gotta remember when you lip syncing. I was like friend move your lips😂
The girls at RCA dropped some coin on this. Like damn she had hella props.
A mess
Head mics for rappers are a miss for me and then she didn't rap half the time too into the choreography. Then there's a vocal track under her. She basically danced to her song, okay, I guess.
Killed it🔥 love her
Corny
Latto ATE 🔥  so happy she won!!!! well deserved and she definitely put it on da floorrrr
SHE IS WEAK, THO!!
Worst performance of the night
She did way too much, just rap
Trash why do they play the track in the back just rap
TORE THAT STAGE UP SWEETIE! Don’t play the LATTO honey🔥 Very fun, energetic performance and nice choreography. Great job!
I love Renni Rucci, but her lack of stage presence is why she’s not as big as Latto at this point😣😔
She killed what? Jumping around the stage. Bad lip syncing. Rap is all popularity now.
I'm too old for this new music. My soul just does not connect! Cute girl though!💜
❤💃🏽🤘🏽‼️‼️Aaaayyee 🔥 performance babee
It was too much going on
My fave song
She does more dancing than rapping. Ion like that cuz she a rapper not a dancer!! The set & choreo was perfect tho🔥
Yeah i dont like her. She has no flow or something like that. In my eyes she is no rapper
Very Good Job.  If I don't tear up, its not good. I teared up Latto. It was a performance,  not a concert.
Latto the shhhhh
is dit tegenwoordig hiphop ?
She killed this performance
WHATS HAPPENINNNNNN
I just knew Cardi b was finna pop out
Absolutely horrible live performance. It’s embarrassing 🤦🏾‍♂️
I'm sorry her raps been weak. Who listens to this nonsense. She cant even rap

Ghetto trash
Best performance 🔥
Damn she's a great ventriloquist
The choreography was 🔥🔥 homage to numerous dances .
Best lip sync
I’m mad she ain’t lip sync with her lip sync 😂😂😂
So today u just lip sync to a backtrack dance a little and u are a rapper? Are u fr?
She ate that
Congratulations latto. A super star 🎉🎉🎉
She did this … she show up and show upon🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trash
Latto look every bit of 38. Ijs
I can’t believe that girl won female rapper of the year she didn’t even rap her own song !!!! Bet y’all got to get it together ice spice had one of the bigger years and even glorilla has done more this year than jackpot
Her stage presence has really changed. Good Job Latto! She was lit!!!
As solid as the performance was Latto should have be rapping more.
BIG latto
These new rappers do more dancing than rapping now 😂
It dont take much to impress ya'll, lol
I'm old school I'm a 80 90 back in the day old school rap but I totally love me some latto and I'm a 70 baby ❤❤❤ she did that and then some
Trash
RIP - LO.
She sooo beautiful why ppl hate on my latto
Mouth wasn’t moving at all lol
She killed it
I rather they perform n lip sic Fr. LATTO  LOOKED BOMB
Nice 👍
🎉🎉👏👏🎵🎵🏆🏆🏆💃♾️💵
Yes ma'am
The fact that Latto can really dance makes the song even better. Loved it. Keep this vibe up Latto. This type of music and your freestyles be lit AF! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She def was lipinging over the backing track lol but overall she did good guess she gotta learn how to rap and move
Is she a grocery bag?.
Get it girl! She did that
Luv the FN outfit. Super cute!❤
Nahhhh
Weak..didn't even TRY to lip sync 🤦🏽‍♀️
The performance visuals are classic “corner store” “grocery store” theme is always gone hit 🤦🏽‍♀️…. I’m still looking at the colorful lights and packaging details behind her😭🤣🤣🤣
She was giving me new age Ciara a little bit. Maybe it was all those ATL dance moves she was doing. 🤷🏾‍♀️
We don’t care who u is Mr. DJ 😂😂
She really work on her core or got good genetics. I’ll give her that.
Yal satisfied with this? Just curious? Latto’s done better imo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥BEST PERFORMANCE from Latto that I have ever seen! She looks amazing as well!
I don't really listen or watch latto but I liked this. That fit 🔥🔥
Mic is off 😂
Too much going on
UnFortunately that was not a great performance😢
Oh nah she a killer forreal
New favorite female rapper
that dj killed too
Love her energy Big Latto 🎉
Not the best performance I’ve seen lol
Couldn't even watch it so cringy
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS, WHY SHE RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!! JUST PERFORM, IF YOUR MUSIC IS GOOD YOU DONT NEED TO DISTRACT EVERYONE BY RUNNING AROUND THE STAGE!!! DAMMM EVERYONE IS A RAPPER NOWADAYS!!!! MY EYES HURT TRYING TO KEEP UP!!!!
This was lame..all them older people in there who was cheering
Ummm 👀👀.... Next
People saying she killed this performance I'm like HOW?!? Girl forgot to lip sync & wen she did rap it wasn't on time with the backing track and sounded a whole mess! The dancing was good but we know she's been working w/ Teyana so ofc it would be but everything else was off 🥴🥴
Missed the show, but if this is what the performances were like, I didn't miss a thing.
Wack
Now if she could just fix her attitude that would be solid.
Target cart 🔥🔥🔥
I miss old artists this new artists are so trash
Latto uh bad girl
i wish y’all would stop putting that fake applause on these videos
The transition to the coi line she kinda killed that part 😂
（笑）
Hip hop is trash now
Stage presence was good but overall this was a bit underwhelming
Love the granny costume in the back
This was like to much and not enough at the same time
She killed it! If you say otherwise you a hater!!! 😊
Ummm cd hv done "rip me outta plastic i been acting brand new" for real
Choreo is on point. Set design is excellent
Excellent job super proud of you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ohhhhhh, she took the oath Clearly.
Shoulda brought out Cardi B 😢
🥰🥰🥰🥰
YESSSS 😍
ateeee
song already been on repeat 🔂 😤
PERIODTTTT
Respect she want all the smoke because coilrey in there!!
mellow buck flow
She never raps her lyrics smh was this a stage play or a rap performance?
Best performance
she barley rapped her own song 😂
Queen 👑  777 ✨️
Her performance was so 🔥 even the prescription bag landed on the counter when she threw it
Idc what nobody says Big Latto is NEXT!!!! 🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰
Why she keep fu*kin up damn latto everytime she perform she do this like she forget to sing or turn down the backup music ..
Lip sync?? 😮😮😮 Like how are you missing so bad
Baby 😢♥️
Cringe
Rip shawty lo
🔥  🔥
So she's supposed to be the rapper but yet I spice rapped her song without her voice track playing in the back minus the hooks? Lotto please sit down. Lotto spent more time making faces, making coke sniff gestures and running across set with a semi wardrobe malfunction, lip syncing and we are suppose to like that? 🙄
😂😂😂
That's my girl period
YUHHH VERY MUXH ATE TF DONT PLAY WITH LATTO AND THATS ON PERIOD
From the Rap Game to The Rap game. Crazy
It’s a no!
Was that a lip sync or was I tripping??
moves and lyrics done ripped off from big soulja
It would of been better if her mic was on and not lip syncing
Proud of latto for going so far since the rap game ...JD gave us another one❤❤❤❤
Besides Cardi, Latto is taking the female entertainer lane to another level.  Yo, she performs ❤️‍🔥
Booooo 🤦🏾
😂🙌🙌🙌❤️❤️🥵
Bet sucks! I haven’t watched in over 10 years 😂ghetto snap awards…EBT
she needs more effort on this, she literally not rapping but dancing LOL
🔥🔥🔥
Big latto
gurl take your money 😭😭
Ehhh 🙄
She showed out!!
Great performance 🔥
Too lazy to rap your own lyrics.  Dang hip hop is so gone.  This definitely not flying 20 years ago.  Trash rap!
she sang 0 of the song.
Good job Latto
Go bish. Get u some LATTO.😍🤩☺️
that piece of tinsel on her shoe made me so anxious she was gonna trip on it 😭
LIPSYNC  FOR YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!! - JESSICA WILD  LOL
Why do all the women in rap sound the same garbage lyrics
She set the stage on fire with that one 🔥🔥🔥
0:58 how did you forget to say it…?!
She killed that lip sync
The plastic bags gotta stop
I was waiting for the plastic to come from under lattos shoe 😭
One thing she will do… is bring it!!! I love how much she’s grown in her career! Like if u been been knowing Latto before the changed name….THEN U ALREADY KNEW WITH THE RIGHT PROMOTION…SHE MOST DEFINITELY WILL BE RIGHT WHERE SHES AT…GETTING MORE MONEY 💪 BEEN SPITTING 🔥
The live track out here snitching lol
Bet awards looking pretty white. Guess the B don’t stand for black anymore
JD did that..
latto is sooo much more talented than most of these new rap girls and she has great STAGE PRESENCE
She lip singing most of the time
When she was coughing, I thought she was really coughing. She’s a good actress she got me thinking that it was real
Ice Spice did it betteeeeeeeeeeeerrrrr!!!💯 Latto has to improve her routine, she can bearly sing while dancing
She 💯 killed it
Wtf is This
Yall az weird that was horrible and was nowhere near talent. Yall just follow whoever somebody else follow or what yall see on social media. That was not talent. That was ghetto trash.
F you hating azz barbz LATTO killing s h i t. I can just feel she MEAN BUSINESS. She want that spot no matter how long it takes and i love it.
Ice spice better
smokin on that gas
Omg that 🛒 transition, LOVE, Somebody gettin HIRED!! YES, and shoutlut to the dancer at the cash register 📠 for being a genuine fan while dancing, it was giving energy and united front 🍯 yesss!
she killed fa real badazz chick
That shawty lo blend 🔥🔥🔥
So she record a version to make it seem live over the track and still don’t lip sync to it 😂 this was a great performance but she was making faces and sticking her tongue out the majority of the time.
The biggest 🏆
Good show, but the new artist needs to learn how to sing/rap. Thats why the sound is off because they are supposed to sing. The dancing is good, but people want to hear the vocals... they need Beyonce coaches... say what you must that girl sing and dance in heels for hours with three kids and she older than these young girls.
🔥
Umm....k
Horrible …😒
😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥
That's my baby Shawty lol would be proud period
She went up 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
She can’t be 24 years old
So she had a background lip sync and still didn’t sync with the lips sync THAT’S FUNNY
🌪🌪💥💥💥🌪🌪💥💥💥
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
RIP SHAWTY LO KOB 🙏🏾🕊👑
TRASH!
GREAT JOB💫
KEEP GOING📈KEEP FLOURISHING🍒🍒🍒🎰🎰🎰🍒🍒🍒🎰🎰🎰 BIG LATTO
She just came to dance
So much energy!!! Go Big Latto ❤️‍🔥
I feel sorry for the generation when you have no good music. I don't know what you
She’s different
KILLED IT‼️ Congratulations Big Latto 🍒🎰 ROOTING FOR YOU 🥺
seem like that silver thing caught to her foot was her biggest fan
😮😮😮🙈🙈🙈👀👀
Why did she lip sync 😞
she looks good doing anything you can’t convince me otherwise
BIG LATTO 🔥🔥🔥🎰🎰🎰🍒🍒🍒 BEST PERFORMANCE 👏🏽👏🏽
Why we rapping with the lyrics track?
Queen 🚨
I done seen way better from her, outfit and performance wise 🤷🏽‍♀️
She did that
People actually type in your name to hate. When the hate ain’t working 😅 CONGRATULATIONS BIG LATTO 🔥🔥🔥🎰🎰🎰🍒🍒🍒 GREAT PERFORMANCE 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
ate like always
Her breathe control and stage presence suck. She sound out of breath per usual.
OMG  She sounds horrible
I 😍 it
Her hair is everything❤❤
This was bad
Yesss no fucks givingggg lol
he thought he was putting on his headphones lmfao
So she cant rap and dance at the same time
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What happened to LIP SYNC FOR YOUR LIFE?😊
How she lip syncing on top of lip syncing but still didn’t sing
Weakest performance of the night! She was lip-syncing over lip-syncing and still didn't do it. 😒🤔 She needs to bring that ego down a notch.
Best performance of the night
She so corny
Wtf is this🗑
This is TERRIBLE ‼️
Best performance of the whole show besides migo!! Atlanta showed out
Lip Sync? Nicki Minaj would never! Damn the bar is getting low and low. Thank you Ice Spice
I’m old school, but most of this new music is boring. The rappers don’t seem to be putting much thought in the lyrics or the music. I prefer the old school rappers. I did like Offset and Quavo.
Very good performance!
The sound was off but the performance was great
I love me some big lattooo
She performed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So proud of her!
Can these new female rappers stop acting like Black women and hypersexuality are synonymous?
This performance was so inappropriate that it gave me secondhand embarrassment. I cringed as I watched it with my kid sister. Latto’s team, or anyone for that matter, should have told her and her dancers to tone it down. A performer needs to know the time, place, and audience. I know I am not the only one who is tired of this hypersexual batch of female rappers.
This was sad 😒
Soooo weeeeeak 😭😭😭 She thought she ate hahah
an entertainer 😂 idc if she forgot the track she was feeling it i love it
PLZZZZ Why weren’t the lips moving I love her
She had a ball and showed out 😁😁
So she refused to sing/rap along 😂
Eh 🥱
This was not it
We forgot about good performance?
What TF was this???
This is what hip hop has come too , really 🤦🏾‍♂️
It was cute performance.
The performance is great...I love that she actually danced instead of just twerking. However, Gotta be more vocal. The sound wasn't the issue. The issue was that she didn't apply both skills simultaneously (rapping and dancing). Even if she did the verses but just highlighted different parts in the  chorus
Latto actually did good this time and I love her outfit
No ice spice was better
That was the definition of doing too much. Didn’t understand what tf was going. Why is she in a custodian outfit with a mop?? Why is she at a grocery store??
So what bet gon do for the hip hop awards
it would have been better with out her rapping over the track. The track was louder than her! But she looked beautiful and had amazing energy 🤎🤎🙏🏾🙏🏾
Oh yeah rap over prerecorded tracks, that’s a real talent
Mid
There is no snooze - means you snoozed to see future earnings get taken from all contracts to the event. I have none. Give me a contract. I will show you how make without leaving the house. I am away. Get paid! Learn to read contracts. Stay ahead of the game.   Love, Miss Angel Gutierrez.
She didn’t really rap at all , hahahahahahahahahha just dancing
The lip singing😂
Cardi must’ve stayed home with the kids
She only rapped 40 percent of her performance
Not Latto hitting the chicken head yayyyyyy
Ice Spice & Doechii >>>>>
Nicki is shaking lmao she old af now ice ate her up
MOST DEF DID HER BIG ONEEE
not a performer…
The coke line is getting old. Girl you performing at EBT awards while “ole girl” got the vanguard award just for being your INFLUENCE😂🤭
Love the shawty lo mash up lol
This was dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto really ATE!!!
Trash 🚮
I like the performance but child why she forget she was lip singing?
My girl carried the performance
Great performance!!!
OMM AINT NB FW HER🤣💯
Latto baby if you lip syncing over your lip sync you can’t forget itttt! But bishhhh this right here was the best performance just keep topping your previous ones.
Horrible
ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES OF THE NIGHT GO BIG LATOO❤
That 💩 was horrible 🤣
She did that👏🏾
Where the classy women performing we don’t have love anymore everything aggressive even our women .. miss the Beyoncé’s Mary j Ashanti even though keyshia cole was ghetto she still had love in her music .. this performance was a C y’all just hype these BOPS UP
_SHE FORGOT TO RAP._
💎👸💎
Back tracks do not have words on them. If you’re singing your music live she forgot her lyrics in so many areas. How is this performance? Great, it was horrible.
It was dope her stage presence and performance quality is definitely growing as it should
Nicki & Ice getting Barbie BUDGETS  Latto gets BET budgets 🤣
She ate downn but she needa work on breath control cause u can tell it was a pre recorded track playin with the back track
🤸🤸🤸🤸🤸 yea put it on the floor 🤸🤸🤸🤸🤸🤸
I aint gonna lie she killing ice 😮
❤ latto
I don’t really listen to Latto, but she ate this. This was cute. The transitions were 🔥🔥. Plus she can dance and she’s smooth with it. This was artistically fluid.😍💪🏾
I’m a fan of 90s artists but she killed it 🔥🔥
She just came to dance
Culture Vulture
Nfs I’m proud of female artist doing they thang this year 🔥🔥🔥
She slayed!! Bomb AF!
This is genuinely a horrible performance
She can’t sing and dance at the same time.. smh horrible performance
She always goin eat tho 🎉❤ Congrats to latto❤
She killed it 🤪💥🏆🎰
Is this the Hip-Hop Awards?
FLOP
Wtf 😂😂😂
Doechii had the best performance
She did an okay job, but why she look so angry 🥴😭🤣
She is one of my favorites rappers ❤❤❤
Go Lattoooo she said she dancing she dont care bout lip singing Big Latto Ayeeeeeee ❤❤❤❤❤ 😂😂😂😂😂 yall mad ❤❤❤❤❤
THISSSS WHOLLEEE PERFORMANCCCCEE???? 😩😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 she really be doing her thing when it comes to stage presence!! TUH
Glad to see all these ladies performing females doing the thang right now in the game
Lol😂,it's like a high school performance
L
Is this like a prerecorded performance for the performance lol visual it was good but she forgot to sing the song
I like Latto she is a good rapper, she made a hit I love it . She really made a twerk song for y'all ladies 🎤😄 The 2023 BET AWARDS were lit . 🔥
0:57 !!!! 😮‍💨
Great performance??? Wtf. She stopped rapping.
Y’all think jay z and Beyoncé just stay home watching this and laughing?
🔥🔥🔥
All these rap chicks songs are ratchet asl
Trash
Love me some Big Latto
Hands down my fav performance of the night 🤷🏾‍♀️ she killed this 👏🏾😊
I just don’t get why she couldn’t actually do her own lyrics and dance? I love Latto… just lost on why why was so excited to smile in camera while performing rather than just performing!
Awful
I love her look. She looks so natural and realistic
I love Latto, but I was not loving this performance, my opinion. This song is so fire Latto would have killed this performance by keeping it simple. A nice background, a few dancers, a fire outfit, perfect makeup and hair, and A LOT of energy is all she needed.
🔥🔥🔥
TEYANNAAA TAYY CHOREOGRAPHY BBYY
🖤
Honestly that 3 minutes felt like 7-10
Females taking over Rap. They had her doing too much during her performance. She still did a good job tho.
The Barbz be delusional 😂
"SMOKING ON THAT GAS BLUNT BIG AS COI LERAY"😂😂🕺🏼
best performance
great performance yeeeeah
WAS WAITING FOR HER-!!! .WHO TOLD HER NOT TON. TWERK WHAT HER MOM GAVE HEEERhh.this 🗣🗨PG
Not feeling this trash azz music at all. I sure hope we can move on quickly from this era garbage for hiphop music to survive another 50yrs cuz this aint it
She did her thang. Go Big Latto💯💃❣️🔥
The grandma!! 😂😂
Eating too many hamhocks
Peace to the nu skool 🛜
Trynna Diss the queen while mimicking her every move LMAO
Boy hell nah this performance was soo mediocre wtf. From the dancing to the lip syncing it was a huge disappointment 🚮
She alway look slow and out of breath lol
Corny
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 As usual!🔥🔥🔥
She don’t ever actually rap a whole song……… We did not ask for dancing with the stars…. She needs to practice her breath control rapping and dancing. Like how you run out of breath after a few beats into the routine and need the back track to play for you…. EVERY performance
She's a dope artist ❤ better than Megan stallion 😂
She keep tryna put her finger under her nose saying nicki Minaj do coke 😂😂😂
Not only is the music gar-bage, but the performance weak too.🤦🏾‍♂️
She ain’t even try to lip sync
so you know that back in the day, they trained to dance and sing at the same time. It was called artists development. It's called practice
Off beat
she really is a great performer. they just need to get the sound together for these award shows
LATTO RAPPERS DONT LIP SYNC BUT I STILL LOVE YOU
It was a good idea but the fact she barely rapped her song the track did all the work it made her performance look bad and I love her but this was not her best
Did she forget to lip sing? This is pre-recorded😮😂😂😂😂 I can't
LATTO❤️‍🔥
LOVED IT!  BIG LATTO!!! 😍😍😍
She killed it
Sorry. Not impressed. Pretty girl though.
Good energy!
Hate it 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
People always got something negative to say  Lip sing or whatever that’s all you seen WHAT ABOUT HOW SHE STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOW SHE HERE❤
LMAO BYE .  So she can’t move and rap! I just wanna know why she wasn’t rapping lol. She said a total of 16 words. Then they couldn’t unwrap her 😂🫠
It's a rare gift to sing your own song without lip syncing it's a rap thing...I'm a song writer  & singer I don't care what when why or who I need nothing but oxygen to sing or rap my originals. Now.! Let's talk about her corny performance
Not lip syncing
It’s giving coke. Scratch off done lost her mind.
she needs to go to the britney spears academy of lip syncing if she's gonna keep going this direction
TRASH
She came a long way ❤ This was super dope
Big latto
Wtf
she actually ate this up
Gen z is a mess 😂
Congratulations Lotto you killed it💐🌟💫🫡💯
Ayeeee Ok Latto Evolving Beautifully!! Get it Girl! Excellent performance!!
I didn't really pay attention to her the whole time. No stage presence
Yeah what was that????
Killed it. I love Cardi but I'm sure I'm one of few who like the original better than the remix! I loved how she added the tiktok elements to the performance
Stop playing  with her ayeeee
yesss that’s my girl 🩷she did her big one 😊
She just can’t execute, she’s trash
Girl humble yourself
Cardi B should've been there.
I love latto please keep going
Wack
Blunt big as coi Leray
That confetti stucked with whr for half the performance 😭
Is that’s yall  best female rapper of the year?okay
🔥🔥🔥
Yall know nicki minaj and latto got beef they kept going toe to toe with each other nicki called latto a Karen 🤣🤣
I’d rather watch saweetie perform then to watch this.
Peerriiiooodddtttt
Meh
Focusing on those dance steps, 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, made her forget to lip sync.  😂😂❤❤
That was really good performance
And she dress decent  when she performs

No talent next
I'm glad she performed the original version.  Even though i like the remix better. Cause i must say she killed it all by herself 💯
Show them how it go.
Yes and now, ask the grandma to perform like that before her fanbase come to judge big Latto.
Nooo
Bad performance..not even rappin!!!
It’s the growth for me
she needs to say more of her words
Latto Killed It🙌🏾

Great performance! 👏🏾❤🔥
Who’s rapping ?

She forgot to lip sync they don’t even care no more lol

She’s not a dancer tho??? Why y’all make RAP artists do choreography??? She could’ve just stood there and spit.. but decent performance.

Did anyone really think this presentation was good?
Trash😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best Performance of 2023 🔥👏👏👏
She definitely should have had Cardi out there
Rapping over the lyrics and running out of breath
Yuck
Alyssa goodnight 😂😂
That wig omg 😬😬😬

Sad to see how the crowd treating legendary New York hip hop artists like Trash.
Team Lotto ❤
Love the clothes everyone wore!
She did good!
She couldn't even keep up with the tweaking. An artist that doesn't perform their song, but rather dances to it like a fan!
Trash
Love you Latto😍😍😍
I go to your show just for you to play the mp3 and it sound worse 🥴
YESS Latto!! Beautiful performance, she came tf through!! 🔥🔥🔥

LATTTOOOOOOOO 🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹

The choreography is amazing. The people saying she forgot to lip sync clearly don’t know how live performances and back tracks work.
She can’t perform live omg 😱🤣😂 so embarrassing! That was all all lip sync! this ain’t rap with them weak bars. She be acting brand new Fr
Cus ice definitely ain’t goin crazy like this 😭😭😭

Y’all seen Boosie fell while dancing to this🤣🤣
This was bad.
The worst performance l mean who directed this ppl getting paid fr nothing 😅

She killed this
No miss, you’re too new to not actually rap. You have not reached lip sync status yet.
This sucked.
It  was cool but she couldn't lip sing and dance at the same damn time
SHE NEEDS TIPS FROM NICKI😘
Well…
Is she a rapper or a dancer/ stripper?
Bruhhhh plz tell latto she cannot be out here trying to dance and not tapping

🔥
it was so hard to watch this🥴
🗑️
Shawty wasn’t even rapping live😂
The shawty LO beat in the background was a nice touch
I love Latto 😍
Take it off the floor and put it in the trash 🚮
Edit : Jeezy and T.I. just showed how it's supposed to be done this new generation SMH like kiss said we could've stayed at home and listened to apple music   I miss when rappers actually knew their lyrics and didn't need to play the lyrics in the background
So it’s just karaoke at this point ??
pre recorded lip syncing and forgot to move her lips 😂😂😂😂 🥱
Live STAGE PERFORMANCES ARE WACK now a dayz!!!!! All VOCALZ NO INSTRUMENTALZ¡¡¡¡  Kenosha Wisconsin Zion Illinois
O lord this really ain't it
Blunt big  as coi ❤❤
I love her!
She Snapped🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LATTO did her AND DJ VON
she didn't even really try to do any vocals😅
I don’t like Latto but even I can admit she killed this ; ain’t nobody rapping and performing like this .
Teyana got her all the way together 🥵🥵🥵
me waiting to see ice spice get a award like🧍🏽‍♀️
Hot preforments 🔥 🔥 🔥 ❤❤❤
She Ate 🔥🔥🔥
She’s definitely lip syncing her own song
If cardi would have came out
Is it me or she forgot to lipsync?
She should’ve brought out Cardi B and Glorilla , but she did good though
I love it!!!! ❤❤
This was cute. Look like she had fun.
She needs tips from riri 😂😂 she knows how to sing over a pre-recorded track
She should’ve kept the beat.. that guitar and stuff doesn’t match the vibe of the song
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is this live stream
Yes Latto ❤

Amazing performance nobody that’s beefing with her can preform like this. A star in the making ❤❤❤🎰🎰🎰
