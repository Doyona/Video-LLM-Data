I think Sean Strickland is right - Rogan abusing Jamie behind the scenes 😂 ain’t against it though, Jamie seems to forget he is producing a show every once in a while.
His name could as easily be Rex Power Colt.
Like a great comedian his parents literally naming him funny pants smith  gold😂😂😂😂😂
Joe chats some of the maddest shit ever. No heavyweight ever beats Fury.
Joe is telling the truth but Arians will take any W they can.
Fury’s stamina was incredible, that 11 round right hand to finish it was amazing😮
The red did the right thing because Tyson was able to continue. If the ref counted faster he would have got up faster. Tyson just used the count to his advantage. Clever boxing brain.
lmfaooo "that's the shock waves that ripple through his head, look at that fat roll" XDDDD
The fact is that he was up before the stopwatch got to 10, and the ref. So get over it; he won!
Ultimately, the difference is what it's always been: can you take the real punch. Fury can. Ali most certainly could. Wilder cannot.
The guy obsessing over Fury’s name is so funny. He just can’t believe it.
I forget was this the fight where wilder got knocked out and claimed it was because his walk out armor was to heavy?
It’s never been a hard 10 either.
The count ringside is bullshit. Keep to your corner. The count shouldn’t count unless your in the corner.
He got stopped in the 2nd fight because of his corner, Joe.  Cmon 😂
It’s the fight game
He had blood pissing out of his ear, and was getting twated around the head... yeah, let him crack on and we could have another Michael Watson
USA looses... the world cheated us... get the fuck out of here.
Hi Joe... you are so wrong, "It has always been known that when an opponent gets knocked down, the referee sends the other fighter to a neutral white corner before starting to count. The referee sends him to the neutral corner so his corner team can't give advice for when the fighter gets back up."
If wilders dangerous how dangerous is fury. Crazy skills
Fury the best of England. Us British keep dominating heavy weight boxing.
For the first and third fights Fury wasnt even in shape. Thats the only thing that made them vaguely competitive.... And  Long count....? Excuses guys....check your history...the ref is absolutely right.. Check out Dempsey Tunney 2... Dempsey refused to go to the corner...Dave Barry eventually got him there then went back and quite CORRECTLY picked up his original count...thus giving Tunney 5 seconds extra to recover...Wholly Dempseys fault....So stop trying to give your guy( who incidentally is an ingracious prick who wont admit hes been thoroughly whipped) another absurd reason to claim he was robbed...
Golovkin was a fighter with that power and skill to match combo, Kell Brook showed real heart but his head was coming apart by the end.
There is no other human that has ever lived that could have taken that shot
Joe looking like a roast chicken
hOW MAY fights were determined when someone was outcounted by like 1 s or 2 =? GTFO here... U can see in a fighter eyes if he is there... u wont outcount him if he is there for 1s... especialy CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT
MMA fanboys: Conor mcgregor can beat prime Milk Tyson because Conor can kick and grapple 😂😂😂
To be fair, he gave Wilder a long count too, who knows
Wilder awesome also x
Sorry Joe, but it is specifically called  “A ‘count’ of ten”. Not ten seconds.
A lot of that power comes from being grounded, so being on your toes you don't get the same power
3 time & all lost
Any one questiioning any thing in these 3 fights Best go have a bud light .
Fury Wilder III was the best fight ever
Forget USA Vs UK and Black Vs White boxers.  I'm a white UK boxing fan and the best heavyweight by far was Lennox.  He was shunned by UK fans because he had a Canadian accent.  He was  born in UK but not considered fully English. FFS WHO CARES.  HE WAS THE GOAT in the best era.  Fury would of probably beat all of the greats.  The Ukrainian brothers could of most probably beat most of the US and UK legends but we all ignore them because they're not ours.
How would the fighter know what the count is if the ref isn't calling it out
13:46 If my auntie had a pair of balls she’d be my uncle.
Joes 10 count is wrong
Tyson Fury should be given credit not just for beating Wilder three times, but also for teaching Wilder some humility.  Look at the difference between Wilder before his first fight and after his third fight.
These 3 fights will be legendary. I really came to respect Wilder and his heart ❤️! At the same time Fury has my vote as the number 1 Heavyweight champ of all time!
Mills Lane in my opinion is one of the best boxing refs of all time. Hate me if you want but every time a great fight is about to start I still hear his voice saying "let's get it on!"
joe really throws out the greatest of all time way too much, shouldn't be surprised this clown thought ronda lousy was one ogf the greatest of all time, what a clown
He was still up well before 10.
So when Mike Tyson loses to a bad count it was shrugged off. Now you guys are digging in. Fury would beat Wilder again and again and again. Ppl just cannot accept that a fat white dude is beating ppl to smithereens. Wilder is a sore looser. He got his ass tore up by a fat white guy that does drugs and drinks beer all day.
It’s official, Joe Rogan does not know shit about Boxing
Sorry joe ur wrong on the count.firstly its a ten count not a seconds count.secondly opponent must go to his corner for the count to start. Thirdly the ref is very very experienced best in the game he knows whats right and whats not. Ref has to see wether fighter can carry on and defend or if he will get hurt and then makes a decision based on his instructions
Tony sounds like hes always at the end of his sentences
Fury didn't struggle getting up he took advantage of the count the way we are taught. You have a 10 count so why get up at 2 or 3 , you don't get points for getting up early but you get recovery time taking the full 10
Tyson fury follows the count and waits till 8 before getting up either way tyson wouldve gotten up
it was just under 10 seconds for Fury to get up,  stop whining
Joe showing his absolute ignorance of boxing here.  "There's not a single guy that's knocked out as many guys as Wilder has."  Ever heard of Archie Moore?
Why is nobody mentioning that the round ended 1 second after that slow count?!?!!? what difference would it have made?
May be it was corrupted or error or you guys are just sad because American loss.
Well...he was named after Mike Tyson so it's not that big of a coincidence
Why don't they just do 10 second counts electronically?
He changed his name guys.
that was not the greatest match of all time 😂 they say anything
No. What you said was wrong. The referee to begin with cannot start the count until the other fighter is in the neutral corner..ALL BOXERS KNOW THIS..that’s why most run to the neutral corner as soon as they knock someone down. And yes if that fighter moves away from neutral territory..the count stops until he returns. But the ref is not supposed to start the count until that fighter is in neutral corner. I grew up in the boxing world…my mom was Mike Tyson’s first promoter cause Cus wanted him with honest people…not DON KING…Mike Tyson was at my house so much when I was little. And later on, my father who was in boxing for almost 50 years was Tyson Fury’s cutman as well as many other world champions. My older brother had many brawls…one was ESPN fight of the year and he also fought Hasim Rahman (Previous Heavyweight Champion of the World), Baby Joe Mesi…but definitely the best fight was vs Vinny Maddalone in that ESPN Fight of the year match!! Love Boxing and also love the UFC now too!!
If you actually consider long counts properly, ALL the knock downs between Fury v Wilder were long counts.
The first time I heard Tyson Furys name I thought they were talking about some WWE wrestler his name sounds made up.
Tony knows he’s heard of Queer Street. He’s lived there his whole life
This reminds me of Kongo-Barry where Kongo looked done and Joe says "oh I guess Murgliatta is gonna let this one go" and then Kongo drops him, out cold. So he's right,it is subjective.
Tony is so annoying
Joe thinks that every single fight is the greatest fight that has ever happened.
Great fucking fight.
American shit talk again
Joe would love watching the premier league in a small town pub in England
It's not rocket science.  At that level they are in the entertainment business not boxing business.
I like to think when joe watches a fight at home he still shouts “OH HE’S HURT”
Watch this if you want to see Joe Rogan kissing Wilder`s ass for 15 minutes. Very bias!
Show the clip again! .... Camera man proceeded to not film the clip.
Never underestimate the Gypsy spirit. Those guys will fight to the death. If you're from England and Essex you will understand what i mean lol
Incredible stuff
Joe has no idea how the count is in boxing. Come on Joe
Tyson Fury has beaten him 3 times Joe.. Talking about Power but Fury has knocked Wilder the fuck out 2 times now.. Had Wilder bleeding from his ears and knocking him down with body shots. nobody wants to see Wilder get hurt actually. Fury could possibly be the best boxer ever joint with Mayweather
Good luck in space Joe 😂
Joe doesn’t know enough about boxing as mma. The referees count is exactly what he says it is..full stop! regardless of any other count. Dems the rules!😊
Joe says that Wilder has more KOs than any other heavyweight,  with 41.       Vladimir Klitscko record 64-5 with 53 KO,        Vitali Klitscko 45-2 with 41 KO     I watched the fight again and Fury was up at the count of 8    according to my count. I tried to be fair. Second knockdown I couldn't tell because ref was in the way. The disgusting guy with fat rolls beat the perfect , Joe Rogan approved body guy.
He got Sweet Lord Saviour Jesus Christ , only Truth slide Path to the Father Halleluyah Glory to God ask ,knock ,seek with all your Heart mind and Soul !!! Cry out Lament supplicate become a little Child xxxx bless u all and May God soften your Heart xxxx
NASA never been to moon ohh
Deontay and all there need Lord Jesus
At the end of the day who was the best boxer.... fury
Joe looks like an Italian Dr evil who’s been pumping iron
It's great at the pub
"if you could get wilder to pretend he can't hit hard". Haha, that's why he isn't a boxer. Most men could knock another man out, but if you are relying on your power to win a fight, well that's what happens on streets, and is the reason wilder was never going to beat Fury. You could argue tha Ali was a great boxer and not a fighter, and that's why Fury will be remembered, as one of the greatest, because there are billions of fighters.
Wilder is a fighter and Fury is a boxer. The two are poles apart.
I’d rather watch fury wilder 4 than fury chisora 3
"Pretend you don't have that power" think that would be defunkt after the first 3 or 4 bouts tbh.
Lmao joe and Jamie’s relationship is hilarious 😂   Jamie living a good life for sure it’s just joe is basically on Chill Mega million mode.   Joe: did you scream out Jamie?   Jamie : 😀 nah was tired
And Tyson never lost to Buster Douglas ...
OMG what drivel  if you are saying Tyson has a longer count how many times did Wilder get extra time whilst practically out on his feet and some more, The ref gave Wilder so much extra time to recover and should have been counted out. Dont tarnish the win. Wilder was second best and that is that.
How the hell does Joe find all these people? XD He's talking to astronauts about a heavyweight boxing fight.
Joe! what u aint saying is Fury was ready anyway, he just hung for the count..
Joe is also SO full of shit. You can clearly look at the video that tyson lands, and then before 10 seconds he is up. So even with this made up idea that Joe talks about here, the VIDEO shows the clock, no matter what video you are watching! And in the video, you can clearly see that Fury gets knocked down, lands, and after that landing is ON his feet right before 10 seconds has passed. But that's not even the rule.
Long count my ass. People been screaming long count since boxing was invented. Deontay got his ass wrecked twice and got out boxed in the first match. That's reality, long count or not.
Joe "greatest of all time" Rogan
It is the best fight off all time
He moved from the corner
Joe biased as fuck on wilder. Fury absolutely pasted him!
Joe looks like a baked potato
6:30 ...Rogan wrong! ....if the ref has to stop count to usher fighter to neutral corner, he will then resume the count from where he left off!
Boxing is old school it shouldn’t be ruled by technology
One of the Best trilogies in history 👌
The possibility of human error will create more controversy and  sell more tickets in the end. Just like umpires in baseball.
Fury would of got up anyway, regardless of what happened.
That’s what they do now
Yo....you said you watched this on your own when you interviewed Deontay......
Ali vs Foreman.  Smart vs strong just  like Fury vs Wilder
all in all : better had fats to reduce chocs...
There is only one Tyson Fury Gypsy King 👑👏🏻💯
Wilder was shot in that 2nd fight. I just watched it again. He was one punch away from a coma sitting in that corner.  He wasn't right from the time he got dropped from the ear shot.  One more thing, can we stop with the recency bias all the time calling what just happened the "goat" or the best X of all time?  I doubt Joe ever saw George Foreman and Ron Lyle from 1976 or countless others.
Joe is right about the count that happened and how counts should be. Mike Tyson got robbed like this, too.
Wilder was not expecting him to getup like most men could not after a punch like that ?
I feel like joe has just came off a DMT session wearing that 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joe you are so wrong on the “slow count” theory.  1st off its not a 10 second count. Its an official 10 count. The count does not start until the fighter heads to a neutrel corner which wilder hesitated to do. The Ref did everything correct. There was nothing flawed about it. Please do some research on what you are talking about.
The ref should have a button in his hand and he presses it to begin a loud count over the speakers. He presses it again to stop it.
damn joe really doesn't understand boxing
Dont forget Tyson never train for fight 3 cuz of he's new born child was in hospital ill
So the 10 count that has always been the 10 count should change because you say or anyone else? Not hating just asking because if majority say so I’d ride with it even if I’m not happy
Thanks to the wide shot we got to see that that's not just a fancy jacket Joe's wearing, he's wearing the whole getup!? You going to the moon after this Joe?
any reasons why all post fight vids of creators of this fight are slow on youtube?
If your going to say Fury should've lost then it should've been over with the first knock down. It was 12 seconds when the ref counted 8. 20 seconds when the fight continues.
The ref did the same type of count for both fighters. The American lost boo hoo, moving on..
There was no extra count. Because its a 10 count rule.
There were only half a second difference in the counts between Fury and Wilders two 10 counts  when you watch it back you can simply look at the clock in the corner of the screen. They were BOTH long counts , equally long, just people seem to have latched onto Tyson's count. Watch it, you will see. Also the ref continually allowed Wilder to hold the back of fury's head whilst punching him in the face
Joe's passion is kinda infectious... like him being excited and talking enthusiastically about fighting makes it seem MORE exciting in a weirdly different way. Good commentator and entertainer.  And he REALLY KNOWS his shit re. Boxing and MMA, and many other combat sports. Dude.
Am I the only one who's thinks Joe is a bit biased towards Wilder? Nobody cares how hard Wilder can theoretically hit. Like come on dude the guy got his ass kicked three times by a superior boxer.
Hey Joe awesome podcast with Tyson fury I'm a guy from south Boston who's son was invited to dontay wilder camp as a sparring partner but I have a story to tell about what I think is one of our country greatest tradiges & failures and that's the fatherless home don't know how I missed you @ the BAC believe me I think this is a very important subject thank you Joe God bless🥊🥊
Joe Rogan must be the only puppet that  tells you he a 😈 puppet without actually saying it out of his mouth because they know the sleeping sheep got their eyes wide shut   The logo at the beginning with the 3rd eye with the Sunray going round it then sits there with  a NASA space suit when they can never get out the dome, freemason bricks behind just to name the most obvious and the sheep will read this still refuse to see it
Im from the uk this is the first nobody wanted after fury v whielder 2 everyone thought it was pointless we want aj vs fury but it turned out to be one of the best fights in history
How many bullshit facts joe rogan believes to be true just because someone told him
Obviously Wilder doesn't hit that hard. Else how did Fury keep getting up?
Jaime is very,,, whats the word
When they were talking about Tysons name is shocked me joe didn't mention Tyson has that awesome name because he was in fact named after Iron Mike tyson
I just don't agree with what they say about the count simply because fury was fully aware and looking at the ref following his count like he always does.. he was hurt but not close to out and I think it discounts what fury actually did
I hate that he had to talk about this fight with Tony Hinchcliffe and Redban
It's fairly simple to see that Wilder fared a lot better at 209 than he did at 238..draw your own conclusions...
Also I'm not completely convinced of Wilders power...Hes mainly fought nobodies and hes had Fury down 4 times without keeping him there...
Certainly if the ref has to get one fighter to a corner then he picks up the count where he left it.. and the guy on the floor benefits...refer to Tunney Dempsey 2 where Tunney gained an extra 5 seconds because Dempsey wouldnt go to the corner and ref Dave Barrie rightly suspended the count....
This one is fstupid
That buzzcut guy is so dumb, I hope he isn't a real astronaut??
He did the same with wilder ??
Both fighters proved to be dead game.  Both have no quit.  Love fury. But now I love wilder as well.  He is a true game champion.  Desire to win epitomized by both.  Can not stop them   Both 2 of the best ever
FYI Usyk might not have Wilder’s one punch power but he’ll mess you up just the same or even worse
Both fighters were  given fair counts after touching the canvas. I am a Wilder fan and i have to put my biases aside , Fury is a helluva fighter and a bit of a lunatic which i guess was what it took to beat Deontay. At the end of the day boxing won! Both Champs in my eyes👊🙏
Rocky marciano knocked out 43. So no, Wilder has not knocked out more than anyone.
Ive seen WWF 3 count take longer than how long Fury was down. It is a "sport count", referee does the count based on judgement on how the boxer reacts which is how it should be imo. If a boxer looks good to go around 10s then fight on, if boxer looks dazed and has no legs, referee knows it is best to call the fight, especially heavyweight.
Why the one guy got on the NASA suit breastmilk attachment edition?
"Did you watch the fight?.....Omg dude, one of the greatest fights of all time." Lol how many times have we heard that? Lol  😂
Problem is Wilder ran into the man.
Joe "Queer Street" Rogan
"if you could turn Deontay how to box" bro..
Tyson is actually his middle name, his proper name is "Luke Tyson Fury"
Wrong, Joe.
all the knock downs, aside from the last one, were long counts, all of them, wilder and fury alike.
Jo likes a lot of should a could a would a. If this happened . Or if he was this . This is what happened and this is what it is
fury,s birth name is "luke"
Tyson's Fury.
Represent them Buckeyes!!! Ohio State til I die
Tyson furys real name is luke fury not tyson as the whole world thinks
Did Wilder win the first fight (best fight I ever saw live)? Yes!, can and did Fury win every fight after? Yes! Like politics, the system is the problem!
The count carries on 🤨
I think we miss fury on the pod.. Pl get him back..
man he was so full of shit sayin he knew fury was gonna come back and win
It's painful to me... Joe is such a huge fight fan and doesn't understand the rules, and then tells millions of people that'll never fact check it for themselves. Don't speak about shit you don't know. Sheesh.
Rogan is such a wilder fan boy
My question is why does he have a 49 Star flag on him?
Joe There is one heavyweight Boxer that Has More KnockOuts than Wilder.  Rocky Marciano had 49 wins 0 losses 0 draws. 43 by KnockOut. And what's crazy is his career stats show that Marciano took 10 punches for every one punch he landed on average. Crazy power and chin made of steel. And everyone he fought was alot bigger than him. 5 foot 10 190 pounds.
I now am convinced rogan is a robot. He said near verbatim the same exact thing about fury and wilder to mike tyson
@ 5:00, I think you meant to say "Wilder hits so hard, it almost doesn't feckn matter".
Joey Diaz: Tremendous fat!, That fuckin fat is fuckin Tremendous Joe Rogan!
Michael buffer-   Let’s get readyyyy to rumble  Joe rogan-   oh his throat got tagged he’s hurt!
Thought Joe Rogan knew about fighting.  How can it be a slow count when Fury was up at 6.  And it's not a 10 second count.  It's a 10 count.  Fury watched the ref.  Come on Joe you let yourself down here
If you watch wilders knockdown. Wilder pushes fury Down both of them
Lol they’re debating the first fight 🤪
Wilder stalled for as long as he could, got in the best shape he has ever been, went up against Fury looking like a Frigidaire, and still got his ass knocked out.
Joe doesn't know shit about boxing.
…and just drag him deeper, deeper and deeper into these horrible waters filled with crocodiles… has to be one of my favorite new “Joe boxing” quotes 💪😂
hài qua má ơi
Fury is a legend
In fairness, wilder, boxed well to beat stiverne to win the wbc title. Not saying stiverne is a good fighter, but that night wilder boxed well.
Fury won alllll 3
The counts on all 3 fights were legit for both fighters, go back and count them yourself. Wilder got beat in every fight, yes it's personal preference but legally and in reality wilder got beat 3 times. Tyson is suspected of dodgy dirty boxing, but he did beat wilder 3 times  in reality.
Joe! Another superb analysis!
what a lot of people dont know about Fury, is he is not only a real gypsy,but he is an actual king in the gypsy culture. he is called the gypsy king cause he literally is. he cant say he is a gypsy king if he isnt in rl. its a cultural thing. its a title granted to the most dominant and powerful gypsy of a region or country,and the title is given to him by the other gypsy elders.   i know this because my grandfather was a gypsy king from england. from the same region tyson fury is from.   the title isnt hereditary. its a title of respect for the biggest,strongest,most dominant gypsy in a region or country.   my grandpa was as big as fury,and was a bareknuckle boxer. he led 13 gypsy clans from england into the USA. he also fought in the american civil war for the union army.
First boxing match in 20 yrs that I jumped up screaming with joy or screaming in fear. They claim it's a all time great fight, it is not, not even close. It was the first time in years we gave a fuck who actually won. I only watched because it was actual proof that Wilder is completely terrible at boxing. Wilder is possibly the least skilled fighter/ in my lifetime, what a joke
Could the “wiring” “connectivity ability” have been interwoven through the main structure metal?
Just. Remember you speak English! What's your native language
Long 1,2,3. Now pussy. England in charge of
The ref's count makes the fights more exciting, an LCD counter would ruin it.
Fury is the best heavyweight to grace this earth
Rogan like an old woman
I’m gonna say Usain Bolt has a better coincidence for a name than Fury
In the 1st Wilder and Fury fight, you will see if you watch this video at 1:10 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZRDVA-u3Io it will help you to see what I mean, that no ref would start a count as soon as the fighter hits the canvas the majority of timekeepers/ref's would start their count half of a second or a second after the fighter hits the canvas no one is 100% precise while counting. If you do go along with the time in the bottom right corner from 1:10 of the video I provided above you would see that Fury is getting up on the count of 9 to 9.5 seconds and fully standing at 10. The ref starts his count at 2:22 just after Fury goes down and at 2:19 the ref is at the count of 4 and by the time Fury gets to his feet and almost standing straight is at 2:13 the count is at 9 and at 2:12 which would have been the count of 10 the ref asks Fury can he continue which Fury replies yes most top ref's would let the fighter continue if he is getting up on 9.5 anyway!   In the 3rd fight between Wilder and Fury, Wilder didn't go back to the neutral corner! That's why the ref briefly stopped the count. 4.) KNOCKDOWN, KNOCKOUT AND COUNT4.4. When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knock-downs. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knock-down, the timekeeper's count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers. Nonetheless, the ref is at the count of 7 when he should have been at 8 but that was down to Wilder not returning to a neutral corner quicker so Fury beat the count fairly.
The “what are the chances he’s named that!?” Question is hilarious like it’s a crazy coincidence??… he comes from a boxing family and was literally named after Mike Tyson
The count starts once the other fighter is in the corner, he wasn't in the corner, and its a 10 count, this doesnt mean 10 seconds
Joe you try to hard sometimes
Such a good fight breakdown by Joe.
Tony going on a long tangent about the odds of Tyson fury being named Tyson just by chance and becoming a great boxer not knowing that he was actually named after mike Tyson and his dad was a boxer…
In the words of every single Rugby Union coach ever……. ‘the referee is always right…. And even when he’s wrong, he’s right’
Mike Tyson would have kod fury in their respected primes yes he’s big yes he can take a hit but iron mike is taking that fight
The count certainly wasn't corruption as the machine favours wilder.
Not true at all. I just times both of Fury's knockdown with a stop watch. First one he was up at 8 seconds.second he was up at 9 seconds. There's no controversy at all Joe you 5 foot 3 turd
Joe knows nothing about boxing. There's a reason boxers jump up at the 8 count, they listen to the count. Gives them more time to recover. There's no way Fury wasn't getting up from that
Joes wrong here sorry, the ref controls the count, more often they’ll follow the timekeeper but if they have to tell the other fighter to go to neutral corner then they stopped the count and when he’s ready he resumes it, it doesn’t carry on
How can you say after Fury gets knocked down that it's done after seeing the first two fights. Unless I see Fury on the floor with his tongue out absolutely sparked out, I won't ever say he's going to lose, he's an animal and a hero, possibly the greatest chin of all time.
There is a reason smart fighters rush to their corner and stay there after knocking someone down.
Rogan is wrong.   Once the referee picks up the count from the time keeper then the referees count is the official count.  If the fighter isn't in his neutral corner he stops his count until he does and starts his count afterwards.   The timekeeper is out of the equation
Wee Tony pretending he's interested in boxing when really he's thinking about dolls and wendy houses.
Its funny that everyone mentions the fury count, people who dont know shit about boxing, A count isnt fucking seconds, An average boxing 8 count is 12 seconds...go and watch any boxing knockdown and you'll see that a 8 count is around 10-12 seconds.  EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k  And there you go.  Do you people really believe if it was ment to be seconds they would still have a guy trying to count seconds perfectly in his head 😂 Even joe rogan doesnt seem to have a clue calling it a slow count.
One day Joe's gonna find a topic to discuss, without there being a conspiracy involved....
Maybe the americans thought he was fucked i put a bet on tyson to win and deontays pre match conference he was already defeated
The Americans are STILL talking about Wilders knock downs of Fury...and making excuses... They are the only ones. 😂 Everyone else in the world is talking about how great Fury is...😒😒😒
When you are part of the fight in or around the ring, shit gets crazy. I forget what round it is some times
What Joe says about the ref picking up the count by the count ringside is exactly opposite of what the rules actually say.
Boxing used to be big in my family. My uncle or my dad would order the fight and invite over all my cousins and the rest of my family. It was so much fun. I remember watching a bunch of the early Tyson fights all the way through to the Holyfield era.
The speed of the count is irrelevant because fury was aware and watching the ref count. If the count was faster he would have gotten up faster...that's it argument over
Count is stopped, or not started if you come out of the neutral corner or delay in going to the neutral corner. That's why Sonny Liston got a screw job in Ali II. Ali defied the referee and never went to a neutral corner. Wilder was very slow in going to the corner and the count was delayed.
Joe Rogan says this is the greatest fight he's ever seen. Sugar ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns say what's up. Arturo Gatti (in spirit) and mickey ward say what up.  I could go on and on..haha
No way that was the greatest of all time fight no way..
They should use the count off seasame street 1 hahaha 2 hahaha
Joe "To this Dayyyyyy" catch up on your Difference between a 10 count and 10 seconds. He sacked a Brother Joe? Mark Breland but scared to tell him he was saving his life not fake ear cut not Eardrum busted like all crappie Merican commentators like Punch and Judy shower of shytte. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✝️🇺🇸👍👍🏾
Joe always gives respect where its due
He comes from an Irish traveler boxing family and i think hes named after mike tyson. So its not really a coincidence
Joe 'i don't know the boxing rules' roegan! 🤣 It's up to the discretion of the ref how the count goes
Devil is a killer Box is from devil
Kind of disappointed that Joe's talking out the side of his head here. He most definitely should have told Jamie to look up the rules so they could have been correct instead of spreading misinformation about how that was too long of a count
Is that Patrick Mahomes brother
Tyson fury was born 9 weeks premature and weighed 1lb , wasn’t suppose to live , but his dad said he will be the champion of the world , and his dad named him after mike Tyson ! Doctors said he won’t be too big , he’s 6ft 9 and 280 lbs 🙏🏼❤️
Fury is a king
Fury baddest man on the planet fact
Joe said broooooo
Rogan should watch the video of the ref explaining the fight, he’s a paramedic so I don’t think he was shook or nowt, just doing his job as he saw fit and far from the worst ref I’ve seen, I don’t think this was controversial at all but yanks tryna find an excuse for Wilder even after he’s lost all 3 of the fights vs Fury
His parents kinda named him that because they were into boxing. So the odds are good
Wilder has no excuses left. And  despite Wilder putting Fury down twice, the harsh damage Wilder endured with the 3 knock downs including the 3rd one which was the knockout is stuff that ends careers & can have bad long term health  effecfs. And Fury made Wilder look like a rag doll for the majority of the fight. And Wilder acted classless post fight. 2losses & 1draw, sorry own the L Deonte!
You have to remember the English will always get back up. We are a tiny nation that built the Worlds largest Empire.... We are a nation born in battle.
It’s funny that he’s talking about the fat rolling down. I watched that punch many times, the fat rolling down, just… damn.
The Olympics do a count without the ref
Nah if wilder picked up and drilled Tommy the Hitman Herns style I to his DNA. I think wilder would be a multiple time world champion. The length the power and say what you want about wilder but man has a true fighters spirit(in the ring).
Julio Cesar Chavez had 83 knockout victories, just correcting Joe, never thought I'd be able to😂
If Wilder fought any other opponent, he’s still undefeated and people aren’t saying he can’t box. Literally no one on the planet can withstand what Wilder does to opponents but the goat 🐐 Tyson Fury
CANCEL JOE ROGAN NOW...SHAME.. LEFT WHOOPI GOLDBERG OUT TO DRY...I ASK FOR SAME TREATMENT...NO EMOTIONS 🆘🚨🆘🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🚨🆘🚨 CANCEL NOW...
The front of Dc talking he detached a man's retina with his gouging then accepted the belt! Joe never questioned what everyone knows Dc is the biggest piece of     walking and so what if the ref gives him a second or 2 finish the man
"Funny Pants Smith" - lolz dead
Rogan your a Real Twanker.
Rogan. IT'S A TEN COUNT NOT 10 SECONDS NUMBNUTS. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💯🇺🇸🥊🥊🥊
YOUNGSTOWN!!!!!! BORN AND RAISED BABY great boxers have come out of our city 🥊✊🏼💪🏼
Talks some shit rogan. Saying there's no one ever who's ko'd 40 people like wilder. There is mate. Loads of fighters
"(6) When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall direct the opponent to move to the farthest neutral corner of the ring. If the opponent leaves the neutral corner, the referee shall interrupt the count and will not resume the count until the opponent returns to the neutral corner."
Does Tony know it's not a coincidence that his name is Tyson? He was literally named after Mike 😂
Wilder had that coming with all his victim card, race card bullshit. That's karma is i ever saw it
Joe’s swag tho 👌🏼
Seriously?? Deontay Wilder won bronze in the Olympics just a year & a half after learning to Box? Jesus christ!!    It's no wonder he's incapable of accepting a loss, he's never had to before..  Amazing👏
what are the odds? the odds are his name is luke and he changed his name to tyson, thats the odds..
Joe rogans knowledge on boxing is embarrassing
The Youngstown shoutout 😂
It was an exciting & a thrill.Both fighters bought their lives on the line.TF isn't the greatest boxer ever.He was knocked down by a cruiserweight.
I kind of like that refereeing in boxing is subjective 🤔
no the count was perfect if you set a stop watch it is perfect timing the ref was exactly on time joe. look at it again . also fury can only time his getting up from the ref he also times his getting up perfect from the refs count.
Joe looks fucked here..
What is bullshit is that Wilder got credit for a knockdown that was a club to the back of the head. Fury was fully aware of the refs count and knew he was gonna get a little extra time to regroup.
I heard Tony came out the closet recently...
The ref gave the the same time counting.... search it can watch the Times.  .. whilst they were down and when they got up...  they had the same time( count )
Usyk is overrated because he beat a soulless AJ, in a repeat of the Ruiz nonsense...  Fury is the man!  He will annihilate Usyk.
Joe needs to go watch that fight again. It wasn’t a slow count.
its actually not fat its loose skin behind all that loose skin his as rip as any boxer
Know the rules joe , stop count until neutral corner . Clown
Carlos Zarate my friend🤣😂😎👌🏼
What the fuck are you wearing Rogen??!!😂🤣
Joe is still just a regular dude.  He's in a spacesuit, but whateva.
I was educated by the count description,  of a ringside counter continuing the count if the ref has to direct the other boxer to a neutral corner. I was always of the belief, (now corrected), that if the ref had to direct the other boxer to a neutral corner the ref continued the count where he left off, as a penalty against the other boxer for not following the rules. Thank you for clearing that up.
What the hell you wearing Joe
One hears the comment  “he is the hardest puncher ever” This is often attributed to other boxers. Although we can’t measure past boxers punching power, we can measure present boxers punching power on a machine. Why doesn’t someone organise that, gather the stats, use a formula to figure out weight and power ratio. Then we would know who is the hardest puncher is, across all weight divisions.  Is that a crazy idea? Would boxers be up for that?  Has it been done already?
Americans and there excuses😂😂😂😂Fury watches the count "he was no where near 100% fit and still won by a badboy knockout😎
Everyone saying if?😂😂😂
Who keeps vaping da bud 🤒🌴
Next time invite Jamie to a watch party
Been watching boxing my whole life , that was one of the most exciting fights I’ve ever seen
It wasn't a long count at all. There's no controversy at all!! Wilder got his arse handed to him for the third time. Fair play, the fight was brilliant but Wilder deserved every punch he received!! The excuses from the second fight, completely false accusations of cheating, and the way him and his wife carried on from then till he got battered yet again in the third has destroyed any credit or legacy he may have deserved. Kudos to Wilder for fighting the way he did ( ie, taking a beating for so long), but not a sportsman and not a patch on Tyson Fury. Simply no controversy or  excuses. He got beaten all 3 times and showed the man he is. A shame!!
Watching the Fight I think both Fighters got saved by the bell!  Tyson was knocked out.. I don't understand the rules!... Waiting for part 4!
Celebrities newest abstract artist: https://youtu.be/loqAWb4kDdU
Referre is not supposed to start the count until the opponent goes back to his corner..so in my opinion it was a short count.
Alternative title: three guys talk about something they know nothing about.
The best way to be 100 % into a fight is making sure the volume is off mute
At home. Sounds like joe still commentates ahahah. Joint in one hand. And bottle of testosterone in the other. That’s the life joe. That’s the life my man!!
He did received a longer count but he was up by 8 watch it again!
Joe thinks the count was long? Joe doesn't know shit about boxing!
The only  one , the king mr.Mike Tyson!
I think joe lost a bet on this fight.. if it was the ufc he’d say don’t let it go to the ref count or the judges.. fury got up.. and won
Joe Rogan is actually incorrect about the count, it's not a 10 second count it's a 10 count. The ref is allowed to stop the count to tell the standing fighter to go to the neutral corner
Joe saying it was a long count was so wrong ..... Its been debunked in a video starting the count on screen when he hit the. Canvas the count was 100 percent accurate
It can never be just a fucking win or loss there's always gotta be bitching last one he lost because he went out in a dumb big ass suit, this time the referee was bribed, next fight the illuminati made the floor slippery
It wasn’t a long count.  You don’t know the rules in boxing.  Simple as that
Joe Rogan comes across a bit biased here
Fury 🤝🥊
How is it that Joe Rogan doesn't know what the rules are when a fighter is knocked down in a professional boxing match? 😯
Fury biting his gloves   to expose his laces to tear flesh made me sad.
It was Joey ,big Lou , pretty boy jimmy
IN ENGLAND WE SAY IF THE QUEEN HAD BALLS SHE WOULD BE THE KING!
I didn't know the guy from mad tv was a real person
Jo King lol
5:15, you didn't knew Jack shit Tony. Go watch pro wrestling.
This first time Joe Spoke to Wilder Joe was the one trying to convince Wilder that he should gain weight.
Trying to look for excuses. Wilder is shite. No boxing skills what so ever.
They all sound high 💨
Wtf with the nasa gear?
Rogan knows as much about boxing as I do about quantum mechanics. Spoiler alert - I'm not a quantum mechanic
Tyson fury is the best . And good for mental health
Been a British boxer for ten years and never had a second person picking up the count. And the referee discretion. Rules might be different in the USA
6:30 those are not the rules. If the boxer that got the KD gets out or doesn't go to a neutral corner, the referee has to pause the count. The long count was Wilder's fault lmao.
Fury vs Wilder III was a sloppy mess.  They both looked like shit.  Wilder gassed after the second round, Fury kept smothering his punches.  Anyone who thinks that was a great Boxing match don't know shit about boxing. The fight was entertaining so no one talks about how bad both boxers looked.
Joe “everything is the greatest of all time” Rogan
Joe definitely lost money on this fight the way he’s talking 😂
6’6 and 209. Tyson was right. Dam twiglet legs. Seriously though there is no way in hell you can get in that good a condition, that low a body fat with muscle and not be on PED. Funny though it was Tyson who got flagged years back. Good old boar meat!
Let's remember Fury is yet to get fit for a big fight, except his Klitschko shut out. He was sleeping on a hospital floor for this fight. He has much more to give if his head stays straight.
I like the person that Tyson Fury is, happy he won that fight.
Joe Rogan loves black guys
What is he talking about? It’s not 10 seconds it’s the refs count: he is the ref and judge for if the fighter can continue. Rogan doesn’t know what he’s talking about, knows nothing about boxing
You guys in the media built this guy Wilder up to be something he never was and you're doing the same to Fury too.
Joe I love ya, but your wrong on this one. Watch the vid. Watch it again but watch the round count down clock. Tyson's arse hit   the canvas with 20 seconds to go but is up at 11 maybe 10 seconds left of the round.
This was not one of the greatest heavyweight fights of all time. I'm not even an avid boxing fan and I can tell you that. Wilder was the definition of a questionable champion, and Fury has only ever beaten like three guys that were legitimate contenders. How Fury gets touted as one of the all-time great heavyweights is kind of ridiculous to me. Sure he's impressive and has great skill, but it's nothing really too outstanding to me like a Mike Tyson or Muhammad Ali. And the fact is this was the third match that nobody really wanted, at least I didn't. Everybody already thought that Fury completely outmatched Wilder in their first two fights. How anybody was screaming their heads off watching this fight just doesn't make any sense to me.
Radcliffe literally bleeds the life out of me. I cannot stand this guy. I would do anything to end him. Please world. End this doosh.
Nope. The ref can stop the count of the opponent is not doing what he should do (going to the neutral corner, hands off the ropes etc). Incentive for opponent to clear off.
how can you not mention tht 40.kos were against tomato 🍅 cans man 😳 😉 😜 🤔
first one i seen in ages what happened to.the oven lol
Wow ya'll were so high! lol
Joe Rogan just fan boy the hell out this fight! Was awesome to watch!
Way fun to have watch party's! Call me, I'll come to any and all fight watch party's
The thing that surprised me the most about that fight, was what great shape a guy Fury’s size was in during the later rounds. Wilder was dead on his feet by round six, but Fury was almost as fresh as when he walked out to the ring.
"What are the odds of that?" It was devised actually. He was literally named that because he was bred from a family of boxers.
If they did Joe's idea for the digital count, they should definitely use the (last ten seconds or an abbreviated version of) music from beloved English afternoon quiz show 'Countdown'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dhD9zR6hk
I feel as if I can pop Joe in the oven for Xmas dinner. He’s wrapped in foil ready to go
Wilder is not unique, foreman stopped more guys
Wilder cant box. Joshua can box, but cant fight. Typical overhyped boxers who are one dimensional, nothing of substance under the shiny surface. Inflate your record with wins over subpar opponents, while never improving at your craft. And they fold at the first sign of adversity, and are exposed as more hype than talent. Except for Fury, these heavyweights today would get embarrassed by any top ten heavyweight from '70 to '00.
Mike Tyson meets Brian Fury. Tyson Fury
Seconds!!
Tyson knocked the breaks off Wilder 3 times and you think it’s corruption?? Jesus man !
That Tony Hinchcliffe isnt funny or interesting .
There is nothing worse than a bunch of casual boxing fans like these muppets smoking dope and then trying to talk about the rules of boxing 🙄 GTFOH
I think there was a rule where the opponent not being in the neutral corner suspends the count which is to discourage fighters to stand over a downed opponent and let the ref do the count. Slow and fast counts are relative to the different refs all throughout boxing. You get what you get.
What the hell is joe wearing?
Love Joe, but he’s so clueless on boxing....
He got his ass BEATDOWN
Boxing match lol Tyson literally cherry picked him 80% of the time .. Wilder doesn’t have much except a hard punch . No stamina no combination no  Defences
What about the long count that Wilder got? It’s strange and very reckless that when it comes to the count it was only mentioned in relation to Tyson Fury!?? We all know the ridiculous lies that Wilder has spewed out about Fury with the 2nd fight so comments like these are totally irresponsible and aren’t painting  a true and fair picture.
Why does Joe hang with that weasel Tony Hinchcliffe? Talk about a guy who hit the clout lottery huh?
that’s the first time i’ve seen Joe treat Redban like a friend.
Oh shut up Rogan. You are tripping 🤣
Fat shock wave 😂
i love me some joe rogan, unfortunately he doesnt know enought about the count and the rules..... regaurdless it was a great fight and the right man won..... i think if the reg would have started the count at 7 fury would have still gotten up, fury knows exactly what to do in that situation, fury has been trained to take as much time as is needed
Why does Joe's head look photo shopped
the beginning of this podcast they are talking about violent movies and media and that kids nowadays have access to sites like Liveleak where they can see REAL gore and death, exposing them to violence and carnage at a young age. and Tony’s loser ass says “pro wrestling, the Undertaker was “literally” burying people *alive*” he then says “ i learned about death-…” and joe cuts him off saying “i can’t believe you just brought that up” and dude gets all defensive lmao. that’s such a dorky thing to say and it was totally off topic and irrelevant lmao.  theatrics in wrestling is not horror, maybe to someone who’s challenged lmao. This idiot really tried to compare the undertaker and WWE to watching REAL people DIE. when joe says “it’s fake” Tony says “ oh yea because i forgot that’s so real”. yes idiot, it IS real that’s the difference dipshit. i can’t stand him.
The count thing has been debunked, the ref counted at the same pace for both Wilder and Fury. In any case the history book has been closed on this amazing trilogy. Both are fantastic and imo #1 & #2 boxers right now. Wilder beats aj and kos Usyk maybe 11 or 12 after losing like in his 1st match with Fury.
Facts
"teach wilder to move like fury" ummm I think that's impossible no man that size should be moving like fury and many have tried and lal have failed.
I'm pretty sure the count doesn't start until the standing fighter is in the neutral corner. Also the second knockdown in the 4th round that Rogan is saying was a long count shouldn't have been counted as a knockdown anyway as Fury was rabbit punched around the back of the head
Fight 1 - Fury tentative with the jab. Fight 2 - Fury leaves the jab in there. Fight 3 - Fury leaves the elbow in there.  Trilogy - Nutshell edition.
Mayberry rules, ref 10 count it not called a 10  second count, just like wwe 123 count as well
I love that people are so used to seeing clips of Rogan that there are no comments about the space suits that aren't referenced at all and don't fit the context in anyway.
Fury didn't even have a proper camp, had covid and then his daughter was in hospital weeks before the fight and still battered him
Fury is a thoroughbred his ancestors had to fight to survival and the children box for sport from a young age. His mind is what wins the fights.
Listen man it’s not 10 seconds, it’s a count of 10. What about commenting when the doctor came in to see wilder at the start of a round, he’s supposed to do it in between rounds. That gave wilder more like 30 seconds
Funny story, Tyson dated a relative of mine, when he was courting her he visited the home, saw a hanging punching bag, punched it and broke it in two.
Lol the American bias. Wilder got a long long count when he was downed, but I guess the Americans have blocked that out if their memory
They were both saved by the bell. Joe trying to b political correct again. Jesus Christ Tyson is the best heavyweight ever. Seriously, who could beat him? He is too big. He is the not the most skilled but he is too big and too good
Does anyone know what jacket joe is wearing?!?!?
24 seconds to get back up is enough time for any boxer to get back up.
I would expect better cardio from Wilder. Fury's cardio was so superior it was crazy.
Marciano has more KOs than Wilder still
The only time Jammie witch is a girls name screemed is when he figured out Eric Dubay is right and the earth is flat
The gloves were tampered with look at the videos slow mo.
Tyson vs Wilder = Drunk man with a clever chopping up a body. Canelo vs Plant = Surgeon with a Davinci machine. I'll watch the surgeons over the drunk men any time.
Cormier also said "that was a great jab" about a punch that was aobut a foot away.
NO JOE , NOT TRUE!  THE RULE ALLOWS THE REF THE TIME TO HANDLE THE OPPONENT IF HE IS IN THE WRONG,  THEN PICK UP THE COUNTING WHERE IT LEFT OFF.  SO WILDER SCREWED HIMSELF.
Rogan don’t no shit about boxing#rogermayweather
This man is talking bollox. Error or corruption. None of them. He is talking BS. The ref takes up the count from thetimekeeper ffs.
Joe "I know fighting" Rogan. He chats so much shit its unbelievable.
Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson so not such a mad cocidence
Trouble with Wilder is hes only got one brain cell to match his one punch, his trainer tried to teach him to box but that one cell wouldn't have it. Hence outclassed
Joe and Cormier exposing the match all these fury dick riders thought he won “fare and square” and another miscount happens💀🤣boxing is corrupt and a joke.
What ever happened to Kelly Pavlik? He was great and had amazing fights
8:25 he's definitely thinking of wii sports boxing
And not a bad singer to boot, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u3MmswT5jg
Definitely the automatic 10 second count. Ten counted seconds is more like 15 seconds. Change the rule, buy the equipment. Update and rebrand this awesome sport. Boxing needs better TV producing. Joe should produce a televised Boxing tournament. Not another ultimate fighter, but maybe 3 round fights with head gear. Interviews, advertising and beer. Nobody gets hurt, final fight is a 10 round fight no gear. Get Connor in there, get Pauli Malignaggi and all the boxers that are willing to fight head gear on for 3 round fights. I would be glued to something like that.
stay with mma, boxing is not your forte.
I just watched the fight and was led here, I mentioned the behind the ear shot in the comments, lol    I'm back a few months later but Joe was way off with some of his comments here. There was no long count at all and it's been proven that deontay actually had the longer counts in that last fight, and wilder himself made the ref stop when he left his corner. The ref had to tell him to return and that counter thing about when a ref stops someone outside the ring picks it up, that isnt standard practice. It is solely up to the ref to do and give the knockdown counts, and even in matters where an outside counter beyond the ring does count when a ref has to stop, the ref themselves can choose to outright ignore at their discretion. That's because a 10 count is not the same thing as counting to 10, despite what people may believe.
I think it was a great move from the ref cuz one its the heavyweight championship of the world he is going to give time for these massive humans to pick themselves up. fury was wide awake just had to pick himself up the only way this trilogy was going to end is if someone was put to sleep which wilder was in the 12 I hate this excuse
9.8 seconds he was up and ready to go ! no long count for fury !
Joe, ur totally our of ur element here.   Fury owns Wilder
Nar rules of boxing is the person knocking down has  to be in a neutral corner before  a count taking place. Tyson needs to fight Joshua or that half pint who put boxed Joshua.
Jamie rulz
Joe you need to go back and count your damn self so does Cormier, because Fury was up before 10!! He was up in 8full seconds! Plus Joe knows the fighters listen to the refs count to buy themselves time! And how about your point on the second round the towel was thrown in the ref had too! And most refs would’ve stop the beating Wilder was taking…
Really is one of The Best because, The Sheer size of both, the power of both especially Wilder, Theeen the fact both fighters got of the canvas multiple times to go almost the whole fight is absolutely mind blowing!!! When you put the previous two fights with this one is at the top to me The Best all time trilogy with a 3rd fight even better!!!
Wtf us Joe wearing
Nobody thought it was over when he went down, he was there the whole time.. I love Joe but holy shit when he's high he can waffle for hours!
Nobody thought it was over when he went down, he was there the whole time.. I love Joe but holy shit when he's high he can waffle for hours!
When you have the build of a freakish 16 year old and you only train arms, anyone could punch like that... his boxing ability is mediocre at best. When the camera pans down and you see those chicken legs, it's no wonder he wobbles under a gust of wind
You say shit!! And we have images of the referee explaining rules in front of both opponrnts begore the fight... Dtop fueling conspiracy! Now i remember why i unsubsctibed!
Tyson Furry hits harder that a coffin nail ...
Joe is cooking up conspiracy theories Wilder was getting beat brain dead in part 2.
10 count is never exactly 10 seconds it never has been. If  I remember right Tyson dropped Buster Douglas and there was a longer count. Say what you want Tyson Fury got up. Talk your flat earth theories Joe. If you need the count to win the fight you a bum.
Fury was given longer count
Joe rogan getting to set a colony on Mars with that jacket
If Tyson Fury was American he’d be president by now. The most undervalued boxer in history!
Look at the size of Rogans head. All those steroids made his head grow.  Jeff Mayweather said the count was good. Joe Rogan should call the Mayweathers and teach them about boxing.
I love the pod casts there amazing but the bloke across from joe is so annoying everything about him is just like a thorn in your ass
Imagine if Wilder could move like Lomacenko.😝😌
Here is the evidence that the counts were consistent across all knockdowns in the fight.  The count on Fury was the same length of time that Wilder received.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k
Wilder had the same type of count. Let's talk about that.
Didn't that right hand from Wilder did put Fury down?  It just took 3 seconds for him to fall.
literally 15 mins of them talking about deyontay ... its like they didnt see the 3 fights where fury brok deyontay down to a scared little boy
spent 8 mins soo far talking over both times tyson was knocked down.... what about the 4 times deyontey ate dirt?
I was in my 30's when Ali took on Foreman and we all thought Big George would kill Ali. With that in mind, I strongly believe Ali in his prime would KO Fury.
Joe, you need to learn the rules of boxing concerning the knock down count!
Tony hinchcliff is literally the last man I want to hear comment on a fight
Does deontay punch that hard or is tyson just that flabby?
What about the Doctor who should of checked on Wilder in between rounds, but instead of doing that he waited until the next round started then decided to stop the fight to see if Wilder was ok to carry on ,giving him extra time to recover.Just like in his first fight with Ortiz.
"Boom!, I mean bro…" That's eloquence right there! :D
Excuses are like a-holes, everybody's got one, that's unless you're Wilder he's got several a-holes
I can say with absolute certainty that it was never no doubt for me who was going to win and it was Tyson fury all the way deontay Wilder couldn't box his way out of a damn wet paper bag
Wilders biggest problem is his punch because he misses the target so many times he punches himself out
Tyson did what anybody else would had nothing to do with him the refs count was terrible
Gypsies always box usually bare knuckled no wonder Tyson Fury is such a great boxer.
Silver NASA jacket
What is ridiculous is Joe Rogan said he is full lefty. Voted for Bernie during the primaries. Says California going to shit due to bad policies  Then just before signing 100 million deal moves to Texas.  Are you fucking kidding me?
Fury dismantled him again!
Most likely the long count that served Fury has something to do with big betting. I'm a Fury fan but also a logical person for the most part
deontay's fist touched fury's chest after hitting the head, that's where the ripples came from
Damn this was painful to listen to. Joe no clue about boxing but he thinks he know it all...
Good job fury tucked his chin, result would have been very different otherwise.
Let’s be honest, the fury count in the first fight gave us the trilogy which was epic
Is this the space force 😝
"Funnypants Smith" made me wheeze.
@PowerfulJRE Thanks for outing New Zealind Prima Minista and her unreal over reaching control turning socialism into communism. We are Censored. Thankyou so much as our nation is oppressed
The long counting was debunked! The referee is fair and professional his average count is 12 - 12.5 secs between Wilder and Fury.
This fight sucked. What a shame what boxing has become. 🤦‍♂️
That wrong count thing has been debunked - see https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Tyson wouldn't have been Tyson without his ability to move. Tyson would time his punches with his movement and bam. Hed ducked way low then spring back outta no where and bam. No boxer had an aura that equalled Tysons in my lifetime. I wasn't alive in the Marciano days and just a small lad at the very end of Ali's career but Ali was never feared for his power that much I can get. Tyson came along knocking dudes into other dimensions talking about eating their children. The fact is when dealing with heavyweights if you fight long enough eventually someone will catch you. Tyson won fights but never fully found what he once had and its obvious he struggled with that fact. Deontay will likely be similar based on his personality. Fighters like a Tyson or Wilder get to wrapped up in their personas and hype. Once that's gone they seem lost.
No it wasn’t one of the greatest heavyweight  fights of all time, it was one of the best ass kicking of all time. Fury fucked Wilder up.
Joe looking like Moby on his We Are All Made Of Stars cover.
In the second fight didn't he have a broken ear drum so makes sense that he couldn't stand properly
Joe looking like the bald Buck Rogers
Why are they wearing moon landing gear? Sorry yanks, you never landed on the moon
I don’t know where the Americans get the 10 second count? It ain’t seconds nobody ever said it was seconds. It’s a 10 count
What a load of crap. Fury is very lucky this time. He wasn't prepared for this fight, No excuses.
Fury showed that he's the best wilder is good to but the best man won I don't think it was corruption. I think the ref wanted a fair fight and made sure no excuse boy homie got ko. Best heavyweight fight I've seen .
Seeing as he was literally named after Mike Tyson it's not that crazy, dude in the orange on the right a real goofy casual 😂😂
First time I've heard Joe sounding like a straight up idiot here in this clip .
👍👍
….he was named after Mike Tyson. That’s why his first name is Tyson. As for the last name Fury, that’s pretty fucking nuts, it’s true. Probably from his family’s long line of Irish gypsy bare-knuckle fighters; eventually just got the nickname “Fury” and it stuck as a full-on surname. That part is nuts. That with that first and last name (and the enormous weight it carried) along with his father’s decent legacy and family legacy in the sport overall, the fact that he achieved the level he did is a true testament to the hard worker he is.
Earnie Shavers, George Foreman and Deontay Wilder are the 3 biggest power punchers in the HW history
WTFFF is Rogan wearing?!? 😳😳  Moves to Texas. Completely loses the plot…
There's been quite a few people on fury's nuts about the count buts that's out of his hands he has no control over the referee..  maybe a V.A.R type knockdown counter or something to save any doubt. It's done and dusted and move on..
Tyson fucked up that prick big time !!!
Joe wearing a nasa suit and saying 'it's out of this world' 😆
Fury absolutely destroyed Wilder, yall high if you think that fight was close, oh wait you are high 😆 seriously though Fury took Wilder to school. The doc stepped in at the START of round 9, which is absurd, and gave Wilder a chance to recover even.
Mike Tyson knocked Buster Douglas out, it was a 13 second count.
Crazy world look all around you Middle East, tanking economy, supply chain shortages, lawlessness, riot. If you aren’t sure where you’re going after put your faith in Christ dying for your sins paid with His own blood on the cross, buried and rose again. You don’t have to be religious or go to church, salvation is a free gift of grace through faith alone in Christ alone. Free ticket, not asking for blind faith some good sources are jack hibbs, jd farag, Robert breaker, Tim henderson.
14 second long count. Wilder got screwed in 2/3 fights.
What are the chances of Tyson being named Tyson? Well he is after all named after Mike Tyson, so I'd say pretty good. He was raised as a boxer his entire life, it was destined, it wasnt random.
Rogan still talking shite , he’s a pro ref , he has to count at the boxers face if he’s  semi unconscious, he shows them his fingers , wilder had 16 seconds when the doctor came in to the ring to see if wilder was ok , 😜 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Use your phone stopwatch. And time it for yourself. He’s up before 10 seconds. It wasn’t a long count. So my point is? If you wanted to use an ACTUAL CLOCK as Joe Rohan suggested? Then Tyson Fury would be fine. Because again, use your phones stopwatch and you’ll see. No long count. Not longer than 10 SECONDS.
Normal human being would have been ded after Wilder connected that
Cheating is when you fake a nut shot and get a fake timeout right before you were going to be finished from a liver kick.
If you Deontay Wilder would be taught how to move like Fury or Usyk, with the same power he has now. If Malik Scott could teach him that. He would be even better than Muhammed Ali. He could be one of the greatest of all time. It is a pity that he had fallen in love with that power. If he would have learned how to box from the beginning he would almost be unstoppable.  You see that Fury also learns now how to knock out people and to use more power. You see what a major difference this makes. Imagine if Wilder would be taught how to feint and box. It would be unbelievable.
Yeah Joe just imagine if the ref just stopped the fight then and said at that moment in the fight ok Tyson you have now lost, Wilder wins.
The whole count controversy is nonsense, on both occasions that Fury went down, he was wide awake and concentrating on the ref and the count.  He waited until 8 before getting up both times, that's what boxers are taught to do, take as much time as you can to get back up.  If the ref had counted quicker, or started the count sooner, Fury would still have got up whenever the count got to 8.
I have done some fact checking & found that Joe Rogan is lying there is a man with over 130 knockouts & his name is Billy Bird! Billy Bird (1 January 1899 – 6 February 1951) was a British professional boxer who was active from 1920 to 1948 and boxed in the welterweight division. He fought a recorded 356 times in his 28 year-career and was regarded as one of the most active boxers of his time. He holds the record of the most knockouts in any fighting career. Bird has 356 recorded fights, but has been rumored to have even more fights during his career which were not professional matches. Bird currently holds the knockout world record at 138. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bird Rocky Marciano has 43 knockouts!

Joe dksab
Joe doesn't understand proper Gypsy fighter's. I've seen gypsies in far worse keep going
Beautiful fight and shitty fucking commentary.  I seriously wonder if there should be an option for tv viewers to get a non commentary telecast.  Fury is just so fun to watch. He did these  combos in mid range that looked so beautiful. He would do these only a few times but it was so exciting.   Wilder had such heart. Fighting till you physically can't anymore...that's some mythical shit.
Reference the slow count on Tyson Fury. I have timed fury hitting the floor as zero and timed him when he finally got to his feet. He made it to his feet at the count of 8.5 seconds even though the ref was still counting 6, 7 therefore, the slow count is irrelevant fury was back on his feet before the count of 10.
If my aunt had meat-and-two-veg she'd be my uncle. Some theories are a forlorn stretch.
Man you americans...are full of excuse man... The conclusion is Fury beat his ass in all the 3 fights
Joes head look like a helmet
Gypsy Gang
Such a shame that these two are Joe’s guests when talking about the Fury Wilder match.
im a joe rogan supporter, but he gets stupid sometimes, there wasn't a long count.
The only reason I knew Tyson was getting up again is because in gypsy fights they get knocked down countless times his recovering is akin to that they are warriors through and through.
The Ole Gypsy fix smh
hey joe clown Rogan.. learn first and then talk.. don't make up boxing rules as ur crazy ass want
Wilder and his fans are basically black supremacists, f them.
So who really won in your opinion Joe
Jamie saw that in NJPW lol they definitely always keep the count over the stadium mics
They make you walk towards them to make sure there coherently responding. Could of would of should of or its people not knowing better then when there 50 there brain dead. Thats why stops should take place. Many heavy weights said mike tyson by far hits harder then wilder guys that been hit by both.
They first check to.not make sure your ass is out then count. Thats why its always been that way . He stopped it because wilder was out cold if it wemt longer he would be brain dead it saves careers.  Watch dempsey fight it was brutal 7 knockdowns in one round the guy he pounded was brain dead. Watch marciano. Furry would of been fine .
Brian Redmond freaking out over a count from a fight he didn't see and not knowing the actual rules to a count. Headache
why does JR think he's a great fighter....or an expert on boxing......never achieved anything other than talk...never went through what real professionals go through....he an amateur
Archie Moore had 132 KOs, out of 186 wins as a pro.  just fyi
what the?  are they wearing ? looks odd , and smoking cigars ...lol That fat wave ripple ! Tyson is made of steel!
His dad named him after Mike Tyson....
The rules of boxing is clear When a boxer get knocked down The count only starts with the opponent when he is in the neutral corner. The count stops when he leaves the neutral corner. So no mistake
Man to man, fuck the count, hardest man won. I agree though the screen count would work.
Joe looks like he’s in outer space, with weed lol
Maybe know the actual rules before saying things like corruption, smh .
It's clear street Joe.
This guy just refuses to research or confirm anything before offering his uneducated opinion on any given subject, everythings either insane, or wild, he's such a limited thinker
Joe Rogan spouting gibberish on the count as per per normal
Any boxer with any experience is going to make the most of the count to recover. This should be basic knowledge to all boxing fans? Fury knew what he was doing
The difference in counts over 4 knockdown was ½ a second. From hitting the deck to getting to 8 wilder average was 12 sec fury average was 12.5 secs.
Joe you need to lean boxing rules .
Uh Joe you're smoking too much pot bro, Fury was never hurt, he said he was never even wobbly, or close to being ko'd on the knockdown.
“Look at that fat roll down, look at the fat! Look at it roll down!”
Rogan is a tool. Typical yank. Edited.... What the fook has he got on. Elton John wouldn't even entertain that jacket
He’s named after Mike Tyson, the odds were 100%
Oaft, it’s a 10 count not 10 seconds, wilder also got the same treatment when he was knocked down, 13 “ seconds “ for one and can’t remember the other.
😒 camera man can’t pan to the knock out and keeps it on Joe the whole time instead? 😒
Most people chat shit  Tyson furry lost the fight but no one want talk about it why. Tyson furry was down for long time and no one say anything is about white vs black here some black American fake they know they boy win but still want Tyson furry win sham on them shame on boxing they cheat
“So fun”
Jamie is such a dork.
Did Jamie say he needs to get riled up to shout and the Fury vs Wilder was not enough for that? What’s the point in watching fighting when one of the greatest fights ever doesn’t get you hyped!
Joe, you are completely wrong on the referee. You don't understand the rules. Count stops when Wilder leaves the neutral corner. 10 count is not 10 seconds. That referee did an incredible job the entire fight.
Joe should really stick to mma as he talks utter shit about boxing. It wasnt even close to a great boxing match, it was a exciting fight but as a boxing match it was terrible. 1 guy was swinging for the fences from round3 and the other was only flinging 1-2 and grabbing the entire match. Also talking about wilder being one of the hardest punchers of all time🤣🤣 how does he figure that? With Wilders record of knocking out soup cans for 40 fights. And fury being a all time great🤣 because he beat wladimir at the end of his career while on roids, or beating the most protected "champion" 3x? Or could it be when he got beat by a cruiserweight and got the decision because the ref had a beef with the cruiserweight? Or the wallin fight that he should have lost because of the cut? Stick to talking shit about mma joe(even though you make a arse of yourself at that a fair bit as well)
Why has Rogan got a silver space suit on?
Joe rogan is gay
lmao seeing those joe rogan fans who are mostly trumpies and fury fans mad at him... u forgot joe stands in the middle.. he doesnt choose a side... so im assuming alot of u now says hes wrong about this BUT RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING I AGREE WITH
New 10 sec clock has to be implemented I agree!!! Fury was down 15 freaking seconds 🥊🤛🏾⚰️🔥 but s good back and forth fight!
Tell the truth and shame the devil. Your a good man Joe.
All of the denial in the comments 😂😂😂 finally a white guy admits fury is a cheat
Joe knows fuck all about boxing
I fucking love Joe, you guys see how a non racist white man talks about wilder. He says the truth, you racist give him no credit.
they are wearing Nasa .... I see occasional clouds go past
If testing is $20 a day thats $51100 a year everyone has that lying around to pay out.
What the hell are they wearing?
It's a 10 count every good boxer will just get up on 8
3:51 he wasnt bornt with that name, do research at least. Tyson spoke about why he changed his name many times as well lol
You got the wrong people to discuss the fight hah
It fucking WAS NOT one of the greatest of all time.... Fucking behave
Love the confidence this guy has even when he is being stupid
Imagine how many Tyson fury's there would have been if there hadn't been a potato famine or WW1 or ww2
Tyson fury is one of the best of all time
Joe , stay off the drugs and alcohol. You have no idea wtf you're even saying half the time. Look at his fat jiggle . Must have been one of the hardest punches in the world🤣🤣🤣 the count was rigged.🤣🤣🤣 Wilder got his ass beat. That's official
Joe, you are wrong with the counting. Know your boxing rules.
It's not 10 seconds, Joe, it's a 10 count by the referee...Wilder was at fault for not going to his neutral corner. Wilder gave him those extra counts
Joe done too many psychedelics. It's a 10 count NOT a 10 Second count.
Joe Rogan talking about boxing is like a fish out of water. Clown man
All fighters are taught to wait as long as possible during the ten count to get up.  Fury isnt going to get up until he hears the 7 or even 8. Regardless of how long it takes
Rogan looks like a baked potato
There is only one Tyson fury
Youngstown represent baby!
How these morons are commentating baffles me. Basic boxing rules not understood, a lot of 'what if's' blah blah, don't know if they are clueless or simply casting aspersions through bias..
What’s with dress up like an astronaut 👩‍🚀?
“Best boxing match of all time”….you do not have extensive knowledge of boxing history. It was a good fight.
Joe. It's a 10 count. It's up to the Ref to decide if the fighter is fit to fight.   It's not 10 seconds. It's a 10 Count.
Redban seems very bitter over him not being on JRE anymore. Although it's been years. Not to mention Redban is a poser Comedian. His Stand Up blows majorly.
Wow these guys know nothing about  Tyson 🤣😂
Ty joe for calling him on his bs he didnt know jack sh!t tryin to sound cool lol
Joe looks like he just got done doing a 90s rap video
Promote fakeness
Wish it was just Redban Tony I don't dig so much...
Only one clip from this episode???
Look up the rules before you determine your opinion 🤔
It's a 10 count not a ten second count from the referee  I'm sure of this as I remember talking about this  not so long ago to someone else who was saying the opposite of this
14:50 I've been saying this for years Joe. Deontay just doesn't know how to box and his footwork is awful. If he improved ring generalship just a little bit he'd be so damn good.
These guys are stoned as all fuck by the end
Bring var into boxing.
Wilder is a dosser Tyson made him look like an amateur more time in the gym instead of the bong
Hahahaha need to know ref rules but chatting bull
Long count is a myth, they had the same time to get up for all there knockdowns
Joe  and his love 😆😆😆😆
You Americans only enjoy combact sports
AJ’s last fight they ended the last round almost 10 seconds early, right as he was getting knocked out.
They always give the champion a long count. It’s so standard it should be in the book
Curious if Wilder can punch harder than Ngannu on the same certified machine
I mean... Earnie shavers had 68kos in 74wins...do we think Wilder will have the same stats at that point?
Joe looks like Dr. Evil with his silver space suit. :)
Joe does not understand boxing count, so there could be corruption, and he doesn't even look high in this? And they all accept his word as gospel. And this astronaut guy has the most annoying voice ever, Joe's worst podcast yet.
Just watch the video on slow count debunked. The guy counts the whole knockdowns accurately and they were all found to be consistent. The entire 10 counts till the fight resumes averaged at 22.5 secs for both the fighters. There were no slow counts. It's just an excuse by Wilder fans.
Oh hold on wait, no mention of Anthony Joshua?
Joe looking like a potato wrapped in tinfoil 😂🥔
Joe Rogan out here looking like Tin foil man
That fight made my brain hurt.
Joe should talk about the Wilder vs Charli Zelenoff fight. It might be better than this fight
Joe Rogan showing his ignorance as usual and on top of that, he's also unaware of his ignorance.
George foreman 60 KOs
I’m so glad Tony isn’t cancelled. Thank god Joe had his back.
I can listen to Joe talk about great fights for a good 48 hours straight.
Referee went by the true count, the time keeper starts the count only. If the count is broken the referee picks up from the last count. Nothing is said about Wilder getting a long count or extra time at the beginning of the 9th
Wilder started well, but got dropped and the gameplan went out the window.  He looked absolutely knackered after round 4.
I see aj is looking for a new team. About time, he has gone gun shy. I went to the Parker fight and ever since then it seems like he's scared to throw the right hand, klitshcko fight not included.  He needs to a lewis, fury and go to kronk. Jab right hand all day.
Wilder was knackered after 4 rounds. Fury could fight forever, it must come from the traveller fights, no rounds, bare knuckle, concrete. It just shows that fitness is not down to just appearance,  much like fedora.
Fury is a Gypsy Wizard.
The ref counts to IO, it’s not necessarily IO seconds.
Get back in you corner and that wont be problem.
Born in Manchester, but he comes from the Irish gypsies, the travelling people as we call them here in Ireland. Great fight, well done Tyson.
why doesn't boxing have a knock out counter by now? why allow a human do anything other than start an automated counter? Joe touches on this as i type :P
🥊🇬🇧🥊
Seven seconds took for Fury to get up ,same and Wilder .Both when 10hit  they were up already ,Fury was up already
Joe Rogan doesn’t know boxing rules BUT he knows a ton of other stuff so he’s still my guy
Fury was ready to get up on the counts….
I can’t stop admiring the craftsmanship of the sign, then I wondered why the fuck would you use plain white. Triggering.
Thing is, whether it was a slow count or a quick count, Fury uses time to his advantage. So even it was quick, fury would have gotten up at about 8
Why does Joe try to talk like he understands the rules of boxing when it is obvious he has no idea what he is talking about, doesn't he realise all the young Jamie's in the world can Google his incompetence in 3 nanoseconds?
Thats right bubble head no one knows but you 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ as Tyson says the only way to beat him is to nail him to the floor , but you knew what was going to happen, telling someone they don't know to condensing prick
@3:40 He's named after Mike Tyson, knucklehead
Out of all the things joe knows surprised he doesnt know Chavez looked so good because he was a boxer fighting janitors and mailmen. Mayweather is  boxing if you wanted to know how to perfect it also surprised joe doesnt know about Tyson fury cheating tactics in the UK
Joe has to shill for the 👁 and Wilder is in the 👁
Fury won all 3 fights and all the respect.imo.Wilder lost respect with all the excuses
Joe " Watch His Fat Ripple" Rogan
Its 10 seconds per refs count.... if the ref is biased thats one thing...but the rules state its "per the refs 10 second count"
No Joe...the ref picks up the count by an official
Only Americans can dress like rogan
Fury is among the best of all time, no doubt.
You look frieddd you must got that new pack
Not the rules Joe.
Joe is 100% wrong on the count procedure
It’s weird none of them know he was named after Tyson
Rogan To this Day thinks it 10 seconds count when it's a 10 count. Understand Rogan Josh 🤪😭
4:10 "Joe King" .... no that killed it ... sooo good 🤣
Oof, I dunno who this dude in the orange is but I’ve seen him on Rogan a few times and he suuuucckkksss. Kills the convo to say some dumb shit
U look like Humpty Dumpty from the puss in boots movie  joe 😭😭😭😭😭!
Tyson was listening to the count and got up when he needed to get up. If the count was on 7 instead of 4 he would have got up, he was looking at the ref taking his time. Disappointing that you yanks look for excuses for your own
One side fight from the middle of the 2nd round.  Wilder should disappear now!
He gave wilder the exact same count. Fed up listening to this lo g count nonsense. The reason the ref does it because he shows the fighters at the same time because fighters don't hear the ref a lot of the time they are looking at thaim counting so having a count at the dinde is nonsense coz the fighter wouldn't hear half the time anyways. Wilder was hurt badly in the 3rd and got a good few seconds longer than he should have but don't hear hmjoe tslkig sbijt that. I respect hoe rogan so much but totally disagree with him on this. Maybe u should stch the 3rd round knock down before the tyron ones as they were all the same he did nothing wrong and went up to the fighters each time to show them the count as well as shouting it. Powell won't just accept that fury won that fight fair and square.
Thats why the gypsy king! Is the king. What he has done for "us" Council scheme people is amazing, regardless of boxing, he makes us feel like we can achieve things that we never thought we could
I love it when joe does cocaine ….
When you highlight the huge blow Fury took in the 4th round, when you acknowledge how his body mass ripples throughout and nobody had been able to withstand that power you are correct, yet you seemed to miss that Tyson even leaned into it making it even more damaging. It looked as though it hit him maybe on the temple but he somehow gets back up and then goes down again with a blow to back of the head  ( imo) and the bell sounds. Somehow he gets a second wind and looked like he could go another 10 after the fight. If the ref stopped it after any of the knockdowns we would all have been robbed. CNN just bulshitted you, I think you should have a look into boxing rules and understand that it’s not a strict 10 second count and that you must go to the neutral corner to allow the ‘count’ to continue. Tyson uses every advantage the rules allow and could have got up at any time. You didn’t mention the 14-15 seconds Wilder got in the later rounds when the Dr checked Deontay out to see if he was ok to go on. Why didn’t you bring this to our attention. Big fan Joe but just like CNN just gave you a ‘biased’ pasting, I feel like you are ignoring Tyson’s complete control of when to get up
Wilder was thumped fair and square. Fury is the better fighter. It's this disrespect that's propelled Fury to higher standards
I love your show Joe and your guests have been amazing and I’ve learnt so much from this eclectic group. But you don’t seem to understand boxing rules. It’s not 10 seconds. It’s a count and the opponent must go to the neutral corner for the ‘ count’, not seconds, and then continues. And at no stage did Tyson look as though he couldn’t have got up earlier. He is a master boxer and uses the rules to his advantage. And what about Wilder’s second knockdown to Fury? It imo to the back of his head? And when Wilder was given 15 seconds for the Dr at the beginning of later rounds to see if he should could continue. You have huge influence and should be more informed. I love that you are wrong and correct yourself so FFS point out the actual reality. Tyson would have got up at any time he needed but he’s a boxer through and through so uses the ‘count’ not some bullshit ‘10 seconds’ shit. Anyway, love your stuff but please correct your mistake
This has nothing to do with the clip but anyone hear when they were talking about cell phones, someone was saying yea in like a Beavis voice. But it looked like it didn't come from Brian or Tony. Jw. It was kind of weird.
Disappointing video
Those nasa suits are so corny
"I Knew if I could just open my eyes I was alive and ok. And if I was alive I could get up, and if I could get up, I could could fight."  -Tyson Fury  A man who can beat his own demons can beat anyone.
Get Tyson Fury on - say he cheated to his face.
Rogan showing his ignorance when it comes to boxing rules. Surprised he didn't bring BJJ into it.
I find it unbelievable that anyone ANYONE could last 12 rounds with Deontay Wilder.
He did do a long count for wilder at one point as well tho
Stop whining Joe..
Too many great heavyweight fight from the 70's 80's 90's. This is a great fight the present Era, not of all time
Can't take Joe seriously in a NASA fan boy jacket. We all know it's fake
Wilder had a long count too..
"The ref asked the boxer to get his hands up and walk towards him, then wiped his gloves off, at least he was consistent with both boxers"  Bro is this your first boxing match? Who is this guy?
Omg who doesn’t know Tyson was named after mike
Joe, I don't often disagree with you but you are wrong about the so called long count when Fury went down in the fourth round. I have watched over a dozen times and BOTH times he went down i counted at normal speed from the second he hit the canvas to when he got to his feet it was a count of SEVEN and the ref continued to eight count as is the norm. Stop listening to Wilder fanboy conspiracy theorists. Watch it back again if you don't believe me.
Wtf is with their getup
@PowerfulJRE @JoeRogan, watch all falls and counts here, I like yiou joe but your wrong, you need to read the full rules on knockdowns... Timing on  counts (Wilder got longer before having to start again), doesnt matter though the rules are the rules, Showbizz channel breaks down some of it one video directed at you Joe, then does another one where he has Steve Willis the famous boxing referee exokaining exact same thing to fighters and teams before a fight not too long ago..  Go onto the official sanctioning bodies websites before accusing of some kind of cheating or corruption. I like you, an expert in MMA, Knowledgable in boxing, but stuff you're not sure about you should really read up on first, it literally tells you on the sanctioning bodies websites about rules for knockdowns and why what you wanted to happen cant happen. I love your vids but  the 10 second countt you say is against the rules. like I enjoy MMA but dont know exactly every single rules so i dont spout my mouth about stuff I don't know.  Keep the good vids coming but when usure, read up man, you have a huge audience, you could fool peope into thinking that.
https://youtu.be/E_oPB5EDLyg 10 Count rule
Joe doesnt know ish about boxing
Fresh back from the moon, immediately jumps on his podcast.. Joe is truly an inspiration
The odds of that are pretty big when you consider he was named after Mike Tyson 😂
5:21 damn joe is so brutal!!! lol fucking ALPHA
Tyson Fury got named after Mike Tyson lol :) Fury said that in Mike podcast. Here is link https://youtu.be/E3el4bkPkY8?t=38
The ten count is not a ten second count
👊🏻🇬🇧👊🏿✌🏻🇺🇸✌🏿
This one seems like joe needs something to talk about to fill time
I boxed professionaly for 3 yrs and if i remember correctly boxing has never had a 10 sec count its a 10 count and to tell ya the truth i have seen 10 counts that lasted 15 sec and have seen some that were as little as 7 to 8 secs, i went over all the rules before everyone of my fights most of which were queensbury rules and never did i see anything that said i had 10 seconds to get up incase of a knockdown
One or two humans that have ever lived that punch harder than this guy. Tells me everything I need to know about this rogan idiot. wilder ain’t even in the top 10 of hardest punchers of all time
"Best fight ever" Talks only about loser  Joe Rogan :P
Americans still making excuses
Its not ten seconds... Its a ten count and ref's discretion. And they can start the count stop it and pick it up at any point he sees fit!  I've been a boxer since I was five years old and now 39!  And i m a traveler myself I grew up with the fury family went to school with them . we're born to fight. Its like a religion so I know what I'm talking about.
A guy made a video debunking the long count, timed it from start of count until fight continued, and every count was the same length within 2 seconds
Watched it like five times... Fury is a boss
I wanted Wilder to win because he's American. But how many times does Fury have to win before Wilder fans give him credit? He won the first fight,  dominated the second. Shouldn't of even been a third fight.  If Wilder fans which is me are gonna bring up the third fights count, then the 1st fight should be brought up how Fury got robbed. Two knock downs compared to 9 to 10 rounds Fury won. Like I said I'm American and I love Wilder. But Fury is the champion it's simple as that. The British get this W.
Wilder had good game plan more weight and I was hoping weight would add power to KO Fury to point Fury would not get up and it worked because Fury got 15 second count on second knocked down. Wilder won fight in my opinion.
To me it is a controversy that Fury has to beat the shit out of wilder 3 times and still can't get some slack.  Ref split up clinches incredibly fast , other refs would let them tussle bit more... isn't that a "controversy" eh? anything can be controversial.
listen to crackhead in nasa suit... ofc
Even at 19/20 stone Tyson boxes and has footwork like he's a Super.middle.weight ! He would iron out A.J and drain Usyk or even out box him... Like Fury says... Unless you knock him cold... He wins! PROPER FIGHTING MAN....
I love fury but wilder ko him out.. go back and watch mike Tyson fights you can hear the ringside counter guy counting he was done done . Boxing wanted it to go longer
Do one with Usyk
The odds are zero.  Also a boxing count are not in seconds...also the fight must go on...
Joe is barely keepin it together here
Love the way they use big numbers to define how good some thing as horrible as giving a fellow being brain damage can feel to watch.  Hardcore gay masochism LOL. For 12 seconds I could not see joes hands.
Joshuan vs Usik was ended 7 seconds earlier.
Hate it when people talk confidently about stuff they don't know about.  How can you be so sure of yourself when you're definitely wrong?  Surely there must be some doubt since you obviously haven't checked.
Joe rocky marciano had 43 out of 49
Doesn’t matter if he took long with the count, fury was watching the ref both times he got knocked down. So this whole controversy of how long the count helped fury is a bunch of bs. Fury was never devastatingly hurt.
Just shows that haters gonna hate.. Wilder just got TKO'd twice, and they're blaming the referee this time😂.
This guest didn’t even watch the fight…
Good analysis, thus I am surprised you didn't mention the Klitschko brothers, who were both knockout artists, but also technically sound boxers. Which by the way had 53 KO's and 41KO's respectively between them.
Glad joe came back from space
Disrespectful punk couldn't except he got his ass kicked i loved that fight go fury
Fury was looking in regs eye's listing to count ..he would of got up
Joe "look at that fat roll down" Rogan
Any decent boxer runs to his corner for this exact reason. Its a massive reason that Deontay is a crap boxer because he didnt know this.
Buster Douglas v Tyson...long count.
So, the slow count; I noticed when I was watching it live, his count was slow between seconds 5 and 6 to redirect Wilder. It took maybe 1-1.5 seconds and then the ref picked back up on 6. So it's definitely significant for a 10 count, but Fury had turned it up on him. Insanely good fight.
Rule book says opponent must be in neutral corner before count starts.Wilder didn't do that according to his own trainer.
Tyson Fury was named after his Dad's hero. Mike Tyson!
Fury is a great, complete boxer.
love this show https://youtu.be/Q0hSeZ8WLLg
Only reason Joe is such a good mma analyst/expert is Because he’s been doing martial arts his whole life. He’s not smart enough to pick up boxing in the same way that’s why he lacks so much knowledge of the sport
Joe is an idiot thinking that ref is long count on Fury. There is a youtube video that testify the counting both wilder and fury. The ref is counting both the same fighter no long counting. Nxt time Joe in the 4th Fight of Fury and Wilder you will be the Referee
Joe has a bad habit of talking out of his ass and acting as if what he's saying is non debatable. I remember one time he said when crocodiles get their legs bit off, they grow back
Joe dreams of fights….. I was a UFC fan starting back at the first ppv. We use to rent them on the old prime star satellite ppv events. I was a huge boxing fan back in the 90’s during DeLahoya and Roy Jones Jr days. This fight was equivalent if not better.
THE GYPSY KING WILL NEVER STAY DOWN !! AS LONG AS HE HAS A BEAT IN HIS HEART HE'S GETTING UP💯 #KINGOFBOXING
A Joe Rogan podcast with Mark Dice would be epic.  Joe could ask him all kinds of tough questions and get off the cuff answers.  Undoubtedly interesting.
Were wilders counts slow as well?
I'm pretty sure that fury would still stand before the 8 count happened, but still wilder is wilder he could have ended it, but it's still fury the who took wilder's punch and still stand up in the 12th round .
if wilder could move like fury, damn he would beat the brakes off fury!
Deontay has never faced a decent boxer.  Both of these guys would have been killed in the Lewis, Tyson, Holyfield era.
When have u ever seen a ref start a count... 1..2.. & then give intruction to the opponent to back up to neutral corner...and then pick up the count at a further point from the outside time keeper?  The answer is never. So its  something thats rarely ever practiced so it should not be expected. And the ref moved slow on everything from all knock down counts to & all the times he did safety checks on both fighters after getting up from knock downs & wiping gloves.
Lol with the count clock idea  “ I feel like I’ve seen that before !”  Lol yeah on Capcom street fighter lol 😂
6:35 - That's wrong. If the ref's count is interrupted by a fighter not staying in a neutral corner, the ref can stop their count, direct the fighter back to the neutral corner, and then resume where they left off.  It's in the rule books. People who make this point are just ignorant of this rule.
Annoying Joe
Love your show, Joe.  You're always spot-on.  But, in this segment, it seemed like you just praised Tyson Fury's opponent without praising Tyson Fury himself.  Fury is a legend.  Epic fighter.
It has been and always will be Ref discretion regarding the 10 count
There's a video of Jack Reiss explaining the "long count". That should have put this debate to rest. I'm guessing none of us fans know more than the ref himself.
Wilder fights like an unattended fire hose.
People forget the count isn't explicitly stated to be in seconds. Its a count to decide if the fighter is still functioning. A 10 count can be 15 seconds in real time.
He was named after Mike Tyson…
Joe in the second fight it was wilder's coach who stopped the fight not the referee!!
https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k Re the controversial  count Plus why are you talking to this guy about it , he obviously doesn’t watch boxing. Having  said that…love the content Joe. Keep keeping the bastards honest mate.🙏👊
You guys don't know the rules of boxing, the ref uses the time keeper to start the count i.e. whilst  getting the other boxer to the neutral corner will then pick up the count at 2 or 3 but if they are interrupted after starting the count they stop where they are and then carry on where they left off. I will say the count was a bit slow but that happens all the time
that long count as debunked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k
joe try less smoking crack and keep up the dreamweaving for your boy wilder  lmfao
joe pretty damn dumb on this ....
Joe the count is not based on seconds but a count based on the referee. People relate the count to be in seconds. If the count was 10 seconds, Wilder should have been done during the round 3 count.
How is the fight so great . . Best you don't look back at golden years of boxing
Joe looks disgusting.
Combat sports supposed to be Joe Rogan's strong point, but it seems like he doesn't even know that properly. What nonsense must he be saying about things like politics...lol. Will he make a video correcting himself and apologising once he reads and if possible understands the laws properly?
Fury really wasn’t knocked out. He looked pretty much disappointed in himself. If you wanna ruin boxing just make it a strict 10 second count and you could have plenty of fights ending earlier than they should. I believe this fight would’ve actually ended with the first knockdown of Wilder because as far as I know technically that was also more than 10 seconds.
It was like watching 2 giraffes fighting
Joe is wrong here once the ref picks up the count from the ringside guy initially it is his count from then on. Wilder should know you go to the neutral corner and if you don’t and have to be told to do so you are giving your opponent more time.
This is only the second time I've watched this guy. And, I can say beyond a doubt he's a punk. Know it all b****.
Wilder always looks like he’s about to gas out in every fight. 40lb costume not withstanding. He’s always just one punch away from ending the fight though.
It's not a rule of boxing its the referees count of ten not A count too ten its his count it can be shorter or longer. alot of people make that misinterpretation the problem is a straight count to ten never works you go back through many fights and you see the same thing. Plus Wylder's count was 12 seconds I think fury was 13 in the first count
Joe Rogan in that jacket 😂👌🏻
So you all just gonna ignore Joe’s NASA jacket🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's twice the refs have screwed Wilder out of a KO victory
30 more seconds of round 4 and Wilder wins but once Fury got through it I thought he'd win. Still went all the way to the 11th which is crazy. Great fight.
Joe Rogan educate yourself. https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Fury is trash. So is wilder
Best fight I've seen 👏 👌.  Tyson would have got up on any counts he knows how to rest on a kd he was all there both times joe sounds butt hurt with the excuses
Dude,if you could teach someone to grapple like Habib,hahaha! It takes a life time to master the art of boxing, or any  Martial Arts and became the World champion! Wilder started at 17 and never took it seriously, so he never even learned the basics, relying on his right long jab! Furry was boxing and learning the craft his entire life and he's talented and huge! However, Wilders arrogance is what was his downfall,saying, I need to be lucky for a second!
It's not a 10 second count, referee counts with intention to give a fighter chance to continue! Referee was counting the same way for Wilder and Furry and was excellent at his job! The Reason for immediate KO stoppage was Wilder falling forward, indicating a Classic KO!
Nobody’s gonna say anything about them dressed like Senior Space Cadets? 🧑🏽‍🚀🧑🏽‍🚀🚀🛸
Who could take a bunch of sell out NASA fan boys seriously?
Fury is definitely top 3 or 4 all time..if he beats Usyk or Joshua he will be #1 all time
I dont know about that ...fury took every second they gave him so he would have been good enough to fight but he sits like a smart boxer recover as much as possible
Down goes Frazier!
I love Joe Rogan. But there are times he says things that are so wrong it’s scary. Hey Joe, it’s a “ten count”. Not 10 seconds. It’s never been 10 seconds. A 10 count usually last around 14 seconds. And you think the referee shouldn’t be the one counting??? SMH. The referee counts so the fighter that is down, can pick up the count and know when he needs to stand. The referee is also watching the fighter to try and determine if the fighter can concentrate on the count. Most fighters are trained to watch the referee and try to stand when they reach the “count” of 7 or 8.   So your opinion is that someone other than the referee should count, and it should only be for ten seconds. SMH.  BTW, Wilder and Fury got the same counts. The referee was consistent. The only thing he may have done wrong was he gave both fighters extra time after they were standing.  But at least he did it for both.  “If you could teach Wilder to move like Tyson Fury…”  You know, if someone could have taught Butterbean to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee - he would have been a contender.
Wilder sucks he gets his one lucky punch getting beat up most of the time
FFS Wilder got his arse handed to him...get over it.
Slow count on Wilder too
that's not true Joe rogan.the ref stop the count until back in neutral corner.and it's not 10 seconds it's a ten count.like 1000/1 1000/2 1000/3 look at the rules,so ref was correct to halt count.if wilder was in neutral corner he wouldn't have stopped the count.plus boxers are taught not to get up untill 8 so if the ref counted quicker he may have got up slightly quicker.other than that spot on with boxing analysis.
I dont see how the fight was that amazing.. maybe first few rounds and then the toughness of wilder not goin down.. but a lot of it was kinda sad looking
hey what about Bart Starr, Johnny Unightis...
Even by the clock Fury was up by ten seconds even if the refs count was behind. However the count begins once the other fighter has gone to the neutral corner!
9:50 It’s a fucking championship trilogy, YOU MUST let it go until on man can’t anymore. Long counts make good fights, both fighters got long counts
6:40 that’s not true. Once the referee picks up the count from ringside (he doesn’t have to do this, he can start himself), it’s up to him alone to continue the count. This is why it was long, because he was keeping the count and wilder was farting around the ring
Rogan spreading that propaganda. Maybe he has a bias to Wilder because of his story of getting into boxing. Even if count was relevant it was a behind the head push punch that put him down. Sad, Rogan.
Wilder is one of the best no doubt.
Joe is stoned again ffs lol
Wait, the guy in this thumbnail isn’t Jamie? I thought that guy was Jamie.
Tf is up wit his jacket
Fury twatted him and put him to bed in the end after beating him twice already( definitely won the 1st) the best won end of story thanks for reading
Why are they dressed as astronauts?
George Foreman's punch >. Wilder's punch.      George was devastating compared to spaghetti arm Wilder.
The count does not continue until the boxer is in a neutral corner, otherwise the boxer can stand over the downed opponent if the count continues, typical MMA lackies having no  clue again.
His real name is Luke Tyson Fury
Change the name of the clip to ‘Joe makes excuses for Wilder’
Joe is so biased towards Wilder. He can’t say Tyson beat the fuck out of him. Back to the conspiracy theories. Half this clip he talks about a fucking ring count. Give over
By the way there is a video showing that Tyson was up before the 10 second mark.
Look up for Paddy Doherty on YouTube 🔥🔥😮‍💨💯😮‍💨💨💨 bad ass bare knuckle fighter
Fury beat this dude 3 times, and twice he finished him. Clinging to a few seconds sounds like Wilder complaining about loaded gloves.
Gypsy King 🥊🥊 Great display by Wilder too, just sad he is a sore loser and cant admit he was defeated 3 times by the better man. Also Wilder walked and he interrupted for 1 second man.
It's alarming seeing everyone go along with the floppy glove guy
Imean, Wilder has landed the right hand on Fury 4 times sending him to the mat and not one of them was enough to finish him. It was probably pretty discouraging knowing your meal ticket punch is ineffective against an opponent.
Julio ceased Chavez had 80 kos 115 fights
Joe you need to learn the rules about boxing before making useless comments.  Stop puffing and talking shit 👍
And even Deontay Wilder's coach, Malik Scott, says the count is legitimate.
Nearly at the end of this show. A lot of ifs and maybes .waffeling joe shamefull stoner
Unprofessional
It's Fury's boxing experience and know-how which tells him to use all 10 seconds to recover. Doesn't matter how quickly the ref counts, Tyson will be up at 9.5!
You should have timed it your self your see it’s only ten seconds
Pretty sure Marciano beat Wilders ko record
It’s all about safety . Safety comes first .
Stop puffing mate it’s affecting your judgement
Joe if your getting into boxing you need to know the rules & history. 👍 .
Cormier cry's a lot in general. "Crazy slow count"  seems to me like he just wanted Wilder to win. The first knock downs of the fight literally took 12 seconds in order for Wilder to get back in and 20 for the fight to start. Overall there was a 0.5 second difference between the counter when you sum them all up.   If he wants the actual counts to be a thing then Wilder would've lost on first knock.
Fury finished wilders career simple
Tony has nothing to offer the conversation for over 3 hours.
Stick to ufc if he doesn't know rules of boxing
Long count is called cheating. Its called fixing a fight
It’s amazing how wrong Joe is about all the numbers!
According to Big John Mccarthy the ref did as he was supposed to in resuming the count where he left off due to Wilder not staying in his neutral corner. Wilder made the mistake which gave Fury the extra time. Also if you know how Tyson fights you know he uses the whole count to maximize recovery when getting knocked down. More than likely had the count continued without interruption Tyson still would have beat the count.
Who you cutting weight for Joe!
Why orange clown guy sounds so ghey
Fury is greatest boxer ever
A comedian spawned to be great... Carlin Chappelle
Once the ref picks up the count, that's the official count, the referee can pace it at his own discretion. It's not a 10 second count, it rarely ever comes to 10 seconds precisely. If the opponent steps out of the corner and the ref has to tell him to go back, the ref is fully within his right to continue where he left off, lots of refs do it as it acts as a deterrent / punishment to the standing fighter for messing around. That being said, Fury's eyes were on the ref the entire time, he was just making use of the extra time, he still would have been up on his feet had the count been any faster.
What surprised me was that they let fury wear the same gloves lol
Why is the voice of Mr. Smithers working for Joe Rogan?
Its a 10 COUNT, not a 10 SECOND COUNT.
Joe needs a mic that does dark Vader voice or something for dudes with girl voices like this guest😂😂😂
Those jackets are sooo icy ❄️
This is the rules from the WBF - Joe I love ya but your wrong the ref picks up the count from where he left off if interrupted by the standing fighter. please correct your corruption comment.   4.4.         When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted.
Its'a 10 count, not 10 second count!
What are the odds? Is literally named after him
Seriously tho ...is it just me or is this "Ref" acting shady in this fight? Also, Fury was holding the back of Wilder's head as he was hittin' him ..I believe that's illegal, right?
Joe has a better argument arguing about Fury's gloves than the count.
Boxing bros usa break down Wilders recond he's really not that good
All they want to talk about is Wilders power. Give Tyson his respect! Clear win for all 3 fights no question
Joe you are wrong the count starts where he left off.... Wilder cheated himself by not doing cardio. To much mass didn't help either..
What a Nastard.. Mr "question everything" and "no I don't believe they went to the moon". Joe is a tool, too cowardly to stand up for truth. His buddy Eddie Bravo is actually sticking up for some truth and logical thinking.
except a 10 count, in boxing doesn't mean 10 seconds...good that you don't like it, doesn't mean we should change the rule for you, referee don't have a computer in their heads....
These guys are so baked 🤣
Watch the ring clock on both knockdowns, from hitting the floor to standing fully upright, the first was a fraction under 10 seconds, the second was 9 seconds. Before slagging off the so called slow count get your facts correct. It appears that Americans don't like losing.
What the faaack is joe wearing 😂😂😂😂😂
It's like an ice cream man named cone.
just an idea. when joe puts a clip on to watch and comment on, show the audience. watching joe watching the clip isnt that entertaining lol.
Was I the only one surprised that Joe didn't invite Jamie to his watching party?
Wilder never came close, Fury in complete control, just like in the other two fights.
Joe is right but.....the count can't begin until he's in his corner. So he had to start again. Maybe wilder should have went to his corner. And I actually counted it from the time of the first count and he still beats 10 so Cormier needs to stop. Fury isn't Jon Jones so let it go
You are wrong Joe, a referees count does not mean a 10 second count. They can can count to 10 anyway they want. If Wilder had just gone to a neutral corner rather than puffing up his chest to his wife the count wouldn't have been interrupted. Fury was on it anyway and was just giving himself maximum time before getting up.
Tony Hinchcliffe is the gayest straitest guy!
The rules of boxing clearly state its a 10 count. NOT a 10 SECOND count.
The count is part of the show... It was more spectacular this way, maybe Fury got an advantage, but Wilder could have finish him after... Either way, Fury was up on his feet on the 8 second.. I even counted on the watch and he was on his feet before 10 seconds.
Joe out here looking like Dr evil in the spy who shagged me lol
Nominative determinism
I think Judo had a timer for pins.  For an automatic win.
I lost it at funny pants Smith.
So deontay has the most knockouts ever eh?  Top 10 boxers by most KOs  Billy Bird (138)  Archie Moore (132)  Young Stribling (129)  Sam Langford (128)  Buck Smith (120)  Kid Azteca (114)  George Odwell (111)  Sugar Ray Robinson, Alabama Kid (108)
Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas...longest count ever
Fury’s greatest win without cheating is Wilder, the worst boxer to hold the WBC who’s greatest career achievement was beating a 40yr old Luis Ortiz who even at 30 wasn’t a world class top 10 boxer. Bullshit. If anyone decent with a hard punch fought non stop low ranking fighters it would result in constant KOs. The ability to KO deminishes at world class level unless you are actually elite level; hence why Wilder could not do anything with Fury.
Rogan knows fuck all about boxing.
Boxers generally get up on 7 or 8. He got up on 8. If the ref got to 8 quicker, he would have got up sooner. Not really a point.
Frankly for rogan to be as knowledgable as he is and not understand the ten count rules of boxing is kind of alarming the guy has such a huge audience he's gonna start a witchunt
why the space suits
Wilder has went 30 rounds with Tyson Fury. Fury has ate his best shots and they weren’t enough to put him away. So maybe Wilder’s power isn’t what people think it is
Why does anyone listen to this shit?
“Queer city” an old saying. Nothing against gay folks lol
Wilder gassed by the 3rd round was getting beaten on like a wounded wildebeest just put him in the dumpster if he wasnt 6'7" with a 85" reach he wouldnt have gotten anywhere no defense skills at all.
Fury was going to be fine even if it was a shorter count. Props to Wilder but the better man won.
JARRETT HURD VS JULIAN WILLIAMS GREATEST FIGHT OF ALL TIME
"one or two guys that's ever lived that can punch as hard."  Maybe more like 40. Off the top of my head I got Ngannou, Tommy Hearns (same build too), Iron Mike, Liston, The Black Beast.
This whole long count narrative is ridiculous!  And there is proof - https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Tyson Fury is the best boxer of all time. Ali would get destroyed by Fury.
These guys were made for each other is an understatement
Joe rogan: Deontay could of been the greatest had he not lost to the greatest.
The referee counts you out, it's not in seconds perfectly and doesn't need to be. The referee stops the count and moves Wilder back to his corner as per the rules. Plus Fury was waiting to stand up on the count. Fury was eyes open and compus mentis the whole time. There is no suggestion of wrong doing in this instance.
Tyson slumped him. Any fight with fury is the best fight of your life guarantee.
Joe King/Joking. 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This was a great podcast
Beat the bum 3 times
Not to be racist, but you find that with alotta Black fighters. They have this ridiculous power and athleticism, but many them ignore technique.  The ones who don't ignore technique always become GOATs.
I actually thought it was a pretty lame fight that 95% was spent in the clinch hugging. The ref was the real winner
On the count being off in this fight. I've watched thousands of boxing matches and it's uncommon to have an exact count for any knockdown. I think the count should be 15 anyway
RIP Joe Rogan
I agree that the elongated count was in Fury's favour, but it did feel like it was only 1 second to me. But I've seen this kind of count happen in other boxing matches too, where counting resumes after telling a fight to hey back to their corner. I cant remember which fights they were in, but I've seen it happen in a few
If Adam Dunn could hit singles he would be the greatest hitter ever.....
Time keeper does the count from ring side. The referee can pick up the count from time keeper. Mike Tyson vs Buster Douglas was the fight in Japan. When the Mike Tyson knocked Douglas down, the time keeper hit 10. The referee was about 3 seconds behind. You can physically see the time keeper in the Tyson Douglas fight 3-4 seconds ahead of the referee.
Boxing should have a computer timer count out loud as soon as a fighter's knees/ass/legs hits the mat.
They sent the doctor in to give wilder more time . wilder had the more time to recover
Great video thanks
In the second fight it was stopped by the corner, not the referee!
Like every decent boxer and what I learnt from being 12 years old, when you drop take the full count, you don't gain extra points for jumping up at 2 and if you need to take a knee take a knee for 8 seconds be up for 9 and ready by 10, fury was ready by the normal amount of time regardless of the longer count
If the Ref is counting, I could see guys waiting till 7 or 8 to get up
If I didn't watch this fight from this video I'd think Wilder won.  Why is this a "let's hype up Wilder" video? 😂 Jeez
Joe said "Queer street", cancel coming.
Trying to land more calling gigs Joe? Jk I love your critiques.
Sorry Joe but your putting out bad information saying Wilder has the most KO's of any heavyweight at 41 knock outs ,the greatest heavyweight of all time Rocky Marciano knocked out 43 opponents and is the only heavyweight champ to go undefeated his entire time as champ until retiring as the Undisputed Heavyweight Champ with 49 wins & 43 by knock out ,Wilder is 2nd to Rocky in every last fight stat .
The orange suit guys all SUCK
Honestly I think people and the establishment wanted Wilder as champion because black people won't watch a sport, of there isn't any black people in it.
Joe you're dead wrong, Fury is legit, that fight was fair.
Joe looking old🥲
joe really displaying his lack of understanding on boxing rules here, jeez
In regards to the refs count. fighters will stay "down" for most of the count.  This means Fury would have gotten up earlier but he was listening to the count.  It's a non story and could be brought up every other fight
If Wilder is the hardest puncher in history then Fury must have the strongest chin.
Stop making excuses for wilder... it's ridiculous now... wilder should have been stopped before this...I can't believe he didn't collapse if exhaustion
Whats up with the space outfits??
You're an American, we understand Joe..we do! Go suck on Deontay W. Fury is great probably the best of his generation.
I love tyson fury.. everything about him.. but I thought he had absolutely no chance... I was so astonished at his ability.. that man is special. I thought for sure he was going to end up brain dead after fighting deontay... but the great white hope shocked the world 3 times.. and he knocked out the knockout artist twice!
this shows how much of a prick J ROGAN IS
I'd never heard of Joe Rogan before when I saw this headline, I mistook it for Martin Rogan (the retired Irish heavyweight who was stopped by Fury a few years back.) I thought maybe he was having a dig for old times sake. Then I realised it wasn't him, it was just this professional mouthpiece whose opinion isn't worth shit.And just to illustrate the point, I played back the two knockdowns in Round 4 with a stopwatch. From Fury hitting the canvas to being back on his feet it was 9 seconds exactly. for both knockdowns, and that doesn't even take into account Wilder's delay in going to the neutral corner which according to some (including WBA rules) should de deducted from the count, contrary to the bullshit that Rogan is making up here.  So, longer than the referee's count, yes; and I'm not sure what the ringside timekeeper counted, but one thing is for sure, these comments from the professional mouth Joe Rogan and his studio bumchums are (unsurprisigly) complete and utter  bullshit. Then again, from the way they were mocking Fury's physique and wetting their pants over Wilder's right hand, it's pretty obvious where their sentiments lie, which makes the result of the fight even more satisfying.
Wilder got his ass hammer in all 3 fights. W are you talking about😂
Funnypants Smith 😆
Tyson fury, stage name!
O common Joe ,it was a one side beating for 3 fights despite the knockdowns.Wilder got 1 right hand coming from a mile and nothing else.
I’m excited for Wilder vs Ngannou one day
A ten count isn’t ten seconds. Also fury could have got up at any point he was just waiting
#stopmissycummings
Fury could have got up sooner he was waiting on the refs count using the full time to catch a rest
California JOE talking about wilder like he WON!
Sorry Joe wilder didn't go nutrell corner walked past corner ref was pointing to WILDER WALKED RIGHT PAST THE NEUTRAL CORNER ANDOVER TO HIS CORNER so count stops Check the rules. And the referee also has to wipe the boxes raunds tell them to put their hands up asks them to the want to continue.  So people using ring clock Wilder was knocked down with 36 seconds to go round 3 he got untill 15seconds 21seconds on clock and fury ran straight to the neutral corner the rest didn't have to check him.  An wilder got 2nd knockdown holinding Fury head he been warned he held his head an hit wit rabbit punch don't take my word watch knockdown s
So salty 😂
Joe "Dr. Evil" Rogan
Calm down rogan 😅
Sounds like Joe had money on Wilder or something. What a bad loser. Fury OWNED Wilder THREE TIMES. Get over it dude.
What about the fact that when wilder was down they removed the clock from the screen on the tv with 9 seconds remaining and immediately rang the bell a 3 seconds later.
Cry about the ref count all you want, the guy did a helluva job otherwise. He was in the ring with 2 GIANTS and took no shit from either.   The ref wasn't wiping the gloves, he was shaking the fighter's arms to see if they are coherent by how loose their arms/hands are.  What fight was the guy in the orange with the insanely weak voice watching?
I've an un le called Joe king
Tyson beat him 3 times
joe they have to pause the count until the boxer goes to his neutral corner, hence why he told wilder to go to his corner......
Tyson lane got 300 year of bear knuckle championships in his blood line . He was bread 4 fighting
Joe Rogan is talking all normal about boxing  with a reflective Nasa suit 🤯
Joe u are right it was best fight ever
Joe clearly knows zero about boxing.
8:30 he’s thinking of Wii Boxing
Fury has an incredible jaw recovery time. Pure tenacity. Gets up. Dusts off one of the hardest single connections ever. And boxes even more dangerously… Fury is the king
Who gives a fuc what Daniel Cormier thinks?  The ref stops the count once THE OPPONENT LEAVES THE NEUTRAL CORNER.  Wilder should of stayed put.   Period.
How come nobody mentions all the Fury steroid use issues? Reminds me of David Ortiz in baseball... which kind of ignore it because they act so nice in public.
Bad take by Rogan. He needs to read the actual rules on the count and stop adding to all the people trying to protect wilder. No idea why people are protecting a bad, arrogant boxer like wilder.
The hyperbole within the first 10 seconds. Best fights ever? Smh. Stick to ufc
I have watched over A 1000 fights and I've never heard of that at the end of the day Wilder wasn't in the neutral corner  and I didn't hear you mension the doctor coming in after round break
It’s not a 10 second count. Meaning you don’t just get 10 seconds. The referee uses the 10 count to determine the state of the boxer. That referee did everything he could to let the boxers fight and not end it prematurely.
I dont think Joe knows boxing counting rules that well.
Conspiracy Joe at its finest 😂
The counts were the same for both guy's
Rogan is so full of shit, teach Wilder how to box and he'd be one of the greatest boxers of all time.. Really Joe? 🙄
Excellent 👍
salty Joe
Joe made a couple mistakes in this video.
Somebody uploaded a video of both Wilder and Fury getting knocked down on each occasion when the ref reaches his 8 count it's 12 seconds for both fighters. So the ref was very balanced.
I am pretty sure Klitschko has knocked out more
Its completely subjective. I am a boxing casual and my first full match was Mike Tyson vs Lennox Lewis. But I felt Tyson Fury was in complete control of his mind and body when he fell and he took as much rest as possible, just in case. Just my opinion though
Bullshit talk from the 6min mark 😒.  Mma heads
This Referee was very very high Quality and everything was okay with that. It has nothing to do with 10sec at all that should be clear from the beginning. Every Ref has the right to have his personal count, there is no real reglemantation in that.
Wrong Joe your not always right Joe lol it's in the Rule book that the Ref inside the ring if the fighter is not in the neutral corner he will stop the count until the fighter stays in the neutral corner the outside official has nothing to do with the count in that aspect... It's just the fact you can look up yourself I already knew this but I'm sure you can look it up
wait, you don't know fury is named directly after mike tyson? he's from a family of fighters bro. he's the real game bred
Fury had him worked out by round 4  All over after that
He punches that hard in three fights he couldn't knock him out.
Wow, kind of surprised here. When me and my friends watched the fight we all pretty much agreed that Fury won every round except round 4. Joe makes it seem like Fury was struggling for the win
Deontay Wilder is the Francis Ngannou of boxing.
Nice to see the dumb guy King repping NASA.
I understand that there isn't much you can talk about that Hinch knows anything about, but why would you talk boxing with him?
The counts for Wilder were also long so the count arguments are just rubbish
What's tosh.0 doing on the show with Joe Rogan???
You guys make it out as if Fury was badly hurt by those punches. It looked more like he knew he was wobbled by the punch and went to ground knowing that he had 8 seconds of not having to dodge punches whilst shook.   He was hurt, sure, but took a tactical knockdown instead of being clobbered on the feet.
Joe, greetings from Ukraine!!!
Mr. Rogan talking absolute shit about the count. Please focus on what you know not what you see.
If you read the rules it states that fighter must be in neutral corner before the count begins. Hence why fighters immediately run to the corner after a knock down.   Look it up. Count was legit.
Didn't his parents specifically name Tyson Fury after the 'fury' of Mike Tyson?  How can this guy not know this?
Joe is wrong on the referee count tho. Fury could have easily gotten up faster if he wanted to. But he is smart and takes as much time as possible to recover. Also Wilder was at the wrong Corner, thats why he interrupted the count. Also its not a 10 second count, but a count to 10. ITS NOT SET TO 10 SECONDS.
Why not for manual counting - have an automated counter with an audible beep or screen that has large digital numbers counting up, that keeps the same uninterrupted tempo? The ref can initiate it by clicking it with a remote to start it or something.  Lol made this comment too early
If the fighter doesn't go to the neutral corner the Cound is pause it's in the rule wilder should off know the rules and gone to corner
Tyson was ready to get up, just waiting the count out like a pro. So Wilder punches hard, big deal. Joe needs to pour some cold water on his Deontay-boner and give Tyson the respect he deserves for dismantling Wilder convincingly once again.
Fury looks like 2 liters of milk in a 1 liter bag trying to box....
As soon as this came on I immediately thought of Austin Powers with Joe in that space suit
Wilder should’ve stayed in his corner and the count wouldn’t have stopped
Tyson fury was named after Iron Mike that makes his name even cooler 😎
I’m pretty sure Mike Tyson disproves Joe’s theory on power punching hinders your movement.  Mike Tyson was insanely illusive coupled with insane power
WAC 36-12-140
percentage wise - yes Wilder is the highest KO percentage. Archie Moore has more knockouts than anybody in history.
I've never heard so many excuses by a guy over a trilogy
Joe is such a wilder and jon Jones fan boy.
Joe is wrong about the neutral corner reffing.
Tyson Fury’s name comes from the fact he was born the year Mike Tyson fought Britain’s Frank Bruno. He was born under weight at just 3lb and almost died in child birth. He spent the first weeks of his life fighting to stay alive and his dad said he was a born fighter so named him after another born fighter, Mike Tyson
Joe you might lose fans for telling this truth...don't do it...naw do it  !!!!!
Why is this podcast so focused on wilder rather than the fact tyson absolutely outclassed him the majority of the fight? So much of this interview is just 'oh but wilder could have won' 'oh if this didnt happen maybeee wilder would have won 🤦‍♂️
The long count yeah. Fury would have been listening to the ref and even if he picked it up at the right count Fury would have got up. He was just buying time. Make the count work for you.
So if tyson fury heard  2.3.4.... he be like ok I get up at 8. But if he heard 6.7.8... he up straight away...
Rogan shilling for NASA again
It's never been a 10 second count. It's a 10 count. This leaves some leeway to the ref if he feels the fighter has a chance to come back. It's not perfect just like calling balls and strikes in baseball. I also believe that Wilder's infraction of not staying in the neutral corner does indeed pause the count.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong here but I boxed at an amateur level for about a year in the United States army One thing I've learned from my coach is if you get knocked down and you can listen to the count don't jump up as soon as you want to listen to the count and when it gets close to seven or eight get up before it gets 10 basically to make sure you get the rest and that you're able to stand and continue the fight Don't rush it I know this cuz I got knocked down and I jumped up after like the count of three and he told me you wait gather your thoughts and then you get up.
Awsome match.
Hay guys. Just to clear up the count rules,if a Fighter doesn't go to a neutral corner the referee rule is to stop the count,make fighter go to corner,then continue the count,that's the rules,stop the count then continue count once other fighter goes to the corner,not continue count during this time. Watch the replays in slow motion. The referee picked the count up from the time keeper on 4 correctly too. So as Tyson get up the count is on 5,but the count isn't meant to be 10 seconds because it's based on the recovery rules not exact count of seconds. The recovery rules state that the referee as counting is also looking to see the eyes and legs are back and they can take instructions,as in gloves up come towards me.. the ref seen Tyson's eyes and legs were ok on 8 then he told Tyson gloves up and move. It was not a long count at all because the rules again state the count is at the referee's discretion as they must give the fighter time to recover,it's a golden rule,and has never been an exact 10 seconds count ever. It's a recovery count at the referee's discretion because the show must go on as such,unless the fighter is out on his feet. It has always been this way.. every count in boxing is longer than 10 seconds,it's a 10 count not a 10 second count.. Tyson was born prematurely and only weighed 1pound when born,his dad could hold him in the palm of his hand he was that small,you ask Tyson about it. Big John named him after Mike Tyson too and said at birth my son will be heavyweight champion of the world. It's an incredible story and should be recognised as such,never mind the debate about the rules.boxing is 3000 years old,the Egyptians boxed so I would imagine those in charge of the rules over the last 3000 years have got them right by now,wouldn't you agree.? ✌🏼&❤️
People dont know it but tony is one hell of a fighter. Been doing it for years....... that aids though
Rogan on a rant again, dude is getting seriously boring...."Show this" "Show it again" "Look how this happens" "Show it again" "Boom" "Loot at that fat".....jesus wept is he high again?
Tony bringing up Asians is hilarious . Still giving them props using words and not hans.
Joe Rogen Kills a Triceratops  https://youtu.be/KFuFqA4CG78
Why does Jamie not show the knockout. I wanna see that sht. Showed it twice and only saw the fall
Tyson fury took advantage of that long count, he was just relaxing 😂 I think he would have gotten up regardless even if the count was puckaa
When is Fury-Wilder 4?
It's a 10 count, not a 10 second count lol 🤣
2:55 Fantastic strategy of Muhammad Ali vs Foreman.
How come once in a while everyone is in space suits?
Joe sounding like master Shifu at the end
He was up by the eight count though, so your point is??? Youre just a reflection of trump now. Lies, misinformation and conspiracies. Sooooo stereotypically American 🤣🤣🤣. He lost. To the better fighter. Get over it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k         debunked
What I don’t understand in boxing is: why have the rules of the count not been adjusted to modern times? It seems leaving the fate of recovery in the hands of human counting/interruptions isn’t efficient
i don't know anything about boxing
Get your facts right joe ,,,,, in the marquis of queensburry it's a reff 10 count it's nothing yo do with a ten second count ,,,,, and if that's your argument check out the count vs seconds when wilder was down,,,, stick to mma baby ,,,,,
Wilder give up dude. You can't beat Fury. Fury is the superior boxer.
I do love Joe Rogan, my favourite podcaster, my favourite UFC commentator and martial arts expert that I always listen to with passion but when it comes to boxing.......... I really do not like that Joe is biased  when he speaks about Wilder vs Fury with much favouritism leaning towards Wilder. Talking about Deontay record and history of knockouts when It is not a secret that Wilder had very precisely selected opponents that were more butlers than boxers and never fought anybody that good and decent beside Luis Ortiz and the man was already far beyond his prime. When Fury got knockdowned in fight #3 he was sitting on the ground like a tourist on a sun bed sipping mojito with sanity and focus in his eyes, he is just super smart and was using all the seconds to get rest and recovery. I would say the same about fight #1 slow count or not, Fury was still in the game. Fury outboxed and declassed Wilder and showed him true mastercraft level of boxing 3 times.  Wilder is a  true monster with huge weapon in his right hand, but I wouldn't even consider to call that Behemoth a boxer, cause he has almost zero technique and most important, literally ZERO sportsmanship. In my eyes he is just a self centered narcisist and sore looser that can't even give back respect to his opponents. That is not only Wilder's fault he was surrounded by a bunch of ''yesman'' people that created a bubble for him to live in. Being on the ''top'' and constantly being called the King or the best, while fighting not the best quality opponents can fuck up your mind and twist reality that there is nobody better and when a true master of the sport appears and burst that bubble things go nasty so quick that he couldn't accept reality. He went so low to even blame his own coach for spiking his water or being corrupted or influenced by others, going through the refs, ''Extra'' padded gloves and many other things out of this world.  All hail to the Gypsy King 3-0 in this trilogy.
Wilder lost to the better boxer that night but it doesn’t take away from his skills. I would love to see wilder fight Anthony Joshua I think wilder would school him
Its a damn shame that boxing is so crooked. Could be the most exciting and entertaining sport to watch (it  was at one time)  but you rarely see the fights you want to and if it goes to the scorecards.... put your money on the guy backed by money.
There is a different law. If the boxer doesn't go to neutral corner he can stop and continue where he left off
Love me some Joe Rogan but what the F is up with everyone on the show wearing these assholenaut suites. lol
Wilder has the best padded KO ratio due to fighting cans for most of his pro career
2021 blessed us with some amazing fights
Tyson put hands on Wilder like he was Mr. Potatohead. Show some respek.
That has nothing to do with it being boxing and not ufc it was the ref thats how he does it the ref was Russell Mora he's been around since the late 90s he just reffed the Pacquiaos last fight  & has always been a Damm good ref and I don't agree with Joe he's right the time keeper starts the count if Russell doesn't start the count right away but I thought Russell Mora started the counts on time however I felt he gave the fighters way to much time when they got up he kept asking them questions and give me your glove etc... So I counted the extra time he gave and he gave Wilder :6 extra seconds when he went down 1st time he then gave fury :7 extra seconds &:6 extra seconds he then gave Wilder :6 extra seconds on his 3rd knockdown:9 extra seconds on his 4th knockdown
Joe, biggest controversy in the first fight was the DRAW while Fury beat the shit out of the BRONZE DOSSER
Congratulations to Wilder winning for Wakanda again.
Mike Tyson: 44 wins by KO David Tua: 43 win by KO
Amount of ignorance re boxing Primary purpose of count: to protect the hurt boxer, used to be opponent could jump on opponent straight away as he started to get up.    Also to be fair to the hurt boxer the boxer takes the count from ref right in front of his face ie fingers and voice rather than a timekeeper who boxer might not be able to see or hear.     Unified rules of boxing - if opponent fails to go to or stay in furthest neutral corner the count may be stopped by the referee
I always respected Rogan but I've lost all respect now
sorry joe he's knocked out 41 retired boxers, tin cans, etc.
Rogan has zero credibility
Tyson Fury kicked Deontay Wilder's ass 3 times out of 3, and all Rogan talks about is Wilder and excuses. Pathetic.
The count was irrelevant, Fury was fully aware at all times and got up when he needed to according to the count at that time. A shorter count would have made no difference.
All Rogan does is sit and analyze from the sidelines. He'd be a third string kicker in NFL.
D rider Rogan.
It was 15 sec count
He is spaced out with that bitch ass space suit but has never stepped foot on on the moon, nor the Octagon. Fear factory not nigga!
But Fury would whoop the everliving shit out of Rogan and Mayweather
Hey Joe , have you had Eric Dubay or Dave Weiss on your show yet?  I ask  since you have the NASA garb on.
Joe Rogan Shits in his pants like Kill Kenny but will never interview Dana Loesch because he gets migraines from boxing and can't ever be half Rousey enough to step in Octogan
Funny pants Smith & Tyson fury are not in the same category of names, I'm sorry and shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence ty. IMO
Joe I know you don't read comments  I'm a fan and love your cast. I am going through a life time of depression and other things, ssd, panic attacks but I know how you kick so hard. I'm a small guy but I know how to kick like you.
He’d had gotten up at 8. Whenever the ref called it
I totally thought Joe Rogan was dressed up like "minime" from Austin powers for holloween.or Doctor Evil!.😂
WILDER WON 🏆.. PERIOD
Any fighter would take advantage of a long count. Why not? They're trained to wait until the ref gets to '8'. They're complaining about the count, but not the fighters taking advantage of the situation. 🤷‍♂️
Joe Rogan and his imagination of what should happen in boxing whilst stoned off his nuts
Joe getting nervous twice in this clip is jokes 1st when he said queer street and they laughed and he gets all defensive "It has nothing to do with gay people!" then he started sweating when tony started talking about japanese and chinese
That been debunked with a stop watch that the ref was not slow counting... https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Most likely an error lol. Either way they both made not than most
So here you see again how Joe manipulates his viewers to surf on a big wave to the point the it doesn't matter how big the wave is , it's all about the surfer ! By running the entire podcast to admire how great was the Deontay Wilder loss , he tries provoke his viewers so that it becomes all about him again .
Joe I'd like to tell you something because I've enjoyed most of what you do.  I've seen the video where you state "we've moved passed God".  It's such a shame to see someone make this obtuse remark. I've noticed that this is mostly common within groups of people who are wealthy, famous, or democrats. Some push God away because they place themselves in a "godly" likeness of sorts.  Some push against Christ simply due to being afraid to face Him and face the abundance of sin in their lives.   Some deny Jesus Christ even with all of the text, historical documentation and testimony from countless people because it's the "hip" thing to do.  And of course some deny God because they assume they are enlightened in a way in which very few others could understand or reach, mostly this types mentality is altered by some substance or they are simply suffering from some mental illness within the category of narcissism or stereotypically schizophrenia.    It saddens me to see someone like you proclaim such nonsensical rubbish, especially with the blessings that have been granted upon you.  Many people who cling to their faith more strongly than ever don't have the notoriety nor wealth that you enjoy but isn't it odd that they would rather have God?   Of course there are an abundance of wealthy people who hold to Jesus Christ strongly as well, who make it their life's mission to serve in the capacity they feel that has been granted to them.  But you Joe, you sit in an awesome position to proclaim Christianity as the only truth, which it is, yet you use your platform to sow discerning views which hold no real importance other than fueling the most current fad or gossip and enjoy the fires they feed.  Joe we all know that there IS a God because deep inside every single one of us is the seed He placed to insure that when our time in this evil world is over and done, we would have no excuse as we stand before God Almighty and receive our judgement for the lives we've lived. You feel it every time you do something bad or wrong.  There's no scientific term for it. There's no "proof" that it exists yet we feel it.  Some say it's our conscious but it's really our souls.   No matter how hard we try to ignore it, it can keep us up all night.  Mankind is getting more and more intelligent yet we can create a simple blade of grass.  We sit at the perfect distance from the sun on a planet which spins the perfect speed which is perfectly suited for our survival.   We are God's children yet dead in sin which is why we live in a world which is dying exponentially. ALL of the prophetic scriptures in the bible is happening before our very eyes yet you say no.  I have very little but I've never been happier.  And I know I'm far from perfect.  I know I fall short each and every day.  I say things I shouldn't and do things I shouldn't but I'm happier than ever.   Because I've witnessed God's work and I know without doubt that He is not only here but He's always been here for me.  I just truly hope that someday, somehow you find the truth that's within you.  I know it's within you because it's within us all.  God bless you
AJ and wilder is the fight. Usyk should be fighting fury. Usyk schooled AJ and I reckon barring a knockout, it's gonna look very similar to the first.
Not true. The 10 count STOPS until the opposing fighter goes to neutral corner. That was rule when i fought as amateur My trainer always said after you knock someone down  to move it or lose it.
Tyson Fury has a heart of a Lion. Respect to Wilder but Tyson is a all around fighter. Wilder being one dimensional was his downfall. Great fight.
what your asking for is a digital referee, no thanks
I remember now why I quit watching Rogan... It won't happen again.
if ur heart wasnt raised watching it, your daed
Joe come on man, wilder hits hard.. fury had wliders number 3 times over. Fury got up.. Wilder basically went to sleep just before going to the hospital.  Remember joe 3-0 .. (draw)  #
Was that a Brian Redban sighting?
I hope Deontay has been brushing up on his excuses  errrr.... I mean skills!
Actual boxing happened ? And not social media boxing 🥊?
I'm glad you mentioned fat ripped. If you see the match between Listón  and Ali, the so called ".hantom punch", you will see "fat ripple" after the punch but before Listón hit the canvas.The tv cameras were not totally covering the action like today.
I wish JRE would interview Fr Vincent Lampert. JR is a great interviewer
I agree that it was a great spectacle.There have been bigger ones in my opinion. Trilla in Manila,Rumble inthe Jungle, Ray Leonard vs Duran to name a few. This was more of a slug fest.Pure boxing,I dunno.Fury went down for a rest a few times. Check it out.No corrupción needed!
This clip is the definition of "you don't know shit about boxing" 😂
This Podcast is great! Hopefully mine gets to this level! Just gotta keep finding creative topics and good guests!
That was the "Abner Mares low blow" referee.  They actually switched to him in the middle of fight week.  Who knows with boxing.  A great fight, but cant help but feel it had a bit of manipulation.  🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
Joe Rogan is now just a full blown conspiracy theorist lmao
I really like Fury. He's very agile for a guy his size BUT with that mobility and that much of a weight advantage it shouldn't have been close. I guess that speaks for how good Wilder is. I agree Wilder does need to work on his conditioning and fundamentals.
If Wilder went to the neutral corner, per the rules, the count wouldn't have stopped at all. Fury has won 3 times now and people are still making fucking excuses. Delusional.
Rogan just wants the american to be the winner ...
https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
What i want to know is what's the chances of the fastest human ever being named Usain BOLT
What joe is describing at the end was essentially young Mike Tyson before Cus died. Crazy good movement with good power.
Jan vs Izzy all over again. The bias is insane...
That's the 2nd time they robbed Wilder I don't give a fuck what nobody says Wilder beat Tyson in all their fights idgaf who says different....
Oh STFU......your taking away from Furys outstanding domination over 3 fights. " if if if wilder could do this " NO ONE CARES.... ROGAN TURNED INTO. POS......
You are out only by a ref 10 count, not a flat 10 seconds. It's been this way since the beginning of the sport. It's the refs discretion, just like waving off the fight is, just like deducting a point is, etc. Even so, he only paused because Wilder was not in a neutral corner, which is in the rule books to do, as well as picking up where he left off at. Either way, Fury knows to stay down as long as possible on counts. It's the smart thing to do. He said the same thing after the first fight. People thought that was a long count too. But Fury knows it's a ten count only, and uses it. Fair fight, great ref.
More bullshit about the count smh. There are two types of people out there: people who clearly know Fury won, and people who don’t want to admit it. Fuck Cormier.
It’s a 10 count not a 10 second count ffs when will people realise this shit
I was under the impression that "10 count" does not mean "10 seconds" in boxing.
The best fight in boxing speaking as a fury fan of similar Irish heritage in England is hearns hagler. Maybe that’s my age showing but as a 9/10 year old that and Maradona a year later just blew my mind.
People wear space suits a lot on Joe Rogan, quite odd
Archi moore knocked out 144 fighters
Joe clearly showing a little bitterness deep down in there that the American.... got destroyed..... AGAIN.....for a 3rd time! .....by a Gypsy from Manchester haha. Fucking love it.
Dude took too much dmt it seems
#1 Absolutely trash casual theory to think that Fury was the one benefiting from any type of "corruption". Maybe if he were fighting over the pond, but buddy, this is Wilder's backyard. Also, don't B.S. and pretend like Fury was dazed up until 9. He was just waiting out the last few seconds like any pro does.   #2 The rules set out by the Association of Boxing Commissions and Combative Sports clearly states: “The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner.”  Basically, the referee has the power to stop their count if a fighter has failed to do so. This has happened many times, in the history of boxing.
Joe news flash every count is slow when your stoned out of your mind you dipsh*t.  🥴🤪.  Sleepy Joe².  🤡
Damn Joe I fuck with you tuff and respect your show and word, but I have never seen you be so firm on being so wrong bro...it's ok to be wrong and humble
that's the best breakdown. Joe is not right at this time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k
that ref was probably exhausted. He was old AF and tiny compared to those two. Imagine being a regular size 60-year-old man and trying to drag Fury off of someone 30 times a round.
Joe Rogan doesn’t understand the rules of boxing : ——————— Footage reveals the reason referee Russell Mora stopped counting at five was because Wilder was not in a neutral corner.  It was at that point Mora stopped to signal for the American to move into the neutral corner before his count resumed.  The official was just sticking to the rules set out by the Association of Boxing Commissions and Combative Sports.  It reads: "When a knockdown occurs, the downed boxer’s opponent shall go to the furthest neutral corner and remain there while the count is being made.  "The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner." ———————  Game Over.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k    ref was consistent with both fighters
Can’t believe people, especially Joe rogan, are still making excuses/conspiracy theories that wilder was robbed of a victory, fury has battered wilder 3 times ffs, 3 times! American boxing fans are sore losers for sure, fury is a boxing genius.
If Deontay Wilder could box he would be great - and if my Aunt had a dick she’d be my Uncle…
When people claim corruption or a long count its ridiculous...fury was obviously taking as  much time as possible which alot of smart fighters do when they get knocked down...if the count would have been faster fury would have got back up...he wasn't floored and he didn't struggle to get up...the ref did a great job and kept both counts equal so hats off to him and anybody talking shit about long counts and corruption its very disgraceful and very distasteful..hats off to both men for a very hard fought fight...both men showed alot of courage,heart just pure toughness ....love how Joe Rogan just applauds the fight and the fighters and then delivers a kick in the balls by saying but this was a controversial count ...Joe when u say when a guy gets that hurt when talking about fury ur delirious..fury wasn't hurt as bad as u say .....I'm a American and I for one have never thought any count was long or neither fighter had a advantage when it comes to the count....ref was fair and its also fair to say the ref could have stopped the fight when wilder was getting battered ...he took alot of punishment and I don't think anybody would have complained wait this day in age sorry my bad every American would have complained...I wish Americans wouldn't be so biased just because,Wilders American and furys from  the Uk so people think that we have to root for the American boxer ....I'm a true boxing fan I choose to root for who I think is the better boxer or who I like not based on where there from....I for one have said since day 1 wilder lacks boxing skills and all he has is power ....he doesn't set it up ,he just throws with bad intentions...I've said since day 1 if he would just use his jab and work behind it he would be a totally different fighter and would have a way better chance at beating fury...I've said it for yrs pure boxer vs pure puncher...boxer wins everytime because,his focus is on landing many  shots not just 1 and is prepared to go the distance at all cost ...compared to a puncher whose looking for that 1 punch and kinda has that look of like oh shit when they land that big punch and his opponent is still there ....now if wilder was like the Mike tyson of old meaning when the tyson that  fought razor rudduck realized razor can take a punch he just dished out a beating in both of his fights with Rudduck...thats what Wilders mind frame should have been ...he should have always been prepared to go the distance and just been prepared to dish out a beating ...but instead after the 1st fight with fury he acted like he was kinda lost and shocked when he couldn't keep fury on the mat
It's not 10 seconds it's a 10 count and if the other fighter doesn't stay in the neutral corner that's not furys fault.
Joe loves talking about bull shit in boxing but not in mma like the Colby vs usman fight
Tyson fury obviously better fighter no matter how hard deontay can punch he just sucks.
If what he was saying was true he’s have a point but as it stands once again he’s spreading bullshit what a shocker
Tyson looked like the Terminator getting up.
Americans standard Butt hurt taking a L three times fury destroyed wilder in every department
A 6'2" Tyson Fury never makes it into the heavy upper leagues -- this is a combo of 6'9 270 plus half-way decent boxing skills -- he does not hit hard pound-for-pound...Even his nominal power is by my count rank 10th all-time (at-best).  He gets hit a lot but is so tall when he uses his height he evades well -- at 6'2" he would be too slow too not-powerful regardless of weight.  A Mike Tyson size fighter might not ever happen again.  I think we are in the land of giants at this point.
NO way Tyson F is a great fighter, he's a good fighter. Both fighters are horrible, sloppy as heck. Joe is tripping.
Fuck yeah BUCKEYES!!! Northeast Ohio also produced  Ernie Shavers  Just sayin. Um Fury is  literally NAMED AFTER MIKE TYSON
If he got knocked out he wouldn't even get up after a 50 second count
The fat saved fury
Tyson Fury could have gotten up after 4 seconds however he took advantage of the referees count which is smart and wise
It sounds like Joe Rogan had money on Wilder lol
Joe Rogan giving Deontay all the excuses for him lmao. The count was too long gtfo you got knocked out bro
There’s no way wilder could’ve done shit if they didn’t stop the 2nd fight. He was about to get killed.
Joe 'greatest of all time' Rogan
good fight, definitely not greatest of all time tho.
Get Julio Ceaser Chaves on the podcast!!!
Great take and segment Joe Fury is a demigod in the ring and Wilder is as well... But one is better than the other.
Stop making excuses the count was fair 😂
I love this studio. It just really fits Joe
If he doesn’t have footwork by now, he never will. His trainers have failed him, that’s one of the first things you learn in boxing. My first couple of months in boxing, was just straight footwork, no punching at all.
I like joe rogan but he's talking shit about tyson fury, tyson won all 3 fights Convincingly I'm just sick of all wilder fans excuses wilder lost all 3 fights end of get over it don't make him a bad fighter just not good enough to beat big dogg fury 😝
Made it 1:08 into this video only to realize I don’t care about joe Rogan, I don’t care about his guests and I don’t care about what they are talking about.  I’ll show myself out ✌️☺️
I listened to 2 hours and 36 minutes of this podcast and did not realize they were dressed like this
His father named tyson fury because of mike tyson he was a big fan
TRUMP 2024
Wilder just knockout couch uncles then stepped up to a boxer finally!
Re counts. Time the first wilder knock down with a stop watch. From the second wilder hits the floor, ten "actual" seconds pass when the ref is only on 7 secs.  A total of 19 seconds pass before the ref let's wilder boxes on. The ref does acutlly pick up the count correctly from outside the ring at 4 secs, but then his count is slow from then on...... And adds another 9 seconds after his count before he lets boxing Continue..... Can't sling mud at Fury..... Horses for courses....
It's a ten count, not a ten second count.
The entire time fury went down he was aware looking at the ref,now if he was down and confused with eyes rolling then right there you know he’s out of it. Usually boxers quickly rest when down and use the count to their advantage.
how do grown men let rogan control a conversation ..with repeated dumbness
joe used to know more boxing refs ...back in the day
joe talks so weirdly about the match....he definitely didn't watch it
joe the dimwit realized watching boxing with friends is fun....get off the juice
Completely wrong bout the count like
Who listens to this space cadets opinion anyway? It doesn’t even look like a real space suit.
Get off it - wilder got his ass handed to him. Why talk about counts since it wouldn’t make any difference anyway. Fury is miles ahead best in the world - sorry guys but better just accept it
Please some1 tell bias joe Biden Rogan tht the 10 second count isnt a 10 second count until the fight is over. Its time to see if the fighter is capable of fighting on.
This is why I think mike tyson is the greatest boxer ever.  Any boxer if a lower weight class can't punch hard enough to beat him. And as joe says a young 21 year old tyson had both punching power head movement and footwork he truly was the full package before prison.
Joe Rogan doesn’t know the rules of boxing. The ref stops the count if a fighter isn’t in the neutral corner, and picks up where he left off once he’s back in that corner. Either way, Fury was getting back up to smash that windmill.
One guy weighed 30 pounds more. Everyone call that fair??
The count was fine. If you want to talk about letting someone recover what about when wilder came out of his corner bell goes and then ref stop wilder to check on him. At least 4-5 seconds after bell had rung.
I think your guest is referring to either dream, ONE championship or pride with the arena wide counts...I can still hear Lenne Hardt screechy  voice clearly in my head 🤣
Go read up on the rules joe Jesus Christ
Wilder sucks!!
I have seen all three Wilder / Fury fights, and two of the three Ali/Frazier fights (the first and last Ali/Frazier fights).    Both Ali/Frazier fights were better fights than any of the Wilder/Fury fights, and it's not particularly close.
Completely disagree with the count being on a LCD screen, it’s a spectacle and entertainment as well as a sport
First fight when fury got knocked down he came back and won that round lol
Many guys have more than 41 Kos in their careers Joe, especially many older boxers. What I think you ment is Wilder has the Highest ko percentage ever and that is close to being true only Edwin Valero Has a higher KO rate than Wilder. Valero himself is a crazy storyline
Well he was named Tyson after Mike Tyson dumb dumb
What about the biggest punch of the night that did not come from wilder??
2nd fight he couldnt continue they threw in the towel. He was gassed out. First fight wasnt a draw if you think this one is controversiel. Facts wilder lost all 3 fights
Finally someone with 1iota of knowledge just by watching this fight/round again, Wilder was robbed not only here but in all those fights It's like they're propping up white guys to be that "Great White Hope" shit I hope not I hope it's just the normal rigging fights go thru🙄
You guys are sooo mad that Joe is giving Wilder props😂😂❤💣❤💣💣❤💨💨💨❤💣❤💣STAY MAD.
Joe rogan looks lile dr evil
Lol. Wrong.
You calling him a liar? He said he would get up to the girl 😂
4:07 btw Tyson is named after Mike
excuses, excuses, excuses, i suppose you've got an excuse for Vietnam, and Afghanistan, and every other time you got your arse handed to you, your boy just wasn't good enough, 3 times Fury beat him, I guess you want a rematch until your guy wins, just get over yourself Joe and behave with a little dignity
It’s not a 10 second count. It’s a count of ten.
Wilders ko record is good as he fought a bunch of journeymen soon as he fought a champion he lost.
dc is one of my fav. my is getting biased day by day.
Where's Eddie and Brendan??
Lets us comment on spotify 😭!! Anyway, we need Ben Goertzel back to let us know if AI is eliminating humans soon!!
Gotti vs ward 1 2 and 3 all fights of the centuries unreal but yes this a heavy weight fight AMAZING
Americans can’t comprehend that fury is just the better man, so many excuses
Joe pulls this kind of crap whenever there is a sliver of controversy to hitch his wagon to. It’s clickbate and you’d expect better from someone who professionally announces fights. And let’s face it: Joe likes Wilder better because Wilder is hip and he needs his fans to watch his show. I highly doubt most of Fury’s fans even watch Joe. So he’s being an opportunist.
If you don't go to the neutral corner the count stops. It's a ten COUNT, not ten seconds bro. Wilder didn't so the count stopped. Fury beat the count anyway. Gotta know the rules 💯💯💯
It was not an error. It’s actually a rule. Ref can stop count to tell opponent to go to a neutral corner and then can resume counting. IT IS A RULE.
8:45 So Joe thinks Fury benefited from a longer than 10 seconds count? Yes he had a 15 seconds between hitting the canvas and the referee getting to 10 but it’s a referee count and Wilder got the same long count in the previous round so they both got longer counts. What matters is that both fighters were treated equally and both had longer counts also Fury doesn’t just get up he waits until the ref says 7-8 coz he knows it’s better for recovery to stay down. Wilder got hurt in the 3rd so did Fury twice in the 4th and Wilder got hurt again when dropped in the 10th but managed to end the round hurting Fury just to get finished in the next round. If the referee did anything wrong that was to allow both guys to recover so that they can both go to war for us the fans and also with the amount of complaining Wilder did for stoppage of the 2nd fight he got what he asked for. Great fight,both great warriors and that’s all that matters!
Totally disagree, Wilder looked great... he had a few problems but was very crisp and had great movement until against the ropes.. I would give his performance an 9 out of 10 with the only weakness is not getting the hell off the ropes but what we don't understand that Tyson's punches were earth shattering too... those body shots sometimes MAKE YOU freeze and cover up until you can recoup.
Rogan can stick up for wilder all day but he was beat 3 times by Tyson
Joe Rogan is such a smooth brained individual
pendulum swinging hard to the other side after those intense berenson/shellenberger/gupta pods lol
If wilder had backed off when Tyson went down like s gent the ref wouldn't have needed to tell him to back off and the count wouldn't have had any issues. So wilder is partly the reason that happened. I don't think it was rigged.
Tyson went in the right weight Deontay didn’t too much heavy muscle too much muscle to carry around simple.
Awesome commentary from Joe Rogan!
The count was fine. The ref counted slow for every knockdown. Fury would have just got up quicker he was fine.
What if it was the start of the round wtf does that mean??
Should have asked Jamie to check "Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. "
I feel like when the guy sees a car crash happen between a fist and a forehead he could get nervous
All 3 fights people made up shit about fury cheating, only reason for that is because his chin and ability as a boxer is unbelievable
Long counts happen sometimes, it's part of the game. Buster Douglas was down for 12-13 seconds
Deontay Wilder has no defensive skills and he flails around with his arms
Sleepy Joe 😂
Fury won all 3 fights you Americans need to get over it wilder ain't in furys league
I think I watched 3 different fights to Joe and his buddies here. Fury clearly won all 3. Yeah Joe, we get that Wilder has a hard punch but he’s 6ft6 and spends all day in the gym… if he hits most people, they’re going down. Fury is quite clearly the superior boxer and wilder can’t accept it.
hey joe, just thought you should know, mens health magazine just put you in the "Misinformation Superspreader Hall OF SHAME"
Joe Rogan cooking burgers on a George Foreman grill...*LOOK AT THAT FAT ROLL DOWN!*
Hi silly horse man. Political commentator Vaush reacted to your claims about Ivermectin. You weird little horse man.  Vaush's video: https://youtu.be/2xxxrC0Dk80
You are you’re own worst enemy , learn the rules before chatting shite - fool
If Joe Rogan would just admit that ALL FIGHTS ARE FIXED He is in on it with UFC an all of it  JOE  YOU KNOW THE TRUTH... it discredits all the other good you do when you lie and act like a coward because you are controlled by Mafia and Dana and the rest of those  schmucks
This is bullshit . It's the Refs count , there have been many instances of long counts due to fighter not returning to neutral corner . This has happened many many times . It's the Refs discretion , if he feels the fighter is safe to fight he will over look.a couple seconds , for the fight, for the sport and for the fans . It has nothing to do with error or corruption , Fury was fit to fight and won so it was the right decision.same as a ref can just call.it off at 6 if he doesn't like.the look of the fighter .Joe's a dickhead
Wth? Is he going to space or something with William Shatner dressed like that?
You don't know what your talking about.  Would have been up by 8 or 9 anyway ffs.
Hey Joe!, I'm just gonna say this once; YOU NEED TO INTERVIEW THAT P.O.S. DON LEMON.
5:37 nah after the first fight im not sure that wilder could keep fury on the canvas if he chained him to it.
Omg after second fight  everyone already know that Deontay  gonna lose it even a little bit wired that in this time he don't find any excuses
Knock out punchers can't box .  Chris Eubank ?!
" when he got dropped we all thought it was over".... Nope sorry Joe but you could see he was going to get up 😂🤣😂
One of the things that worries me about Joe is that he is terrified to be labeled a conspiracy theorist and so he sometimes dismisses (or overlooks) real and obvious conspiracies.
Are they on the moon?
You still believe these NASA snakes huh jo
The better man and fighter won but I’m so tired of people acting like that count didn’t impact the fight at all. I think Fury would have been fine as he was still coherent but the ref gave him a legit 16 seconds to get up. Yeah, Wilder wasn’t in the neutral corner but he did the same thing during he first knockdown. The ref should have instructed Wilder before he began counting. Even if you don’t get knocked unconscious getting up too quickly after a knockdown will make you dizzy. Lastly, anybody saying “it’s a ten count, not ten seconds” there’s a reason why there’s a time keeper who keeps count as well. It’s suppose to be roughly ten seconds. Even once the ref continued counting he didn’t start from where he left off.
I thought that finally, after Wilder being out boxed 3 times in a row, Wilder fans would finally drop it and stop making excuses... I underestimated the delusion.
The second knockdown was a bad count, but Fury was up before a legit 10 count anyway.
I went back and counted he's up by 9
Makes me wanna name my kid funny pants hahah
Joshua can't stand with Tyson fury or wilder
Learn the rules joe. You are wrong. Just ask big Jon m.
Fury would’ve got up no matter the count
Every one that knows Boxing knows Tyson had this in the bag before it begun.
Fury looked pissed of when he went down the result was correct and that's that wilder is done with fury he'll never beat the gypsy King
How can Joe say Wilder is one of the greatest when he lost to my boy Charlie Z??    Charlie Z knocked him out 3 times in the same fight.
fury won by a the fat he was carrying.. or more appropriately  the weight that Deontay carried...Fury never let his opponent get into a rhythm.. and placed enormous pressure on deontay.. his right never came into play.. and when it was thrown .. was telegraphed that fury was able to get a cup of tea.. and watch it go past...
With 2 steel rods in anyone's arms would increase everyone's punching power. He obviously punches extremely hard but... 2 steel rods in my opinion is akin to cheating. But damn the man can hit hard. Hats off.
Joe's head is super shiny today
"Thers not a single guy who's knocked out as many guys as wilder"!?? 🤦🏻😒 wow what a retard ufc statement
Amazes me how these Americans still think wilder is a goat wen he got smoked 3 times by a fat man
why are they all in space uniform?
How is it that Jamie doesnt' pull up the count rules while Joe is describing them.
Com on Rogan get back to UFC.we miss you
The level of ignorance and sour grapes in this is almost painful to listen to. Fury won. Twice. End of, get over it.
Joe King 🤣
“If you can teach Deontay to box, he’d be a great boxer”. -Joe Rogan
Joe 'long count' Rogan
What is Joe on about? The count was fine.
It's called a ten count, not ten seconds!
The fat rippling accross Fury's body??   it does that when he takes a step lol
I watched the infamous count back a few times and he was easily up before 10 seconds. Fury just took his time.
all i hear here is excuses for Wilder. He got beaten 3 times. if they fight 100 times, Fury will win 100 times.
You got your rules mixed up on the count bro
If it was a true 10 sec count,nobody would get up, from the second the fighter hit the canvas 10 secs would pass too quickly. It would change boxing completely for the worse. Imo...
That is not the rule Joe.
Tyson could’ve got up at any moment, was waiting for his time the hole time like they should do when getting knocked down
its not a 10 second count its a ten count
Watch the first wilder knockdown. Gets knocked down with 36s left of the third round. Ref is on a 7 count 10 seconds later
Tony, you look alot better with the facial hair. Youngstown loves ya buddy...Jimmy v!
This is why despite the boring stereotype of heavyweight boxing tyson fury is still more entertaining than mayweather. Didnt duck nobody. I hope fury will still maintain his undefeated record. But still even being there is a stain on his record hes still one of the respected greats.
Wilder was way too arrogant to learn anything new from real men! Malik is a yes sir, yes man oh ah trainer.
Oh no… not knowing how Tyson was named🤡 and saying the ref could have been panicking😬.
Lost a lot of respect for Joe after his opinion on the third fight. The fool clearly doesn't understand how counts work and the corner rule
Deontay still thinks he won the first fight, til this day!!
We watched the fight, and we were physically drained after the fight was over. This was the greatest fight I’ve ever seen.
I felt like TF pushed the envelope of danger, much more trading head shots w/ Wilder - when he didn't need to, to win (see fight II).  I didn't really understand it, unless TF simply wanted to beat AJ at his own game.
You know when Joe wears his aluminum jacket he is extra high that day.
Hey bring on more JRE Toons!!!!!
Ever watched the fight on weed man??
The ref outranks everyone, including the timekeeper. The ref guides the timekeeper not the other way round. If the standing fighter leaves the neutral corner the ref is to suspend the count and pick up from where he left off. That's the penalty for not going to the neutral corner quickly and staying there. That's how it works in boxing, which definitely isn't the sport people seem to think it is. It's not about who can punch harder, it's not a race to a 10 second knockdown. It's the art of punching to the body and head while dodging punches from your opponent. The ref is supposed to use his discretion to see if a fighter can continue and still defend themselves intelligently. You have up to 12 rounds to beat your opponent to the point they can't continue to box, or to land more clean punches on the legal target than they do on you.
Wow I thought Joe would actually be knowledgeable on this subject, have some respect for the greatest heavyweight boxer of the 21st Century.
Joe says queer street gets immediately defensive ITS NOT GAY NOTHING TO DO WITH GAY PEOPLE
Wow is joe back on YouTube?
Everyone knew Fury would win
Wtf they wearing
There used to be a guy just like Fury. His name was Jerry Cooney and he was a giant. Larry Holmes beat him like a drum. And Holmes couldn’t knock anyone out with one punch. Wilder just can’t box. Hits hard though..
aahh herer we go with the excuses again? smdh
Ref also counted slow when wilder went down - so i dont think its corruption. also, its not 10 seconds on clock, its 10 count by ref ?
Joe looks high AF in this one..
Biased towards Wilder much, Joe?
I'll believe whatever Joe says when he'll stop reading commentary from a script in UFC fights 😎
Joe, you are as wrong about the count as cnn was about you taking horse drugs… and your claims of possible corruption are extremely reckless and ignorant….. very disappointing
Perhaps give the referee a vibrating watch that counts so he can look at it and pick up the count on the right number. This also means he will be counting in true seconds and not slower. Think of it like the goal line tech & watch for the football referee's (soccer for you americans). It would be easy to implement, and have short and easy learning curves for the referee's.
People who keep saying it was one of the greatest ever heavyweight fights don't watch enough boxing. That's not to say it's bad, it was a terrific fight but quite even after round 4.
They always give the champion the benefit of the doubt bro they always do that you should know that by now bro check out Andy Ruiz vs Joshua the first fight
Wilder is shit he windmills his way to victory but not against a great boxer
count not important as fury was fine and was just awaiting the count.
Did Joe Rogan get a Strike? :(
Let's be clear. As a fighter you listen to the refs count and get up when you need to. Tyson would have got up 2/3 seconds earlier if he had to but when you get hit hard you use what time you are given.
I love Joe Rogan but why the fook would you bring some controversy about the count when you CLEARLY know that "Deontay Costa" is an excuse machine. He's probably preparing his next dumb excuse to why he lost and gonna add... well Joe Rogan agrees bss
I think PRIDE used to have that loud countdown.
The count isn't based on time
Joe Rogan I am a huge fan but just stick to talking about MMA you suck at boxing .
Learn the rules of boxing you clown Joe Rogan.
Rogan doesn't know shit about boxing.
Show more footage of what your showing on the in room screen, Jamie! FFS
Fury was not even a 100% fit and he still came back
I don’t think any of these heavyweights could hang with the Lewis, Tyson, Holyfield heavyweights in their prime.  I really think they get destroyed by the ones older then them also.
Well Wilder's new trainer got his mate beat up for 12 rounds no two ways about that. If Wilder has some sense left in him he should go back to his former trainer and thank him for stopping the fight when he did
Always making excuses because a yank lost . Every fight you make excuses. Fury was never wobbled .
There was no prolonged count. Wilder wasn't in the neutral corner. That was the reason why the referee didn't continue to count. So it's Wilder's none existing knowledge of boxing, that probably contributed to his loss. Fury just knows every aspect of the game. If he gets a "prolonged" count, he will use it to rest a little bit longer. In this fight at one point Fury even decided to go down before Wilder could deliver the knock down punch, and used the time out to recuperate. Fury never chooses to pretend, that he is the tough guy, when there's a more intelligent option to choose from. Wilder doesn't have any strategical knowledge.
well i stopped the fight and had a real clock go with the seconds, he was actually in fighting shape just as the clock hit 10 if i recall correctly, so the decision was actually amazing if you're loyal to these boxing rules, he just made it in the last not even second but fracture of a second and then won the fight, however i don't think boxing rules are any good, id much prefer that if a fighter hits the floor the match is over, saves their health and makes it more fair in my mind
The count has never been on the second. it has always been for the reff to determind if the fighter is able to continue, maybe there needs to be a conversation about uniforming it, yet I feel the more you do that kind of thing, it looses its drama.
your a hero we ride with you
Sheeesh
I feel like everybody in the UK had no doubt in Tyson. Like we are just conditioned at this point to assume he’s going to win so I never panicked
Fury wasn't at his best like the 2nd fight,Wilder ran out of gas in around round 7,the count made no difference as Fury would of got up quicker if he had too
Joe sees an Irishman crying over his mother's coffin after a natural death. Joe: he either killed her by mistake or he beat her to death in a drunken fury.
It's like guys in tennis who have a big serve. Usually the rest of their game isn't great
Robbed in the first, accused of all sorts of unproven bullshit after the second. Joe really should have chosen his words differently. Cant remember someone with his accomplishments receiving such disrespect.
Let’s just listen to a podcast of Rogan doing a Sunday service where people just listen, worship and think everything he says is gospel.
Wilder also got a long count.
The count didn’t matter. Tyson Fury was up when the ref said “6” when it was really 10 seconds. So he still was up in time.
You guys know that you are wrong about that countdown rule, right? The ref is supposed to continue from where he stopped not from where the ring side counter is, when the countdown is interrupted.
You lot are slow idc 😂😂😂. The count only start when the referee gets the other fighter in the corner. There’s a person outside the ring obviously counting right from the knockdown but it’s the referees call all the way till the end. Buster went down for long but the ref had to send Mike to his corner. And buster wasn’t even hurt just pissed off he got caught like that.
A 10 count isn't 10 seconds. its a count to 10
People can imagine what they want and make up any fairytale they please still doesn't change the fact that FURY IS THE BEST, he beat wilder 3 times in a Row. DONT FORGET THE FACT that fury had personal issues 7 weeks before this fight where he nearly lost his new born daughter in hospital and still managed to smash wilder up!!! Thankfully the baby  is healthy and well 🙏!!!  Fury the Greatest  👑
Please do you're research and do a updated video please..I love that you're honest that why I watch you, but you should also correct you're own mistake.
Then the count is retaken up from where the ref left the count until the standing boxer follows his direction.
Sorry Joe, I really like you..love from England. But you're wrong on the slow count. The ref is to stop the count if the standing boxer leaves his neutral corner. It is not to be pick up by the ring side in this event.the count is stop in boxing.
Joe Rogan you have a few things to learn about boxing. Educate yourself before you wreck yourself.🥊
No ,there was no count problem, Fury was good and outskilled wilder and ko him
Fury still would have pummelled him if it was a 5 second count..
Joe Stop Crying like a bitch THE GYPSY KING IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIMES
Tim hasnt realized that the show he did became this popular success comes sometimes later
Shut it Rogan you quilt you haven't got a clue
If Wilder had won on points. Would there have been a 4th fight?
Fuck Is joe wearing?
Deontay couldnt KO Charlie Z. Went to the cards.
That count was too long for everyone with seeing eyes. Had it been done correctly, Fury would've been waived out and Deontay would've won. That simple.
Tyson furys family heritage in boxing and bare knuckle is real just look up bartley gorman
Jesus, could you imagine reffing that fight!?
I don't think the count had no impact on that fight. Does Joe have a lot to say about Brian getting an extra MINUTE in a title fight in mma?
There are no odds, he comes from an Irish Traveller family who know nothing But boxing. His dad named him after Mike Tyson.
As for Wilder, it's cause and effect... why does he have to work on footwork and technicalities when he knows it takes a split second to switch someone's lights off with one right hand. 🤷‍♂️ It's worked for everyone else apart from when he's faced one of the greatest heavyweights of all time.
When Mike Tyson knocked down Buster Douglas the referee started the count late while the ringside count was already at 3 and gave Douglas extra time to get up.
Joe is talking so much non-sense in this clip.
Lets get the douchiest and lamest comedian with me to discuss this epic fight
We see skills + a few inch more makes you invicible....
Joe Rogan: if you could go into space, you would be an astronaut
Why is Joe Rogan acting like he don't know how boxing is officiated there is no sometimes they count fast sometimes they count slow what's wrong with you dude 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
‼️‼️‼️No sir he does not keep the count going he keeps the count where the ref stops at to address the other fighter and the ref picks up at the count he stopped at it does not continue on ‼️‼️‼️‼️
What’s up with the stupid costumes?
Tyson ain’t his first name.  It’s his 2nd name.
Joe rollllllin off that sativa

This fight was extremely entertaining. If you watched live you saw wilder come out aggressive and drop Tyson. I thought aww shit wilder did it! Then Fury got to work
"maybe it was for his health his corner stopped it in the second fight" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Joe is backwards
We have a saying in the uk called “clutching at straws” that’s what I’m hearing
6 degrees of seperation. Starts at Tom Green
Do they wear space suits just to make sure everyone knows Joe doesn't respect Redban?
He reminds me this baker from that Baltimore cakes show back in the day with that Duff dude.
Holy fuck Joe common! Why is Joe's judgement very questionable lately
Joe you are man to man ! Deontay almost wins Tyson is cheater
You can tell Rogan is not very bright.
5:00 he messed up the names 𝔥𝔢𝔥𝔢
Me and my buddies drunk as hell watching Volk vs Ortega were screaming
How embarrassing for Joe. He should have looked up the rules of what the 10 count is.  End of the day the count is meant to establish if a fighter can continue. Fury was clearly able to continue lol people who wanted him counted out are cowards.
why they all wearing astro suits
“Drew him into dangerous waters filled with 🐊 “🤣
Wilder has way to many excuses.
Fury #1 Bitches.
There is a slight mistake in the rules interpretation. When a person is knocked down, the time keeper starts the count while the ref sends the other fighter to a neutral corner. That part was correct. If the standing fighter strays from the neutral corner (like Wilder did) the ref will  pause the count as a punishment/deterrent for wandering from the neutral corner.  This also assumes Fury wouldn't have otherwise gotten up. He looked aware and wanted to take his time.   The lesson: stay in the neutral corner.
6:17 what Joe said here is literally false and a straight up lie to support DC the jealous racist black man who can't handle his "brother" getting KO'd by a white man. Time the counts yourself. He was up within 10 seconds :) Stay mad, bum ass joggers.
joe rogan fell off hard. he knows nothing about combat sports. think he hit menopause
At the end of the day Tyson is the better boxer.
Enough with the long count bullsh*t Tyson was looking at the ref and watching him count with all his faculties. Listen, no count is going to be EXACTLY right anyway so chill with all the nit picking
Feel like whoever this guy is is one of those people that just agree with you all the time "yeah yeah"
"boom boom"  Oh
He has a power overhand right.nothin else that is it
Joe.  What fight were you watching?   Fury wasn't out of it lol. Boy you are terrible at this job.   The count starts when the fighter is in the correct neutral corner....not a 10 second count lol.  And not by a person outside the ring duh.  Study your content
Tyson benefited from that long count but he was clearly awake already. Tyson just kept down to rest.
Guys. This was not an all time great fight.  It was a one sided beat down
Jesus joe you talk about the 10 count as if the referee didn’t count exactly the same for wilder, and you don’t talk about how every time fury wrapped wilder up the ref immediately broke them apart, but every time wilder wrapped fury up the ref would wait a solid 5-10 seconds before breaking them up.
Joe's talking horseshit about the significance of a long count for Fury. After the first knockdown of Wilder, the ref gave Wilder an age to recover whilst checking if he was fit to continue.  Fury gained no net advantage whatsoever from counts!  That, and the doctor gave Wilder a considerable amount of extra time to recover between two of the rounds whilst checking on him.  (All that said, I though that the ref did very well over that fight.)
why are you still on about it ffs wilder got his ass kicked
lol you nothing about boxing what so ever
you have the time keeper at the side of the ring an it's not a ten second count ffs
BS Fury was up in 8 seconds
my God he out boxed wilder is dosser an Fury has called Joshua out now ,it's a ten count not a ten second count please
I saw Dr. Evil....And Scott- :) Zip it, zip....
Love Rogan buy he's high as fuck here. Completely wrong about the count and to be honest the fight in general was OH KAY. So much hugging and grabbing and Wilder made Fury look great because Wilder really is a bad boxer without his power.
Fury deflected punches by reflex that skill is rare
Slow count debunked…..https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
The Fight was a fix dislike 👎 if you disagree 🤔
He’s the lobster guy
They don't start the count till the other fighters in a neutral corner when there's a knockdown
All I heard here is "Deontay this, Deontay that". Give Fury the credit he deserves! Not one word on how great a performance Tyson put on, 3 TIMES!
Ref was consistent with count for both fighters. Plus it was arguably a rabbit punch that dropped Fury, and if ref stopped it we would be talking about wilder winning with an illegal punch…

The count should be like an old school arcade game when you lose and need to insert a quarter to continue.
I wonder if the Gypsy King likes "dags".
You’re just wrong Rogan. You’re living in your favourite place. The cannabis fuelled place where everything you think is sweet, where everyone agrees, where narcissism is sweet & pure & true. You know WHAT for a fact? That you’re successful & stoned perpetually?  The rules of boxing dictate that you MUST be in a neutral corner for the count to continue. It must definitely does not go on, it STOPS!!! Nothing corrupt wrong or wrong there except your understanding. But your understanding is that you’re hugely successful & can do whatever you want…………but the rules are clear; just read them!!!! And then smoke & renounce your”corrupt” insinuations please 🙏
The referee's intuition IS.PART.OF.THE.FIGHT.
I still think a lot of fighters in the Lewis era would beat them both.  There was about 30 good heavyweights in those days.
Wilder's record is like Celtic in Scotland.  They have a better win to loss record than Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid, because they face rubbish every week.
I know people talk about all Wilder's KO numbers but who has he beat?  Nobody.  An aging Ortiz is the only guy he's faced who can box and he almost beat Wilder.  Had him in big trouble. Wilder got saved by the bell
The Ref got it right.  Its not a ten second.  Once he had to stop his count because of the other fighter he was supposed to start where he was at.  He actually did his job.  All this wouldn't matter because Fury was alert, if the Ref counted faster he would have simply gotten up faster.  Zero impact on the fight.  Fury beat Wilder.  Wilder is a sore loser.  Period.
Great podcast but wrong about the count. Check the rules !!
The right man won.   The only foul play in that fight was the doctor coming in to give wilder time to recover.  The doctor waited until the next round starts to intervene..  in boxing the doctor comes in between rounds.  Clearly not right
Ole horse worm Rogan
Joe: "Most human being are going out with that punch"  Me: No Joe, most human being are fucking dead
are we ignoring the rule that if Wilder was not in the instructed corner the ref will stop the count until he gets in the corner?
Why are all of these “so called” experts saying that this was a great fight???!!! Weary Wilder ONLY had two (2) moments and they were both in the 4th round!!! Totally one sided and the ONLY greatness displayed was from Fury!!!
Joe i think the key difference is Tyson fury is a Gypsy and has Gypsy blood and they have been fighting bare knuckle all there lives all disputes are handled with fists, i believe that is the only reason tyson fury could take punches from a man with power like deontay wilder, gypsys have a steel chin watch there fights and see for yourself you cant knock them out !
SUE CNN DON LEMON AND GUPTA FOR LYING TO YOU AND THE WHOLE WORLD!
*** Joe Rogan is incorrect, as a former boxer I have seen this happen many times. First off, the referee may halt the count at any time to make sure the fighter scoring the knockdown went to a neutral corner. "Dempsey/Tunney long count"..  Number 2, the count is not 10 seconds, its the ref's count of 10. Most 10 counts in boxing through out the last 100 years are around 14-15 seconds, boxing referee's do count at slightly different speeds. But it's never been a clocked 10 second count. Ali/Liston 2, Tyson/Douglas all had funny counts, the only thing that the fallen fighter can do is listen to count from the 3rd man in the ring. Many fighters may have gotten up faster had the count be faster. Seasoned pro fighters are trained to take a knee and rise at 8 1/2 so your on your feet at 9. Most Refs today take additional time closely examining the fighter upon rising post 10 count., They ask questions, name? What month is it? Do u want to continue? They also ask for lateral steps to either the right of left to assess gait to look for instability which could mean a concussion. Nothing is more important than making sure a fighter has all his facilities when your turn loose against a trained killer who is looking to put him away. I like the idea that they don't rush the counts. Marciano/Walcott 2 had a situation where Walcott got dropped in the first round by a weak punch and rose at 9 1/2 being perfectly fine and got counted out. The fans where furious, similar to Tyson/Carl Williams. Refs should give a fighter every chance to continue after a knockdown early in a fight, particularly when they can defend themselves.
Joe it's over.
This single fight or trilogy was single  handily better then Floyd Mayweathers entire career. What Manny Paquaio vs Mayweather should have been even if Floyd lost.
Tyson fury adapted kungfu 🐼. He lean on wilder. Drag him deeper sink him. Exhausted wilder. And executed him one and for all. This how awesome is Tyson fury. With those fat actually is a weapon.
The ref Russell Mora interrupted his count correctly because Wilder was walking around and hadn't gone to the neutral corner as instructed. As MMA Referee John McCarthy pointed out Mora was only observing the Unified Rules of Boxing which state after a knockdown keep an eye on the standing boxer and make sure he stays in the neutral corner, if he doesn't stop the count put him back into the neutral corner and resume the count. Fury beat the count anyway.

Its not seconds, it's a count...York and New Jersey boxing commissions, a knockout is not necessarily 10 seconds, but rather a count of 10
Lmao. That was a ugly ass fight. Joe really says sum dumb shit sometimes
Joe aren't you a brilliant lad? May be you should learn boxing rules first before knowing that was a false out. Questioning someone's professionalism. Do you even think how it effects the referee's career? Just making absolute non-sense comment without doing adequate research. This isn't MMA, this is boxing.
As far as technique it was ugly. As far as drama it was great
No matter what the count. Tyson was well aware and taking advantage of the count. No matter where that count would have been, Tyson would have gotten up.
Joe desperately tries to drum up controversy. There isn’t any
Joe a bit bias here but okay.
"When Kim and Kanye got divorced" 😂😂 Oh boy they ripped him a new one😂
Tyson won all 3 fights
Rogan talking like Wilder didn't get smashed to pieces in 9 out of 11 rounds
Wilder was awful ok joe 1 good punch that's all he has in the bag
Tyson fury can damn sure take a punch! Not many guys could handle that hit! Fury is the best!! Heavyweight in history
Rad outfit Joe.
One thing, Tony doesn't know boxing all that well on account of call Iron Mike "one of the goats". Now Tyson is in my personal top-five Heavyweights of all time but I don't know that much before the Ali/Foreman era. But ask anyone who knows boxing and Mike Tyson is not even in the top 10 all time heavyweights
Joe, disgusted that Jamie doesn't yell at his 📺
brian's joe king joke was underrated
It's not a 10 second count, it's a 10 count. The number of seconds that pass are entirely irrelevant. Don't like boxing rules, change them.
He needs a new switcher
Joe needs to learn the rules of boxing. The ref HAS to wait till the boxer goes to the neutral corner to start the count. The ref followed the rules.
How good do you think a Ju hit Su guy would do against a giant like Tyson Fury
Joe “that is crazy” Rogan
Regarding the count in R4…yes Ref messed up one way or the “other” however Fury also responds to the count. He would’ve moved faster if needed imho. This fight, Fury said he was never dazed and heard the entire count unlike before where…he came back from the dead. EDIT: just rewatched R4…ref messed up but Fury still up on natural 8 count
“The Resurrection” is THE MOST INSANE COMEBACK in all of boxing and arguably all of sport’s comebacks.
What’s up with Joe’s Jacket?? Wow
Where the fuck these guys off to the moon ...
In this suit Rogan looks like Humpty Dumpty from Puss in Boots.
Fury used his body as a punch. He would throw a one/two then his body would come afterwards. It was a great strategy for 277 pounds. There's no way Wilder would've lasted 12 rounds being 40 pounds lighter and not as skilled.
Wilder new he had to go to a neutral corner but stood there bathing in his accomplishment
Sorry bro boxing is corrupt but........ Tyson is the man
There was no need for the ref to count anyway Tyson got pushed down both times it’s not like he was knocked clean out like Wilder was
Joe thinks he knows boxing. His knowledge is basic at best.
Those aren't the unified boxing rules - the count was up to code.
Joe is delusional if he thinks it mattered at all
Upset about the count. The ref counted the same for both. Difference is wilder didn't follow instructions and went to his corner instead of a neutral. Plus fury was ready either way.
Boxing is dead tho…. Rogan 10 years ago lol
Wilder had not had a good fight until fury and he lost all 3.
Joe Rogan why should Wilder be an exception to the rule of going to your corner after you knock your opponent down ? I dont give a shit if the count went to 5 instead of 10 !! no way in he'll Fury would've not beat the count period ! he was fully coherent and watching the ref ! FURY HAS BEAT HIM ALL 3 TIMES ON THE REAL
Why are they in space suits?
Wilder still my favorite heavyweight boxer 💣
Fury would have got up when he knew the count was coming to an end regardless. He was fine. No fault on either part. The count is the referees discretion
Joe "Theres probably only 2 other humans who lived that hit so hard" Rogan
Speaking of Athletes... get Bjergsen on here - esports legend
Very disappointing from Joe Rogan to focus on Wilder when Tyson Fury absolutely destroyed him.
Yes his name is awesome
Who's ever seen tony birdcliffe be funny
Joe you almost always have good takes, but damn get your boxing facts straight
They're wearing space suits.....
It’s a 10 count, not 10 seconds. Plus it’s on the refs count since even if I get up on time he can decide to still call it off
It's not a 10 second count it's a 10 count. Varies and happens consistently.
He may be wrong about how counting works in boxing, but that just reflects how the average person probably doesn't know either. A uniform timer would be an interesting change.  My perspective is that the count is meant to protect the fighters from taking unessesary damage in a lost fight. It's not meant to sneak in a win because your opponent took 1 extra second to get in stance.
There's never a perfect count in boxing. Ever. Get over it fury is the better man  Let's move on
all I want to see is Usyk vs Fury, everyone else is irrelevant
Wilder would have been a sparring partner in the 70's and 80's.  your only as good as the competition, and there ain't much out there to worry about.
You dummy’s need to learn about the long count and how prevalent it is. 25 seconds for wilder in the same fight. No one talking about that cuz he got crushed.
Joe the count was fucked up because furry went down at 17 seconds an got up at 2 seconds that’s a total of 15 seconds
Joe, it is a 10 count, not a 10 second count. Also, the count can only be started once the opposing fighter is in their neutral corner which Wilder was not. Fury did get long count, which was caused by Wilder, but Fury was cleared headed and in no danger. It is a none issue.
He was named after mike Tyson apparently
“The level of skill was so evident.” What are you talking about man. These lumbering palookas wouldn’t have even got a title shot in the 80s or 90s.
One of the most repetitive things on this podcast…Joe going on a Wilder nut-riding campaign saying “HE HITS SO HARD” over and over again after every one of Wilder’s fights. The only thing more repetitive might be Brendan Schaub saying “good dude, real good dude” after Joe brings up anyones name on the planet. He’s 6’7 and built like a brick shithouse…It’s pretty obvious any normal person would be unconscious after being hit by him.
He would've got up at 8 regardless of how fast or slow it was.
That's why they need to tie his one arm behind his back and let him catch a chicken just like Rocky did
I just don't watch you now that you don't post full videos  on YouTube  glad you made 100 million  though wish you would of kept your core and fought  a bit like some other content  creators instead  of getting  a cut and stepping to the side . Not mad  you made money  mad you left people  like me behind  after you got the money
Wilder got given just as many chances to get up and recover. And does anyone remember the bullshit the ref did in Wilder vs Ortiz first fight like get get over it.
How is it that you STILL can't watch your podcasts on smart tv's?? Been like a year. I listen to half as many now because I used to watch them on my TV, I'm sure I'm not the only one. Typical Spotify woke corporate...take something they're not a fan of because it makes them money, and completely fuck it up.
The count doesn’t start till the fighter is in the neutral corner !!!!!!!
The referee slow count is bollocks anyway , fury would of got up at 8 count whenever it came because it’s clever to use that time to recover , you don’t get up  at 5 or 6 you get up at 8 ! Grasping for excuses
Pooor Jamie, bet he wasn’t invited to watch it with them.
Guys stop acting like Fury was knocked out cold, he was looking directly at the ref the entire time, you use all the time you get given, Fury could of and would have gotten up earlier whether the ref stopped counting or not. Wilder got slept excuses after excuses.
It's been a while, what's up with the astronaut suits?   I wish Wilder would take someone like Roy Jones Jr. up on being trained. I don't think he's ever going to learn and polish his boxing like Fury's is, but maybe with some unorthodox boxing or even just learning to fight off his back foot can change the character of the fight enough.
why are still counting time?  start an actual clock.
When Joe Biden pulled out of Afghanistan I screamed and threw the TV brick at the television
If wilder could move and box like Tyson Fury he would be a top level boxer, the b/s that this guy talks 😂😂
Joe knows nothing about boxing its not 10 sec count its count to ten
Why are they wearing NASA gear?
15 minutes of praising Wilder.
Does all the comments that contradict your " opinion" make you feel silly Joe ?
Stick to MMA wtf was he talking about lmao the only way you can say this was one of the best fights of all time is if it's the only fight you've ever seen
Somebody please teach Joe Rogan the Unified rules of boxing
just... Rogan is the best at what he does but, he just doesn't know boxing like he does MMA. Sir its a ten count... not a ten second count.
Dude his parents named him that intentionally after Mike Tyson calm down
Tyson Fury has one of the greatest chins in boxing history as well not to mention his skill
My heart was pounding!!!!!!!
All joe says is “probably” “could have” “might” “possibly” “maybe” “one of the greatest fights of all time” (every fight he talks about)
I'd never wanna do anything masculine with Tony... Such as watching a fight
They talk like Tyson being hit hurt him course it hurt him! Makes me laugh how they go as if this is breaking news him being hurt!
The count is legitimate. Joe should read the rules before spouting nonsense.
Here’s the deal, the ref cheated with that long count and he knew it. White America will never admit that. With all of that being said, Fury was clearly the better fighter. Had deontay not gotten that lucky punch, the end was inevitable.
He would’ve still got up. He wasn’t even down from the knockdown he was on all fours. And they’re supposed to start counting where they left off.
Watched that fight a few times over and still don't see it. It's like people saying McGregor pushed Mayweather, wilder caught fury, fury turned it on. Same fight as the 2nd one, beat down on a beat down. Wilder hung in but it's not even top 10 greatest fights of all time, might be top 10 HW.
The fat roll after-shock will be a lasting image and tribute to Wilder's spectacular power.
Joe is correct, but… the length of each count on BOTH fighters 2nd knockdown was 11 to 12 seconds  Here’s a video breakdown  https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
This pod was pretty blah The energy was low throughout
Joe, where is the Triceratops trophy? Hang em up into your Studio :-)
Tyson strategy was tire him by holding and leaning on Wilder.  Very smart and to put on weight to take those power punches.  Wilder not agile and can’t get out the way.
Pro boxers often deliberately don't get up until the ref counts to 8 even if they are 100% aware and feel ready because it buys them extra time to recover and is a very obvious and well known tactic..Fury was 100% aware of what was going on within one or two seconds of his knockdown.. watch Leonard vs Hearns 2 (it's a great fight btw) and see Sugar Ray employ same tactic when he's knocked down..its very very easy to understand as is the total and utter BS of "glove gate" anyone that's even half genuinely interested in boxing knows how dumb these allegations are and we're and just underlines what an utter dosser Wilder is..HE KNOWS IT TOO and is not only a liar but a narcissistic sore loser
Tyson will be one of the greatest once he clears a few more fighters..  Dillian whyte - not the best but still can Bang Anthony Joshua - needs to just get it out the way Usyk  Not a Joshua fan by any means but his resume is more stacked than tysons, his only credible wins have been from klitchscho and wilder barring them he's fought no one of credibility.
Wilder is right hand crazy he knows if he lands solid with his eraser that's it. Problem is every opponent knows that is his game he needs to work on footwork ballet and good lord put some meat on them giraffe legs.
Joe Rogan: One of the greatest fights of all time *gaining credibility....* One of the greatest boxing matches of all time *oooooh, so close...*
So, Roberto Duran had many more knockouts, so that's not true about Wilder..
Stick to mma joe p.s im not a hater l like joe rogan just the ref stuff i couldnt listen to
Joe’s chatting shit really it wasn’t that slow and if he counted faster fury would have just got up quicker he was fine
1927 Dempsey vs Tunney  A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner. Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover. Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee's count of 9.
Listening to Joe talk about boxing is like listening to a trainwreck for 15 minutes. Good lord
The video analyzes the count of the referee in knock down  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k
Joe Rogan doesn't know shit about boxing
This is a copy and paste of the rules, I hope Rogan comes out and admits he was wrong about the count. It's amazing that someone as knowledgeable as him can get the rules wrong and spead this false information. Anyways these are the count rules..... 4.) KNOCKDOWN, KNOCKOUT AND COUNT  4.1.         A boxer shall be considered “down” when, as a result of a legal blow as ruled by the referee, who is the only person authorized to determine this, any part of their body other than their feet are on the canvas, or if they are hanging helplessly over the ropes, or if they are still rising from the down position and not standing upright.  4.2.         The Mandatory Eight (8) Count after knockdowns will be standard procedure in all World Boxing Federation championship contests. There is no Standing Eight (8) Count; there is no Three (3) Knockdown Rule. If in the referees’ judgement the knockdowns have been indecisive and clearly with no injurious effect upon the boxer, the contest may be continued but with good sense and judgement and the boxers’ welfare always paramount.  4.3.         When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall audibly announce the count as he motions with his right arm downward indicating the end of each sound of the count. If the boxer taking the count is still down when the referee calls the count of ten (10), the referee shall wave both arms indicating that the boxer has been knocked out.  4.4.         When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers.  4.5.         A boxer shall receive a twenty (20) second count if the boxer is knocked out of the ring and onto the floor. The boxer is to be unassisted by spectators or his/her seconds. If assisted by anyone, the boxer may lose points or be disqualified with such a decision being within the sole discretion of the referee.  4.6.         A boxer who has been knocked down cannot be saved by the bell in any round. If a boxer is down and the round has terminated, the referee shall continue the count until the boxer rises or is counted out. If a boxer fails to rise before the count of ten (10), he shall be declared the loser by knockout in the round just concluded.
You  need to talk  to  JJ Benitez  Spain ufo researcher
Joe wrong about the rule
Wilder is a one trick pony show his right hand! Bulking up muscle like he did was the wrongmove because you  use more oxygen with muscle which then drains you faster.He can't box or use his feet.Throws his punches  all wrong and he took  on Fury in the first fight thinking big ex champion name was out of shape with a few years ring rust AND STILL LOST that  fight.2rd fight that I always tell people"The winner of the 1st will win harder and faster"  which happen.The 3rd fightwas well Wilder had to go into a court for him to fight.That was one hell of a fight and  it was a long count or slow one was the only time he could have a chance of winning
This vid explains the rules. https://youtu.be/P8wa9GZY3TY
This explains that both boxers got the same counts.   https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
How does a fight fan like Rogan not know that in Boxing,a 10 count has nothing to do with 10 seconds acc to the rules  that its is only on the ref....and he keeps repeating his misinformation, even as an expert in the field and some idiots will believe Rogan now...bcs he is the"expert"!
10:20 They threw the towel in the second fight cos he had no chance of winning. He could’ve probably gone on but there was a very low chance for him to win that. This fight he went on and got knocked out anyway.
Fury was nowhere near as hurt as the first fight. The ref took forever with Wilder too.
Bunch of space cadets in their NASA jackets
If you watched the fight fury was clearly watching the ref count. He was waiting. The guy is a smart boxer. He would have gotten up at the same point  in the count whether it was fast or long..fury also rolled his ankle in the third round. So he pretty much had a bum ankle for rest of fight. That being said. Wilder’s corner should be banned from boxing. Dude broke his hand and they knew it. The red knew it, the doctor knew it, the announcers knew it, and the people watching knew it.
Deontay Wider is an excuse machine..good riddance!
Joe needs to learn the rules
I think he just lost his legs
Well, according to Breland, Deontay is untrainable. He has a team of yes men. He's a one trick pony. The guy doesn't even throw a proper jab.
Watching it back I don’t think the count was slow. Everyone knows you say one Mississippi alligator, two Mississippi alligator, etc. everyone knows that since you’re a kid. Problem solved.
Joe, no is not. I’m disagree! I was not impress with the boxers. No really good boxing.
Well actually the rules state that its not an actual 10 second count. The ref is supposed to count slow and clear and the timekeeper only starts the count if the ref hasn't done so already. The ref picks up the count from the timekeeper and if the ref has to get a fighter back in the corner he stops the count to do so and resumes the count after the fighter is in place. Wilder should've known that and it wouldn't have been a "long" count.
its a lot of guys with more ko's
Goddammit, Jamie, u didn’t show the clip of the actual hit. Fuckin blue ballin me over here. Lol
Can you bring svante pabo on?
So tow second made Tyson win ???? Bs Tyson the best he beat him 2 fights and. Now he win by tow second 🤥 Tyson got knocked out many times but he always back because he’s healthy no alcohol
Joe just talks some shite
Joe looks like mini me lol
Lol, " when he got dropped we all thought it was over."  No Joe, most people in the world could see that Wilder was dead and just winging haymakers desperately. At no point when fury was down did anyone think he wouldn't get up.
Rocky Marciano had 43 Kos and no losses
Can we all please remember how much of a robbery the first fight was? Every world-class boxer and commentator thought Fury won easily. That’s a much bigger robbery then a slow damn count.
Who hits harder, Ngannou or Wilder?
Smh 🤦‍♂️, The 10 Count has never been 10 seconds in time ??? Time ten counts from fights and it’s not really a time thing ???   It’s a Refs decision to call a fight, like a ko or tko, why not give them all 10 counts, but some just stop the count, even when fighters are on their feet ???   You get your bell rung, and you’re gonna feel it for over 10 seconds, question is can you continue, most people COULDNT even stand these shots and the ones who do, have trouble rationalizing their own names ???   If he counted faster in a fight like this, you would all be crying it got stopped to soon ??? Sum fights called to late and others not at all, that should have ???   The count as it is at the refs discretion gives all fighters a fighting chance, you technicalize that,  you change the sport, and the rules, where fights are ruled by technicalities, that turn all fights lost into excuses, and not on abilities ???   Refs judge by a fighters safety, of a deadly sport,   O’ and the Space Suits Are Cool, can’t wait until Earth suits trend, everyone will be wearing the SUIT THATS TIED 2 Technology and make you all more environmentally friendly to others and the world 🌎???   Putting the mans kinds into the machines, every body is Gonna get a super suit ??? IT WILL BE FOR EVERYONES SAFETY, just watch and see ???   On screen display activated ???
Also that slow count nonsense is another tired excuse and is really quite pathetic. Here’s a video for the slow to check it out.  https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Joe needs to stop the DMT
In Boxing its known that the referee is in charge of the fight..Thats it..The referee has the decision on the match ultimately..  The boxers are following the referee..Not otherwise..
No sober October this year for Joe?
Damn Joe is high as a kite 🤷‍♂️😂😂😂
With a name like Tyson Fury he was left with two options career wise. He could’ve either been a heavy weight boxing champion, or the secret identity of a marvel comics action hero.
1st knockdown 6 secs 2nd knockdown 9 secs count it !!
Just shows how much these know about boxing when they say it was a long count 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Or Tyson fury likes taking the entire 9 and half seconds to get up. Regardless of how fast or slow the count is, he will get up in time.
The guest does not have a clue on boxing.
It's a ten count, not 10 seconds
Amazing fight
Tyson ain't taking that from Ngannou
The Fury bots in this comment section lol
As ever Joe makes perfecy sense buut its hard to believe with a shorter count wilder would have KO'd Fury a third time. The 2nd knock down was with about 1 or 2 sec left so its not like wilder would have enough time to do anything. (3 secs max)
I know how you make him not have any power. Heavy weight training before his sparing.  His arms are heavy and sluggish. It will be like turning down the volume
joe "dr evil from austin powers" rogan 🤏
Tyson could've got up at any time, he wasn't hurt, he just waited until 7/8, he knows the game and is the best player of the game
Fury was watching the count taking his time, he has 10 to get up so may aswell use the whole 10 , also a man of his size takes longer than a lightweight getting up so surely they should havw different count times
maricano 43 KO out of 49 fights. 49 wins...
I love Tony not having a single clue Tyson Fury was actually named after Mike Tyson lol
Wilder has won 5 rounds of 33 vs Fury…
Lol fury wasn’t knocked out, he was totally there and was waiting till the 8 count to get up, also the ref has to stop when the other fighter isn’t back in his corner. Plus the count wasn’t abnormally slow. People just love to make bs up
Cmon now Joe put down that joint🌬 research before you let the spliff talk for you
His name being Tyson is not crazy, his father specifically named him after Mike Tyson and trained him as a boxer since he was a toddler.
Idk but the past few weeks of JRE is just been   “COVID COVID COVID” almost every episode Joe rambles about it for an hour, like this episode
The only Trilogy where one fighter won 3-0. Wilder is good Joe, Fury is Great.
“His whole family is into fighting” is just about the greatest understatement ever for a gypsy bare knuckle fighting dynasty that goes back 300 years.
I also noticed the lack of the ref continuing to count there was a moment where the ref had counted to 10 and Tyson had gotten up but wouldn’t face ref which to me was bullshit because he had already been warned
Redban laughing at "queer street" smh how are you 47 and do you not know that is a figure of speech?
theres a difference between talent and skill
Why are they showing joe rogan'a face and not the screen? 12:19
Always fun to see Tony on JRE… zero athletic ability yet talks with absolute authority on all this sports. *coug..dunning Kruger cough
Everybody saying that Fury was alert and would have gotten up regardless are missing a seperate issue: it still helps to have that extra rest during a slow count. Even just a couple extra seconds helps you collect your thoughts like Joe says. I'm no expert but I believe Joe that even 1 second can make a huge difference. Could mean the world stops spinning for you. Wilder might have attacked him again and knocked out fury had fury not gotten that bonus rest. Speculative but possible. We'll never know.
“What are the odds of being called Tyson Fury”  It didn’t get pulled out of a hat at random btw. His dad named him Tyson after Mike Tyson.
Rogan is king fence sitter. Always finding a way to praise a guy yet slight him at the same time, he did the same thing with fury after the first fight
https://youtu.be/KFuFqA4CG78 triceratops 😆
Joe forgot about Furys ability to keep on getting up.  Tis the stubborn Irish in him
He was named after Mike Tyson! Ha
Cenk is the greatest boxer and fighter😂🙈
Reading these comments, both wilder and fury Fans are fucking delusional 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please understand the rules of boxing before making such ignorant statements.
Wilder  can't  accept being  defeated  .
JOE ROGAN LOOK INTO WHATS GOING ON WITH BRANDON GOODWIN FROM THE ATLANTA HAWKS , IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR YOU TO GET HIM UP HERE
And this is why Joe is wrong about everything this shows you he really doesn’t know anything about boxing the fact he thinks fury could have lost because the ref stopped counting for two seconds seriously he was up before he got to 5
It was a normal count dc doesn't have a clue what he's talking about that was fake news from a wilder fanboy
See I think Fury's second knock down where according to Joe he took a clubbing right hook behind the ear, I think he wasn't hit that hard, he was pulled off balance and being the experienced and talented boxer that he obviously is he thought 'I've lost this round anyway cos of the 1st 8 count, i'll take a second standing 8 just to get some breathing space'
Crazy that joe is apparently an expert on fighting sports but still doesnt know that boxing is a 10 count not a 10 second count
Why are they wearing flight suits??? Did I miss something
Joe Rogan is def carrying the conversation. The other dude just saying filler words lol
Listening to these men talk about boxing is like listening to my wife talk about the NFL.
Why are they wearing space suits as if they’re about to take off in a space ship??
Rogan gets excited sometimes and says stuff like Wilder has the most ko's ever in boxing  ...  Sugar Ray Robinson had 109 ko's  lol.  Mike Tyson 44   lol.  Remember Joe Rogan blowing hot air up Ronda Rousey's ass for a couple years.  HAHAHA.  Yea little Joey gets excited and says dumb stuff every so often.
Remember A.Smith and MMA?  Well, lately seeing the same thing with MMA guys commenting on boxing.  He is a good referee and everything was by the rules. Taking up ringside count is at the beginning, if the referee has to stop the count after it started because the other fighter is not in the corner or otherwise interrupts, than it is paused and resumed, no ringside keeping.  0 controversy there.  IMHO after a couple of years and without recency bias I highly doubt this will be considered the best heavyweight fight ever. It had drama and was a spectacle, but not the first or the last, while technically not impressive at all, with TF not being at it's best, and DW while possibly at his best still a bad boxer. Usyk-AJ is for me a better fight, though it would be even better if AJ was not so lost in the ring. But we have seen a great technician at work, this was a slugfest. Even if TF did show skill, he had much better performances in the past.
Rogan is so ignorant re boxing count lol
Joe was just gutted that he couldn't interview Wilder whilst he was on the way to hit the canvas
Wilder is a great boxer, he just ran into an all time great
Stick to mma lads ffs
Tyson Fury is named after Iron Mike. The Fury’s have always been a fighting family.
Cmon Joe who are we kidding the old referees you knew back in the day are still around today just like the judges. All those worthless bitches are old  and corrupt as shit. Can't stand how everyone talks about how hard of a job that is................
boxing version of taking a knee...second knockdown was initiated by fury to get his shit together
wilder had the longest count of the fight you noobs
The ref counted super slow even when Wilder was knocked down, so they both had the same treatment.
Joe "Watch the fat ripple down" Rogan
OK, I just went back and timed Wilders first knockdown by Fury. From canvas to the ref saying “fight” Wilder got 20 seconds. Then watch Fury’s two knockdowns at the hand of Wilder.. 20 seconds. Now watch Wilder’s second knockdown. 20 seconds. Go see for yourselves. The fake need a doctor in the ring request for Wilder.bought him 20 seconds+
Joe stick to every other sport but boxing, Tyson was always getting up even after being dropped twice in the same round, both knock downs were no where near as powerful as the first fight knockdown.
Fuck the excuses, Tyson beat on him for 10 rounds, Wilder won 1 round that entire fight, he has had 3 chances to beat Tyson failed every time.
fucking divas
Jo's wrong on Wilders record, most were top 50 top 100 outside boxing rankings and hand picked, his legacy is fraudulent
"There's not a single guy that's knocked out as many guys as Deontay Wilder has"  Erm....
How could you do this to a poor triceratops Joe ! 🤣🤣🤣
Tyson killed it 🇬🇧
When tyson got dropped i knew he was getting back up. Did you not watch the first fight? It shows hes a beast and can get back
3 fights
You know what Joe, I always thought you were cool. But now I hear you're trophy hunting the endangered Triceratops for sport!? Not cool Joe. Not cool.
Does Joe even know boxing, wilder didn’t stay in his corner so the ref has to stop counting, fury was ready to go at 7. Weirdo behaviour at this point
There's no ringside timer
Fury won all 3 fights hands down, Wilder needs to go back to fighting bums and 47 year old Cuban over hyped ex champs
For wilder being one of the hardest punchers ever he couldn’t seem to knock Fury out. Fury took wilder to school and wilder failed.
Fury could’ve milked the time to rest as much as possible. Hard to say
tyson have stamina,wilder have power.
Fury walked Wilder down to prove a point. He'll go back to his stick and move tactics hopefully.
Tyson Fury was actually named after Mike Tyson. They talked about it on Hot Boxin
Look Joe has on that costume so he's a real astronaut and the Earth is round... If you see it in our media, that makes it true right??
SAVE THE TRICERATOPS
I'm sure nobody's going to talk about it or if they do, it will be to poo poo it, but Tyson Fury cheated in the second fight, the glove thing is real.. and he has a history of doing the exact same thing, he'd been caught doing the same thing before. He definitely won the third fight, fair and square, but that second fight he cheated. And pretending like Wilder's excuse about his legs isn't a good one is just desperate! You're just a desperate white guy trying to find fault in what he said when what he said is absolutely true!
Long count get out buster Douglas was 20 seconds
Space suits, pot smoke, and neon lights. Hahaha!!
Joe is 5”3
Joe Rogan plz just focus on MMA u just sound as stupid as Stephen A. When he talked about Conor vs Cowboy..the irony is that you got pissed off at him cuz he doesn't know shit about MMA, same goes to you. If you don't know the rules of boxing just shut up and be a normal fan
Tyson still got up at 7 so what’s the problem if 2 seconds were lost?
It's sad to see how Joe becomes less relevant these days. Feels like his prime time is gone, but can't name the single thing why - Was it the move to Spotify? Is it the constant lack of expertise on the subject while making comments in judging or teaching tone? Or is it just a popularity decay?
Poor old Joe, doesn’t understand the rules of the sport he claims to know everything about
Wilder got smashed for the third time .As for the knockdowns ,wilders first count was 18 seconds from hitting canvas til ref allows him to continue .So no argument after that , no complaint here.
JRE seems downhill. $100M deal getting on him
In Fury vs Wilder 2, Tyson needed that count after being knocked down. Wilder rocked him.  But in F vs W 3, it looked on both occasions like Tyson was having a bit of a breather, bleeding the count.
I love Joe but he doesn't know shit about boxing 😂
Joe sounds like Deontay
Tired of ppl just acting like joe is always right...dude lay off the weed bro...nobody cares about this but u...bet ur wife is jealous how much u care
Fury seemed to be ok waiting for the 8.
referee did same when deontay got dropped round 3
Joe explains this like it was ground breaking when in reality nobody cares but him...u wud think he gets paid by the word...joe lay off the shrooms...bet u didn't describe ur kids birth like this
Why are they dressed in spacesuits ?
I find the whole count excuse SO cowardly and pathetic, these people just make Americans look bad, I mean you clearly just saw someone beat a guy, but you're sitting there trying to say well no wilder should of won because the count was a few seconds slow, that's the only way you could win is by a few seconds of a count? Clearly wilder wouldn't finish him regardless of the count and fury dominated him before and after, stop trying to claim a win based on a few seconds
Come back to YouTube plox
That's the most u heard from Jamie since he been there...notice how Jamie never gives a straight answer...sound like a 40 year old virgin
Definitely a long count for Wilder in the 11th round - he was obviously going to get up....
What a Dosser
If you woulda asked Rogan in early 2015 who would of won Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder 3 he woulda said Rhonda Rousey would beat them both at the same time without breaking a sweat 🤣
With respect to joe. I’m a British boxing fan and I’ve watched hours of fury footage. Not once when he went down twice did I ever think he wasn’t going to win that fight. Tyson is the best heavy weight of all time .
Do Joe rogan fans enjoy listening to him because he's as dumb as them?
Its called a 10 count not a 10 second count... The 10 count lasts around 12-14 seconds on average..
Wilder lost and deservedly
The reality is fury is the superior boxer and wilder is a one trick pony completely depending on his power . Was totally out thought and boxed  in all 3 fights
Did you guys know Joes actual height is 3’3”?
Ahh Tony Hinchcliffe, Toe Rogans new butt boy
3:40 fun fact - Tyson was not named Tyson at birth. He changed his name
I must be the minority cause I thought they both looked like shit to be honest. Wilder being tired mid way through 2md round was pathetic
Both Wilder and Fury got long counts. The ref was consistent.  Wilder likes to get up straight away fury always takes his time.
Corruption?? DC doesnt know shit😂 the ref did a fucking superb job
Imagine if the ref stopped it in the 4th round we all would have been robbed of the greatest modern heavyweight bout either. Sooo no, fuck you.
Watched that round several times Joe, it wouldn't matter how the ref counted because he was up by the 8 count both times.
Totally nailing the Dr Evil look! 😂
9:10 Всё лежит на виду! Судья вне ринга включает счётчик в момент падения бойца на настил. 10-0 отсчёт. Далее уже судья на ринге принимает решение!
As usually Joe knows nothing about boxing) It was funny when he was talking about counting
seriously Calm down . It’s been one of the most one sided trilogys I can think of. He’s probably won 4 -5 rounds over the three fights . Wilder is dog shit. . it wasn’t a back and   forth contest which is what you really need for it to be great fight . It was one sided like the others, Fury was all over him except for a double knockdown Round
Amazing how short Joe Rogan's attention span is.  You'd think he'd have learned from previous assessments of Ronda Rousey, Connor McGregor, and others, that the "best/greatest of all time labels" shouldn't be thrown around so casually, especially when the guy hasn't fought anyone close to being "best" at anything in a boxing ring.
wilder is a slugger like foreman they lack footwork and finesse around the ring but make up for it using the raw power  fury is a outboxer like ali they use there jab to create distance between the opponent and fight faster using long range punches
If you could teach wilder to box. Good one Joe. Good one.
Rogan what the fuck are you smoking,I want some lol
Have you seen wilders record. Cherry picked most of his fights, even when champ he took defenses against unrabked boxers
Rogan what the fuck are you smoking,I want some lol
Anybody shittin on wilder is shittin on tyson too. Respect both fighters for having the guts to stand in the ring where you cant or wont.
Nothing to do with the count. Tyson was alert and ready. I don't think that was brought up as an excuse tho.. more to try n run the sport of boxing down. 👎
Wilder was beaten 3 times by Tyson, so many excuses
Joe rogan jacket is so dope....I want it 😩
Many things in this beautiful sport hold it back. Not having a timer for the knockdowns is one of them.
Fury is the best heavyweight out there right now.
Can someone please spread awareness about what has been going on with the lockdowns in New Zealand PLEASE
Really glad he talked to Tony about this cuz you know he's really just a Powerhouse of knowledge when it comes to MMA and boxing FOH
Joe is wrong that is not the way the count works. 🥊
It's one of 3 things----you are wrong! with a little bit of USA bias. RULE BRITTANIA.
Ya Joe tell them, it's no coincidence he was named Tyson Fury. Father and both grandfather's were bare knuckle boxing champions and his dad loved Mike Tyson. That's why he named him Tyson Fury. And ever since Mike Tyson had his fame in fighting, it immediately became more likely that someone would name their kid after Tyson and put him in boxing. No an unbelievable coincidence at all.
Live from the YO, Youngstown Ohio! You need to come do a show here!
Francis Ngannou? or Deontay Wilder?  Who will Hit Harder??
Started boxing at 19 after countless street knockouts
Wilders just a sore loser🤣🤣
Fury would've gotten up at 8 regardless
I knew fury was getting up and I’m not talking shit . And that referee was great he made sure they kept fighting .
Its not a mistake in a big fight like that if you see the fighter is still on and capable of going on they keep the fighting going, otherwise every fight would stop many rounss sooner
All this about the count. The ref starts his count at 5, so the ringside counter did tho his job. His 6 count is indeed a bit slower pick her picks up the pace at 7 and by 8 Fury is on his feet ready to go. If you count from the moment he screams down, you also reach 5 when he starts at 5. Cormier was just salty. Watch it again and judge for yourself.
One of the best fights I’ve have seen in a long time, probably ever.
Deontay Wilder Hits so hard it almost don't matter* not Tyson Fury! I thought it was Sober October, Joe! 🤣🤣
Dont let wilder see this🤣 he gonne use this as an excuse
The real reasonwhy wilder lost https://youtu.be/e9Z1qN67n-4
Tyson Kratoss Fury - God of War
Why are they wearing space suits
The count thing is wrong watch it back 😂😂😂😂he was up before either way.dear god talking points though eh
Nothing wrong with the count, Wilder got very similar counts when he got dropped. If Wilder had any brains he'd have stayed in a neutral corner which wouldn't have interrupted the refs count, that being said though, Fury would have been up regardless.
The bible long list of excuses for wilder just doesn’t stop, it’s like people don’t wanna believe a fatman whooped their guys ass. Fury whooped wilder like a father disciplining his son
I can’t understand why anyone would watch the Jerk Off.
The hyperbole has gone  off the charts with this one. Wilder is genuinely terrible, Fury showed that all you have to do is push him backwards and he can't fight. Half the top 10 beat him now and handily. Fury is a decent boxer, but his boxing ability is over exaggerated because his main thing is he's literally just a massive human being. Probably the best of a really shit era because he can box and he's huge and he'd be a problem for anyone because of that, but in terms of ability Uysk is far far more talented in this era and there's countless others from the past. So All this best fight of all time, Fury is one of the goats etc is complete fucking nonsense. It was entertaining yes and Fury is a good heavyweight in any era because of his size, but get a grip.
no joe we ddint al think it was over. IF your a fury fan you know for a fact it isnt over until the its over. Never doubt tyson fury
Electronic count would take the charm from the sport. Let's not steriles the sport.  Wilder had a long count too as he did get preferencetial treatment vs Ortiz after he was knocked down.  Just enjoy the sport and its flaws, its these old traditions that's what makes it special.
Corruption my arse yanks would of added seconds on to beat the brit
Good job give Wilder some more excuses to throw around....Fury beat him fair and square for the 3rd time...Get over it!
I knew Tyson would come back after the 4th
He's wrong there the count get stopped if the opponent isn't in a neutral corner. This was spoken about even from the first fight when he came out the corner to do he's goofy dance because he thought he KO'd Tyson in the 12th. Not sure if the time keeper outside keeps counting but the ref will continue from where he left off if the fighter comes out the neutral corner or takes time getting there. Its simple really. All this mistake shit and this and that crap. What people should say is the first fight he made Fury go left and right a bit asking him if he was OK that gave him valuable seconds to recuperate but i understand the ref needs to see if the fighter is OK to continue, nothing you can do about that.
I sent you is basically saying that you can be overweight fit and healthy and beat someone that's completely totally ripped
That's not how the count works Joe.
The count rule isnt right by Joe's explanation I'm sure of it
People need to count the knockdowns in their head of Fury. Delusional to think it was slow counts. Plus not all refs count so rapidly.. On top of that Fury was fully aware of the count and took the seconds to recover. Excuses,excuses, excuses.
Bruh Joe’s jacket is one of the worst I’ve ever seen haha
Can't agree with that at all fury beat the man 2 already then 3 fight in people still making excuses the better fighter won power dont make u a better fighter fury won and deserved to win
man.. great analysis.. Discussion on Tyson Fury having a first name as Tyson was the highlight
Who are these airheads?
Why are they wearing astronaut suits
Bro there are a million people or more that can hit harder then Dante Wilder he can hit hard yes but to say only 3 people in the world your out your mind in every penitentiary there's are at least 3 people who hit harder then him wtf u talking about?!!!
I thought Tyson had significant more skills on that fight .. or course is clinching and if u load up u will end up in someone arms when u run in too each other and Wilder should have used sidsteps for that but he didnt .. Is kind of strange because Tyson is better boxer in close range but still he choice too clinch.. I thought Wilder should have stuck too the stradegy of punching Fury in the stumach but he didnt ? Anyway Tysons jab is just amazing plus his fotwork and condition and still deliver hard punches.  Tyson had Wilder rocked many times but he still clinched up? Tyson has more weapons and technical faster skills soo it would end in the same way whatever stradegi Wilder would have used. I think Tyson will win any fight they will fight 10 out of 10 times.. His just a more experience better boxer. Still a great fight with 2 superstars
I've never heard that someone is supposed to continue the count while the referee orders the opponent to go to a neutral corner. I've always seen the count stopped until the opponent goes to a neutral corner; otherwise there is no incentive for the fighter to go to a neutral corner.
This bias from Joe gives me flashbacks to the Błachowicz fight.
Fury was watching the count he would have been up either way. What about all the times the doctor was in the ring delaying the start of the rounds for Wilder? No one talks about that because Fury ain’t a whining little bitch.
FFS! Do you really think Fury doesn’t know where the count is at?? Fast….slow…..medium speed…..he’s not getting up until he has to 🤦🏾‍♂️
Long count debunked. He was slow for both fighters. https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Wrong. The count IS interrupted if the opponent is out of his corner. It is an incentive for him to move immediately to his corner. Also, the stricken boxer is instructed to get up on an 8 count as stated by the ref, not some other counter.
Rogan talks so much shite here it’s embarrassing
You're wrong Joe https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Fury’s Stamina is amazing!
Didn’t realise that Rohan’s knowledge of boxing was none existent?? I ♥️ Joe Rogan show, he’s a great, funny,entertainer but we know now why he’s not a boxing critic😂😂😂😂😂
Broke & Desperate. Pls send Donations to Mark Edwards, Flat 7, Preston Court, Sandford Lane, Wareham, Dorset, BH20 4DX, UK. Pls Share address everywhere 🙏🏻
Joe knows nothing about boxing and is upset because he bet on Wilder and lost money
American  Fans  stop crying 😢
Wtf have they worn though.
OH HE STUNG HIM!
Hey Joe, I see you 👀 failing to mention the doctor mid round giving Wilder an extra half minute? That should be done between rounds. Been watching boxing 30+ years and can only think of this happening once before, funnily enough it was Wilder fight against Luis Ortiz. How about enter that into your one sided long count debate. 😴😴. Oh..... and Klitschko had 60+ knockouts against better opposition, Wilder is nowhere near the most powerful heavyweight nor does he hold the most knockouts in the division. If you want to big Wilder up that's fine, he is the only American pony in the show, I get that,just don't lie for him.
10 Count not a 10 Second count...plus The ref can not continue to count until the opposing fighter Is in a neutral corner  it's always been like this and will not change..
NAC467.740. Procedure for counting; knockdown; knockout; technical draw    1. When an unarmed combatant is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to retire to the farthest neutral corner of the ring, by pointing to the corner, and shall immediately begin the count over the unarmed combatant who is down. The referee shall audibly announce the passing of the seconds, accompanying the count with motions of his or her arm, with the downward motion indicating the end of each second.       2. The timekeeper, by effective signaling, shall give the referee the correct 1-second interval for the count. The referee’s count is the official count. Once the referee picks up the count from the timekeeper, the timekeeper shall cease counting. No unarmed combatant who is knocked down may be allowed to resume competing until the referee has finished counting to eight. The unarmed combatant may take the count either on the floor or standing.       3. If the opponent fails to stay in the farthest corner, the referee shall cease counting until the opponent has returned to his or her corner and shall then go on with the count from the point at which it was interrupted. If the unarmed combatant who is down arises before the count of 10, the referee may step between the unarmed combatants long enough to assure himself or herself that the unarmed combatant who has just arisen is in condition to continue. If so assured, the referee shall, without loss of time, order both unarmed combatants to go on with the contest or exhibition. During the intervention by the referee, the striking of a blow by either unarmed combatant may be ruled a foul.       4. When an unarmed combatant is knocked out, the referee shall perform a full 10-second count unless, in the judgment of the referee, the safety of the unarmed combatant would be jeopardized by such a count. If the unarmed combatant who is knocked down is still down when the referee calls the count of 10, the referee shall wave both arms to indicate that he or she has been knocked out.       5. If both unarmed combatants go down at the same time, the count must be continued as long as one is still down. If both unarmed combatants remain down until the count of 10, the contest or exhibition must be stopped and the decision is a technical draw.       6. If an unarmed combatant is down and the referee is in the course of counting at the end of a period of unarmed combat, the bell indicating the end of the period of unarmed combat must not be sounded, but the bell must be sounded as soon as the downed unarmed combatant regains his or her feet.       7. When an unarmed combatant has been knocked down before the normal termination of a period of unarmed combat and the period of unarmed combat terminates before he or she has arisen from the floor of the ring, the referee’s count must be continued. If the unarmed combatant who is down fails to arise before the count of 10, he or she is considered to have lost the contest or exhibition by a knockout in the round containing the period of unarmed combat that was just concluded.       8. If a legal blow struck in the final seconds of a period of unarmed combat causes an unarmed combatant to go down after the bell has sounded, that knockdown must be regarded as having occurred during the period of unarmed combat just ended and the appropriate count must continue.       9. The provisions of this section do not apply to a contest or exhibition of mixed martial arts.  (Hope joe rogan can see this)
In boxing the referee can stop the count if the opponent fails to return to the neutral corner and resume the count when they do. It’s a rule of boxing. Maybe Cormier should stick to MMA.
That jacket Joe is wearing is fucking sweet
Joe explaining the count is a bit like someone who knows nothing about football, trying to explain the offside law.
Who gives a fuck error or not and nah if the fighter who dropped the guy moves from the neutral corner the count starts
Yep its not just boxing where incredible talent leads an athlete to be less skilled they just rely on that one thing while the guys lacking that extreme talent end up developing masterful skillset to compete and even dominate those extremely talented athletes Tyson fury is the same for most of his career he didn’t have knock out power so he from a young age developed world class level skills
I just don't understand why everyone is hyping this fight up. It was competitive for 5 rounds then Wilder was exhausted. 6 more rounds of leaning and clinching until the finish. Its not even fight of the year imo.
Watch the footage he was up in 8 seconds anyway.
The Killers- Quiet Town (cover)  https://youtu.be/JAN7LvchcdM
joe is fucking next level blazed in this one
Get in there chavvy! You won't that wench! Traveller boy
Fury lays there for a few seconds and let's his brains unscramble. Then comes back like a monster.
Wilder will never be the same
A 10 count does not mean a 10 second count
For someone like me, who can't stand MMA or UFC, but love old school boxing, Fury is a godsend. Making boxing interesting again
About the counting, you have to see this more like in the UFC, the Ref is making a judgement on the boxer if he's ok to fight or not, some guys get up in 4 sec but are far from fit to continue, other boxers stay down for almost ten seconds, get up, nothing happened. Anyhow, Fury got up, boxed like nothing happened, he could have got up two or three seconds earlier.
Joe getting lots wrong in the video. The rules, the count and who has the most knockouts. It is not Wilder. It is Joe Louis with 52 KOs. If he had worded it differently he would have been correct. Wilder has the highest KO ratio. 44 fights to 41 KOs. Then again his opponents should be taken into account.😉
This is inaccurate, the ref can pause the count if the fighter is not in a neutral corner. The problem is people don't understand it's not necessarily 10 seconds but a 10 count Refs are more prepared then anyone in the world to be in that ring under those circumstances. In the past refs wouldn't even start counting until the standing fighter is in a neutral corner
There is nothing wrong with the count…not mention that the second knock down was a hit behind Fyry’s head with the inside of the glove
Jamie squeals at knitting vids on you tube! Joe is a dribbler after all the drugs...can't stand listening to him now!
Count only starts when the fighter is in the neutral corner, so presumably paused if fighter leaves? Just more excuses smh
There are like 3 set of completely different rules and standards in boxing and they’re almost all unspoken and the ref, the judges and the time keeper are all on different pages.  The only way wilder can generate that power punch is by planting his feet and winding up which takes a long time to do and fury saw it and reacted. Wilder is nothing without that punch and fury proved it by taking it away.
It is not a 10 second count. It is a 10 count and the counting starts when the other boxer is in the neutral corner or moves towards it  if the other boxer is not in the neutral corner or leaves the neutral counter the count will be stopped and will resume after he returned to the neutral corner.
It’s really not that crazy that Tyson’s dad John who idolised Mike Tyson called his son Tyson, that really made me cringe
10 count is not 10 seconds, the ref knew Fury was in a good enough state to continue, which he proved by outboxing Wilder for the rest of the fight.
Had he kept counting Fury would've gotten up sooner. He only stayed down because NO fighter, if they are smart, stands up until after the ref hits 6 or later. He was using the system. AS EVERY (smart) fighter does. Had the count gone on without pause he would've got up right away.
He’s knocked out 41 tin cans. Most unknown and padded record of probably any heavyweight in the USA ever.
"When Kanye and Kim broke up" AHAHAHAHAHAA! RIGHT OFF THE TOP. Threw  ko. That shit was funny as fuck!
Sack the what if,s ...
Also if the ref would have counted Tyson out and said No u not fit to continue would that have been right?  After seeing him get back up and win the fight would it be fair to have told him he had lost ??? Exactly.  He was ready to go and proved it without question!!!!  Like I said the ref don't have a stop watch ffs. The count is for the ref to decode if a fighter fit enough to continue without serious injury , and Tyson clearly was.. Take it on the chin. The Gypsy King.. THE CHAMP.    I'm British I even I underestimated him at the beginning  and thought Klitsko would beat him. Truthfully I looked at his body and thought No. Plus to tell u the truth I expected him to be black hahaha. Frank Bruno was our last world Xhampion and let's be real it had usually been Black men smashing the heavyweight division so ithought our new hope  Tyson Fury ( what a name ) was black and when I seen this out of shape Gypsy I wrote him off... Shame on me..... He a legend
I’ve always seen the boxing 10 count as a symbolic measure rather than literally implying that a fighter has precisely 10.00s flat to get up. If the true purpose of the 10 count was to measure exactly 10s, it would have been automated a long time ago.
JR = sensationalism in place of knowledge and understanding.  Nice work Joe....Learn the rules!
Here we go with the excuses yet again ita actually pathetic at this stage fury outclassed wilder in all 3 fights you lost to the better man and boxer accept it
A count is so the ref can assess if the fighter is still able to continue the fight. Its not a stop watch . If you know anything about boxing you would know that... So if the ref takes a extra 2 seconds to make sure the man up for the fight and isn't going to get seriously hurt if they continue he let's the fight continue! And at no point can u say that Tyson Fury was not fit to continue  so the  excuses  are ridiculous...
Fury always takes the full count, an experienced boxer knows to do this.  He would have been ready at 9 regardless
Again, Rogan sounds like a moron and Lobsta Tony knows even less.
Just unlucky for wylder he exists in the time of a real hard man.
i love the channel logi
about the count, an experienced fighter knows when to keep lying down and when to stand to beat the count...if you are down there is no point in trying to hury to get up...wait until its about 7 to get up...but JR makes a point though when he said maybe if he had got up at the time he should have, perhaps he would still not have fully recovered to the advantage of fury...but all that is just theoretical...one thing i know is that fury is also experienced at clinching...one thing i wilder is not good at...fury would throw 2 combos then immediately tie wilder up to neutralise any possible counter...wilder did not have that skill in his bag. so i think one another thing that made fury do well is knowing how to tie up wilder when he is advancing in.
I wonder if Joe Rogan comments on fights he's watching from home?
Turned it off when joe started explaining the count lol 😆
Wtf is Joe wearing.
Joe need to look at the boxing rules and not hearsay
"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat." Part of President Teddy Roosevelt speech in 1910
Stop seeking for other reasons. Tyson won 3 out 3 with Wilder how much do you want? He is GOAT
It looks like he skipped leg day for life
Boxing rules state if a ref has to stop his count to send a fighter to the neutral corner, the count is picked up where the ref left off.
David Tua in his prime would kill Deontay Wilder in round one.
Disappointed in Joe and Cormier for buying into that slow count BS because it didn't make a difference, it may have made a difference if Fury was flat out and just about made the ten count each time but that wasn't the case
Those fools are high as fuck.
The way joe knew buddy was full of shit when he said “ don’t worry he’s gonna come back” I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣
10:20 the BEAUTY of Boxing 🥊
Joe don't know  Fax not printer Sorry not sorry.
Facts about that LCD count
Couple things.... 1)Joe is absolutely biased in favor of Deontay, and black flighters in general. (Who knows why) 2)Fury did what most smart, experience fighters do when they get clipped and go down but are not knocked out.... He intentionally waited the count to get as much recovery as possible. This was obvious to anyone who spends any time watching boxing. Joe probably needs to lay off on the weed. It's clouding his judgement. ☝️
According to the Queensbury Rules of Boxing the ref should only start counting a downed fighter when the standing fighter has made it to a neutral corner, not at the first instance of the knockdown.
Why does everything has to be hyped up to the "Best of all time" status these days? Was this a good fight? Most definitely. Was it better than our even up to the the all time classics from the 70's,80's or 90's? Not a chance. Why not simply limit your statement to saying that this was the best fight of the current generation of heavyweight boxers? It's clearly closer to the facts and less controversial. The need to hyperbolise everything is one of the biggest cancers of our times.
I need to see Usyk Fury.. I’ll pay for that
What about Doctors stepping into the ring, not between rounds, but during the actual round buying Wilder time? This is not the first time it has happened. And it is a 10 count, not a 10 seconds count. If Wilder went to the neutral corner, the count wouldn't have been interrupted. Either way, Fury owned him 3 times (he was robbed in the first match).
Wilder isn’t a boxer. He’s a freak of nature puncher. However he hit fury flush 3 times over the trilogy,  Fury got up and battered him on each occasion.
Joe Rogan once again showing his bias xD
OMG!! Excuses galore. Isn't it funny that the very fighter who boasted that he would have KOed Iron Mike in his prime was KOed by Iron Mike Tyson’s namesake. I guess Wilder’s fans just can’t handle the loss til this day.
Long count but the idea fury was not able to get up sooner is crazy. He went down seconds after the punch rolled over and sat  and waited the count for rest. He got up in second fight with a great count he could get up from that third fight knockdown. Landed twice as many punches in that last fight as wilder. Wilder more motivated than ever Tyson wasn’t what he should of been in that fight and it still wasn’t even close.
Who’s the orange astronaut dude? Literally everything he says in this is inaccurate. Get him off
I used to like Joe  until I heard about the Dave Asprey stuff. Even deleted his podcast from 7 years ago with him. Not the person he portrays himself to be.  Very sad :(
haha nasa unies !
"Tyson FUry who would know how would it happen"   He is literally named after Mike Tyson.
One of the best fights of all time.
They should do the boxing 10 count the same way they bring people in to the royal rumble
Deontay Wilder with Tyson Fury's movement = Mike Tyson
There is actually a video out counting the clock digitally and they found that the ref was on the money.. wilder and his fans are all full of excuses, dude got beat all three times by the much better man. I love how Fury gave all glory to Jesus Christ, wilder was talking about being possessed by spirits before the fight it was basically good vs evil. all the libtards and evil people were rooting for wilder too it was perfect
NASA SHILLLLLLLL
I feel like wilder can knock out every HW except for fury .. that’s how powerful and dangerous he is
Where you get that jacket from joe
That was a great Referee. Both men had a chance to fight to the end. Fury won and there’s no question about it.
Who’s this clown he’s with ? Plz don’t bring him back everrrrr
I like how Joe talks about what he likes to talk about, hence the Wilder fight, his guest didn't know much about the subject but that didn't stop Joe as always LOL, love ya Joe
Till this day!
Tony looks like he's in his dad's space suite
Joe Rogan: I remember him. I still listened to him sometimes, back in 2019. This just reminds me of why I stopped.
All these rumors of fury cheating. All this proof. And yet we doubt.   He tells a sad story depression. Jesus christ. Good sportsmanship. Its an act so he gets a crowd to believe in him.   Hes a cheater. All these advantages leaning towards one side only means one sure thing.   Too much coincidence and luck.   Or what's obvious. Fury fights dirty and cheats when he needs to. To get the win.
Everyone keeps telling everyone if wilder learnt how to box he would be great. He was undefeated champion of the world. If only
The count stops if the ref has to address the other fighter.
YEAH BUT JOE, Isn’t wilder in the hospital right now though
Ofcourse DC, the black guy, is going to reach at any excuse to support the other black guy. BS.
I've just re-watched the fights. On both the times Fury was down he was up by 8 seconds.
Look at Tyson fury his résumé
MMA is dead
Wilder has metal rods in his hand.. thats why his punches are so devastating..
Get Michael Saylor on the podcast.
That looked like a dragon ball  Z episode when the shock wave went down fury back
The count didn’t make a difference. Fury was ready to go and waited til 7 or 8 like usual. He was aware enough to not let him get to 10
Wilder definitely got cheated that was a extremely long count
I believe fury's greatest talent is knowing himself. It's like he has a PHD in the study of body weight advantages and he utilizes all of them as well as his reach. His foot work is like a much lighter fighter.
That's cuz he's literally named after Mike tyson
I think the fight was stopped 2 rounds late. Wilder was done by 7. It's just that Wilder is so dangerous he could get the win regardless. But danger shouldn't be a factor as much as the ability to defend. He was doing shit to protect himself other than being scary af.
Rogan knows what he's talking about...
Fury lost that fight if you go by the correct count.
Does anyone suffer from recency bias more than Joe? Every fight or figher he sees is the "greatest of all time".
He’s name after Mike Tyson.
The fuck Joe talking about  controversial count?   Here someone has reviewed it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k
Joe is acting like hes never seen a boxing match? I have never seen a ref start a count...tell someone to go in corner and then look at ringside personnel and start the count off again at another number...never seen it...its probably happened at some point but 99% of the time that will not happen...in the rules its the refs 10 count and thats it..thats the only thing that sticks...you want a faster count after you knock someone down..you get in the corner
Are you kidding me?? What a sloppy, lazy mess. Wilder has zero stamina.. Tyson just lays his mass on him.. Terrible fight!
Great fight!
Big George foreman might disagree on the most KO's in the heavyweight division...
it was a long count but Tyson Fury was just following his lead, he waited till the last 3 seconds to get up based on the ref's count, the official rule is that the ref is the ultimate arbiter of the count, the time's keeper is just there to keep track of the count for the ref but has no power in reversing a long count, this rule was established back in the day when the Mike Tyson vs Buster Douglas fight was heavily contested in courts due to the long count when Douglas was knocked down in the 8th round, the ref has the final say, it's not 10 seconds, it's a 10 count
saying it's the best fight clearly shows how little he watches older fights.
Fury was up at 7 or 8 of the "long count" anyway.
mistake is when its just a long count joe in this case it started with the commission fighting over the funny looking gloves, then a ref was changed last minute as well as judge at thats just before the long countS at some point coincedences have to be called what it is corruption
Get vaccinated.
I’m from Youngstown and ya my best friend is a boxer haha
Joe pulling a cnn, this is fake news.
Try hards talking about fighting. I'm done with Joe and his obsession post Spotify to present pure shit. I was good up until Spotify. Many many things changed. He has 400 mill so I guess the joke is on us.
Deontay wilder would be better boxer if  they both had started at the same age
Why are they wearing fake space suits ? 😂
Wilder is clown as far as character and Fury truly is a champion in character and boxing.
Jesus is something on the ceiling
“Greatest boxing fights of all time” that’s a bit of a stretch was it amazing and exiting to watch live yes. Was is an amazing display of boxing, no.
MAN..I love Joe, but F these spacesuits
The odds of that? Because he was named after Tyson and trained to box from birth.
Joe Rogan is wrong about his "count theory"
Joe NEVER mentioned Wilder taking 2 knees and he caught himself both times he said “when wilder clubbed him in the back of the head, er I mean behind the ear” Noooo Joe you were right the 1st 2times he held him and rabbit punched the back of the head it’s illegal Deadly and wrong
so tired of JOE shilling for bums , THERE hasn't been a great heavyweight fighter since Lennox retired , the HW division is a joke , full of big dudes with no talent , who the hell has either one of them fought , NO BODY , there is nothing great about these two , nothing but marketing hype , Fury doesn't even have to make weight , remember when we had standards for boxers , now they can come in at a comfortably weight , you have more class than to lower your standards to rave about these losers !
Everybody keeps saying that about the count but Tyson would have got up faster had to count Been at 7 or 8 because the boxers usually wait till the last second to get up so if the count was later he would have got up you know what I mean
The fact that Joe placates this racist bull shit is so disappointing. There is no such thing as a 10 second count in boxing and Joe knows that. This happens every fight with knock downs. The count is at the refs discretion and the ref is more concerned with weather the fighter is hurt than the count timing. When a fighter gets knocked down the ref doesn't give a shit about the count every fight fan knows that. They are concerned with how badly the fighter is hurt and weather they can continue. SMH..
Joe looks like dr evil in that suit
Tell DC to worry about “judging” when Sal D’Amato or Derrick Cleary are judging UFC fights Why does every black person hate when a white boy whips that ass ??
This was not about counting,  it's about fighting,  Fury is listening to the count and is waiting for count 6 or 7 to stand up.  Fury is listening to the ref not some off site count person.   Trust me these long counts helped Deontay more than Fury.
Fury can only go by the referee's count He was obviously looking up at him listening so he could stay down and rest as much as possible, which any fighter who is down but still has his faculties does. Zero excuses for controversy, Wilder won maybe 3 of the 11 rounds. He got throttled except for round 4, and in reality, lost all 3 fights of the trilogy.
Geez and here I thought Joe Rogan knew what the heck he was talking about. Serves me right I guess
Seeing wilder getting beat in his back yard 3 times is so funny he is a joke
I wish we could've seen a fight with a version of Wilder trained from his youth like Fury was.  I wonder how much of a difference it would make.  Would it have made him worse somehow?  Did waiting till he was older allow his strength to develop unhindered to allow his punches to hit like he does?  So many possibilities and what ifs.  It already was one of the greatest fights (the last one) ever in boxing and definitely of the past 10 years.
Thanks Joe. The LDBC is about to use the soundbite of you talking about the count to write this off as Deontay Wilder was cheated. They won't be satisfied until they watch Tyson literally take this man's life in the ring.
His real name is Luke fury still a legend tho
Tyson Fury is named after Mike Tyson
Here it is broken down.  https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
Three great fights, TF won them all. Stop with the slow count bs.
Wilder is America’s Frank Bruno. Big punch, not much else.
We are worried about the count how about worry about the ref letting Wilder stay in the fight to the point the commissioner came out in the 9th and told him fight or I'm ending this. That ref let them duke it out until one got KOd
Only way you get up from a knockdown like Tyson is …………. Cooooooke
Stupid to even talk about!  Tyson Fury looked perfect on the ground, went by the ref and got up before 10.  If you watch it again, Fury was counting himself.  And, Tyson would probably have gotten up if the ref went faster.  Horrible for Rogan to even say the word corruption.  The match was in The Untied States, Not the UK!
I don't miss your podcast anymore glad you left YouTube!
They named him after mike Tyson
The ref did what he is supposed to do. And btw its a 10 count not 10 seconds
Wanted wilder to win but the only way wilder could win is a knockout he can't outbox fury. Wilder could had take it easy on the early rounds and save some power for later rounds.
Wilder should have gone to the neutral corner to avoid any trouble
Sad when someone wants to win with a fast count, not a beat down.
The count was fine. You’re always searching for straws to clutch
Watch the replay that wasn't a long count, not even close. If they had ended the fight everyone would say the count was to fast.
He got hit       HARRRRD
BRING DEL BIGTREE ON .. YOU KNOW WHY...
One of the greatest boxing of all times😂😂😂 JOE! Quit pandering!!! Wilder doesn’t even have COMBOS! He swings like he’s in a bar fight!!
Rogan says it best 14 mins in. If Deontay wasnt a one hit wonder, and had real boxing ability like Fury, he would probably be the best heavy weight boxer ever. So this fight is comparable to Ali and Foreman fight. Foreman a massive puncher against a slick master boxer....V
If Wilder started at age 9,10 like most fighters…who knows what he could have been. But at 19, he’s just too old to break the habits
Do not know jaxk shit
George foreman agreed the ref was fine just take the loss in peace
People hear 6'9" but they don't realize how big that is because they have never seen that height in real life. To be that big and nimble as Tyson is near impossible.
I dislike Redban a lot
"Most people dont know shit about boxing" AKA Daniel Cormier
Why do they wear those stupid fake NASA suits? I don’t get it
Thats wrong! The referee pick up his own count not the guy outside. The rules is in the internet just look at it
Joe I know everything Rogan
Mike Tyson was an awkward puncher but same thing. If you got hit once it was over.
Naaahh when the referee came back he started at 4
It was a great fight
So wilder didn’t go to neutral corner so ref (according to the official rule) stopped the count.. it was done to the book. Now for all the goons who think fury was given a long count.. please count the actual seconds from the time wilder hit the floor until the time he got back up snd was told to fight.: 21 seconds. Is the count: in fact all the knockdowns were around 20 seconds. Now fury don’t make excuses but you could argue that the doctor gave wilder an extra 20 seconds at the start of a round.. can’t remember which… but he’s supposed to do it in between rounds. All was fair in this fight…
Tony literally knows nothing about boxing. He pretends to like it to impress joe
Listening to Tony Hinchcliff talk about boxing makes me want to kill myself.
What amazes me besides Tyson being an unfuckingbelievable fighter is how he came back from being hooked on drugs and alcohol and now looking him. He is a legend
The count in boxing has ALWAYS been a 10 count NOT 10 seconds the pace of the count is at the discretion of the referee and the ref did exactly as he was supposed to when Wilder failed to go to a neutral corner following the knock down.  Rogan was talking out his ass on this one.
oh dont even talk about the count🤣 just get over the fact that furys just extremely better than wilder and has broken wilders heart
Look at Joe shilling for NASA .
Remember Charlie Zelenoff had a fight against Deontay Wilder, too
7mins - what a load of shit. I watched the fight at least 5 times getting my £25 money’s worth as well as watching an all time great fight. Counted the Fury knockdowns on stopwatch (as I know wilder fannies would moan again) and he was easy within 9seconds. Put the weed down Joe - typical septics
I'm a bit conflicted about Joe saying how badly Wilder hurt Fury, post match Wilder went to the Hospital, Fury went to a nightclub.
I think Tyson was ready to get up no matter what the count was at
the purpose of the count is to assess if he can get up and never has been 10 seconds, a 10 count is the referee counting to 10 and it's subjective to the ref whether or not they want to provide more leniency if they believe a fighter is fit to continue
I’m from Youngstown
Of coarse Cormier believes Fury benefited from a slow count.....Gee I wonder why?
There is problems in every sport with referees and that issue probably will never change. It's only going to get worse!
“I was tired” bitch the whole uk stayed up to 5 in the morning to watch it ffs
Nowhere near one of the greatest heavyweight fights of all time
For this being one of the first time Tyson goes does without being knocked out … really crazy how he took his time getting up … compared to like ryan Garcia’s first time getting up from Luke Campbell was way too fast and he was stunned that he went down … I know ryan doesn’t even compare to Tyson but just shows you even a great boxer compared to a legend …. But yeah Ryan’s third dropped fight don’t got so much respect for him
Please Joe, don't discuss fights when you have a choir of Beta males in the studio.
Haha love when joe wears his astronaut gear
Joe Rogan is wrong about the count rule. The unified rules say otherwise. You have to pause the count if you need to address the other fighter and resume the count where it was left off.
Doh, he was named after Mike Tyson 🤦‍♀️
If you go to your coaches in your corner the count stops until your in your corner, pretty sure that happened on that knock-down,because it happened on one of them, I just can't remember the fight clearly, gotta rewatch sober. You'd think Joe would know this, going out to millions of uninformed people who will now believe fury got favourable treatment.
Is joe wearing cling film….
I love watching fights with like 10 friends, bbq,beers, n bud. I miss those days.
And much like taking horse dewormer to cure covid… ROGAN is WRONG again!!!!!! The rules state that if the standing boxer does not go to the neutral corner, the ref will stop count to inform the standing boxer to go to corner. The ref then proceeds from where he/she left off!!!!!! You are a fucking morning JOE!!!
Cry babies just accept defeat.
I have been waiting for Joe's commentary on this fight!!
He was up by 10 anyway.
it's actually a ten count....not 10 seconds count. Also, the rule is the ref. will pick up from the outside counter, but will stop counting when the fighter is NOT on the neutral corner and continue his own (ref.) count... No Controversy here...
There should be an automatic clock for counting during Fight events. A big screen that everyone in the stadium can see and follow.
When joe said thats the type of kos that ends careers. I just think of James Kirkland
Fury us a hype. Problem is Wilder has no clue what he’s doing in the ring so he’s make Fury look good. Who has Fury fought really ?
“Wilder had Tyson Fury on How Weird Street.”  Great oneliners Joe👍.
Joe Rogan you are incorrect. You need to get you're facts straight regarding the refs count. The right man won anyway. Fury is the better fighter and has been throughout the trilogy.
Joe is wrong on this one once the ref picks up the count from the time keeper the time keeper no longer keeps count and you go only by the ref. So when the ref stopped counting to direct Wilder to the white corner he pauses his count and picks it up where he left off. Joe Rogan is indeliberately fueling a controversy that's a non controversy.  The reason the count isn't kept on a clock is the reason this count was slow. It's so the ref can control it if he needs to get a fighter to the furthest neutral corner away from the down fighter. I suppose he could use a push button to control that but that clock could be tampered with as easy as you could pay someone off I would guess so it still isn't full proof. Or what if that button fails are you going to have a fighter have another fighter standing over him with the count going?
It's not 10 seconds joe, it's just a 10 count. It can be 15 seconds or even 20 seconds. It's just to see if the guy is knocked out or not.
Was proven it wasn’t a slow count
Some guy made a video comparing Furys count to wilders. The ref counted slow for both
I personally feel that Wilder is done. He hits hard but I get the impression that he's a bitch in his heart
Joe dont know boxing rules. there is a rule to stay in the neutral corner. if u dont stay there and walk around, the ref need turn to you and tell you... so the guy on ground get more time.  is mistake of the guy who not stay in the neutral corner. its a boxing rule since early 19xx... because 1920 they walk around the guy wich was on ground. and if the ref call to 8 and said rdy, he start to hit him again.
Incredible fight !  Congrats to Tyson Fury
Tony has such an annoying voice.
These guys are not on Joes level for this one just sitting there , yep , yeah, for sure lmao
Wonder how much Rogan lost betting on Wilder 😉
Who is this guy Joe is interviewing? So boring ruining the conversation
Wilder fought mostly cab drivers his whole career.
Wilder wouldn’t shake his hand after this loss. Dumb move.
Has Alex Jones done 'Kill Tony' yet?.    I think it might be his 1st Stand Up attempt and even if he just stood there and stared, He could win it.  Cheers J.R. & Crew. Much Love.
This is painful to watch because Joe doesn't know his ass from his elbow .
The count was not off if you go back and count yourself it was on point.
When the bell goes you have to protect yourself at all times so what's the doctor doing stepping in the ring after the bells gone ..the doctor should have checked wilder between rounds ...not when the bells gone ...there should only be the ref and two fighters in the ring...and the same thing happened in the ortiz fight...the doctor gave wilder 20 extra seconds ...but the round before ortiz had been KNOCKED DOWN and the doctor didn't check him . Fury has two bare knuckle kings on his dad's and his mum's side ...one was Bartley Gorman...he's literally born for it . IF there was a long count then that's on the ref  but the doctor checking on wilder is total bullshit ..
i hate how joe talks like he 100% knows what the deal is and talks about it supper confidently but if you know whats what it turns out he doesnt know shit
Fury must have the best chin of all time then lol Reality is that Wilders KOs have been against sub par fighters and it was a one horse race after round 4
I think Wilder started boxing at 21, not at 19. 4:23
Kinda like how the fastest man to ever live is named “BOLT”. Destiny
Joe realizing he said se wrong the thing 5:02
Did Joe not see the Wilder count in r3? Exactly the same. And when Wilder doesn't retreat to the neutral corner, the count SHOULD stop- it's literally in the rules Joe.
Joe in his Halloween costume already
Wilder has no class. Sore loser. Tyson Fury won all THREE fights fair and square.
Wilder had a right hand but did not have the conditioning and stamina to survive twelve rounds.
timekeeper starts as soon as fighter is knocked down. Then ref is suppose to get the tie from them after returning fighters to neutral corner. They gave Fury that win he was down
Fight of the century wow wow wow
He dad named him after Mike Tyson and made him train like Mike Tyson his whole life.
I heard from a bird that Tyson is setting up a fight between him and Fury in that legends league thing he has.
Deontey should have been counted down before he got waved KO'd.
The fighter that goes down also waits for the 8 count before getting up for maximum recovery. He's listening for the referee's count, and not the actual count that he does not hear.
They look like astronauts who have just landed.
Wilder could have kept going in the second fight ,but he could also have got brain damage doing so
All the counts were roughly 18 secs including the Wilder one so it wasn’t anything in favour of Fury.
Joe wants to get fisted by Wilder - cos he punches HARD 👊 🙄
Vote for Youngkin!
Wilder could beat fury if he knew how to move his big ass head quicker
WILDER WAS OUT ON HIS FEET FOR AT LEAST 5 SECONDS LUCKY HE IS ALIVE
All about Wilder... typical
Too much smoking. Dumb guests.
No ,not true . In boxing the count can NOT begin until the standing man is in a neutral corner.
It wouldn’t of been a 10 count anyways if he didnt count slow Tyson waited for the count and looked at referee and always waits a sec to get up so he can’t wait the longest to get his head straight
Ffs Joe what has fury done to offend you?! Going on about his weight! Joe do yourself a favor -remove your tongue from Wilder's ASS!!!
Everyone is the “greatest” In something in joes eyes. Lmao
J R clueless as usual, official rule is actually the following:  4.4.         When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers.  .... And just out of interest, fury was actually up at 10, that was from being dropped to getting up by my own count.  JR must be smoking too much weed 🤔
Fat ripple nice name 4 a song
Someone broke down the Ref counts for both Fury and Wilder, the average for both was the same, 12 sec to get to the 8 count, 21 seconds from knockdown to back to action.
Tyson.! 🥳
10 count doesn't go by seconds i don't know why noobs go on about this and it doesn't matter if its a slow count or fast count and its all subjective as some refs have slower counts and some have faster counts. Wilder went to the wrong corner hence why the delay.  Side note, Fury took wilders soul in the first fight when he witnessed Fury get up from arguably his hardest punch, infact he punched him again as Fury was falling. Wouldn't surprise me if his career ends next couple of fights
Fury.! 🥳
Good always wins
Bring  prof,Peterson  JORDAN   now is a time  earth   will explode   in a nice coollloorrrr
The 10 count is a fucking stupid rule anyways lol it's way too short, should be at least 20.
Although Fury is definitely more skilled out of the two I honestly think it had to do more with the size difference between them. Fury had reach, height, and weight advantage...he'll he had all the advantages, better footwork, endurance, etc. It was his fight to win. Wilder only had a punchers chance.
Joe needs to understand boxing rules he has no idea about the 10 count stick to MMA all these boxing novice haven’t a clue
Joe "look at that fat ripple down" rogan
13:40 ‘there’s not a single guy that’s knocked out more guys than Deontay Wilder has’ ??? There’s literally dozens of boxers that have
Can we introduce a timer for boxing so we don’t make excuses
It makes no difference if the count was slow. Fury would have stood up at the eight count as it is tradition.
FROM THE BOXING REFEREE MANUAL   Do not over concentrate on the boxer in the neutral corner unless he exits the corner and forces you to stop the count   BULLSHIT SAYING ITS A SLOW ASS COUNT  wilder wasn't in the neutral corner and made the ref stop the count to have to go into the corner.  Stop with this bullshit about corruption and feeding the wakandans. It's disrespectful and embarrassing.
8:43 Took me that long to notice he was in a space suit🤣
EVERYONE has a story...his life, his fame, his fall, was all for his daughter born with spina bifida. Respect ✊. Imagine Fury comes over to shake his hand after knocking him out in the third fight but he was too hurt to think straight and full of self hatred for failing his daughter. Two sides to every story. His poor grammar e.i. “hurted me” is just sad 😢 and shows he had a tough life. Unlike Tyson Fury grew up son of famous John Fury.
I thought if the fighter still standing was told to go back to there corner the count stops because they had to give them directions.
How much for the baked potato suit?
I used to love Joe's podcast, but the moments when he is misinformed and confidently spreading his misinformation are getting more and more often.
Who gives a sh1t if the count is long. If a fighter is able to stand up within a reasonable time and wants to carry on, keep the fight going, goddamit. I would be pissed if a good fight was stopped because someone stands up at 10.5 seconds.
About the slow count when Fury was knocked down, in particular the 2nd, it seemed slow because the referee started the count at 5, not 1. The ref caught himself doing it. He was at 8 when he knew he should be at 3. I timed it. If you count from the moment Fury hits the canvas, he's up by 9. These modern day boxing refs, the majority of the time, shortchange fighters on allotted time. They start the count at 4 or 5 usually when the guy has been down for only 1 or 2 seconds. Enjoyed the fight and Joe's analysis.
I didn't think it was over when Fury went down. I was a little on edge and worried. But I knew that he was just as in the fight as Wilder at that point
Wilder could have won the first fight and it wouldn’t have mattered because he got destroyed in the last two.
imo fury lost...typical boxing...fkn joke sport. so corrupted its sad.
his names luke
Why does Joe allow this racist hinchcliff on his show?
No! That interpretation of the count makes no sense--because then there's no incentive for the other boxer to obey and go to his corner
Americans struggle hard to make sense of defeat 😂😂
Excellent analysis! but Fury owns the mental and technical experience {years} and i seen it in the first fight. Wilder needed to be humbled by the mind, hopefully he can innerstand it
That fat is high-tech shock absorbers!  The spare tire is like Bilsteins for your head
WTF Is Joe about to blast into space or something?  Nice intergalactic space suit dude!
I'll never be able to witness Ali vs Frazier live, but I got to see this masterpiece of a fight & experience the nail-biting moments right as they happened in real time.
Fury gave wilder those knockdowns if you watch fury goes down to gain time to recover after hard shots  fury would of got up by ten he just waited for the count to get there
Usyk beating AJ was way more impressive
Thank you Mr. Joe Rogan for speaking the truth! Nobody can take the truth anymore. That’s why Jesus, the apostles and the prophets were slain.
Boxing has been invented to wager and cheat. Of course they're going to keep the rules the way it's easiest to cheat.
Look at that fat look at it roll down “ american news: joe rogan fat shames
Jesus, shut up about the count - Tyson was rocked, but fine - looking at the ref, timing his rise back to his feet. Fury has beat Wilder three times now. Let it go already.
"...is named Tyson Fury, what are the odds of that" Is Tony literally the dumbest person that ever lived? Every time he opens his mouth I'm having a hard time believing he just said something even dumber than the last time. Also neither quick Tony nor funny Redban do even come up with a comedian name that works the same as Tyson Fury.
What about the 20 headlocks??
thats it!  Joe"King" Rogan
Rogan is wrong on the count, you can check the rules, it specifically says the ref stops the count and then carries on from where he left off.
Joe's right there isn't a law that allows them to do that specifically in Vegas... It's actually standard practice for boxing matches anywhere in the world.
They were titans for sure!
Listen, Tyson operated in wilder 3 times.  Wilder hasn’t got the bottle Aka courage Tyson Fury has.
With proper boxing counts that would mean Wilder won the first fight and the third fight. I wouldn’t mind seeing a 4th fight in the future in 2023
Joe Rogan = Dr Evil
I tried watching JRE on spotify but honestly without the comments and the timestamps it's not as fun an experience and just gave up.
Your forgetting about julian jackson😓
Greatest fight all time is the shittiest way to describe it. Why is everyone acting like this. This was good fight that’s it.
The white man can baby, jk! Fury road was a dead end for Wilder!!!
If the count hadn't been done fairly with both fighters I could see this being an issue but that definitely didn't happen in this fight.   I think this is a non issue.
Tyson was getting up on that count. He was waiting for as long as he could. If it was a second quicker he would have got up a second quicker. He wasn't out, he was using his time.
Joe is incorrect.  The ref picks up the count from the time keeper who starts counting immediately after the ref signals a KD.  Then after sending the other fighter to the neutral corner, the ref then picks up the count from the time keeper.  If for whatever reason that fighter doesn't stay in the neutral corner, or in Wilders case goes to the wrong corner, the count stops until the ref gets him into the neutral corner.  The ref was correct albeit slow with his counting, but he was the same with Wilder.
julio ceasar chavez is the GOAT. period. with micky ward as honorary GOAT. lol
That was a funny moment when he took a puff right after saying "comedian named Joe King" like "mission accomplished. Podcast over. I'll never say anything that good again."
2 things. great fight, but no where near other great heavyweight wars (thrilla in manilla, rumble in the jungle, buster vs tyson etc) and DEFINITELY not as good as lower weight fights (gatti vs ward type stuff). 2nd point; joahhna vs zhang is the greatest mma fight of all time. and its MUCH better than fury v wilder.
I wonder who made that neon sign? Looks like a Coastal Graphics piece.
For fury to lose fair and square he would have to face against another cheater,stealer, liar, addict, mental health struggled, caniving deviant and btw also Tyson is the largest able bodied human in the world, basically when you add cleverness to that it’s over, deonte is a true sportsman his only downfall was that he didnt compete in his weight division like  20-30 years ago.
A bunch of wanna be Shatner's
Wtf has happened to Redband shit he has aged sooo much wow sad to see him like that
The fucking suits
Those were some long ass counts for fury I just don’t wanna make excuses but it just doesn’t make sense
Wilder having no boxing basics is why he has so much power like albert elstine his dyslexia but his a genuious
Lol! I was busy watching the boxing and then I realized they were wearing space suits.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joe rogan proving he doesn’t know the rules of boxing. A 10 count isn’t necessarily 10 seconds any beginner knows that
Fun fact - tyson fury IS named after mike tyson furys dad used to be a boxer and his idol was mike tyson so he named his son after him
Well he was literally named AFTER Mike Tyson so wtf is that guy talking about when he's like "omg what a name! What are the chances?!"....clueless
Nothing goes from 100 to 0 that quick
Our guy done your guy simple as that ,slow count bullshito, get over it, the English have a real fighting spirit,and gypsies even more so.
It’s a count to 10, not 10 seconds as I understand it.  At the referee’s discretion.  I may be wrong.
I'm so bored of hearing Wilders excuses. In the UK if lose something you have lost,  there seems to be a culture in the US that excuses are made for losses after
People who don’t know boxing rules shouldn’t comments. Firstly It’s never been a 10 sec count it’s the ref count of 10. Time keeper starts the count when a fighter is down once the ref picks up the count it’s at his discretion. If a fighter is not in a neutral corner then the ref will stop the count give the standing fighter direction then pick up the count. A ref will count slower and hold up fingers to give the downed fighter a fair chance to recover.  This is done in every fight.
If he got a long count, so did Wilder when he had his arms around Fury’s legs
I thought the count stops while he goes to the neutral corner then resumes once he is there ?
That’s BS about the ring count!! Read the rules. Joe has no idea what he is talking about.
Theres weight classes for a reason.
Youngstown is a town where I dare the hardest man on earth to walk around all day. Bet he don't. it's a nutty town...with nutty people
Rogan is wrong abt the 12 count.
What if we are all totally stoned yet so used to the effects of it they we are almost talking coherently.
If you check the video playback, actual seconds, Fury got up before 10 seconds clearly each time.
People still talking about a "long count" in the first fight are part of the problem with boxing and fighting in general. They don't want to know who the better fighter is anymore, they just want to say their guy won. It's sad because not only did Fury prove that he was fine after getting up, but he then proved in 2 more fights that he's far superior, yet people still want to talk about it.
Now yall say joe doesn't know combat sports? Lol so toxic. He's definitely right the count was slow. Yall just so political about that fight you dont want to say it. Thats so delusional
get teal swan on here….. plssssss
Why are they in fancy dress...
Really? Still using "the count" excuse??? Wow.
Joe :  show us the video.  I would like to see it and know what you know.
why the duck can they never cut to the tv screen on time when viewing a video screen?. I think this Jamie guy needs some staff to assist him or who ever does the camera work.
Tony is annoying.
Why the f@ck do they all have on ACTORNOT clothes. Oh I forgot its because Toe Rogan is a government shill who pushes lies and uses his show for propaganda. .........earth is flat and stationary, space as we've been taught does not exist. The moon landing was a complete hoax.
I dont u understand why joe always talks about fighting with people who dont know shit about it. its so cringe
I love Fury’s unabashed love and praise for Jesus while Deontay worships Satan and allows himself to be possessed by Demons. Anyone catch the interview where Tyson got Deontay acting all crazy and suddenly saying “My God will beat your God.”? Talk about a messed up thing to say. Jesus had Fury’s back.
You have to learn the rules of boxing.. Showbiz explained it according to the rules and the referee did everything right.
Joe rogan  The ultimate proof that a little knowledge can be dangerous.
The odds of him being named Tyson were pretty high, his parents named him after Mike Tyson.
Imagine watching a boxing match with joe in a sofa and when someone gets knocked down, Joe screams ”OOOOHHHH”
His birth name was Luke not Tyson, he changed his own name to make himself more marketable.
True Re: count delay, but even if the count was picked up the way it should have been, Fury would still get up...his eyes were clear with full attention to the count.
It’s not a ten second ‘fucking’ count 🤬 it’s simply a ten count.
Craziest part is that he was named after Mike Tyson.
👏
I have no issue with the long count...who cares if the count is 10 LONG seconds..all refs go slow usually. It should be 10 long seconds. I disagree with Joe here, I don't think refs are going to stop the fight when Wilder is one of the biggest punchers ever. The fight was an A and the ref was an A+.
Tyson has always sat out counts. If the ref had picked up count where he should have he would have for up. He was waiting 5 to get up. A good boxer when he goes down doesn’t rush up.
Ok but did fury  cheat w/ his glove the second fight like I still don’t have an answer to that
They were fighting for like 20+ minutes bro, that’s a long time to be fighting. Most fights don’t last that long irl.
okay, joe, you are talking nonsense about the counting controversy, WOW!!! know your stuff when you are making statement.
Why does Joe bring this guy on? He doesn’t contribute anything ever
Im a fury fan but I agree with joe if wilder gets a trainer that can teach him footwork and wilder is humble enough to learn the redemption is gonna be crazy wilder ain’t no bum he just got too comfortable with his power he relied on it too much because that’s how he was eating but when someone technical was put in front of him it wasn’t as easy anymore
I love Joe explaining how the count works whilst being almost totally wrong.
Wilder got a long count too if we are being technical in Round 3.
i wonder why joe invites random ppl like this with no knowledgeable opinion on fighting onto his show
ARE  U SERIOUS? SMART BOXERS USE THE WHOLE  COUNT TO THIER  ADVANTAGE 👊
if the ref counted faster then Fury stands faster he was well aware and looking at him, now when Wilder went down on the 11 he was dead and even going out of the ring he almost fell by just raising his hands to the crowd
The one count was long I feel fury should have lost..ref was being a little hesitant, it would have made out for a great 4th fight if wilder would’ve won, overall fury won the fight but it was a great slug fest 🥊
Long longer count could've been handled better regardless of that break you must go figure it out.  Really could've been called too, breaks vs breaks and let the best man win.
Sorry but joe doesn’t know wtf he’s talking about here. He clearly needs to study up on Boxing, as he’s not clear on the rules.
Wasn't this rule invented cuz Jack Dempsey? He would stand over opponent's and just jump on them as soon as they got up. I think a rematch clause required Dempsey to be standing in a neutral corner for the counting to continue. I believe this rule screwed Jack out of a victory and I think he was the one to suggest it. Plz take my knowledge of this with a grain of salt cuz I'm an idiot.
When Wilder was down referee counted slowly also
Joe Rogan kind of looks like Danny Devito
Let's not forget that, by that same counting logic, Mike Tyson never lost to Buster Douglas. I'm just sayin.
Fury was up within 10 seconds both times he went down. Forget about the referee just watch the video timer. Stop with the conspiracy theories lol
Joe, Joe....c'mon man ! greatest heavyweight fight of all time? Of all people....hmmm. Ali,Frazier or Foreman would clean up top 3, 80's, 90's & 2000's in their prime.
I click on a Joe Rogan video and see him in his space suit and it feels like Christmas and cosy.
Amazing fight! I have watched it three times so far.
Showbizz the adult & Counter punch boxing news has debunked this count controversy thing multiple times already. CPN even read the actual rules & regulations on ref counting. It was fair. If Wilder would've went to a neutral corner to begin with, then the count "might've" favored him a little more but the ref has to stop the count to make sure the fighter goes to a neutral corner & not the red or blue corner. It was fair & by the book. Wilder still deserves credit though. He showed a very high level of heart. His will & determination makes him a great fighter to be remembered in the future. It takes more than just the tools. It takes heart & he had it. Both Tyson Fury & Deontay Wilder are awesome to watch!
The closet racist only talked about this topic because fury won
Why is joe spending so much time talking about the loser of the fight
Shadow banned yet again. My subscription and notifications keep disappearing 😒
Their takes on the long count is so wrong. Especially in regards to whether or not the refs should be doing the count. The 10 count is not a 10 second count. The whole point of the 10 count is for the referee to evaluate the health and awareness of the boxer to see if he is fit to continue fighting. 10 is just a standard so the boxer is aware of how long they have to recover and show they are fit to continue. In high profile fights, the count is usually longer than lower profile fights given the importance. Just like in mma. A referee will give more time/chances for a fighter to show they are fit to continue
The ref did a slow count the full entire fight.  So going by that logic Fury should have won via a 3rd round ko.  Stop looking for excuses and conspiracies, Fury is just THAT good.
Tyson would of listened to the count he would of got ups anyway. That’s the least of the referee worries. Deontay looked out of it after getting knocked down Tyson looked fresh as a daisy
FURY WON 3 FIGHTS IN A ROW without any doubt. All 3 fights were total domination.

No if you know boxing and Tyson then you knew he’d come back from that knock down and beat wilder.
In boxing the 10 count is almost never 10 seconds, look at this analysis for the time counts for Fury vs Wilder 3, it shows both fighters had equally generous "10 counts". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k&ab_channel=mrsauce
they cant beat last fight
Watched the British coverage and was 50/50 between both sides. Later watched the american coverage 98% all on Wilder... There was a punch landed count (not used in UK) when Tyson Fury was DOUBLE that of Deontay Wilder the commentators instructed the audience to ignore it.... Wilder didn't even have the integrity to shake Tyson fury hand after.... Expected bit more of the american cousins tbh!!
Rogan is proof how having Google can make you look smart. He is the most dangerous man in America. Became a right wing hero. Leader of the trailer park warrior brigade.🤣😂🤡
I love that when Joe rants.. everyone listens...even though we know they want to put Joe in his place... Everyone is thinking that their opinion is better or more important than Rogan's.. but... because everyone is not more recognized than Rogan...they keep their mouth shut when he rants...priceless.
Fury boxed. wilder looks for one big shot.
Joe Rogan: “If you can teach Deontay to box, he’d be a great boxer”.
Tyson Fury won all 3 fights yet all Joe talks about is how great wilder is and makes excuse after excuse for him getting beaten. Just face it Joe, Tyson Fury is the better boxer period!
How does Rogan not even know fight rules? It’s not 10 seconds, it’s a 10 count! And yes the ref is suppose to stop the count if the opponent is not in his neutral corner. If he is this lose on his knowledge of fight sports something he is an expert on, then makes you wonder about all the other things he talks about
Tyson Fury is at least 3 Joe Rogans tall.
Tyson beat wilder 3 times. You are arguing about the count... It just reinforces the embarssing one sided American bias... Which is the source of so much upset against Americans worldwide.... Never have the humility to admit when your guys lost... Like so spoilt child who hates the kids that has less but was better..... You lost grow a pair and except it.. What a bunch of total planks!!!
Fury was well aware of the count and got up when he needed to. Also check the rules…
As soon as somebody says "10 second count" instead of "10 count" you know they don't really know jack about boxing. Read the referees' rule book, dummies.
Fury still got up on time lol regardless/ the rules are of Widler didnt return to neutral corner the count gets stopped then resumed .... that’s what happened
Tyson fury got a long count it happens but wilder would have won without the long count
Joe Rogan has spent too much time in the company of Alex Jones....
Wilder got a long count in the 3rd , stop looking for excuses !
Joe Rogan is a total douche. What a waste of 15 minutes. Just watch the fight instead. He offers absolutely no insightful, intelligent, or original commentary here. Doesn't he ever get tired of hearing himself talk?
Used to love Rogan podcasts, but now the discussions are dominated by covid and left wing censorship talk. You can find those discussions any and everywhere. Miss the days of obscure topic discussions.
Wlder was getting slow counts too.
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I would also add that George Foreman posted a video about this fight and he says it was the best refereeing he has ever seen in his entire career.  The referee followed the rules perfectly.
Well Cormier sees corruption Everytime a black or a friend loose.
The 2nd "knockdown" in the 4th round was a blatant rabbit punch to the back of the head. An illegal punch. Something Wilder does it a lot. The count made no difference. Fury was not out of it at all. Fury smashed Wilder in this fight and ate his best shots. Wilder could not knock out Fury in THREE fights. So lets not go too crazy about Wilder's power. He has power, but it is manageable. Fury proved it 3 times, and to be honest destroyed Wilder in all the fights.
Joe, neither one of them is a masterful boxer. You need to rethink that statement.
Young Jamie not talking into the Mic. That kids gotalota potential
Hi
The LCD screen showing the count is a need
THE REF put wilder in the corner.... Started counting then STOPPED... MOVED IN THE OTHER CORNER... then continued the count....  Thats the problem
Tyson fury is everything eddie hearn wishes AJ was
Lets Go Brandon!!! 😂
Wilder got no class...
WE ARE OUT OF TIME JOE:  My Father literally was a Firing Room launch controller for Apollo 10, 11, 12, 16,17 and Skylab 2, 3, and 4.  Dad personally knew Wernher von Braun and he knew the EM field was a Quantum Level Gas of Kinetic Dipole Particles just like Nikola Tesla knew and they BOTH  invented a Warp Drive based on EM Kinetic Dipole Theory.  EM Dipoles are very real Joe and have a Mass of about 10^(-60) kg each.  There are 10^(-18) kg of EM Dipole Particles kinetically colliding with everything per cubic meter of vacuum on Earths Surface.  This is the cause of gravity.  EM Dipole collisions with your dipoles.  The Force of Gravity comes from the net collision forces which will be directed DOWN (The direction of the local EM Field Quantum Kinetic Dipole Mass / Energy Density Gradient in local space.    Wernher stopped helping the USA make the Warp Drive and  was afraid the USA would turn it into a Weapon!!!  AND ... DoD turned it into a weapon during Reagan's SDI Star WARs Programs.  This is the NASA Scientist "Ning Li" Drive and it works GREAT!  IT PRODUCES 50g's of EM Field Force.  Then China stole it and made 100's of weapons flying in the skies and under water deployed from Chinese Special Ops Sub Fleet.   I know how the Chinese UAPS work so the US Vets at Funker530 entrusted me to get them the answers and sent me this video for forensics.  Now it is your turn to do forensics.  Chinese UAP Hypersonic Weapons are virtually indestructible.   UAPs are to be used in the Spring against Free Peoples of the World.  Like to hear your comments on the first leaked tape of US Troops Attacking 4 Chinese UAP Hypersonic Kinetic Killer Weapons based on stolen Skunkworks designs from the 1990's.  In Afghanistan, an A10 is dispatched to take done the Chinese UAPs and the Sidewinder Missile controls get "Toasted" by the Microwave RF.  The Explosion is HOT MICROWAVED AIR or PLASMA as the Air interacts with the spinning superconductor generated EM Field Microwaves rotating outside the drone.  BOTH UAPs and the MISSILE survive unexploded....  The missile gravitationally lenses around the UAPs ARTIFICAIL GRAVITY.   A solder on Overwatch filmed the incident then the UAs shoot up 80,000 feet and look like "stars" in the night sky.  Chinese UAPs use Y123 Superconductor impregnated into in spinning in non conductive ceramic disks to densify the EM Field around the drone.   THE UAPs polarize the densified EM Fields via waveguide by hitting the dipoles in the EM Field with Microwave RF.  The Chinese UAPs are based on the EXACT SAME DESIGN as the Bob Lazar Drive.   Everything Bob said is 100% true.  I know.  I am telling everyone about these UAPs and the Quantum Kinetic Dipole Theory that makes them work and how to make your own "EM Field Compression Drive (Warp Drive).  FYI the drones are in what they call a deception mode pretending to be "flares",  BUT US FORCES ARE NOT DUMB?  SO THEY TOOK THE SHOT.  THEY COME BACK 2 MINUTES LATER :  "" youtu.be/_rOdTumdlBs?t=98 ""
John Stossel needs to be on JRE
It's not ten fookin seconds it's a count to ten. Get over it. Fury smashed him.
Is hinchliff gay?
Joe Ivermectin Rogain.
BS Joe, Tyson fuckin kicked his ass 3 times🤣
Tony is one of the worst guests. He never knows anything about the topics. Has no interesting insight. He's there so Joe can go on his long rambles.
Rocky Marciano 43ko’s in 49 fights. One of the many, many reasons why the 20th century caveman was, is and always will be the greatest heavyweight champion of all time
Fury didn't beat the count. Ref and judge was switched last minute (foul play). Wilder was at a disadvantage before the fight even started. And let's not forget, Fury is a cheating piece of ish.  CORRUPTION
joe you really showed your igorance about boxing rules.
Fury only won because wilders tattoos weighed him down, and his water bottle was to full.
*Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.*
If you go check the fight both Wilder's counts and Fury's were spot on perfect. Time them ffs! All spot on
Brooo Youngstown I’m from there
Hey Joe: Deontay Wilder is a hard puncher ...... But He's NOT a special Talent
The ref from wilder vs Fury 1 said the 10 count was never meant to be 10 seconds.  Most people just assume its 10 seconds.  Youll see the ref talking about it in his video being interviewed after the fight finished.
Not the greatest fights of all time. Modern era of boxing is dead.
Joe wearing that Never A Straight Answer jacket... What is your game Joe?
he counted the same for both fighters. go take a look
Why you All wearing Astro-Nots suits? Come on.
Every one talking above Wilder power. Those are loaded punch. Any heavyweight can knock out a guy with loaded punch
Holy shit Redban let himself go bad!
I'll trust all the pro boxers and referees that the refereeing was perfect over a Daniel Cormier and Joe Rogan Sorry Joe, still love you
dana white said joe would blow him if he wanted him to .
No we need a counter 8r timer. Because these officials are throwing fights and cheating.  Take the officials out of count.  It's cheating. You can't defeat the officials and the champion.
Elon. Send joe to space and hold a podcast there. Now that would be great content!
The count didn't matter anyway, it didn't take Tyson 10 seconds to get up.  He was using the refs counting to get up the latest possible, you could clearly see him looking at the ref waiting.
When joe puts on that suit yk it’s going to be a good podcast
Joe rogan know little about boxing , way better fights happen
Your wrong Joe…. We can’t have TWO refs counting at the same time…. The ref takes over the count from the ring side ref… at that point ONLY the ref in the ring controls the count.
CNN Now calls you a "Skeptic" on todays upload.  Joe. the buck stops with you.   They are lying about you many ways offically and this needs to stop.   What will you do about this?
Come on Joe, a good fight, yes, but a good boxing match…… Fury is a B class fighter , Wilder C class at best. This is no Ali/Frazer , lets get that straight
Fury was so unprepared for this fight too, due to sleeping on a hospital floor for a fortnight because his baby was I intensive care
Invite Nick and Nate
always with the excuses. one time maybe, two times unlikely, THREE times?! gimme a break. Fury is the better fighter and earned the wins. case closed.
Wilder still doesn’t know he needs to run his ass to the neutral corner So that the count isn’t interrupted by the the ref.
It was a good fight could of went either way really glad Tyson won
Joe looks like he's going to a disco
This is the only time when joe’s opinion should be valid when he talks about fighting.  For some reason people give people they respect or people who have success an all encompassing pass of intelligence. When these people only have a specific realm that there opinion should be valid. No one should think joe is special out side of fighting commentary or comedy. Especially not give this guy sway over your health decisions who has no qualifications in the healthcare.
Are they playing Astronauts
Love this show!
Why people banging on about the long counts?? Deontay wilder only has himself to blame and ref was only following the rules if a fighter is knocked down its down to the referee to ensure the opponent goes to a neutral corner the ref has to also make sure that fighter stays in neutral corner while giving the count if the opponent leaves the neutral corner the ref has to stop the count and make him go back to the corner then  resume counting was all fair play and the ref followed the rules to a tee
the queensberry rules state that if a ref has to interupt his count, he must start where he left off
How does Fury compare to the all time greats?
The count was legit stop talking ass!
Literally every single factual statement they make about the fight is objectively wrong. That was absolutely maddening to listen to.
Had money on Wilder winning in 4th. would have  payed  a grand. I was screaming after Tyson went down second time in 4th. Then I cried.
The ref has to start the count once the opponent is in the corner
what are you going to say when you go befor him guys hell is real you don't want to spend youre eternity in hell burning and saying if only i would have accepted Jesus as my savior come to his arms he is waiting for you!!!! i love you in Jesus name i just want you to be saved God bless you Don't have to respond just think about it he gave us free will so is youre choice if you let him in your heart and let the holy spirit change you life
That was a fun fight.
My friends will forever be grateful to me for making them watch this fight!!!!  It was so fun and the undercard was pretty good too…..  The ref besides that one count was amazing and let them fight I liked him and I usually dont like refs
This needs to be a tv show. Rogan is killing it
Great fight, still amazed that fury was 40lbs heavier and wilder almost got the win with lesser skills.  If wilder is a bum, how is fury so great by beating him?
Now I'm certain Rogan knows nothing about boxing or is biased af. Wilder was inferior and a sore loser, while Joe is just up his butt nonstop. Have some decency, man.
No need to clarify Tyson got hit hard when he was downed. Takes more than a normal punch to down that meat mountain.
It's a 10 count, not a 10 second count. Ref controls the count always
WOW joe wow saying there's not a boxer in history that has as many knockout's as wilder ok so why would you say that Mike Tyson had 44 knockouts  with 50 wins and holds record for most first round knockouts that's killing wilders knockout's JOE YOUR IGNORANT TO BOXING HISTORY STICK WITH MMA
Love Joe, but I'm far more excited about hearing his fight recap than I was watching the fight. Wilder is(was) an overrated unskilled right hand bomber with little to no stamina or chin. Fury is respectable, but hardly one of the greats.
The problem with his lcd countdown… the guy on the ground can’t hear it…
Fury is an animal he was always getting up and he still got knocked down again after it haha  Fury is just better
They made good money for their efforts. Everybody loves to watch the big boys bang.       Both are great fighters, hard headed,and have the stamina of lightweights.
Fury’s chin helps
When a fight is as big as Fury Vs Wilder 3 and with the amount of bad blood in the build up, referees should not be the main factor in the outcome of a fight! Wilder has had so much referee help over his fights, at least shine a light on both sides of it! ‼️💯🥊🥊
Wilder makes a pretty good punching bag. Too many excuses.
Like when TYSON actually knocked out Douglas in the 9th round it was a 14 second count
Quit making excuse for wilder Fury beat him 3 times now. Fair and square
Joe please Wilder is good but not even close to hitting as hard or having a skill level of a Mike Tyson
Sounds like a wilder wank fest
Joe should look at the rules, he's supposed to stop the count and resume, he's supposed to pick up the count from the time keeper after directs him the corner when he first goes down which he does. So no mistake was made
A count isn't even supposed to start until the other fighter is in the neutral corner.  Wtf is he on about here?
Amazing that Wilder managed to put on 30lbs of lean muscle without body fat. And without 'roids too? 🤣
i used to love hosting UFC PPV fights when i was in the military. wildin
That gave him a 30 second break
It was a great fight. The boxing wasn’t great
What about the doctor stepping in the ring to examine whilder mid round?
If someone gets knocked down, they should throw up a tent and do a full concussion protocol. Then resume fighting.
They were talking about how ironic his name “Tyson Fury” is but he was literally named Tyson after Mike Tyson 😂
I dont undetand why people are makins such a big deal with counting.. WHEN did you last time see somebody counted out, because he stood up like to late 1 or 2 too late? Either they are knoced da fuk out.. or They are looking to referee and looking at him how he is counting.... If judge would have counted 2 s faster, fury would get up 2 s faster... to me this is stupid... They are counting out people who referee see they are our of their mind... fury was not.. so this COUNT 10S flat.. its stupid! Its never been the point of 10s...
Did you Really see the Fight joe؟ the ref left the Count at 4 and he restarted counting at 6
I grew up watching boxing as my dad used to box when he was young. Nowadays, I only watch MMA bc of boxing world shenanigans. But the one thing that caught me by surprise in this fight is the “stop and break” the ref was constantly calling. I had forgotten about that. Great fight though.
This was not a race guys this was a battle, a few  more seconds on his ass when Tyson got knocked down didn't make him win , he won because he's a force to deal with , I would never want a show stoped if it can go on
I would go that he panicked. He is supposed to pick up the count of the other ref at ringside. It happens.
Error, corruption or the fact that nobody likes a sore loser?
To much talk of wilder on this interview.you would have thought he won.
Rogan needs to stick to UFC and while doing that read the boxing rules of a ref count….. 🍩
Joe Rogan knows what he is saying
It's not 10 seconds, it's a 10 count. The referee makes a subjective decision about the condition of the boxer. Fury was clearly ready to go again. He also said Fury "used his experience" to beat Wilder, when Wilder is the older fighter with more pro bouts. This podcast feels like the morning after a drinking session, where everyone wishes they just went back to their own house to sleep, but now they have to sit and make awkward conversation for a couple hours until it's polite to leave.
You mean to say for just a merely seconds u can recover fast with that knockdown, that slow count is BS !!!
I can stand Bruce Buffer, I can stand Buffering but when Bruce Buffer starts Buffering I start Suffering
So it's the count now ? . I have never heard so many excuses for one fighter !
So Tyson Fury did really loose that 1st fight because of a long count🤔
Bro I really really miss The JRE on YT . Spotify sucks donkey balls
Fury follows the refs count before getting up at 8 both times.
I can't watch sports not even football by myself, I have to watch it with a crowd
No anti-vax bs, Joe?
Run a timer and you'll see both Wilder and Fury had long counts. Fury also got up at 8 seconds on both knockdowns
again it is not a 10-second count  its a 10 count
Didn't think that Joe could be biased...
Fury never looked dazed
It was so obvious that wilder was struggling and dazed mid fight
The referee counts to ten at any speed he sees fit, it is not a ten-second count, the ref is looking for tells from the fighter in trouble to see if he is still compos mentis if the ref thinks the fighter is too badly injured he will end the fight before the count of ten, as he did when Wilder hit the deck for the last time. Add into the mix the fact that Wilder doesn't seem to understand the rules of boxing i.e "Go to a neutral corner Deontay!" and you can see how confused Americans might be about the fact that your boy took a hell of a beating, "Thrice!" and he still hasn't got the class to admit it.
We British new fury would win
Tyson Fury is the bollocks
The Americans making up excuses wilder was destroyed 3x by the gypsy king
Joe, stick to your fucking lane.  You know nothing about Boxing or it's many ridiculous rules.  The 10 count has NEVER been 10 seconds count.  It's ALWAYS up to the ref.
Joe talking absolute shite about boxing again. Wilder's not even in the all-time top 100 when it comes to KOs.
“Did you see the fight?” “No” Approximately 8 minute later… “I touched her shoulder and told her that guy who got knocked down is gonna win that fight… I knew”
Wilder skipped leg day  The man feet was wobbling in the second round. I'm not a fan of either or the sport since I've gotten into it because of KSI. A part of me wanted him to win. He didn't gave up like how is he still standing lol ( I remember saying why tf Wilder spamming the same moves and headhunting, later Sugar at ring side said *"His doing the same sh-t"*  I'm learning and paying attention so that's good) . That's some real life Anime Protagonist sh-t. Great fight, too bad Wilder depending too much on that head hunt right hand combo.
If you want to see a bad count see Wilder Ortiz 1...Ortiz was literally robbed at the end of the round and the start of the next round it was very shocking. Theres no rule that the count should keep going while a fighter is sent back to a neutral corner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObX71G00620 fury up in 8 seconds, sorry joe
Love both of these fighters! Fury is a Goat! Wilder is a goat! The fight is a goat! Love them both. But skill separates the boxers from the fighters.
did you see the fight? no  convo over
Wilder didn't go to his corner when he knocked Fury down so the ref told him to go to his corner which meant he stopped counting which meant Fury had more time to recover so there's no conspiracy about it just common sense which Wilder doesn't have lol.
Looks like Redban bought the Tom Segura costume from YMH merch store
Rogan says fury is one of the greats then goes into a conspiracy theory .., Why can’t you Americans understand you ain’t any good anymore at this , at democracy or militarily .. .. your getting your .. kicked and China is up next ..
Think joe’s wrong here about the count (But judging on British rules here ), it’s called a 10 count and not 10 seconds, this is why they don’t use stop watches or have the count on a massive screen when a fighter falls . The ref will only start/continue the count when the opposite fighter goes to the furthest neutral corner. Wilder should damn well know that by now after knocking out  40+ people. Seen so many fights where the ref has scream at a fighter to go/stay in the correct corner. If Wilder kept his emotions in check he could have won but tbh even Wilder’s second knock down they gave him a lot of time to recover as well. Great fight nonetheless.
The ref is Russell Mora. He's ref'd Pacquiao v Ugas, Berchelt v Valdez, Lomachenko v Lopez, Canelo v Kovalev, Pacquiao v Broner. But sure, Rogan hasn't seen him so he must be a nobody incompetent ref.
So I can tell Joe & many folkes don't know ish about boxing. The count is not 'seconds' it's a ref count. And the count is picked up from the ref from the outside timekeeper then the ref takes over alone. The ref stops the count if a fighter is not at the furthest neutral corner and then picked up back at the number the ref left off. The time keepers count seizes once the ref has taken over.
Stop being stupid Rogan and READ THE GODDAMN RULES! The count was proper, even McCarthy says you're an idiot!
Rogan is getting on my nerves
HARD
They love to talk about a long ten second count that likely would have made no difference, yet one of Wilder's knockdowns was a clear blow to the back of the head.
What a bullshit .. 3 guys who have no clue at all.
Wait wtf if the referee didn’t count properly doesn’t that mean that the commission has to review it
See Mike Tyson and Buster Douglas fight that was a long count as you see the white glove in the background count to 13
Street fight. No finesse.
Wrong about the count rules. The count is paused if the opposite fighter does not comply with the rules to go to their corner. This is largely due to how Boxing was before the rules were implemented where they were able to start swinging as soon as they stood back up.
Tyson's performance again proved how good he is even if his training and conditioning was not 100% this time round. Hats off to the Gypsy King.
Earth is flat. Joe sold out now wearing nasa uniforms.
Only in 2021 does Joe have to clarify "queer street" 🤦🏻‍
His dad named him after Mike Tyson. Fury's dad's favorite boxer was mike Tyson
George Foremen won 68 fights by knockout! 🤷‍
If the boxer goes to the neutral corner but then moves away from it, the ref can stop the count tell them to go back to the corner and then start the count again from where he left off (not the time keeper).
It’s a crime that Joe didn’t do a fight companion for it.
Fury was getting up to the Refs count, using as much time as he could. Experience is the key.
"look at that fat roll down"
U should get a camera for jamie.
Talking rubbish as normal. George Forman has more ko's than Wilder. First fight wasn't a long count.
IF you are not the neutral corner the count is not stated at all. If you leave the neutral corner the count is stopped! That's why you see some fighters run to the neutral corner after a knock down
Did Tony have gay conversion therapy? He seems a couple % less gay
Wilder would have been hospitalised if he’d carried on in the 2nd fight.  Stop blowing smoke up his arse.
He wasn’t that hurt.
Please stop making excuses!!! That's just disgusting!!!!!!
Showbiz adult has a video explaining this to u joe the timekeeper stops after ref takes the count
Why these dummies dressed up like weirdos🕴️
Can’t stand Joe’s “affirmative action” praise of Wilder or this general trend of smothering athletes with praise JUST for their skin colour.  If skin colours were reversed Joe would be non-stop talking about how legendary Fury was and how dominant his performance was.  Americans have a fking weird approach to race matters/political correctness.🧐
Tyson would have got up whatever the count was.
Joe was man enough to admit the judge was corrupt and counted incorrect and slow. He knows as a professional ref what he was doing. That's why thus judge was called in just two days before the fight.
Will Power has one of the greatest names in sports
ITS NOT A TEN SECOND COUNT, its a ten count.
Prince Nazeem. Had power and movement.
Is Rohan trying to be an Astronaut or missy Elliott
Yanks stretching for excuses for wilder now lol.
It would be cool if Joe did a thing where people win to go on jre podcast and smoke weed with...
Its not a coincidence he is actually named after Mike Tyson FYI
Joe knows jack shit, about how counts work in boxing.

@ all and you JR https://youtu.be/GGbFnAz2TeI
What the fuck is with the NASA club?
What a shite podcast wilder has a shite record knocked guys out that are not even real level boxers.  Fought fury and couldn't knock him out in 3 fights hitting him with this god given hardest punch what a hype job
Also calling bs on most knock outs, if you dont know shit stop talking about it, braggin americans, 41 knockouts doesnt even come close to the most knockouts in history, do your homework
The ref can stop the count, if the fighter breaks the rules of knock down, witch wilder did, he came out the neutral corner, if wilder had stopped in his corner he would have won, but he chose to come out his corner, therefore the ref stopped the count...
Being a fan of both fighters I still wish people would give Tyson Fury his credit in a win and stop always saying something to deter from his victory. Great when by Tyson and fantastic heart by Wilder enough said
These americans are such a whining bunch of people, all the excuses, tyson fury was the best boxer in 3 games, all the excuses its pathetic
Ahh Joe Rogan huffing glue again sticking up for Professor Klump DC saying it was a slow count.  The Ref makes the ten count and that’s what Fury responded to.  All that elk meat is bad for you got bacteria 🦠 in it..
Y'all don't know s*** about boxing
So Tyson Fury didn’t legitimately win the fight. If those are the rules of boxing then Deontay wilder was involved in a rigged competition.
Tyson was alert at the referee's count, he just used some precious time to rest. If he counted faster, he would be at his feet earlier. He is just a smart guy besides a great boxer
Fury wins mentally the fights way before it starts!!!
7 knockdowns between the two fighters in ONE FIGHT, that’s crazy I can’t even imagine being someone that had money on the fight wether I had Fury or Tyson winning I would have had a heart attack either way
Hos punch is that hard, Tyson got up from it twice and knocked him out.
Wilder was mauled/beaten up badly 3 times, he only have his lucky  right hand... if from some reason they will do 4 fight he may end up death or in wheelchair with brain damage.
Didn’t mention the doctor coming in the ring to examine Wilder at the beginning of the round.  I’ve never seen that happen before, that gave Wilder ample time to recover. Anyway, it was fantastic fight!
You not gonna keep ducking this Dave Chapelle smoke. We want to hear it. What you got to say B ‼️‼️‼️
Kinda wish fury loss so we could get a 4peat
Joe stop talking shit fury mauled wilder
Nice clip Joe. A great contest it was
Joe Rogan should have a slit screen when he’s watching a video
haRRRRRRRD
Is anyone going to mention the wilder count in the 3rd? It was exactly the same
It's not Furrys fault it's the refs, Furry is clever he uses the count to his advantage. If you had to get up at 5 he would. Stop the bulshit Furry won like a man, Wilder lost like a man.
Crap fight one of the best my ass bar brawl with no fitness that  wasn't boxing.
45MAGA are US. Trump v Biden II Coming To Rumble... BigGuyBiden running for 15 rounds from the Orangeman! Are U Ready For That.
Greatest boxing matches of all time?? Wasn’t a boxing match fulla
In response to the comments [DC & Joe] about Tyson fury's second knockdown in the 4th round- I just rewatched the fight and Tyson gets hit by the punch with 21 seconds left on the clock, he hits the floor with somewhere between 20 - 19 seconds left. Then Fury is fully up and looking at the ref by 11 seconds left in the round, so whatever the refs count [ which is 6 by the way at 11 seconds left ] Fury was only down for 8 or 9 seconds! case closed if you watch it with a specific view of the ring clock.
Tyson was named after a TV dinner.
Tysons father named him after Mike Tyson. So the odds are pretty high.
Fury wasn't out when Wilder dropped him. Look at his eyes.
Joe your wrong the referee was right in what he done it was a perfect count also if that did happen fury would have still got up he is a clever fighter when he gets dropped he takes his time and uses the count
The referee can use their own initiative depending on the situation on how long to make the count as every knockdown is different
The ref was excellent, there's about a 7 minute interview where he explains everything,  I'm sure you can find it easily
How does rogan not know that it ain’t a 10 second count but a 10 count?????? Guys been in the fight business for years. Keeps saying a lot of dumb things lately! (Weights)
Stop looking for excuses
Fury was listening to the count from the ref, he timed it perfectly he knew exactly what he was doing. Is he meant to jump up early because he is thinking about the timer outside. His job is to listen to the ref, ref superseeds EVERYONE
Fury lost the 1st fight  wilder slept that man the ref took forever to count even told Wilder to go back to his corner never should of happen was definitely a 10 count
His name is LUKE FURY Tyson was given to him later in life.
Joe “Greatest of All Time” Rogan
Lets see after some years if those punches from wilder won't affect his health. That punch from wilder is devastating
Hey joe I remember you on night court a nd fear factor. I never really watched your pod casts but I always liked you. BUT AFTER YOU KICKED SANJAY GUPTA IN HIS  CNN LYING ASS. I LOVE YOU MAN.🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
6ft 7 loool not 6ft 9 Pahaha
How many excuses does wilder get tho? The guy complains about everything oh my toe nail was hanging I had to take a shit.  I had a headache wilder is full of excuses dude give wilder a 4th fight so we can hear the excuses lol
Does Joe work for NASA?
All the, "what ifs" and "maybe if's" doesn't change the results at the end of the day Manchester Man Tyson Fury fucked wilder up 🥊🇬🇧
I think this fight showed how good both fighters were. Both showed grit and determination, skill and power.
It’s odd seeing a beta male like Tony pretend to talk about boxing.
I wanna see fury v Paul......
Wilder got knocked out right in front of his mrs she now has one over him For the rest of his life how do you get out of that one
There also wanting to go to 🚀 space
I can definitely see how having a lot of power can hold a fighter back, like all those super fast dudes who never learned to do anything else
Greatest name of all time is dick hammer
joe was shitting on boxing 20 years back
Whatever Joe long count my arse Tyson won all 3 fights easily! Different class
Robed ?? He said that ? No way
joe keeping jamie in check
Joe is wrong here! Ref is SUPPOSED TO PAUSE the count when the other fighter isn’t in neutral corner. Check the rules .
He did the same for Wilders count.
The whole thing with the count on Fury was that he was watching the ref and was not concussed. Wilder was pretty fucked in Rd 3 and bell saved him to. Only one of them couldn't get back up
I’ve also see where boxing refs have said the count isn’t like a video game. That the 10 is a guideline. It’s not a race to be up by 10. It’s a 10 to see if the person can continue.
Fury could have got up earlier, he was using the full count to get up cos he's smart.  If the ref had come back at 6 Fury would have got up earlier.  And Wilder should have gone to his corner instead of prancing around.
LETS GO BRANDON!!!
“Look at his fat ripple”
Joe Rogan doesn’t know shit. Boxing refs have explained Wilder did not go to the right corner. The rules state to stop the count and put the standing fighter into the correct corner. Wilder is not a good boxer and doesn’t pay attention to the technical aspects like this. If you watch any boxer not named Wilder they stay down until 8. Wilder hops up doesn’t recover and proceeds to get his brains bashed in.
Fury ppls champ out boxed out classed the dosser
Yep Joe Rogan sold out. The old Rogan would never explain his usage of “Queer street”   That being said I’m stealing the term.
Tony Hincliffe sucks
so many wrong things said in this video. hope they did some research
It's great to hear Tyson get the credit he deserves.  He tells the story that he was born prematurely and tiny, doctors told his parents he wouldn't survive, so his father  called him Tyson, to help give him the fight to live.  It worked.  He'd be great on the Joe Rogan Podcast, ask him what it's like to be an Irish traveller in this world.
Sugar Ray has 108 KOs, Kid Aztec has 114 kos, Billy bird has 138 kos, dozens of boxers with more kos than Wilder. Check your info Joe.
Fury was waiting out the count resting. If it had been quicker  he would  have got up quicker.
Actually Joe you are wrong.  The ring ref that is outside the ring will start count when the boxer hits the ground.  The referee inside the ring can delay or not start the count until the opponent goes to a neutral corner.  He does not continue with the outside count the is done separately.  The only count that actually matters is the in ring count & that can be delayed or paused until the opponent goes to a neutral corner.
Well done Joe on getting Tyson Furys name right, Well done, I recall u having trouble 2 weeks after interviewing him before, referring to him as "The mental health guy" u complete thicko.
John Fury named Tyson after Mike Tyson by the way.
The outstanding skill of Tyson Fury is that he can take punches. Wilder is one of the hardest punchers in the game. The way he was landing those big punches on Fury, should have been enough to knock him out cold! But that's the thing, Tyson can handle those big hits. Wilder is use to bombing on guys with less stamina and discipline than Fury, which is why he ultimately got mad disappointed that none of his power punches were knocking out Fury.   Fury is just too smart, too strong and way too disciplined. The kid was born to fight.... Wilder entered boxing at 19, which is 19 years too late in Fury's books....
Sure listen to the dude in the space suit.  “It’s like I totally knew he was.gonna get up a win this fight”.  Yeah maaan.
Fury would have got up when he needed to, so he may have had a little more rest but I seriously doubt he would have been counted out.
It's horrible listening to Rogan talk about boxing, but amusing as a curiosity.
Joe Rogan reveals he knows nothing about boxing.  "One of the best boxing matches of all time."  Really?  Wilder sucks as a fighter.  Terrible technique.  Ali-Frazier I is a great fight.   Joe Rogan, talk about MMA or working out, but not boxing.
Joe your on our side ...I am so grateful for intelligence and insight  GOD bless you and your family
There was no long count in the 4th. I went back and counted it like 5 times. He was up by 8
Lol 1.6 M/1000 times 18$ Joe making money still on youtube
Tyson Fury just proved that Skills beat Talent, when talent fails to work hard.
That was way worse than Tyson vs Douglas
Wilder has sting beans for legs
I would also add that George Foreman posted a video about this fight and he says it was the best refereeing he has ever seen in his entire career.  The referee followed the rules perfectly.
Nice work 🎆
Tony is proof that you can have a career in comedy just by being Rogan’s friend
Joe 'Im going to have a subtle bitch because I love Wilder' Rogan
Can I be Jamie for one day no pay but just to see one of these live. Just like you I’m willing to take a chance (ufc) thank joe for your amazing work
Joe and these guys prattle on with such conviction about things they are completely wrong about very often.  Unreal how certain they are about what they've heard from a friend of a friend or some rumour that somebody said this thing...this stoppage count BS is trivial but it's dangerous sometimes when discussing politics and such and millions of people watch you
Wilder will never beat Fury,  he should retire now to avoid mental health issues
Joe’s jacket is so cool where did he get it ?
Everyone was waiting for this
The count, Fury being such a great boxer, will wait till the "8" before getting up. If the ref was counting faster, still at "8" Fury would have got up. 100%
Ah yes I’ve been waiting to see what Tony has to say about the fight 🥴
Other than old Klitschko and Wilder (who can't box) who has Tyson beat?
its crazy how people let emotions and preference dictate facts. If you set a timer and the count lasted longer than 10 seconds, there is no debate. Its wrong. I haven't counted but IF it is longer there is no arguing. Its silly. And ima Tyson fan.
Hey y'all can I borrow 20 bucks till payday love all y'all.
Joe is so rude to Jamie sometimes
Wilder should retire now.  He's mentally crushed
Jeff Mayweather says the count is legitimate, and I'm sure he knows more about boxing than Joe does
Big James Tony would fuck him over night night fury
Read the count rules, Joe!
Ali, Frazer, and Foreman in their prime would destroy the fighters of these days.  Fury would've done well because he is a TRUE boxer.  All these other clowns and their idiot trainers are all about the knockout.  Fools...  Technique, Footwork, Intelligence, Timing, Willpower, Endurance, Head Movement, Feints, Defense, Posturing, Mental Toughness, Stamina, Leverage, Etc..., These are the tools a TRUE boxer needs to achieve...  Ali (1964-1968) was the greatest heavyweight fighter ever...  No heavyweight EVER, could've beat him...
Joe needs to get his facts right on how the count works
Joe Rogan. Take a vacation....you have bags un ya eyes seeing the vacation
Funny pants smith😂😂😂
Tony's hilarious but he does his friendship with joe a disservice by never ripping him. Also joe is haunted 😂
Some things should be better left alone, and the art of peugalism should not be discussed by this group whatsoever. Just stay with UFC and everything else in life, Rogan, not boxing. Please..........
"uhhh"  -Jaime
Is their any subject joe doesn’t believe he knows everything? This is what happens when people kiss your ass and tell you how great you are for decades
Tyson Fury is a freak of nature!!! He just keeps getting up no matter how hard he is hit!!!
Tyson lost the count was rigged
The count was slow when Wilder went down too.
I’m not eligible for the vaccine because of a life threatening illness, I’ve been mostly bedridden and in self isolation for two years because of Covid. My doctor prescribed me Ivermectin. I keep it with me at all times if I need it✌️🇺🇸
Wilder is a typical loud mouth piece of crap without an ounce of sportsmanship in his body. He's a disgrace to boxing and to his nation.
this guy tony hinchcliffe sounds like he’s saying something good to act like he knows the topic but he’s actually just saying non sense. Hahaha
Fury was screwed with the two first fights the second fight the referee prevented Fury from knocking out Wilder in fact every time Fury started with a flurry of punches the referee would step in and then deducted  points for it just was the most absurd refereeing I've ever seen in a fight so who cares about the third fight good I'm glad went the other guys wait forever once Tyson Fury is a much bigger stronger better fighter. Boxing is corrupt, they've been protecting Wilder the whole time.
“It was only business” - Connor McFury
Really enjoyed this.  Like everyone else I just wanted to say thanks.  Thanks Joe simply thanks!
I hope these guy’s aren’t planning a trip to Uranus in them thar space suits😂 Joe is the best!✌️🇺🇸
Why is joe wearing aluminum foil
Joe Rogan should announce these fights. The announcers were terrible
Can't believe someone 6'7" went up against someone 6'9".. A true heavyweight bout.
Greatest boxing matches of all time???
Hinchcliff funny
It's not a 10 second count. It's a 10 count from the referee. He's allows to count as fast or as slow as he wants.
Remeber this name in the future: Efe Ajagba
Wilders count was just as slow as furys
Aha you made a mistake joe blow, Rocky Marciano has had 43 Kos and could have had more. Wilder and fury are definitely different boxers.
Big John explains the counting better with Josh.
Joe remember Wilfredo Gomez
I'm 15 right now and more into boxing than anyone I know. I don't have to the money to buy the fight and tbh it's one of my biggest regrets at this time. That I was into boxing and alive at the time that one of the greatest fights of all time took place and I couldn't watch it. That shit sucks
Wilder got K’d TFO
Crazy idea...  Make the count automated..  As soon as fighter is down, ref gives signal to start clock....  That's it.  Why not do this?  Tradition?  Like how they didn't allow plays to be reviewed via tape in MLB even though we've had that technology for decades.  Tradition is cool until it's fucking pointless.
Joe doesn't know the knock down rules of boxing, look it up. It's also not a second count but the rules are all written down, try reading them and not just believe anyone spouting their opinion.
Fury has Wilder’s number. Saying the fight was one of the greatest is like being starved for the violence of 80’s cartoons and seeing the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers for the very first time. Deontay started off nice in the first three rounds and was gassed and later hurt. He immediately began to fight on instinct and went right back to swinging at air hoping for a knockout. With his hands being so low, I’m shocked he didn’t get his jaw broken. Fury woke up and out fossilized him.
Joe is talking as a fan, who by the way is high as a kite. Why people take his opinion seriously on ANYTHING continues to baffle me.
Whos this nerd thats commentating with Joe? goofball
Fury was listening to the ref and would have got up no problem.
Dang redban looks old as fuck! He was just a little kid back in the og days now he looks older than Joey Diaz! WTF
According to the rules of the New York and New Jersey boxing commissions, a knockout is not necessarily 10 seconds, but rather a count of 10.  "A 10-count is not done by a stopwatch," said Larry Hazzard, a former referee and now chairman of the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board. "That's splitting hairs. The question is, did the fighter beat the count and can he continue?"
Joe Luis # heavy weight of all time. And the best of the top 5 all before the 60's 50's
The only thing young Jamie shouts out is.... I GOT FAT LINES BRO!!!!
Mike Tyson knocked out Buster Douglas in the original "long count" controversy. Wilder wasn't in his corner, he was lurking where he shouldn't be.
You got 5’5” Joe Rogan telling 6’7” Deontay Wilder what he needs to work on when those two knockdown punches on Fury would've put any other human being in the morgue 😂🤣
YouTube really fucked up by not giving Joe Rogan a bit more money/leniency to keep his podcast here. Spotify is just BOOMING
Jesus Joe, there are a ton of HW champions with more KOs than Wilder.
Every single knockdown in boxing history has had a long or wrong count. Nothing new. I mean nothing.  Not correct but not even worth talking about.
Fury vs Usyk Boxing gods hear my prayer
The last fighter who had this many white people caring about boxing was Rocky Balboa  Wow, our standards have lowered over the years.   How is Fury one of the greatest boxers when he just had his first Title defense ever? And the only names on his resume anyone could recognize are a 40-year-old Klitschko and a 36 Wilder who never learned how to box??? If he beats the same guy two more times, you'll be ranking him ahead of Ali
Long count convo begins at 5:51  You are very welcome.
Tony isn’t canceled yet?  What a surprise.
Why haven't you discuss the stoppage of the Usyk - Joshua fight 6 seconds earlier? The 12th round, at 2:54?
Wilder might have the best knockout percentage but definitely not the most knockouts. The record is 138 by Billy Bird
Hey Joe my wife can explain why these Trans genders my feel the way they feel she explained it from a mind point spiritual point of view please let me know if you would like to hear it
The difference is out of this world while wearing a nasa uniform.  Lmfao.  Brilliant Joe
U GUYS R SILLY. 😁 LOVE THE COSTUMES.
Joe high ash fucking his sentences n shit lmao
The way the Americans are talking about this fight you would think wilder won lol fury easily won this on second gear he even didn't have time to perp for this fight for personal reasons an still easily knocked wilder out..
There should be a big banner labelled "Boxing" and "beware of misinformation" on this video.
Joe rogan is a punk.. Doesn't know shit.. That count was fair.. they did the same with wilder..
Enough with the count bullshit, fury got up exactly at 8 so he could recoup as much as possible this is a veteran boxing move. If the count was shorter and started earlier he would have gotten up earlier just the same
Fury and wilder, both are warriors no doubt about, the difference is wilder lack a champion mentality which became clear when he refuse to accept the  failure and instead throwing excuses over excuses.
30 pounds of muscle gain at age 35. Hmmmmmm
LONG COUNT DIRTY TACTICS. WILDER REAL CHAMP
I'm surprised that Tyson is only 277 at 6'9.
I think Joe loves controversies more than boxing
This just comes across as saltiness cause "your guy" lost
Joes wrong. Its the refs 10 count. Doesn't matter what the timekeeper is counting. Its called a Refs 10 count. Not a 10 second count by the time keeper or the official seconds
Long Count Debunked  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k
Duncan Trussell vibes
You can count 3 seconds if you want Fury will still get up; hes just using the maximum time. THe count is literally the only thing wilder fans can hang on to. After seeing this fight 3 times im convinced theres absolutely nothing that can keep fury down.
Why are they in Nasa costumes?
should have given Wilder a few more seconds to get up.... he still would have been down  watch the last punch thrown in slow motion and watch the lips nearly get punched off Wilders face
I think even if those two guests left the room for a loo break...joe will be still talking alone😂😂😂
If you're clueless and you want to talk about boxing, dont invite other clueless dudes.
Joe stoner rogan. "Its like watching it live", exhale smoke😂😂😂😂
If you have crazy power that SHOULD NOT BE YOU MAIN TRAIT
Let’s go Brandon
Wilder VS Joshua, Fury VS USYK
JOE is responsible for so much fake info and I think alot of us know. He actually is starting to change his tune in everything politics. If the slow count crap were of any merit, do we not think wilder would file for investigation for a no contest within the allowed grievance filing time? Daniel is another cheater liar who is extremely bias. Do your own research
Referees get paid pretty well at this level. And should be able to count to ten and keep an eye on the guy in the neutral corner. It’s not rocket science! We don’t need “technology” to count to 10 for us. Boxing is possibly the oldest sport there is and the rules are pretty simple. Let’s not complicate things.
Yeah, imagine if he actually trained with Floyd Mayweather! 😨 #themoneyteam
Joe Rogan: look at that fat, watch how that fat ripples, Look at it roll down. Tyson Fury: Not bad for an old fat man with feather dusters as fists.
What are the odds a boxer could be named Tyson. After 150 thousand people who were fans of boxing, or boxers named there sons Tyson.... After Mike Tyson. Like what are the odds. That half the boys with the potential to be boxers. Were named Tyson. That one of them. Could box. Like what are the odds?  Yeah that is a great question stoned man in jump suit.
FFS really guys, the count has been in place basically since the beginning of time (boxing time at least!) I dont understand the current scrutiny around this fight??? I do hope its not driven by the fact that a US opponent has been beaten by a UK boxer?? I'm sure this would not be the case for obvious reasons but am also bemused by why any person would choose to question/challenge the result!!?? This is the third contest with the same result!!! It should not be challenged in any way, the result is conclusive!!! Shut up you mugs anyone that wants to challenge the result!!!!!!!!!!
Like In WWE Royal Rumble 10 second count yo!
@4:06 you just showed u know s*** about boxing,  TF vs MT? The level of skill on Mike T was impeccable,  no way in anyone's mind MT would've DEMOLISHED T Fury.
I miss jre
You don't know shit about boxing
Schilling hard for the fake "space" program. Pushing their atheist agenda. How embarrassing to wear nonsense "astronaut" suits.
His first name is actually Luke f
Tyson was never knocked out so he clearly had his wits and was just timing the count to get as much rest as possible.. it's also not against the rules because the rest can break the count if the other fighter is not where they're supposed to be in the corner
A guy who has crazy power that knows the sweet science 🤔 Sounds like Triple G & Canelo
I've seen refs do the slow count loads of times. Sometimes you see them just about getting up when they're on 9 count but near complete stop counting for them to get up off knees.
When they get Damage they go and bathe and soak !
The referee count adds to the thrill and entertainment, it’s part of boxing even tho not objective
Ali, Tyson, Holmes, Holyfield, Lewis, Foreman & Bowe would've beaten any of today's boxers. The 1970's-1990's were the Golden Years of Heavyweight Boxing.
In both the second and third fight, the obvious reason Wilder lost (and lost he most certainly did) was conditioning.  Mark Breland has said that Wilder is untrainable and Wilder himself has said that he doesn't do roadwork.  Who knows how those two fights would have gone if Wilder had trained properly and come into the fight in top condition, which it was clear that, as Joe said.  He has done nothing throughout his entire career to improve his boxing skills and most of those knockouts were against opponents that were tomato cans.
He was named after Mike Tyson, I really can’t believe how fucking stupid that guy in orange is
Joe is wrong on this one ...
Wearing a nasa badge? How much did you sell your soul for?
Joe, all is fair, because Deontay hit Fury in the back of the head of the second knockdown which is illegal in the sport of boxing.
Read the rules you lost America 😂😂😂😂
In my opinion, it was reported that the U.S. Attorney General who is attacking brave and honorable parents that are standing up to the filth and scum school board members pushing communist propaganda, that his daughter and son-in-law created a business years ago to sell books on critical race theory and sell seminars to teachers on how to brainwash school children on critical race theory. In my opinion, if that is true then the U.S. Attorney General is attacking brave and honorable parents in order to protect his family's business interests of wanting to pollute the minds of children with communist propaganda. But I can't see how that report could be true. Shouldn't we be educating our children in STEM instead of nonsense and trash from the three blind mice? So instead of blaming the dog crap that is biden-harris or his clown-car administration for the death of 13 marines,  shouldn't they be blaming mark and chan zuckerberg. Isn't the blood of those 13 dead marines directly on their hands since they got the scum elected? Well, you know what they say. scum always rises to the top. I had to laugh. I remember mark zuckerberg was before the Senate I think, and a Senator asked him how facebook made money. Another senator laughed, like duh, and said facebook sells advertising. And I thought, it was strange that it was never mentioned that facebook, in my opinion,  sells user's information. I'm guessing that you pay facebook and they send you a file of peoples names, addresses, email addresses, etc. I'm thinking banks, debt collectors, marketers, private detectives, government agencies, etc... Years ago these groups started to get really upset with facebook. They complained they were paying them money for peoples information and it turns out a lot of these people were fake. Fake names, addresses, etc... So that's why facebook started demanding real names and information. They can't sell your information if it is all fake information. The hardest part is getting information into a system. And here the user inputs all that information into the system themselves. Name, address, email address, etc... From there a program takes it and puts it into a database. Then it creates a file to send to the buyer of the user's information by using SQL (Structured Query Language) to access the database. It is all automatic. Using a scheduler program, the computer will wake up a program say at 2:00 am, run SQL to select the data that the client requests into a file and places it into a folder. Another program outside facebook may connect to that facebook's server's folder via SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and copy the file to their server. Then they'll upload the file data to their database. All done automatically. You write a program once and from then on it does it's job automatically.
I had to laugh when a supposed facebook whistleblower frances haugen was on pravda minutes. In my opinion, this was all orchestrated. The first clue is that frances haugen initiated all this. She purposely took documents belonging to facebook and whined to a government agency. Nobody initiated contact with her. Second, the reporter on pravda minutes assigned to this story was scott pelley. In my opinion, a willing propagandist and a point man for the cabal so to speak. When there were questions about the elections in Georgia, scott pelley was the reporter assigned to create a story, in my opinion, to poo-poo the idea that the Georgia election was fraudulent. Your second clue is that the facebook whistleblower during the interview went out of her way to propagate the democratic communist party's mantra, "insurrection". Your next clue is rather than her giving her worthless opinions in a meeting room in private she goes before a committee where she gives some half-fast unintelligible nonsense even a 15 year could debunk. Just because she has a job in hi-tech, I'm supposed to take the useful idiots opinion seriously. She reminds me a lot of the theranos lady. And her solution, in my opinion, is for her to be in charge of a government oversight body to censor facebook and media companies to solve this imaginery “crisis” created by her.  More than likely, she wants to censor people who disagree with her half-baked and ignorant political beliefs. Her goal, in my opinion, almost exactly aligns with what the democratic communist party has been trying to do ever since the people revolted against the entrenched elected officials and unelected bureaucracy in washington dc by electing trump. In my opinion, she is an over-educated attention whore with marginal job skills. She probably had a job that anybody could do, a desk jockey paper pusher at a tech company, and became so full of herself that she decided to try and create a position for herself which would allow her to stick her nose into everyone else's business. She's just another over-educated useful idiot with a worthless opinion. What is interesting is that pravda minutes and scott pelley are not being treated the same way as  Julian Assange. Here, pravda minutes is in possesion of stolen documents by an alleged whistleblower, and along  with other news outlets publishing excerpts from the stolen documents. Yet they are not being gone after  like Julian Assange was. This strategy used by the democratic communist party to create a fake "crisis" was brought to light  during the second gulf war. A few years after the invasion, I remember Tim Russert saying that the washington media  were manipulated and they shouldn't have let it happen. The only thing I would say in defense of the deep state was that sadam husssein was given a chance to leave the country. If he would have left the country, it would have saved a lot of lives and money. So a lot of it can be placed directly on sadam husssein.  My opinion is that the media were in on it. An example of this strategy. On a Friday, a deep state operative would be in a  bar and leak to one of his contacts in the media misinformation. At the time, it was sadam hussien was trying to acquire tubes in order to refine material to make nuclear weapons. It was an outright lie. Then they would print the story Saturday on the front page and attribute the information to an anonymous source. Immediately after the story is published, the Sunday political talk shows would call the white house and ask them to come on the Sunday morning political talk shows to discuss the story. Then on Sunday dick cheney would be seated with Tim Russert on face the nation on nbc and be asked about the story that was published on Saturday that sadam hussein was trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And he'd say we can neither confirm nor deny the story but we're hearing a lot of chatter through our intelligent networks that blah, blah, blah, ... You'll remember that a cia guy said the tube story was a lie. In retaliation, the administration leaked to the press that his wife was a cia agent and I think the media published her name. And you remember powell went before the united nations with the tube story. He went through with telling the lie to the united nations but later said he didn't like doing that. I guess he got his cake and ate it too. He took one for the team and then later tried to play the victim. The point is, this is all orchestrated theatre to manipulate the public. In my opinion, the same strategy was being used recently  when a government official who was in charge of software or something threw a hissy fit and quit his job.  Saying that the United States is 20 years behind china in cybersecurity.  So he's going to go before a committee and want billions of dollars. And in my opinion, it will be tied to the "human" infrastructure bill. The democratic communist party will say, look our hands are tied. We have to spend all this money. You heard his testimony. We'd like to balance the budget but this is a matter of national security. So $500 million dollars will go for cybersecurity equipment and the remaining trillions of dollars will go to the least productive members of society "human infrastructure" in order to buy their votes so that the democratic communist  party can stay in power forever. This is the deal with zuckerberg and his wife. I include his wife because her name is on the foundation that was created in order to, in my opinion, steal the election.  A cabal reporter reported that zuckerberg created a foundation with $300 million dollars called  the mark and chan zuckerberg whatever-the-name was foundation. This was done to ensure a fair election  the reporter said. The reporter then went on to describe in great detail how, in my opinion, they  went about stealing the election. So why would mark zuckeberg want to, in my opinion, steal an election? You have to go back years. A number of years ago, mark zuckerberg created a different foundation. This  foundation was to lobby the government for immigration reform. I always laugh when they use the word "reform". They want to change our immigration laws but they use the word "reform" instead because it makes it sound like there is something wrong with our immigration laws. Of course, there is nothing wrong with our immigration laws. But they have to brainwash the populace into thinking there is something wrong  with our immigration system and it needs to be reformed. Why would mark zuckerberg care? Because he employs IT workers. As does all the hi-tech companies in the United States. The large corporations spent at least $100 billion dollars building what they call "technology centers" in india. They are really training centers. That is, in STEM you learn by doing. And if you aren't doing, you aren't learning and being trained. The big tech companies want to flood the United States with IT workers from india. The big hi-tech companies are pissed that they are forced to hire and train United States citizens. Their reasoning is that we have all these indians in india we trained, they call them southeast asians but basically they are all indians directly from india, and the scumbag United States citizens are bitching about us flooding the United States with these indian IT workers so they can take jobs away from United States citizens. The homeland security director during the trump administration was running around telling everyone that they need to flood the country with indian IT workers as a matter of national security. Bloomberg was whining about not being able to flood the country with IT workers from india. The idea for them is that they are spending a lot of money training indians in india and they'll be damned if they also have to spend money training scumbag United States citizens. Microsoft was so pissed about not being able to flood the country with IT workers from india that they threatened to move the company to Vancouver, Canada because their immigration policies were far more laxed. Recently, tim cook at a meeting for all apple employees at their headquarters told the employees that he was going to have a talk with biden-harris about the United States immigration policies. He wasn't talking to United States citizens. He was talking directly to all the southeast asians, that is, indians that are in this country directly from india. I remember an H1-B visa once told me he thought the United States was really stupid to allow all these indians to come over to the United States and take their good paying jobs away from them in their own country. He couldn't understand why. trump was sympathetic to the plight of United States citizens whose lives were destroyed when hi-tech companies fired them and hired indians from india to replace them. Highly skilled workers? Just hi-tech propaganda. trump needed to be defeated. hi-tech wanted him out. You wonder why your kid is still living at your house in the basement while H1-B visas indian citizens in this country are driving BMW's and having anchor babies? Thank the hi-tech companies who refuse to hire your kid and train them. What they'd rather do is spend money to brainwash your children with nonsense and garbage like black lives matter propaganda from the three blind mice or critical race theory brainwashing crap.
I love Joe Rogan but he is wrong about the count. The ref is the one in control, he stopped the count to tell Wilder to go to a neutral corner which is what he is supposed to do. 🥊
No denying it was a long count. Fury gets knocked down for the second time with 20 seconds to go and the round/countdown finish pretty much at the same time. Don't think it would have changed the outcome but there's a real issue there.
I think it’s a disservice that we didn’t get to see Joe rogan reacting to this fight while it was live..
If you had to pick who you picking  ALI OR FURY 🥊
Joe lost me at 7min mark
I want to see the female heavy weight champion go against Tyson Fury, I think that would help really express how similar we are (not).
Joe needs to stick to mma where he is a genius! Way wrong on the count situation, so boxing isn't quite his forte especially on the rules of the referee and how the counts are determined.
Sum it all up this way:  a tough, determined complete fighter knocked out a tough, determined, one-dimensional fighter.  Tremendously entertaining, though.
The scared correspondent totally pretend because satin electrophysiologically bless beneath a gorgeous seagull. joyous, dynamic camera
Terrible Cameraman & Production team..Asleep at the job. Show the montior when Joe is explaining a play-by-play on the monitor.
Wilder has a bad attitude he cant be teach read mark Breland letter if he was n a bad mood u couldn't train, if he didn't want to workout he didn't what the point? He lived and died by hitting hard. Thought he doesn't need a cut man (ego) doesnt need to learn anything about boxing just throw the 1,2 and pray it lands
about the count https://youtu.be/sRIeNFMzPfE
rogan has been the least biased out of the entire fighting community and fandom with this fight. since wilder's allegations, no one wants to take him seriously even after the entertaining performance. he's never been a technical boxer but now everyone wants to shit on him for it. then on the other side of the coin you have wilder fans that wont give fury his props for his performance in all 3 fights.
I like Wilder, but he needs to stop making excuses for everything
His name is second only to Usain Bolt's.
Thats b.s there was nothing wrong with the count if wilder hits so hard it shouldn't matter if its a 30 count. Tyson was clear eyed on the ground listening to the count. Its always could of, would have with wilder. Except defeat be humbled and move forward and learn from it
Fury rag dolled him, period. Wilder was hugging the Gypsy King's knees.
Total rubbish joe they were both gladiators in that fight and your tallking complete rubbish
Brian knows as much about boxing as he does comedy
Wilder's trainers should have him develop: 1. Real endurance. He was totally gassed within 2-3 rounds. He should train for and complete an Ironman. 2. Hips and legs. He has astonishing power with skinny legs and (I guess) hips. If he actually developed these, his punching would be the most powerful eve seen. 3. Footwork and defense, as Joe describes.
Yes Extremely slow counts i agree
The count is up to the ref... just like a pass interference... Wilder is a warrior no doubt that can take an ass whooping ... salute to Wilder
Come back to Youtube Joe, after your contract done
So fucking mad I ordered this fight with my brother, dropped his gf off at work and we fucking missed it
I'm glad these clips are still available on YouTube
He wore a dress to fight a 6ft9 man!
Fury was fully aware of the count
#ShowBizzTheAdult
I watched it live and I tell ya I was surprised it went past the 7th round. Everything after the 6th round was all heart from wilder but at that point it was just a matter of time for fury to get that win
stick to the ufc you dont know shit about boxing
No disrespect to Joe but, the slow count argument makes little difference in my opinion. Fury clearly wasn’t terribly hurt and he was playing the count, had the count been faster i’m very convinced he would have had no problem rising faster. Good tactics by Fury taking the count for as long as he could was already a 10-7 round regardless
black man sticking up for a black man
Free Penny!
I dont know I must have been watching a different fight because the one I watched I saw a couple of guys , one that didnt know shit about boxing and just throwing haymakers at the other and the other fighter who knew a bit about boxing and knew to throw body shots instead of JUST Haymakers, no I disagree this was not a great fight in fact I would struggle to call it a good fight, all 3 were like that tho, so thats just MO!!
Wilder got extra time after standing up for the ref to make sure he's okay, PLUS he got more time in between rounds while the doctor checked him.
7:00 why hasn't an electronic count been implemented?
Idk why people assume that the count of the ref is meant to be 10 exact seconds… first, it’s the ref’s job is to make sure that the fighters are safe and able to continue. In the middle of a fight, that might take a couple seconds longer than 10 precise seconds to figure out. Would you rather the fighters get a second or two extra to get to their feet, or the fight be called off as soon as 10 seconds has elapsed?   Second, everyone’s acting like the slower count only helped fury, when wilder also got slow counts when he was getting back to his feet. Funnily enough, no one’s talking about that 🤔🤷🏼‍♂️   third, the entire point of the count, is to see if the fighter is still in the fight, or if he’s out on his feet. At any point, during any of the knockdowns, for either fighter, did anyone seriously believe that the fighters weren’t able to get to their feet? Did either fighter have jelly legs? Was either fighter incapable of standing still? Was either fighter incapable of following verbal cues? No. They just used the count to be able to get a 10 second rest in the middle of a really tiring fight, something every fighter would do if they had the option and ability to do so.
Please tell Elon Musk to get Internet up here in the woods ASAP. Tired of missing out on these special accountances of what I keep missing out on. Current times are cured by current currencies
In the first fight anyone else would've been waived off the way Tyson was out and not moving
The count doesn't start till your in the nentral corner thats the boxers fault that why u see them run to it and ur told before the match
5:51 “Long” count chat starts here 👊🙏✌️🦍
it was only close due to wilders one punch power, skill wise it wasn;t close. Wilder isn't a boxer just a one punch dosser.  Tyson Fury was literally bred for this shit.
Rogan doesn’t know the rules or customs of boxing. Yet his bro ignorance continues to spread around the world.
Come on joe, fury was looking at the ref soon as he was down dazed not knocked out if the ref counted sooner he would of got up sooner
THE GYPSY KING 🤴
1:57
So y'all believe in Rogan with COVID but he knows nothing about boxing???? You guys are a joke!!!
One of the greatest of all time? Maybe at the end of the list.
“LCD screen”your showing our AGE LOL!!!!!
Tyson wasn't even at his best and still dominated wilder and the count was legit nothin wrong with it.
One of the greatest boxing matches of all time? Of course joe Rogan would say this, considering he says every ufc fight is the greatest ufc fight of all time 🤣🤣
Joe wearing the NASA costume — when he KNOWS we’ve never been to the moon !! #soldout
Great to have another British Champion, this is 1 sport we actually do well on. I wonder if the guys were HOT in the space suits
This was such a good fight almost as good as a UFC Fight Night main event lol
Joe made sure to correct his gay slur lol
I would like to see how fury would fight without those gloves. He struggled with Otto Wallin but easily beats Wilder. Come on that's why he is in there
You know what helps for me for excitement? Deworming medication 🤣🖕
Read up on the rules Joe rogan, its a Ten count not a ten second count, the count will get interupted and delayed if the opposing fighter is not in the neutral corner, and then resume where it left off. Just like when wilder was celebrating in the first fight when he knocked fury down in the 12th, he wasnt in a neutral corner. Notice when tyson knocks wilder down he rushes into the neutral corner, because he knows the rules. The second knock down from wilder in this fight, fury was all there not wobbled, just waiting for the refs insructions, not rushing to get up but waiting for the refs instruction, because hes a master of the game and knows what hes doing.
@Joe Rogan   I have been listening to your more and more. You cover vast number of topics and you interview numbers of experts in finance, economics, doctors, etc.. and one of the thing I really like is that you do your homework and research the topic you will be discussing and have an intelligent discussion with your guest. You don't just ask questions and nod your head like other brainwashed robots or cancel folks who don't agree with them. If the interviewee responds to your question in a different perspective that you never thought about, you at least give a thought to that perspective and mostly you call out anyone that lies or give false information on your show. Love it.
You think that was a BIG knockout?? That was nothing compared to the "Earth shaking Pandemic Punch" Charlie Zelanoff would have clubbed him with. Tyson too!  Tyson is now officially on Charlie Z's radar. "Time out, then I fVch you UP!!!"
I think as a fight it is a bit overrated tbh. It was epically even for the first 5 rounds - and either man could have won - but after that totally one way traffic. It wasn't an even fight from 6-12, it was a beat down. Wilder is so one dimensional he's cringeworthy. Yes he had tons of heart, so props for that, but he'll end up with brain damage from beatings like that. Fury beat the living shit out of him, one of the worst beatings I've seen someone take at heavyweight.
Fury went through a tough time before this fight. He managed to put it behind him and perform. I doubt I could have managed it.
Funny Pants McFury.
joe wil you have tyson fury back on plz
If they were fighting without gloves there would 100% been a death.
Skillful fighters do not have rely on putting on weight. They rely on technic and boxing skills. It was a good scrap. A lot dumb guff talk about the referee. Not 1 of these folks have a clue about refereeing boxing. Stop with the nonsense. The health of the fighter and the count is of the discretion of the referee alone. Redban doesn't have a notion and Joe is a close second by the sounds of it. Tony is cool🥊o-o🥊
What’s with the suits??? Losers
Everyone got their dick up Wilders ass for showing heart and surviving. He'd clearly told his corner under no circumstances to throw the towel in. It should have been stopped after 7. "the biggest puncher ever" got his ass handed to him AGAIN. No boxing talent at all.
Tony Wikipedia’n those facts about fighters lol
I disagree on the statement of  naming Tyson Fury as one of the greatests...
Need a Squid Games countdown.
0:07 no it wasn't wtf,  the biggest clash of egos is what it was
For all the boxing fights Joe has apparently seen he doesn't seem that knowledgeable on boxing
Who can downvote this video? Must be Wilder fans lol
The ref counted slow for both fighters, re watch the knockdowns...
He was thinking of the ten count on streefighter lol.
Camera 1 still to low. Tighten that sh1t up 😃👍
You name a heavyweight of all time that beats a nearly 7ft 19stone guy that moves like a middleweight and hits like a train. Boxing IQ is insane, the ability to switch hit and got a chin like steel
If you watch the replay of Furys so called "knock downs" in slowmo with focus you can clearly see that for the 1st kd Fury was slipping slightly into Wilder and Wilder was pulling him with to arms down to the canvas which was already illegal. For the second KD Fury was ducking Wilders punches and when he bend a bit Wilder hit him on the back of the head. Dk if Fury was maybe out for a DQ but that was the reason Fury was never wobbled! Wilder is really one of the most coward, lying Clowns out there just relating to hus heavy armour excuse which he decided well on his own to wear it! But i just cant believe how many pple are blind to the fact that this dude is an absolute fraud. In their 1st bout they argumented that Fury got a too long count but even on the youtube timeline you can prove it by yourself that Fury stood again by 8-9 sec. while the count is not a second count but 1-2 can take 2-3 seconds. 2nd bout was a complete demolition of Wilder and Wilder got mad protected by the ref then they spread photoshopped glove pics with the pulled over gloves. There are 3 controls from the cabines to the ring so its quiet impossible to cheat like that. 3rd they come back to the long counts again while it was Wilder who didnt enter the right corner again like dude is really too stupid to play out his advantages! But worst is the fact that again all black athletes are fronting together that they are favoring white fighters like Wilder wasnt mad hyped and protected being a windmill, no tech. and one dimensional boxer who would never get any respect in strong hw division! Its just a shame and they are scared a ish now that a big white gypse is taking over and they are even ruining boxing more than ever. smh
Joe knows alot about MMA but often talks out of his ass about boxing this video is filled with Joe presenting his boxing bullshit as fact
joe knows mma he should stay with that he is not a boxer. he was siding with wilder and dissing tyson fury.
Is this guy a gay?
Am I the only one that thinks Tony Hinchcliffe is annoying and not funny?
Coincidence not conspiracy that Tyson fury kept getting long counts. It's just coincidence.
Did you see any of the training Wilder had b4 this fight? He didn't implement any of the things he trained for, he abandoned it all after the first round, no slipping, no combinations and he gases out... Stamina is an essential part of training jus sayin....
Bruh…fury MAYBE got an extra second or two, got up and beat wilder into a coma. He’s the winner. People are trying to give wilder credit off some technicality shit. Who wants that kind of win??
The count stops if the ref has to tell the oppnent to get to a neutral corner, that's to stop the fight standing over his opponent to hit him as he stands up, and Wilder also got a long count, go back and check it out!
Joe, that fight was a sleeper!  What a bore!  Now we know one of the side effects of IVER!
Tyson fury was named after Mike Tyson
Lol, already making excuses...
The Fury doubters, should Tyson give Deontay a best of 7 or first to 15? 3x is enough imo.
~He May Carry On,. We Still Don't Know,. ..But He "CAN" Get A Couple More Years, ``But CONVERSLY, He Don't NEED To $$$``
Anyway...When is Chris D'elia gonna be on next?
Tony is the kind of guy to learn just enough about sports to fit in but doesn't really enjoy them
I have never hugged my wife in 36 years like these 2 clinching. The best heavyweight fight ever? Rogan, stop smoking that shit.
Said it after on Twitter that, that fight blew thrilla in manilla ain’t got shit on wilder v fury 3. Best fight I’ve ever seen. Fuck boxing or mma. Just fight, it was so goddamn impressive
joe claims to have been a boxing fan for 20 years yet spews complete bullshit every time he tries to talk about the sport, a quick google search would do ya good joe.
Now that Joe got to confront Gupta on horse dewormer,  Can Joe have this ref come on to clarify?
https://youtu.be/fAjZuT5pWCo  the best handmade gold
Is there anyone less likable than tony?
Fury would've got up 2 seconds earlier, sick of hearing that excuse, he was listening to the count and he was capable of getting up.
im glad someone said one of the greatest instead of the greatest
Joe Rogan,  you are full of shit! The way you are talking up Wilder after he got his arse kicked is just funny to listen to. Yes he hits hard, but Fury has got up every time he has put him down. Even when he hit him with illegal blows. You have been smoking too much mate!
“There’s no way we landed on the moon. No way!”
George Foremans KO streak and percentage was better than Wilder
SPOTIFY, when are you going to enable COMMENTS?
Joe '10 second count' Rogan
Is anyone remember when Joe Rogan made fun of the moon landing video? And then like a couple days later he showed up in an astronaut costume and completely changed his opinion. Wonder why he's wearing it again?
I agree there shouldn’t be a ref choosing that’s a huge thing that needs changed
Joe don't do that. God forbid if Wilder sees this, he's going to have a brand new bullshit campaign. All these excuses. Fury is the better man all around. Period
The count doesn't work like that. it is more to do with assessing the fighters health and fitness to continue. The point of a count has never been about "You have 10 seconds to get on your feet after a knockdown or you lose", that is why the count must remain at the discretion of the Ref. If the Ref had counted faster, Tyson would have got up sooner, at no point was Fury struggling to recover his composure.
Over rated fight
I think the myth of Wilder's one punch power has been well and truly dispelled. Dosser.
Joe rogan sucks. He thinks he is the man
Joe doesn't know the rules, it's a 10 count not 10 second count. You can read the rules, the count will stop if the other fighter isn't in the neutral corner which wilder wasn't. The count gets stopped then continues, it's is not 10 seconds.😂😂😂😂
It seemed obvious to me that Tyson was undamaged by the knockdowns. You could see his eyes were good. and his legs were still fine. I wasn't concerned for Tyson at all at that point.
Nothing is more douchey than thinking it’s cool to wear the same outfit, it’s not funny or cool in anyway, it makes everyone come off completely idiotic
Even Joe's prone to the one thing I see the most with combat sports, MMA fans being ignorant about Boxing rules, and Boxing fans being ignorant about MMA rules.
It's not 10 seconds it's a 10 count
Joe “look at that fat” Rogan
Joe "its nothing to do with gay folks" Rogan
What the fuck does DC know about anything
Hopefully, boxing will one day be banned. Pathetic
No Joe your wrong !!!
Its a ten count. It's not a ten second count. You either trust the integrity of the referee or you don't. Don't cook up a conspiracy where one doesn't exist. In the first fight Fury was out. The button was pressed and then the machine was turned off and then on again. Make of that what you will. Then Fury figured out Wilder and now the world knows that Wilder is a one trick pony. Low skill, low technique and has no ability to fight off the back foot. This is the end of Wilder.
When will Joe Rogan be inviting on his neo-Nazi friend, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson?
I don't know shit about boxing but people keep saying best fight ever. All I seen was wilder throwing a looping big right hand that's it no movement no nothing... I don't get it.
If Wilder had Ali's moves he would have won all three fights.
Rocky Marciano Knocked out 43 out of 49.
I mean if u looked at fury he wasn’t even fazed when he was on the floor
That's not true the fighter can't hear the timekeeper outside the ring only the ref that's why he picked up the count where he left off after he told wilder to go back to his corner !!
Wilder has been boxing 16 years and in that time the only skill he has learnt is how to punch hard… that’s it! He should be ALOT better than he is let’s be honest, he relied on that hard punch so much that he never developed any other useful skills. Having lightning in one hand and a black sack full of arrogance in the other will only gets u so far.
The count is there to make sure the fight is ok… It’s not a stop watch…
Why is Lee Harvey Oswald dressed up as an astronaut?
Furys father named him after mike tyson.
Both counts were extremely slow, which IMO is extremely suspect. Deontay has every reason to feel he wasn’t treated fairly in this fight. I’m a Fury fan, but I honestly think the ref ruined would was otherwise an amazing bout.
Joe, in the immortal words of Uncle Roger, "you don't know shit about boxing". The ref picks up the count from the timekeeper initially, at which point the timekeeper stops keeping time. The ref is then in total control of the count. If Wilder had stayed in the neutral corner Mora wouldn't have paused to send him back. And guess what? Fury would have stood up quicker. He was watching the ref waiting for the count to 8. Read the fucking rules FFS...
That ref is one of the best according to John McCarthy, was no error...John claims the ref did it right, and the count wasnt SLOWER ON PURPOSE. The rules are clear. Fact check Joe. I take Big Johns explanation and the referee tells both FIGHTERS in the dressing room WHEN THERE IS A KNOCK DOWN you are to go right away to a neutral corner NOT YOUR OWN LOL, which Wilder did at first...Ref then had to point to the corner Deontay needed to be thats on Wilder.  STOP CREATING CONTROVERSY!
they playing space with bubbles ?
FYI..If Fury sneezes the fat does the same thing.  Still a big punch!!!
His dad gouged a dudes eye out in a bar fight fucking savage just bleed god
Joe stoned again 😅😅
How the fuck can JR say one of the greatest fights ever?  Unsubscribed
Thats why they call it dope..Stay in your lane fellas...MMA is not boxing and joe sounds very uneducated about boxing refs...Joe thinks we really landed on the moon too...Idiots with money are delusional..
I think had the count been dead on then Fury would have just gotten up sooner but benefited from the extra seconds
honestly bar so low if that was one of the best fights of all time
This is bullshit the judge is always giving them reasonable time to get up.
Well Joe Rogan don't know shit about boxing
No not in boxing , the count is 1 , 2 , 3, 4, and so on, if the ref stops the count the rule is the only master onboard is the ref. Its up to the referee to count , and yes it shoud be like it is, thing is to live a real fight you wanna show more of a fight if its worth it, if the guy's taking a beating than coutnfaster or some.
The planets caused a magnetic surge that rippled space time and aided Furys punch to KO Wilder. And delay time allowing Fury and Wilder long counts, which were counts by the ref in both instances. Fury won all three fights, if you can't accept it now, then maybe you need planetary alignment.
I thought Joe Rogan knew more about boxing rules. He no doubt know alot about fights and different boxers, but he clearly knows very little about counts in boxing. Embarrassing
I feel like the 10 count is more of a recognition test for the boxer if they can't comprehend they have seconds left till defeat and they should get up and fight. The ref gave both fighters ample opportunity to get back in the fight.
Their fuckin costumes 😅 LMAO!
I can tell Joe smoked a big fat spliff
Quit blowing wilder Joe! Wilder is such a sore loser and if they fought again Fury would win. I don’t think wilder could ever beat Fury.
People get so salty with the whole slow can't subject..sheesh lol 😅
Rogan needs to get off the blunts and see the fight for what it was. Fury bullied and schooled Wilder. When Wilder knocked Fury down twice, both times it was a nothing knockdown. Fury was just catching his breath.   Wilder didn’t have a jab and the rights were so off the mark. Fury battered him, and sent him home with no excuses and rightly so. The U.S blow smoke up Wilders ass, a useless boxer that’s not and never will be used to someone coming out and boxing. Your boy wonder got battered by a gypsy king from Manchester. Get over it!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Joe doesn't really know what he's talking about its a 10 count not 10 second count there's a difference
Joe I think you are by far it’s not even close you are the best MMA announcer/ analysts ever bro. but boxing , joe the best fight you ever saw ! What ? Joe it dont even rank on the scale it was an ok fight had some  knockdowns and getting back up all that good stuff. Far from the best .  Joe the fight was over the second fury counted his body shot I think it was in the 2nd or third round as soon as that happened fight was over.   When knocked down I knew fury was getting up he took wilders best punch well , but wilder couldn’t handle fury’s punch so never mind fury’s boxing skills.   My point  is Joe watch more boxing
Redban really never heard the term "queer street" before? Well no wonder he's wearing a NASA costume because he must have been living on another planet
Please interview Chris Sky 🇨🇦
The count was done according to the rules
Who bloody cares about the count?? The dossier lost boo boo boo boo
Oh god Tony Dickcliffe and Redban the first people i hear Joe talking about this fight with, cant even listen to this shit after 5 minutes into it.
Project the 10 second count via projectors onto the canvas…
I guess Joe forgot that Fury was named after Mike. Pretty sure Fury mentioned it when he was on.
"An error or corruption." OR completely normal and legal. Joe consistently speaks on shit he doesn't know anything about with such confidence it's astonishing.
Shoutout y-town
Joe… Archie Moore has 132 KOs… way more than Wilder. Please slow down when talking about boxing. It sounds dumb
What about the doc coming in after the break, for wilder and saying do u need more time, even if he didn’t say that, why didn’t he look at wilder during the break, giving extra rest, those seconds helped wilder , lots of weird ish happened
I like how deontay got up but still was given an additional 10 seconds to recover lol 😂
Wilder  didn't  start boxing until  20, most pro athletes  start  training in  elementary.  Its amazing that  he made  it to  the Golden Gloves.
Trust a yank to make up rules to support his conspiracy xD
You should have LiverKing on the show
I think the ref owed Wilder at least a count when he got knocked down that last time before the fight was stopped. Just my one man's opinion.
Joe Rogan vs. Cenk Uygur MMA fight
Imagine wilder one 😁... the champ would be a undeserving fake . Man went😴... fury is a true warrior 🇬🇧
Crazy he dropped everyone he ever fought
Joe… I’m sorry but you’re proving again that you have a very limited understanding of boxing. Read twice then speak on boxing fam.
Fury hit the deck in R4 with 0.19 left and got up with 0.05 left.
Tyson master the craft and had a size advantage on Wilder. Wilder was noticeably slower this fight.
They both are not on the level as the real Tyson, if they were to jump in ring against the real Tyson even at 55 years old he’d K.O then in the first or second round, they never went against a boxer that’s on you from the bell and every shot is the knockout shot coming at you and non stop until the bell, that’s something these two have never went against before, they are always trying to plan punches and with the real Tyson they wouldn’t have a chance to plan shit.. so I don’t know why people say these two are the greatest fighters when they never fight against a striker that’s on you
If he’d counted faster, Tyson would have been up faster. He was ready, he was just milking the count. There should be a timer, remove human error.
Besides being a great boxer, Fury can take a punch, too. Amazing chin.
On the count, stop smoking joints and maybe your eyes will be clear just like Tyson's eyes were.
Jeff Mayweather said the count was fine
100% wrong on the count info.  There was no corruption- Anyone that knows boxing will tell you this.
Nice to see joe all over deontays balls first he believes this edited video of tyson not getting up for the count and he’s like oh hits him behind the ear it was behind the head but guess what Tyson didn’t complain
One of the greatest fights of all time? Get the fuck out of here
Joe has no idea what the fuck he’s talking about lol
Tyson Furi is named after Mike Tyson
Wilder won 2 of the 3 fights with fury.
https://youtu.be/FUXGB5FzhPc
count again rogan fury would be up by 8 he was up by 6 with the call he made. Fury is not dumb.
Can safely put Rogan, CNN, Fox in the same category. They all spout BS
Wilder hits so hard every time he's knocked down an elite boxer, the elite boxer gets up and beats his ass.
Joe talking boxing to someone that has no clue lmao
The count didn’t matter Tyson was listening to the count and would have gotten up whether it was a short or a long count
I swear joes gay for black dudes
Fury was up and and clear headed before the 10 count, regardless of couple of seconds interruption. No issue.
Spotify sucks.. I stopped listening to JRE cuz of it
American humour is so bad it’s actually funny. Fuckin hell 😂 simples
Joe I love you man and your halloween outfit but the fact is Tyson stood up and Deontey didn't. f**** the 10s it was a monster fight. Just get used to it, Tyson represents what a top shaped prime athletes looks like!
Great Fuckin Take on the fight Joe Rogan
No argument sorry joe fury actually beat him 3 times fairly the referee did nothing wrong bro check out the referee rule book deonte didnt go to the neutral corner and that's it nothing more fury would of got up the same way as he has look right at the referee
Joe Rogan talking crap. Tyson fury, the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time.
the people who start counted with the ref are just there to help him; he can stop the count as long as he wants and nobody can do anything about it. It was Wilder's fight who decided to stay there and chill with the ref
The refs count is part of the strategy of boxing also.  If you're hurt you're going to take advantage of the count to rest.
Mufuckas throw out “of all time” waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too often
Bitter American because his boy lost. Fury won 3 fights fair and square. Next.
What is Joe wearing?
Tyson Fury was never Knocked out. When you get knocked out the way you go down is very different. Tyson intentionally went down to not get knocked out, very smart move. he felt he needed the rest and get his legs back. when you get knocked out you go to sleep for a short time. Fury didn't even blink which showed he was hurt but just dizzy not KO
Joe went to mars or wat
Rocky Marciano had 43 KO's in 49 fights and was undefeated.
Sugar Ray Leonard was a puncher who was also a great boxer... Today Terrence Crawford is.
@3:49 tyson’s dad named Tyson Fury named after Mike Tyson.
Lol the old slow count again
Joe don't give Wilder any more excuses to use why he lost, and is a poor loser lol
Please, for the love of god, show the clips as you talk about them. I really wanted to see the KO he was talking about
It was an exciting wild fight. But certainly not the greatest flight of all time. It was a bar room brawl with absolutely zero skill. Watch Ali Frazier or Holyfield Bowe these guys were big and had  elite skill. Those were amazing fights. This one was just awkward slow poor skill But very exciting. Low level skill combine with awkwardness and intensity leads to a wild fight.
Rogan has never understood what a ten count means. And he's not one of the greatest, Joe ... he IS the greatest. Lineal champion and unbeaten. Only Marciano went unbeaten and Fury would knock Marciano out inside a round. And how is getting up in the 12th of the first fight greater than getting up for the second time in the 4th of the third?
Joe there is no controversy…… FURY KICKED HIS ASSSSSSSS! He beat him 3 fights in a row THE END!
Fury would have gotten up either way, he was listening to the ref and waiting until around 7 before he got up  If the ref had of continued off where he should fury would have just gotten up earlier   You can't keep fury down, look at the first fight, seriously, fury is just better and again people making excuses
Joe Rogan talking smack while geeked out in a space suit - go figure
thats why tyson should of beat buster douglas, the ref outside counted to 10, i just watched it today
Regarding the count - doesn’t matter if it actually takes 10 seconds or 20 seconds, the fighter isn’t going to try and stand up until about 7 or 8 on the count so you can’t blame the fallen fighter
“You’re talking shit! No one knew what was going to happen “ hahaha exactly what I was thinking “this guys gonna come back” BS
Great point about the counting independent of the referee. But that might just take out the major thrills about KOs; i feel the whole idea of having the ref run the count by himself is all part of the excitements of boxing. I mean, you wanna hear the ref ringing the numbers out loud while throwing up his hands and fingers. It's one of the very few moments ref's get to shine . Just my thoughts...
Tyson's so light on his feet & moves so much he is so hard for any heavyweight to out box you can't hit what isn't there, Last heavyweight to do this was Ali !
If I were Deontay, I would freak out if someone got up from shots like that.  It must be incredibly disheartening for Deontay to land blows like that and Tyson is still standing there.  Reminiscent of that MMA fight between the transgendered female and a biological female, with the transgender athlete (a former SEAL!) walking through the female's punches all night.  Tyson is just to freaking big and strong and able to absorb unbelievable punishment.
Brian Redban looks like Tom Segura's mini-me.
No I don’t buy the whole long count thing. Wilder didn’t go to his neutral corner so the ref had to tell him to go there. The other boxer has to be in the neutral corner before the ref starts counting so actually the ref was within his rights to start the count all over again. Also he counted at the same speed for Wilder I’m pretty sure.
It’s interesting to here the point of view from a man who can physically ride a mouse.
Not bad for a coke head The only sport you can be a junkie and still compete Boxing is a rigged joke
After Fury got completely robbed in the first fight you US fans have a damn cheek talking about the count. The count does NOT continue if the boxer is not in a neutral corner, and fury was completely lucid throughout.  Get over yourselves. Jesus Joe, you’re usually objective but you’re embarrassing yourself talking about the count.
Deadlier puncher Ngannou or Wilder
There’s a YouTube highlights package for Fury and all the punches he landed on Wilder, it’s insane the punishment Wilder took in this fight! This has to take its toll later in life.
Almost half of Wilder’s knockout were in arenas and venues that look like they would hold fights against anyone who came off the streets.
Joe I like ya but stick to MMA you know shit about boxing go away and understand the 10 count rule doesn't start until the fighter is in the "furthest"neutral corner and although the count shouldn't be stopped it doesn't and can't be started on impact..that's why it's a 10 count and and not 10secs
Fam it’s a 10 count not a 10 second count
The disservice shown to Fury here is amazing. Yeah Joe, we get it, Wilder has a hard punch.
"I used to have a bit about it"
5:31-5:34 Why did joe have to say hard like that?!?😂😂😂😂😂
It doesn't matter because fury would have just got up on the count anyway, he was just working with the refs count and deliberately got up when he needed to.
So Tyson would not have got up had the count been correct ?
So glad there's no more sober October
All these cry babies moaning about the count.. they didn't say nothing in the first fight where tyson clearly dominated the fight and actually won by way more points..  you snow flakes need to suck it up!
No one says anything about the 2nd knock down smack behind the head. That was also illegal
It’s a 10 count not a 10 second count. The ref told both fury and wilder he’d give them every opportunity to keep fighting if knocked down.
long count my ass he had to say go white corner wilder was leaning over him and its the refs count not seconds lol
Joes 100 percent wrong on count.  Check out rules then apologize to ref
Unfortunately, sometimes JR talks shit...
It was amazing catching the fight on YouTube the next morning 👍
10:25 It doesn't really matter as the referee had warned Wilder he was going to stop the fight he Wilder didn't show him something before the round. If his corner didn't throw the towel the referee was about to stop it. If I'm not mistaken he said the same himself in an interview too.
That is the rule, the knocker should be stayed in the furthest corner from the knocked down opponent, if the ref saw you move closer he obligate stop the count and command you to move back to the corner.
Look at me in my gigantic shiny shill jacket
Fact: Tyson was headbutting Wilder's gloves entire match.
Not a man in the world who can beat Fury
When Joe talks about boxing he may as well just say "I know nothing , I am from Barcelona..."
Rogan is wrong about the refs count, it's the refs count and count only. If he has to stop because the other fighters not in the proper corner he can stop the count. 🥊🥊
Let's be honest, Izzy feinting has Joe Rogan screaming
Joe “When you’ve got a podcast at 12 and a mission to the space station at 2” Rogan
That dude (not sure who he is, haven’t watched JRE in years) laughing at ‘queer street’ sigh. Such an old boxing phrase. Makes me feel old af, I thought everyone was familiar with it.
Fun fact,Big John fury named Tyson after … Mike Tyson lool
Incorrect, if this was the case Dempsey would have regained the title against Tunney in the battle of the long count
He was allowed to pause the count because wilder was not in his corner. Boxing rules.
Typical yanks making excuses joe he got beat fuck sake stop looking for excuses
can someone tell me how jamie rewinds youtube videos like that?
Regardless tyson fury got up before 10 seconds each time.
Yess Wilder knocked 41 but they truly were some really bad fighters. Boxing is a boring sport.
Lets go Brandon!
The Fear Factor guy is  smoking weed in a NASA space suit on YouTube talking to another guy in a suit with giant nipple tubes... don’t take it too seriously Joe’s wrong about how counts work in boxing.
Joe needs to read the WBC knockdown rule. The different belts have different rules. The count does not begin until the fighter goes to the neutral corner. If he leaves that corner the count stops. Know the rules, ref did exactly what he was supposed too.
Didn’t the ref do the same long counts for Deontay? People are acting like Tyson is the only one who needed a ten count. Do I have to remind people that Deontay Wilder got knocked down more than Tyson Fury did?
But no one talk about the truest technical fight..Usyk vs Joshua
Just excuses for wilder, if your a pro and constantly have to defend your losses with any type of excuse, your not a real champion, period. Your a loser.
I mean, his father named him after Mike Tyson
Fury would have got up quicker if the count was quicker
WILDER IS OUTCLASSED BECAUSE HES OVERRATED
Rogan on the next spaceship to space
Americans are all salty about our gypsy king beating their great black hope 3 times on the trot. Dry your eyes mate and accept it.
So Tyson Fury won unfairly...AGAIN?😲😲😲😲
5:30. "You don't know shit...no one knew.." 😆😆😆😆 Lol! This is the JR I like listening to
Wilder shouldn't quit, he should get himself a good coach and learn how to set up his awesome punching power...become open to learning more about boxing...work on the jump rope more.
I’m gonna name my next son Peyton Brady.
not going lie, joe's living in fairy land and you can clearly see hes day dreaming trying to teach wilder moves that fury has is practically im possible since hes already old, and a bit slow as you can tell
Bunch of white people cheering on a white fighter😆😆😆
https://youtube.com/shorts/IUHggkYipB8?feature=share
This fight was not one of the all time great heavyweight fights...so let's just get some perspective & put that to bed
Oh Joe. This is first time I saw you biased this much. No problem. I always love seing you comment.
the ref did what exactly 98% of the refs at that lvl would do... anyone who says otherwise doesnt watch boxing or hasnt read the rules, or both...   i see a lot of MMA guys using MMA logic on the Fury Wilder trilogy and its usually wrong, painfully so...
This may be the 1st time I disagree with 90% of what Joe's is saying.
I come from the same town as Tyson fury’s grandad Bartley Gorman its no surprise to me Tyson is so great Gormans book the Gypsy King is a really good read
Joe Rogan is a lunatic
THE RULES ARE AS STATES HERE '' when a boxer is knocked down the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns.  Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, rhe referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point it was interrupted, In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers.       Wilder also got a long count wen he was knocked down  not to mention his 15 second doctors appointment in the beggining of round 9  so they both really got lifelines in that fight
Why does Joe try and talk with his guests about fights? None of them give a fuck about combat sports
Tyson was watching the count, got up well before 10... he would have responded to the referee... whatever the count! We know that Europeans rarely get the decision in the US. Fury was robbed in the 1st and thought he had to knock him out to win! One of the greatest!
His real name is Luke. Not Tyson
What are the odds? Well coming from a legendary gypsy boxing lineage probably cuts them. One of his uncles was Bartley Gorman, the bareknuckle champion for decades.
When Fury was knocked down he clearly was watching the referee and based getting up on the count that he was being given.   So, the point of long count appears mute to me.   If there is a valid complaint on this, place it on Wilder for not being in the neutral corner.  In my view, if Wilder had been in the neutral corner and the count was performed quicker, Fury would have still beaten the count.   The rule has been in place since the famous "Long Count Incident" between Jack Dempsey & Gene Tunney back in 1927.   Wilder also appeared to get a long count but nobody has mentioned that.   So, again America, stop with the excuses.
Joe looks like he has aged alot since he got covid
Nah,count is fine,Tyson is ready to rise.What surprises me is tyson is not in great shape like most boxers.
Joe ....this is bullshit........did Joe Fraser or Ali or Evander  or Mike Tyson get advise to go rest for a year......no they were real champions ..........Wilder is a pussy in the 70s through 90s area ......man up Wilder ..... today's heavyweights are so cradled
The question on a long count is also whether or not the fighter COULD have gotten up but wisely listened to the referee count to get as much recovery time as possible.     The ref was great when kept the fighters from clenching the whole fight like others have done.
First time I have tuned in. I am very disappointed with your lack of knowledge. Don't comment on things that you don't understand.
Why they sitting in NASA suits?
Thank you Joe. At last a white guy with the balls to say it like it is. White supremacists are still turning a blond eye to all the cheating that happened. Three fights in a row and Fury cheated the dude in all three. Not taking away the fact that Fury is the better boxer but if fair was fair Wilder would have been given the victory in all three. That doesn’t mean Wilder is the better boxer. Just means he would have won the fights under the rules of boxing. But describing him as the best ever is not true. If a guy like Wilder who is not a great boxer can put him down, imagine what guys who can actually box and punch would do to him.
Such a weird thing to associate yourself with something an hour away like its all connected somehow.
It ain’t a 10 second count it’s a 10 count just like a pin in wwe and if you look at fury he’s watching the ref and he would of got up earlier but he was using the full time he had because he’s clever  ! If you watch the other wilder fury matches fury runs to a neutral corner because he’s not dumb like wilder !
The referee has the count, the rules are not ten seconds, equals a ten count,Wilders 3rd round knockdown was 13 seconds
Refs count does stop to move the fighter to the neutral corner.
Just look at the Ortega volkanovski fight, the round was about to start but then the doctor came in to check Ortega instead of doing it in the break.
What if?
Joke he beat the dude 3 times.
White boy summer still on boys
Joe should stick to talking about what he knows, he’s just making himself sound stupid rn talking about boxing🙄
Is this the knockdown where Wilder illegally hit Fury on the back of the head?
I think we all know who would win if Joshua and fury went at it.
Oh my god he's fucked!  lol
jaime is so fucking bland
Both had long counts. Wilder's was just as long
Wilder needs to get some training from Apollo Creed.
"Most likely and error" yeah you dont know what your talking about lol
Lol Tyson was waiting for the ref’s count. There is no good argument that Tyson was in danger of not making the count. Also, the count was slow for Wilder before that in round 3.
Rogan spreading false bs on the count is truly maddening
fury almost lost in one of those rounds
Tha Lobsta in tha hizzouse.
...Joe didn't claim the rules of any given official organizations (WBC etc.) would demand the count to continue (which they explicitly don't), did he?  As I understood him, he was criticizing the system because he thinks it's "unfair competition". Although I can't agree with that, I absolutely get his point. So, why are people attacking him for his take? #rethoricalquestion
KO 10 count is NOT in Seconds. Get it a rest. Wilder lost and stop crying
Pretty sure his name is actually Luke...
Fury was fine when he went down. You could clearly see his eyes were clear and he was well aware of the count and what had happened. Wilder was out on his feet from the third round on. No count was going to save him.
I don't know why anyone is going on about the count. Count  Wilders on the second round. He got the same amount of time. They were both up at 8 so the ref was fair. Stop bitching.
Rogan is once again full of nothing. I watched and re watched the fight and actually counted when Fury when down - it was NOT a slow count and he got up both times before the 10 count and everything was fine. Wilder went to the coaches corner instead of a neutral corner. These accusations are once again NONSENSE and just another excuse to create drama and give Wilder credit where credit is NOT DUE! He is a 3 time loser - end of story and we are all tired of the story. I wish Rogan would just stay in his lane and stay out of boxing commentary. The real bad count was when Mike Tyson fought Buster Douglas. Mike actually won that fight because its common sense that Douglas got a slow count. That is an actual example of a slow count - NOT this fight.
Fury is a gypsy,they are hard as nails
The ref obviously did a long count because he was white and fury was white..... that's what Cormier is getting at.
Regarding the long count:  Firstly, Fury could have gotten up quicker but was buying more time to recover. Secondly, the count is not necessarily in seconds, but at the discretion of the referee. Thirdly, Wilder also got a long count. Fourthly, the referee is supposed to STOP the count if the other fighter comes away from the neutral corner. Fifthly, the second knockdown of Fury was to the back if the head, which is illegal. Joe, you realised this hence the Freudian slip. You don't know what you're talking about. You really don't. Fury was never in danger of being knocked or counted out, at any point.
Redban looks like Tom Segura and Bam Margera had a baby
The ref counted slow and cheated
When a knockdown occurs, the downed boxer’s opponent shall go to the furthest neutral corner and remain there while the count is being made. The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner.
Joe Rogen, you are just making a foolish noise. (Not so-) Wilder, is a big half-witted wall-puncher who got beaten 3 times by an incredible boxer and better man, in every sense. Deontae is a daftae. Over and out.
He was named after Iron Mike
Just have a huge screen that does the count and you can have the audience see it and count it out loud so you don’t have refs doing these slow counts
How come everyone got their helmets off?
Creating unnecessary controversy 😂😂😂
I’m sick off these excuses for Wilder it’s boring !He got whooped end of
I want to see Jamie as a guest one the JRE
the uk kicks the yanks ass lol
Big John McCarthy broke down the count thing and Joe is wrong on this one.
robot wars timer for knock outs
Watch the clock when fury goes down for the second time in the 4th rd. FURY got a 15 SECOND count.  Wilder should have won the 1st fight by knockout and the 3rd
Conor McGregor hits an old man at a bar: nothing happens it's all love  Deontay wilder doesn't shake fury's hands: Wow wilder should die I hate him
Joe going full tinfoil 😂 when will the hat come out
Love the Julio Cesar Chavez (🐐) comments by Joe
if u don't really know the rule just dont say anything🤡
What about fury having to wait multiple times on wilders corner to exit the ring right after the first knockdown or the doctor holding up rounds at least three times.
😁 the casuals crying in the comments about the slow count comment are delusional enough to think fury is a skillful boxer, bruh! If you got knocked down twice in a row in the same round by Wilder you got work to do, definitely not one of the skillful boxer.
What I took away from this vid were the words..Fu/ck & Crazy.
The tin foiled thumb..I love Joe rogan
Actually joe Billy bird holds the record for most knockouts in their career with 138 wins by knockout!!
First off I absolutely can't stand Fury!!! My hats off to him not only did he batter a world class boxer, he also took some sledgehammer shots from a knock out artist! Great Wilder has the heart of a champion and is a champion! Every great box has a counter opposite and Wilder found his! It aches me to say this but Wilder can't beat Fury and I love Wilder! No other American heavyweight can come close to competing against Fury let alone win! I'm now a part time Joshua fan!
They need to tie Wilder’s arms to his waste and make him evade punches from foot and head movement only for a year, he could be an amazing boxer.
Most people don't know that a 10 count from the ref is not 10 actual seconds. That's because most people don't know shit about boxing.
It's a ten count not a count of ten seconds. It's at the refs discretion. Fury was looking at the ref for the whole count but was taking his time which was smart. Fury could have gotten up no question
His real name is not Tyson its Luke. The counting is down the ref so they could go 1 then 4 seconds later go 2 its down their perception. Also its not hard to knock out 41 bin men
\o
As everyone else has pointed out, JR is wrong about the count. If you cast your mind back to 1927, Dempsey's failure to return to a neutral corner allowed Tunney longer on the canvas and it may have cost him the title. Every student of the game should know this.
Fury had his wits and was simply responding to the refs count. If it was a couple seconds more he would've just gotten up at 9 instead of 6 or 7.
Wtf are you joe 😂😂😂
Lots of fights are long counts.. and most fighters watch the counters to take as much time as possible
Just hearing more excuses for why wilder lost. 🤣🤣
I see the moon wearing a NASA jacket.
So fucking hard man. 🤣🤣
The referee is in charge of the count so the fighter just needs to focus on one person when the world is spinning. The count belongs to the ref, not a clock, and he can and is allowed to start and stop the count at his discretion to clear the other fighter to "farthest" neutral corner so the other fighter can't interfere with the count, nor hover over the downed fighter to avoid a cheap shot before the fighter has a chance to get up and defend himself.
Wilder cheated against ortiz back in 2018. The worst case of cheating ive ever seen at that level in boxing.
The foo in the orange doesn’t even know what he saying 😂
Joe Rogan and the art of sowing conspiracy seeds. You are in the fighting business Joe and you are this ignorant of the rules? Jeez! Whoever told Joe there's a guy in the corner who continues the count whiles the refree orders the opponent to a neutral corner?
"Look at that fat roll down."  No thanks Joe. :)
Mike Tyson vs wilder who wins?
Love the outfit space cadet :)
Anyone remember when buster dugless got a long count against Mike Tyson?  The long count is a staple of boxing and good boxers know to listen and take as much time as you need.
Why do these tadjers always wear the nasa gear when together??
I would love to see Shannon brig's go out of retirement and beat  deontay wilder
Joe Rogan this is wrong. The rules stats the count is paused if the opponent fails to stay in his designated corner. The referee was bang on correct.
Showbizz the adult could teach this young sapling some boxing knowledge
What's interesting is there is exactly the same time between Wilder getting dropped and the ref restarting the fight (21 seconds) in the 3rd as the 'controversial' second knock down of Furey in the 4th. Fury is watching the ref throughout and is waiting to get up. Think DC is being a bit salty here... or biased... which isn't like him at all now is it??? ... 🤣
Counts wer 100% correct
Why is joe such a sellout for Nasa...wearing a tin foil jacket
Everything he’s saying is completely misinformed. Many have more knock outs. And the ref can stop the count to send a fighter to the neutral corner. And Fury got up in slightly less than 11 seconds. And was clear eyed. Waiting for count.  Does he research anything. This is supposed to be in his wheel house and he has no idea what he’s talking about. The blow the put Fury down was also blatantly illegal.  Not behind the ear but to the back of the head. And to suggest it may have been corrupt?
WTF Joe I waited a week for this peace
Joe is seriously on weed I think fury deserves credit not wilder fury just exposed wilder nothing less nothing more
A masterful boxing display by Fury? Lol nope. That was rockem sockem boxing. You can tell Joe is an MMA guy
I think Joe is mistaken.. I have seen some screenshots of the rule. The ref was correct on the count. Wilder penalized himself by not hustling to a neutral corner
Let's be honest when fury got knocked down 2nd time he just looked disappointed in himself
Its not a 10 second count but rather the refs 10 second count. Theres a difference.
Can we just take some time to credit the ref please? It was one of the great ref performances in one of the greatest boxing fights ever. A fantastic all-round fight.
“Funny pants smith”
I generally love hearing Joe’s take on fights, but man, he really needs to understand the basic rules of boxing. Happens every time. Although when an American gets beaten (beaten badly at that!!) by a foreigner, there’s always going to be fingers pointed. First fight it was the “counter”, second fight was the “heavy suit” snd “loaded gloves” and “corrupt refs” and “traitor cornermen” and this fight we are back at the counter again. Wilder is a warrior but he isn’t in Fury’s league. Let’s move on eh
It's never ever been a 10 (second) count its the refs discretion and used a Refrence point. Joe rogan is very very clever especially in contact sport but always gets this wrong. Never been seconds!
That Ref was selected because he’s proven in the past to stop fights and protect the fighters from themselves ..?
I think old school Mike Tyson would destroy both these guys.  It’s so strange that mr fury looks so out of shape and yet isn’t.  How does someone train so hard and looks fat?
No no and no. The problem with boxing is that even MMA announcers don't understand the rules of boxing. The Ref did exactly what he was supposed to do under WBC rules! When the boxer does NOT go to the designated neutral corner the Ref STOPS the count until the boxer is in that corner!!! That's the rule! This fight was officiated perfectly. I am shocked at this spaceman's lack of understanding of basic rules.
Joe puts whole lot of sauce on people that are good at stuff lol
Cenk wants to fight you joe give him the business I will buy that pay per view
Learn the rules of boxing Joe. The ref was spot on.
Deontay is an amazing young bigger Tyson. Huge achievement for Fury. Tyson Junior vs Tyson Fury
It's funny how people try to forget that men named Earnie Shavers and George Foreman existed, when talking about punching power. George Foreman would have walked right through Deontay Wilder and possibly paralyzed him.
Fury was clearly lucid and fine for both counts. He was watching the ref and getting as much rest as possible. If the ref counted faster fury would have gotten up faster. This is a non story. Enough excuses already
Yo dude Rogan! How come you don't invite Beetlejuice from Howard Stern to your show? BEETLEJUICE! BEETLEJUICE! BEETLEJUICE! PLEASE!
Joe Rogan doesn't know shit about boxing
tyson fury  he's the greatest ever fact in any era respect to ali tyson etc but he's the greatest he's so big 6'9, nearly 300 pounds, moves like a lightweight, ko anyone , unmatched IQ, unlimited gas tank ! He's the greatest ever fact 👑🐐🙌🏻🔥
Whats up with the space suites
lol, I watched it in real time and thought as soon as it happened: "I bet Joe Rogan talks about that shockwave of fat"... to be fair, it was incredible! Great fight - Wilder is a far better fighter than I ever gave him credit for.
Be fun to have Tyson Fury’s dad John Fury on the show. Good video here  https://youtu.be/zsHFYasUO2M
Joe is having this conversation with the wrong people. They don’t seem to know anything about boxing.
That’s the shock waves from his head rippling down his body  Nope just Wilders right hand hitting Fury’s body after connecting with his head
George Foreman - Ron Lyle   (1976)   Tyson Fury - Deontay Wilder  (2021)
@8:18 he’s talking about Squid Games 😂😂💀
Joe doesn't shut up for 2 seconds this whole episode.  Turning into a real know it all blabbermouth
Exactly Joe Rogan it should be a real 10 second runoff but because boxing is so corrupted this is what happens I’m cool with fury winning because he’s a better boxer but he definitely got knocked out and didn’t make the count
The irony is that Mike Tyson lost his belt because of a miscount because he already knocked out Buster Douglas the round before and the same thing happens to Diante Wilder when Tyson fury was down longer than 10 seconds but because of the ref not following the rules Diante Wilder eventually got knocked out
We have millionaires podcasting and streaming in space suits. We are truly at the beginning stages of Idiocracy. I for one welcome Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. He would be a great change from Trump and Biden, plus he fucking loves guns.
These  🤡 are just making excuses for wilder 😒
His real name is Luke....
That’s not how the count works. The official count is done out side the ring and the referee references the outside count to maintain the proper time.
Do people like Tony? The guy is a goblin.
Love Joe Rogan but he knows fuck all about boxing especially the rules
I think we all go with what fits the narrative we prefer. If we like Fury we love views that support him. If we like Wilder we do the same.    For example Jeff Mayweather said the count for Fury in the 3rd fight was fine...but he also said he thought Wilder won the 1st fight. Some quote Jeff as a boxing authority/man of experience...but they only mention one of the things he said. Let's not be biased.    Both the 1st and 3rd fights had controversy around the count for Fury. Joe Rogan made an unbiased observation about that. The '10 count' should be set because one ref could count 10 seconds, another could easily count every 2 seconds making it 20 seconds in total.    I don't think anyone disagrees with Fury being the better 'boxer', but Wilder levels the playing field as a 'fighter'. Fury proved that 9/10 times skill and determination will probably win over raw power and determination. But Wilder equally proved that with enough determination and even with one tool (power) a person can win.    This was an epic/legendary clash of styles. Goes to show that everyone can achieve something with their gifts.
Ten rounds deep and after being rocked earlier, I can't praise Fury enough for that five shot finish, with four of the five landing.
Lol and the space suit?
hahaha this guys dont know shit
Tyson Fury Vs Wilder was like Rally Motorsports -crashes -KOs, turbocharged and never knew who would win till the end.
You don’t get 17 seconds to get up & you only get 10 seconds, anyone saying the count was not off is a damn lie 🤥🤥🤥🤥 Wilder won clearly in the 4th and took unnecessary damage after that
As his trainer said Wilder was great Fury was greater 🤷‍♂️
Fury was in no danger of not getting up in this fight. He times the ref counts to rest then stand up. His eyes were clear. Joe and DC need to stop tugging each other and talking nonsense giving Wilder another excuse
Everyone’s a professional boxing referee now🤔  Fury won fair and square
Joe you should invited Canelo to your podcast
I love Joe but he's wrong about the long count, it's already been debunked. It's also in the rules that if the ref has to tell the fighter a second time to go to a neutral corner, he has to stop the count then restart it, not continue as if he hadn't stopped the count. Joe just doesn't understand the rules.  "Mora had counted to five before noticing Wilder was walking around the ring. He then urged Wilder to walk to a neutral corner.  The delay gave Fury several seconds to recover before Mora resumed his count.  But as veteran MMA referee John McCarthy pointed out, the Unified Rules of Boxing show Mora made the right call."
We only get clips this long when Joe rants about men hitting other men.
Wrong
99.99% of human beings that have ever breathed would not get up from that Wilder shot to the dome.
If they did the screen thing it would still be an excuse makers paradise saying it started early or late always excuses…. Fury won 3 times
Well the problems is also. The fighter relies on the refs count because and sometimes they try to get as much rest as possible. Not saying this is the case but the fighter is not counting but looking at the ref for what the count is.
I have to get extra high when joe has the space suit on 😼😂🤣
Come on referees, it’s not that difficult! All you have to do is count: either 1 alligator, 2 alligator, or 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi! 🤣
NASA is code for Narcotics Assisting Stimulating Assertions.
Someone tell joe if he wants to talk about PURE skills/IQ Duran is the guy.. chevaz is a GREAT TOO but chevaz with all his IQ had more of blood/guts grit Mexican style ..Duran was the more technical..
GREAT fight! But joe i need that jacket lol xxl!! love it lol
Rules are in short, if the ref has to stop and rediirect the opponenet to neutral corner, he has to pick up the count where he was interrupted. The WBF rules (Rule 4.4) clearly state counting rules as follows: "  When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers."
Reminder when it comes to Joe and boxing, he thought Ronda was an ELITE boxer.
He has to want to learn how to move
Joe was just mad because he had Wilder winning probably lost money on him so he’s salty lol
The japanese do something like that using Chinese words.... eh ?!!
Joe is wrong here:  The count STOPS, it’s international boxing law. The count STOPS, when the ref has to intervene with the opposing contestant to make him go to a Neutral corner. FACTS. Research it.
Wilder was robbed, everyone likes Fury because he talks that jesus bullshit. But  from the first fight you could tell that everyone involved was on fury’s side. They knew if they didn’t give fury extra time wilder would fuck him up right away.
Refs in all sports are to human. Either they make mistakes or cheat, like when Herb Dean let's McGregor use his toes on the cage or grab the opponents gloves or throw illegal knees on the ground...
No excuses!! The better boxer won
You’re biased Rogan … learn the damned rules
Man.  Rogan is a moron. He always refuses to check basic info and just gets belligerent.
Power : Fury 7/10 vs Wilder 9/10 Boxing technique : Fury 9/10 vs Wilder 3/10 Defense : Fury 8/10 vs Wilder 4/10 Stamina : Fury 8/10 vs Wilder 4/10
You guys are missing the Good vs Evil angle. Wilder is a Satanist as exposed by his costume. Fury is a Devout Christian and he WON
Exciting defo but greatest of all time no
"its fun watching a boxing match with other people, its almost like your watching it in a small crowd" how do people listen to this drivel
That might be the official rules, but find me ONE title-fight in which that happens, where the ref picks up a count PAST where he left it. I've NEVER seen that.  Hell, most fighters now-a-days, practically RUN to the opposing corner when they knock someone down, so the ref starts the count quicker.  If what you guys are saying is true, that wouldn't even be necessary.   Furthermore, Who's to say Fury couldn't have gotten up quicker if it was required? If dude got-up from that combo in the first fight, he could have easily gotten up from that punch.
I used to think your comments were good but you’re talking absolute crap when you start this long count excuse nonsense
young jamie getting ripped at the start😂😂
Got halfway through the video and realised they were wearing spacesuit, why are they wearing spacesuits?
This was the best heavyweight boxing match of our generation we all won that night
Fury was fine, he was waiting for the count and could have gotten up sooner if necessary.
I am a boxing fan.. and I watch many rwally good bouts.. Now the Fury haters has come up with another excuse, the referee slow count.. Any referee coming up with a tenth count under 15 seconds, does not deserve to be a referee.. check a referee who has taken up the count from the time keeper, he is showing by hand movements and counting... It was not a long count.
Just Americans talking about counts and cheating accusations
No long count and both went down. Wilder sacked Mark Breland for not going out on his shield and went out on his shield in 3rd and last Time with Malik Scott. ps. A little notice. Tyson Fury has hit wilder more times in the 3 fights than all of Wilders fights combined???
Joe “of all time” Rogan
Joe I love you. But your wrong.  Only the ref counts and if he has to tell the other fighter go then the count stops.
Tyson Fury the Greatest Heavyweight Boxer of All TIME.........
nasa would be proud
This show has gone so downhill.. It would be more interesting to listen to three ameobas chat
Bit late aren't we ?? Fight was a week ago -and you finally come out your box !!! Too late masshole -shut the lid -go back to sleep !
fury hits hard because he manipulates his gloves.. is it true?
When Rogan has nothing to say, he just holds a word a long time as he releases it while saying something obvious and repetitive, such as "He hits sooooo .... haaaaaarrrrddd.....  so hard"
Fury took as long as he needed to. He would have got up before 10 regardless. Wilder got the same kinda loose count.
Shut up Joe, the fight was won by the better fighter. WHAT IF IF IF ... If the queen had balls she'd be the king. Wilder got whooped 3 times
You need the referee to count because the boxer uses that information to decide when to get up.
Wow., Joe has completely lost his credibility as a non biased interesting talk show host. He’s become a right wing nut job Joe your responsible for killing people by lying about ivermectin.. Your a retired MMA fighter..  sure people are responsible for their own actions and who they listen to but with all your fame and money comes a responsibility to think about what your saying to people because unfortunately some Americans think just because you have a podcast and have become famous then you must be credible… you should have a disclaimer that your just another Joe Schmoe who is not a scientist a doctor or a honest journalist.. just because other people will do or say anything to get rich and or famous doesn’t mean it’s ok that you say things that are killing people..  unless you come clean and admit your wrong about ivermectin, that you made a mistake , ivermectin is a parasite medicine for tape worms and not an effective COVID 19 treatment..  so now part of your legacy is that your a mass murderer ,  for money.. pathetic sad man
No one has knocked out more guys?  Billy Bird, Archie Moore, Rocky Marciano and a few others might have something to say about that.  lol
Stop with the long count crap. It’s completely legal and fury gets up with the count. He always takes the full time. Plus wilder had 20 seconds when he was knocked down as well.
Wilder got the fuck beat out of him 3 times .. you Americans think you where cheated... just a reminder ... greatest  so called boxer ever Ali split glove..mmmmm
It’s not a 10 second count Joe, but a 10 count. The two are very different things. It’s at the refs discretion. Also, fury was clear headed whilst on the ground and he stayed there to have the rest which shows his ring experience. If it was getting close to him missing it, trust me, he could’ve got up in time.
I’m calling you out Rogan.  https://youtu.be/AuD_G_WE4Sg
Hey boxing aficionado Rogan… Julian Jackson 55 wins 49 by KO. Sickest KO expert ever. George Foreman. 81 fights… 68 KOs. Wilder isn’t even top 3
The Knuckles Apparition-https://youtu.be/gXqjJ8tKvVg
Joe Rogan doesnt know shit about boxing smh
Name thing is the same for Usain bolt. Crazy you're gonna have bolt in your name and be the fastest man ever
I'm really not trying to be a dick, but can anybody tell me why tony hinchcliffe is funny?
B's, Fury had no problem with the count..
That ref has done plenty of shady stuff in the ring before.  No doubt he is corrupt.  Watch Abner Mares vs Joseph Agbeko.  Joseph was the champ and outboxing Abner the whole fight but the referee let Abner nail Joseph with low blows the ENTIRE fight.  Russell Mora the ref never took a point away despite all the warnings and then even had the audacity to call Joseph going down from a low blow in the 11th a knockdown.  That was a fight that just made me disgusted with Russell Mora.
love you joe, boxing is a soap opera joke now unfortunatly.. a total joke
Referee Richard Steele would’ve stopped the fight on the first knockdown of either fighter.
Wilder needs to learn some sort of foot work
There's probably hundreds of people in the world alive today who can punch harder than Wilder, they're just not in professional fighting
Y’all downplaying a boxer that gave his all in the ring Deontay started actually boxing at 21
What about Sugar Ray Robinson ? 175-19-6 (108 KO) and a perfect amateur career 85 victories 85 KO. Marcel Cerdan ?  119-4-0 (61 KO). Forman ? 75-5-0 (68 KO). Deontay Wilder is the best puncher alive, he's got the best stats, but there were boxers who knocked out way much opponents and boxing was rougher then.
Tyson "Big Rig" Fury ran Wilder down and that's the last time we heard of the dosser.
Fury has won all 3 fights without a doubt. Only "conspiracy" is how the judges thought the 1st fight was a draw.
Seriously lol that's the next excuse for wilder
Go to uk and do an episode with big John Fury !! Tyson’s dad that would be legendary!!!
Count was bs
YouTube needs to buy Joe back for 200m and f-off with it's censorship nonsense!
Joe high as hell
The last time I jumped out of my seat screaming ecstatically, was the 2017 Australian Open final, Roger Federer beats Rafael Nadal!
this is well and thoroughly debunked, Joe rogan just loves lying.
Rogan on another Tyson boxer & discrepancy with the count…  https://youtu.be/DeaEfoExJJg
Tony's too feminine he's thought more about how he's going to cross his legs when sitting than anything to do with boxing..he googled just enough before the show so joe wouldn't roast him
My G I Joe from 1967 had a space outfit just like Joe's.
Normative determinism.
Mora,  the referee did his job correctly in this fight (not a fan of this ref - check this guys rez he's done some fighters dirty in the past) but you have to check the ABC of boxing rules on the count.  It states very clearly -among the rules of the count-  DO NOT RUSH. Tyson is a smart fighter,  if he hits the ground he's going to stay down until the 8 count to gather himself as much as possible. The ref has a time stretch to check the gate of the fighter by asking him to move side to side raising both gloves and asking if he wants to continue.  yes,  the ref has a lot of power in the ring and this is how the count should always go down.  Theres no doubt the champs or the favored to win in a fight tend to be lent special or lenient treatment,  Wilder has benefited plenty from refs like Jack Riess and Kenny Bayless  check the reels. No one wants to see their guy lose but there were no losers in this match it wasn't about technicality at all,  it was a match for the fans these guys were trying to take each others heads off.
A man with vocal fry?
But these dudes never really hit clean, like the 90s heavy weights.
It's a "TEN COUNT" not "TEN SECONDS". Fury didn't get up right away because it wouldn't be smart, it's best to get as much time as you can get, especially when you're facing hardest hitter in the boxing world. Every boxer does this, even if they can get up at 2 they at least wait for 7. Anyone who has watched at least a couple of boxing matches would know that!
Sometimes joe sounds like he don't know shit
Fury is named after Mike Tyson

About names, I believe if you were named John or Caesar your life would have different outcomes based on which name you received.
Can anyone tell me as a boxing fan what was the timekeepers count after the referee broke his count to tell Deontay Wilder to go back to the neutral  corner will the timekeeper ever step forward in the public and do an interview about the third trilogy fight about what was the actual count after the referee came back to count after breaking his count 🤔💡🥊🥊🥊
~Yeah,.   ...So The FANCY WHITE GLOVE, (TRYING TO LOOK LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT) .............REALLY HAS NO PURPOSE/Yeah!?
I love how Daniel Cormier is a voice that matters in boxing for some reason. The referee has to stop the count to send the other fighter to the neutral corner if they’re not. Dc just doesn’t know a basic boxing rule.
Can’t stand Tony. I’ve tried but he’s just so annoying
“look at that fat roll down” 😂
Joe Mike Tyson has 50 wins 44 by knockout. Most within 5 rounds many in the first. Lol
Other people on other forums have said in boxing the rule book says “10 count” and not a 10 second count, and that the count can be paused if the other fighter is not in their corner
Never mind the Dr giving wilder more rest time when Dr should check in between rounds
I'm sorry to disagree with a lot of people here, but... This, in my own personal opinion, is *NOT* one of "The greatest Heavyweight Matches of All time". It was a *SOLID* good fight. But *mostly* it reminded me of apparently how spoiled we were in the Late 60's - Early 90's Boxing. Cause, I know a certain _Little_ 5'10'' , 220lbs, Monster that would have *EASILY* taken both of them out. But of course, leaving *THE* G.O.A.T. aside, Evander Holyfield, George Foreman, Ali, Frazier, and countless others, had *JUST* as great matches as the one Wilder&Fury just had.  So I don't know if we were just _Lucky_ back then to have so many *Actually* Great Heavyweights then, or if we're _Unlucky_ Now and just have only a few and far between, but it really feels like one of those two options is right.
~LISTEN You's People,.............    The REF. Had Placed A Very BIG Bet, ...................................................    For FURY To WIN,. via. His NIECE!!!  : \
a smart move for Wilder would be to go after Joshua & focus on just the money fights...Usyk would most likely beat Joshua in the rematch, so a Wilder vs Joshua would still make money
No one gonna mention what Joe is wearing ? I need it!
Your very very wrong Rogan gets your facts right
Fury is the better fighter and has proven that.. but both guys inspired me.. salute to both legends
I’m sorry but damn Rogan went in on Fury I feel like the count was good it was a great hit but he was there when he got up
The count is ultimately up to the ref. It’s not 10 seconds on the clock. It’s 10 seconds on the ref when conditions are met for the count to continue. That’s why the opponent should get the fuck to the neutral corner ASAP and stay there.
To be fair Tyson Fury won all 3 fights the only controversy was they didn't give him the win in the first fight.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
What he should have said was: Did you see the fight? No. Ok get tf off my show
Didn't Kobe Bryant practice dancing or slap tap dancing to better his footwork and upper body lower body coordination? ??? Probably helps with balance as well...... that might be what Wilder needs to defeat Fury
I have never watched Joe Rogan before and decided to give him a go for the first time and I could honestly say I hated every second of this 15 minutes I really tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but God he’s a horrible person and why on earth is he so popular do people listen to him I’m really sad after listening to this
AJ v klitshcko was a better fight
Joe go watch the fight again u moron, there was a split second when the ref stopped the count! Give over! Plastic MMA insight
Joe "Conspiracy Theorist" Rogan is no different from Alex Jones....
Don’t forget wilder broke his right hand in rd 2 hats off to that guy
Ah no, please no wilder v fury conspiracies lol.
Wilder has basically been beaten three times..I agree about the power..but joe really has to stop riding wilders junk..Fury outboxed and outclassed him three times..knowing he could get taken out with one shot. By the way, joe must have some body dismorphia to go along with his 100 million dollars..never wastes an opportunity to let all 59 million followers how fat Tyson Fury is..? Weird..could you imagine if mr fury was 277 pounds..and was shredded? Maybe he should take some of Joe’s TRT??
Fury had his eyes on the ref the whole time and milked the refs mistake. No foul play here
Ok,  count that on wilder, you can count 20
Leave it to Rogan to try to talk s*** about boxing. Biased AR we? Like UFC hasn't had some really disputed finishes. And what about the judges! UFC judges are horrible
Fury is the reason wilder will never be number one thats a tuff pill to swallow....wilder will be depressed a while lmao
Wilder didnt “all but accuse his own team”  . He DID accuse his own team. He accused them of drugging him by putting something in his water. Ridiculous.
wilder looked beat after round 7, he steadily got weaker and more exhausted and barely put up a defense let alone really fight back offensively - good fight up until then
Joe is such a bellend these days. Saying stuff with conviction which is wrong and waffling on about ‘what if Deontay could box…..’  yeah, we’ll what if Tyson had Deontay’s right hand.  …they don’t so let’s just concentrate on the facts and not some weed induced bullshit with a couple of comedians, one of whom, doesn’t look like he gives a shit anyway.
Mike tyson vs buster Douglas if you wanna see a looooong count...tyson should have won
DC doesn't know shit about boxing
Joe Rogan should really stick to commenting about boxing and MMA and STFU about COVID-19 and vaccines.
Tyson Fury is like The Undertaker when he gets knocked down.
This was a fun episode, but thank god for the ability to fast forward when Rogan starts babbling about Covid.  Texas is a mess with Covid right now but the way he talks about the state, they're doing amazing.
wrong joe! refs give more time to taller fighters, duh. It takes longer for them to get all the way back up, so refs give a second or two more depending on the height discrepancy. Anyway, the better fighter won.
They do that loud count for everyone to hear in the UK
Doesn't matter when  you're on the floor, you look to the ref for the count and act accordingly ideally being up in 8
(6) When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall direct the opponent to move to the farthest neutral corner of the ring. If the opponent leaves the neutral corner, the referee shall interrupt the count and will not resume the count until the opponent returns to the neutral corner.
Redban looks like he’s in the ecw😂
There are many things that go into the count but regardless, are you going to rob one of the greatest, most entertaining fights because of 2 extra seconds?
Joe doesnt know the rules of boxing. It's not about a 10 secodn count... IT's about makinksure the fighter is okay, the count isn't meant to an exact count to 10 seconds. It's the Refs count, Not 10 seconds. They would just have a clock if that were the rules....
Are everybody going to be blind on Joe Rogan outfit hahahahahahhaha /watch?v=hfjHJneVonE
Wilder should get fury to train him 😂
This fight was the best boxing match I've ever seen in my life live
Goofys are hanging on to this corner rule cause that's all they got. Tyson sloppy got knocked out and y'all know it.. 🤣🤣🤣... YOUR MORE INTERESTED IN WILDERS LOSS THEN TYSONS WIN.
Why can a knockout be career ending and most not? Unless it was Billy joe against Alvarez style?
Big facts fury gets long ass counts.. same with the first fight😂 still think he would of won the fight but that count was long as hell😂
WTF you guys are smoking that rappers weed wearing space suits PASS THAT SHlT!!!!!
Glad to know you haven’t joined the United Federation of Planets yet, and still have the American Flags on.
Both wilder and fury got very long counts in that fight
What a load of horse manure Fury was never in trouble he listened to the ref count to see when he needed to get up to suggest that he was in trouble is BS.
Looking like Joe is going on a field trip to the moon. On other note : Great Fight  👍
Wilder's legs were gone that right hand of fury to the ear was such a weapon of choice the jabs were hurting him though wilder has that power fury roughed him up real bad
Why ruin the fucking fight by talking about the referees count? Fury won the three fucking fights....end of!
It’s funny to see how different Tony is when just chilling, he’s so relaxed, soft spoken, almost seems shy… but the character Tony puts on on stage is like the polar opposite lol
Most likely an "error"??? 🤦🤮
The referee is really the Count who likes to count. One uh uh uhhhhhh, two uh uh uhhhhh....... that's why the count was slow.
Joe, you need to interview Doug Wilson...I think he could help you with your cosmology.
More conspiracy count bullshit. Blah blah f'ing blah
Joe, Wilder also got knocked the fuck out. relax
What microphones stands are these? They look so fly
I almost agree  with everything Rogan says. N trust me I  know boxing. He is by far the best  white American public figure taking about boxing! Solid points he made !
I think the ref speaks to each boxer before the fight and they go through the rules and shit during a knockdown?
So the question is this. If the count was done properly would Wilder have won?
Look at that fat roll down -Joe Rogan
Hey him into some dance lessons in Mexico u will see
Wtfff is joe Rogan wearing?
That fighter was called prime mike Tyson .
Fury looked like he was taking a break not being knocked out.
Your inviting losers . That only  care about Kim and Kanye and know nothing about boxing
Would have loved to watch the fight, but you twats had it on too late.. it was on at 4am here in England.
Deontay if he started when he was a child, the power/technique combo would be nothing that could not be matched
Next time get a boxing expert in there. Or look into boxing a bit more and lower the weed intake.
The count - Tyson was looking at the ref waiting it out as long as possible before he gets up. He would have just got up earlier if the count was quicker.
You can only work with the count in front of you.
Joe is wearing a damn silver space suit talking about boxing lol 😂
Joe " going to space " Rogan wtf are these idiots doing lmao
No mistake my friend Wilder was supposed to go to a neutral corner thats the rules that's why the count was longer it was Wilders fault for going to the wrong corner
Tyson was watching the ref and being clever listening to the count.
I strongly believe if wilder didn’t throw all of those powerful body shots in the 1st and 2nd rounds , wilder would be the winner. But that’s not what happened 😂
Did you watch the count on Tyson v Douglas? Tyson had douglas down and the  was 13 seconds. Go watch the tape. Count the seconds with the ref! Then Douglas comes back and gets Tyson with a good punch and delivers mike Tyson his first professional loss.    This is boxing. You may not think it's right. It's boxing. All of these fighters know this stuff going in.    The class after the fight is what matters. Making excuses and b.s. shows you everything you need to know about the fighter.
This fight made me a fan of wilder to keep pushing the way he did until the later rounds was amazing as fury is just on another level he will retire undefeated
I watched one of the pre fight interviews with Tyson Fury and he said that Wilder punches harder than any one he has fought and if you get caught out he can turn out your lights easily.
All keep thinking why they wearing that crap
As a black man I’m so happy Tyson Fury beat the shit out of Deontay Wilder. Wilder is like Lebron James a false manufactured champion which is why they both have no back bone and are such sore losers throwing tantrums and acting entitled to something real champions know how to win and lose
We not gonna talk about the astronaut suite joe is wearing?
The ringside count is done in most fights and it wasn't done in any of these fights.
Is it fancy dress day at Joe’s place ?? 😂
It's not 10 seconds, it's a 10 count. It's always been that way. I know that in this world of conspiracy it's hard to understand that your fundamental understand of how things should be.. could be flawed.   Do you think that 3 seconds after getting hit by a truck makes a difference?   Tyson was watching him. Not counting seconds. Stop that silly stuff!  Wilder could never beat Tyson unless he knocked him out. He's just not a boxer. He's a puncher. Love his heart. Dangerous man. Just not a boxer.
Wilders boxing IQ is 0
It’s not 10 seconds it’s a count also if the ref looks over and the other fighter isn’t where he is meant to be the count can start over
I really like Joe but he obviously doesn't understand the rules of boxing
Is Wilder now wishing he took the Joshua fight i instead??? shout out to who left that comment ' the Bronze dosser' must be a WBC belt somewhere for you
Not gonna lie fury always gets LONG COUNTS smh joe is not lying
What you should understand is that the ref makes the call. Tyson was watching the ref count and was taking his time.  Watch the fight.
GOD
I wish deontay had actual real footwork and head movement. Would’ve been the difference
Wow that guest not knowing anything is annoying. The odds he is called Tyson fury and is a boxer is high since he is from a long line of fighters and was named after Mike Tyson.
The long count stuff is just bullshit, just accept he lost already.
Wilder has benefited from slow counts or ref slow balling it just check his Luis Ortiz fight out he was given loads of time too recover hell even a doctor came into ring too give him more time. The 10 count isn't literally 10 secs it's the referees count too 10. Fury didn't even look hurt when he went down whereas wilder did every time, plus experience boxers I.E fury times it so they don't just get up quickly once dropped they take every second.
Tyson cheated because he used dmt
its in the rule book
JOE its the oppsoite. the guy outside the ring starts the count. then the ref picks up the count. and if the ref needs to stop the cpunt due to a fighter not being in the neutrual corner the refs stops the count and picks up where he left off
We need a Tyson Wilder 4. That should put an end to it all lol
Listen, Fury won PERIOD! So tired of all the excuses from all three fights between these two. Fury beat him three times.
Joe you don't know about boxing let it go
He was named after Mike Tyson
Deonte wilder vs Francis  ngannou in a boxing match
Damn
Fury had to wait to the 8 count before he could continue fighting; Standing up or On the floor so he chose the floor. Also Wilder was breaking unsportsmanlike and corner rules by celebrating outside the neutral zone before the ref stopped the match which made the ref slower on the count. The Nevada boxing commission rules state that.
Did you not see Wilder try to walk by himself walking to the locker room? Wilder is done, if he comes back he won't be the same. Tyson Fury is the King!
It’s very similar to the Douglas vs Tyson in 1990 when Douglas was said to have benefited from a “long count” but beat the count and was up and nine. He goes in the knock out Tyson two rounds later. It’s NOT the fighters responsibility to know what the time keeper is doing. He just has to follow the referee.
Fury was down for 14 seconds the first fight and 17 seconds the 3rd fight. It is what it is though.
Long count, short count, Fury was never going to lose Wilder.
Pretty sure when the fighter that caused the knockdown leaves the neutral corner the count stops.
Not only was it a long count, it was a noticeably slow count too. Not that it affected the fight though. It seemed dodgy pre-fight when it was announced that the referee would be American and all 3 judges would be American also, in a fight in USA involving an American fighter against a Brit.
I love Deontay. He is the real life Apollo Creed but he should not have gratulated Fury. &@ck sportsmanship. He legitimized Fury. Fury fans were so mad because they had no control of Wilder. Once he Apologized it was like “good boy”. He should not have bended the knee.
It's in the rules of boxing that if the standing fighter leaves or doesn't go to the neutral corner the referee can stop the count to make sure standing fighter goes to neutral corner end of it
Why are they all in space suits lol
Bit of an exaggeration on ring count fury did not look out or unable to continue proof in the victory wilder looked out on his feet most of fight did the ref intervene!!!!!!!
This might be the worst take on a 1 on 1 sporting event I've ever heard. Rogans brain has Covid fog.
The count is negotiated by The Boxers teams
Bruh fury wasn’t even close to being knocked out, he took a big hit and then basically got pushed down and I think he just took the fall because if he stayed up he could’ve got knocked out if he was hurting. Wilder was basically knocked out on his feet since round 4 he looked so out of it
In MY opinion: If the difference between a guy being "good" to fight and disqualified, is like 2 seconds... I kinda think he deserves another chance to get back in there. But what joe says about the LCD timer would be the most fair way to go about it. You cant really bend the rules for different fights... but you don't wanna stop a super-fight early on some 1-second count bullshit.
Got to give props to Wilder for dragging this fight out to the late rounds being so out skilled  ....if he had found his talents say about 12 yo he would have been possibly the best ever...big props to Fury...Rogan is 1000% correct about the count
Cmon wilder was beaten fair and square ,, long count my arse ! Maybe the ref was rasist why not throw that in there too ! Excuses excuses better man won end of !
Wilder was not out on his way down on last knock down. He was purely exhausted. The next camera angle of wilder they show he’s already sitting on his stool.
Deontay knocked out 41 bums jesus rogan is clueless
First met: Wilder and Fury hug one each other longtime. Second met: No hug, talk little. Third met, Wilder: Bye, I don't respect you.  Wilder is a real looser.
Rogan looks like Dr evil with that suit.
Tyson Fury's punches are SO tight, like machine parts moving in sync.  Just how his arms move like well-oiled MACHINES with his hooks. The exact same perfect hooks like everytime.
That’s wrong Joe, the ref gets the Count from the side counter to START, once the ref starts counting the ref has full discretion! If he needs to tell the fighter to get in to his corner he picks up on the last number he was at. This is the correct rule.
People really making a big deal about this bullshit count. Fury was in no way out. He just made the best of the count. No one is saying that Wilder got saved by the bell after that first knockdown.
No controversy no long count, know the rules Joe!
Man,  you are just wrong Joe Rogan.  Imma say it right now , your pod cast hits like walking into an off campus frathouse.  Knowing something about alot of things doesn't mean that everything that crosses your mind is right.
He said Youngstown !!!! Repping the yo
When the referee officially takes over the count it is his discretion when it can be paused or continued. Go watch Brian Campbell on the morning kombat fury versus Wilder recap he explains it perfectly. There was no scandal or corruption.
Joe’s last two fight recaps start with him asking if the guest saw the fight, they say no, and Joe goes into a full recap anyway lol
The count starts from when the ref points to the canvas signifying a downed fighter the person with the timer n bell starts the count the ref takes up the count when he's put the other boxer in a neutral corner, Tyson took his time with the count, eyes were clear 🥊💞🥊💞🥊
Experienced boxers always get up off the canvas according to the count that they hear, and will try to take 8 seconds, for maximum recovery. If the ref counts faster, the boxer will get up sooner.
Tyson Fury as skilled as he is CANNOT be called one of the goats - the man has 1 and I repeat ONLY 1 title defence, you can't be considered the best with 1 title defence - name any other person in any sport considered one of the best of all time with only 1 title defence.
Joe talks a lot of shit.
If u watched all the fights you saw this ref in an earlier fight mess up. The boxer was knocked down and the ref had to instruct the other boxer. In that process the knocked down boxer had gotten up and the ref never gave a standing 8 count and just allowed the boxers to continue.  The card was to big for the ref.
Rogan is an idiot saying the count was long fury won the first fight hands down and beat him handy in the next 2 fights what's wrong with these people stick to the ufc rogan.
If wilder won that fight would they mention the doc coming in the ring would they mention the 13 sec count wilder got, it makes me laugh how far people will go to make a excuse for wilder loses in all 3 fights
Joe .. come on bro .. I like you and everything but say it like it is … the count was slow and no one did anything about it
I love when Joe makes up all of this should have been, may have been, if this happened or that happened lol. Its over and now someone else will get a chance to dethrone a very very tough man Tyson Fury.
Tyson was sleeping on the floor in the hospital for a month fighting in his lil baby girls corner leading up to this fight! Imagine what a prime Fury would have done, hats off to the champ for having the worst camp leading up to the fight but never mentioning it
Wilder koed Fury 2x
Joe talks an eye watering amount of bullshit these days!
Jeff Mayweather says the count is legitimate, and I'm sure he knows more about boxing than Joe does
Im sorry it wasn't the greatest heavyweight fight Jesus have you forgot 30s/40s/50s/60s/70s/80s/90s heavyweights. Disrespectful
This is the first I’ve heard that Kanye & Kim got divorced.
5:01 Joe Rogan confuse Tyson fury for Diante Wilder
Apollo creed lol.......Wielder hit's you once RIP I think not ask Tyson..............Nock downs don't mean shit now......You just pissed him off......And you pay.......Joe slow count wake up let's do it again Tyson was punching lumps out of him Wielder had NO nothing the hay maker was NOT working YOU Americans big or go home.....Look at your car industry BIG power BUT NO control.......You are supporting a black man don't forget the same black man YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON.........SHAME ON YOU WHITE PEOPLE.
Buster Douglas was down for over 10 seconds but they didnt stop it and then he KOd Mike Tyson
You can call it strategy all you want, but Fury basically cheated with all those fking headlocks!!! Why TF Didnt that ref start deducting points for each violation? Ive never heard "LET GO LET GOI!!!" so many times in a boxing match. At least he kept his hands in his fking gloves this time cuz that shit was straight dirty af.
Had to stop watching, couldn't handle hearing how crazy or how insane everything was. Vacuous comments,, surprising considering Joe was in the fight game.
There are so many idiots on boxing rules and Joe is one of them. The count isn't a set in stone thing. Its to let the knocked down boxer  gather his thoughts and get up. Its a break in the action. The ref can stop it and not even count if thats his decision the count in boxing is a small amount of time to see if the knocked down boxer can get up and continue
WHAT ABOUT THE DOCTOR STEP IN FOR WILDER!.. WILDER GOTNTHEBSAME COUNTS !!!
Not to mention wilder broke his right hand mid fight
Tyson Fury was born Luke Fury. He changed his name, but still a bad ass name.
It's standing 10 count, not ten seconds since being knocked down. This has been the same since I started boxing in the 80s.   It's up to the ref to start to make sure the other fighter is in position. Wilder kept encroaching and the ref stepped and told him.
the queensberry rules state that if a ref has to interupt his count, he must start where he left off
How many times has Tyson got to knock Wilder out for the Americans to be happy that Tyson is a greater fighter?
Sorry Joe, you're wrong about the count. This has been analyzed over and over by people who know more about boxing than you, and the count was legit. It's supposed to be a 10-count, made by the ref, at the ref's pace, this is specifically clarified in the rules of boxing. It is NOT specifically supposed to be 10-seconds exactly. Also, if he has to stop counting because the other corner does something wrong (such as not going to a neutral corner, like WIlder did in this case), the count is SUPPOSED TO STOP while the ref addresses it. This is INTENTIONAL. It is meant to be a penalty to the corner for not doing what they were supposed to do. Also, Tyson is CLEARLY watching the ref, waiting for the count to get up. If the ref had counted faster, Tyson would have gotten up faster, this is obvious when you watch the replays.
When Wilder got knocked down in the third fight the first time he got a standing 14-count. The ref counted eight but he took another five or six seconds before he turned Fury loose on him. That was the end of the round and it was the next round when Wilder knockdown Fury. That was a longest standing 8-count I've ever seen in my life.
That was not a great fight! Wilder was not ready period!
Budget Trussell
The one thing I would say, is that they should’ve given wilder a full ten count when he got KO, cos in the first fight (12round) fury looked just as KO and he got a ten count.
lmfao dude is thinking of WII Boxing when you play!! baahahahahaa
I love Joe and others in that scaphander suit haha so good
It's like listening to the know-it-all guy in the bar that never STFU......
When fury got knocked down in the third fight I didn't think it was over Joe. He got hit a lot harder than that in the first fight he's got up then. Why would you think he was not going to get up? He's Tyson freaking Fury!! He's made a pig Iron and Steel!
Most UK travellers are named after boxers.
Fury said he took every second that the referee was giving him in......no way would he have been counted out if the count was quicker
When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers.
I disagree about the count.  Yeah the ring side count is there, but it's up to the ref.  There were plenty of signs Fury was fine, and likely only stayed down to beat the count late, just like everyone does,.  I doubt it would have changed anything.  It's called a 10 count, not a ten second count.
For those unaware the referees first job is to get the fighter who landed the knockdown blow to a nuetral corner. Then it's a 10 count at the referees discretion. It's called a 10 count not a 10 second count. This was a hot debate many times but especially right after Buster Douglas fought Mike Tyson 31 years ago. Joe really should know this as a connoisseur of the sport
I did not think for one second that Fury wasnt getting up
Crazy and action filled?? Maybe after the 7th round
Wilder's only chance was to knock Tyson out. If you are going to slow count and give him 20s to get up, then Wilders chances are much lower. I could see Tyson getting waved off in both first and third fight.
The most incredible thing about fury is his conditioning ! Out of this world
Was it a slow count?
Does nobody wonder how Wilder put on nearly 40lbs of lean muscle over 2 years? Once you've been training for a few years its really hard to gain extra muscle. Seems like obvious steroid use to me...
I shall name my child Murphy Raw and become the greatest comedian of all time.
Rogan cut the BS and read the boxing rules, or stick to MMA.
Wikder knocked out 40 unranked bums, what's really crazy is he was wbc champ but still fighting fighters ranked over 100, that really is insane.
He's one of the hardest punchers... who the fuck started this bullshit ? Proper sheep mentality
10:05 joe sounds like he's about to get stuck in a never ending loop of "could he have kept going or not"
you broke my heart, joe.   you have always been a voice AGAINST this kind of ignorance, and here you are promoting it.  look up the rule.  it was neither an error nor corruption, the referee did his job perfectly.  you said, "i don't think it's a rule  that allows him [the referee] to do that [stop the count until the fighter moves to a neutral corner]."  IT IS A RULE, STATED WITH PERFECT CLARITY:  "The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the [furthest] neutral corner and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner."  you owe the world an apology.
Fury was all there watching the ref count and waited until 8 to get up, he would have got up sooner, watch the clock when wilder went down in the 4th, the clock was on 37 when he went down, it was 22 when he got up
Actually the referee handled that situation exactly by the rule book. I’m boxing the rule book is designed to hurt the person who didn’t go to the nuetral corner by giving the knocked down person a longer count. And the referee is supposed to pick up right off where he stopped counting before. Look in the rule book. And it’s done like that because the person who doesn’t go the neutral corner is most likely in his own corner where he can focus on what his trainer is telling him to do. Deontay went to his own corner not a neutral. That’s why the ref did what he did and fury was the champion. Typically in boxing the champion gets a slower count and the challenger gets a quicker count by 1 or 2 seconds. It’s like one of those unspoken things in boxing. And the count isn’t actually 10 seconds it’s a count to 10.
All the counts were slow. It's a 10 count not a 10 seconds count. No controversy, ref was taking HIS time all night long, not just on the counts. Not rushing, which is fair enough.
Wilder stated that he was off balance.  He said that the knock down knocked his equilibrium off.
The more I watch this...the more it annoys me. Americans just cant stand to lose can they? Excuses...Excuses...Excuses.. .😒😒😒
Wilder had a extra long count as well, he went down there was 37 seconds left of the round on the clock, by the time wilder got up there was 21 seconds left
I love the it when jamie talks. He seems like a smart person!!
The ref started counting at 4. Check it out.
wilder can't box....i been saying this for 4 years
Joe just stick to mma for fuck sake
Joe Rogan tyson fury was knocked spark out he was still good enough to fight but right it shouldn't be up to the reff to count
Not only is Tyson Fury an incredible boxer with crazy speed, skills, and physical proportions….he has a huge personality, intelligence, and other talents that would make him exceptional in life. I got a kick out of it when Tyson sang after the fight. He did a good job. Born again, Christian.
Is it me or does joe rogan sound kinda boring latley
If it was a British referee counting, it would have been called corruption. 😂
Fury is foreman 2.0
Wilder was the real champ
Turning on to see joe wearing a nasa top,, straight away instant switch off. Guy is a sell out. He used to be the biggest nasa basher going about in his early days
He was still up at 9 and he was watching for the count waiting for 8 to get up
If the Ref was counting quicker Fury would have got up quicker. He was taking advantage of the count.
Doesn’t matter how hard you punch you ain’t knocking a calm collective crazy man out  His head is at places the average man will never be able to go   Fury 😎
They changed the JUDGES AND ref last minute before the fight Fury had to WIN
Wilder v.s. ngannou ? Who wins?
Tell Deontay that, maybe he’ll take it seriously! @joerogan
"Look at that fat ripple *Jamie lemme see that again"* Had me dead.
Wilder boxed 40 scrubs😂
Cringing at Tony acting like a massive boxing dilettante.
Wong tu
These comments show a lot.... Str8 bs
That straight right hand on Fury is the exact same punch that nearly murdered Ortiz and Brezeale, the fact Tyson was able to stand back up then go on to dominate the rest of the fight is insane
Thsts not true, the ring side stops counting once the ring ref starts. And its a ten count not 10 seconds. The ten count is the refs time to analyze the fighter to make sure hes not concused or to make sure he is still healthy enough to fight. Thats why its not a ten second count. So many fighters would have lost if it was ten seconds. Notice fury being the seasoned vet that he is, was looking at the ref the whole time watching the count. He could of got up ealier but seasoned vets wait until 9 before they get up. Fury took advantage of the fact that the ref had to stop the count to direct wilder to the neutral corner. Read the boxing rules. The ref has to stop the count to direct the fighter to the neutral corner.
No he stopped his count at 4 and picked his count back up at 6. Tyson put a beating on Wilder.
Joe doesn’t like that 🇬🇧 Tyson has a muffin top and is the 🥊 Champ….always simping for 🇺🇸 Wilder cuz hes jacked.  Merica 🇺🇸 #2
joe rogan knows nothing about boxing
It was a good rigged fight...sports entertainment
So fury got long counts in Rd 12 fight 1 and Rd 4 fight 3? 🤔
A 10 count does not mean 10 seconds. It's based off of whatever pace the ref wants to.
They should take Deontay to Apollo's gym to improve his footwork. It worked for Rocky...
Not a good argument on a long counts when Fury were down twice in a 4th rd as  Fury was well awake the whole time
He loves talking about wilder who lost 3 fights to fury. Wilder was down more than fury
highest percentage of knockouts, not the most.  Earnie Shavers 68 knockouts in 74 wins, Joe Lewis 52 KO's
The fact that they are debating the refs count when Fury was down is fukn dumb, he was never rocked enough for a count to take him out.
When I was at a pal's house. Everyone was yelling on the amount of energy Fury had. Especially at the end i died of laughter but was impressed how he started singing. But much impressed on wilder taking many hits til round 12. Fury is a god at this rate now. Some wilder fans got pissed and were blaming Fury was on drugs during fight. I call bullshit on that.
The Better Fighter won,  Long count, short coun,t intermediate count. I got nothing against Wilder, Fury won. .., life goes on. I very much doubt that, ether man has a bad bone in their body
Joe trippin! Wilder one of the hardest hitters of all time? Tell me specifically why? Fury’s been down by a cruiser weight. Bcuz he kod Ortiz? News flash 40 hws ko Ortiz. Shannon Briggs k.os Ortiz. And fury is kinda like Francis n. We think he’d beat everyone based on funky triangle theories but if ur not lazy, does he beat werdum? He lost to Derek Lewis. I mean I THINK he’s good. I’m not even SURE fury beats aj or whyte. If cruiser weight Steve Cunningham dropped him, aj/whyte can’t? People need to realize styles make fights, wilder is physically weak. Whyte and aj are practically power lifters so that leaning won’t work. “Hell just box from the outside”. You mean like wilder 1 where he was dropped 2x by wilder who is levels below aj in technicality. How do you figure wilder finds a hole and not aj/white. All time, fury hasn’t even proven top 15. I think he loses to aj. 50/50 whyte and 60/40 usyk. Mark my words, he’ll only fight uSyk or retire
This is what happens when a paper champ knocks out 39 terrible fighters and then gets a full on ass kicking when he meets a real boxer. Until Fury came back everyone was slating heavy weight boxing for being rubbish and for very good reason.
fuck spotify. joe only says what we all know
Nasa propaganda suits...
Slow count. Get a life Rogan. Tyson Fury came from the womb to box and he won all 3 fights as he can take anything Beyonce Wilder can throw at him
->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
Where these lot going ? To the moon or Mars
No. Ref has complete discretionary over the count. Wilder made a mistake for failing to get to a natural corner. Remember it is called a 10 count not a clock count.
People talking with absolute confidence without having any knowledge on the subject.
Did Joe invite them just to listen to him talking?
Yeah and Wilder got hit haaaard in round 11 - so hard he collapsed on the ropes was counted out guys
He was named after Mike Tyson, he is a very young guy. People forget
lol ive never said this before but this is hilarious.  we obviously know what happened
There's a count man by the side of the ring its his job to take up the count while the referee puts the standing fighter into the neutral corner. Considering he put on 20 odd pounds and knocked him down twice the weight gain worked but unfortunately fury is just too big
Now we know why they switched the referee at the last minute. That referee wasn't supposed to doing that fight and he was suspended prior for "performance" issues. Its very suspicious...to say the least.
Or the ringside counter didn't make it to 10 before Tyson got up and it's a moot point. what if that happened you're going to stop the fight and the ringside counter tells him you missed counted and Tyson got up at 8 or 9 he still got up before the count ended.
4:59 *deontay wilder
Fury was in full control of his senses both times he was counted.  Wilder is an egotistical sore loser and has been put in his place three times now.  He will struggle to come back after the beating he has had handed to him in the last two fights.
😂😂😂 Come on man, you knew the Wilder fans were going to come up with something if he lost. I guess it’s the 10 count this time lol. Let’s just forget that clown ref from the second fight that actually deducted a fucking point from Fury for some bullshit about not separating from the clinch….
lets go brandon!
It's safe to say that Rogan doesn't know boxing rules
Thank You! Glad J. Rogan said it. Now what can they say? Fury did the JRogan podcast. What's J Rogan bias?
Should Joe Rogan get Micheal Watson on the podcast?
Learn the rules of knock down count. The referee counts..... If the other fighter doesn`t go to a neutral corner, they stop until, they go to the corner. Anyway... Fury was watching and waiting.... Could have got up at 4.....
tyson would have got uo anyway. fighters wait until the count of 8 to get up. he wasnt out on his feet.
This should be retitled - ' 2 Americans make excuses as to why there boxer got beat '
How have they never heard of Queer St. Smh
Dude in the 2nd fight that ref was fully for wilder...
You cant say its a long count when after the 2nd knock down it was the end of the round.. the first tyson was ready to get up at any point
The long count wasnt corrupted nor was it an error...it was the ,"spirit of boxing." Lets let dead dogs lie. #Bombzquad
almost the same odds of a cutman being named Stitch
It’s crazy how knowledgeable joe is about MMA, but when he speaks about boxing he’s the opposite. 6 months ago he was saying Loma was the best ever, now he’s talking about a long count. Watch the video fury was down no longer than 9 seconds. He did the same with the Joshua fight, when anybody with a brain could see the DAZN clock was off.🙄
7:27 -7:34 Joe sounded like Trump 😂
Wilder wanted more after the 2nd fight. Now he got it lol.
the count - he still got up in 9 seconds anyways no matter how you look at it ( watching deontay looking at the rev , looking at your watch , STILL WAS 9 seconds :)
“If u could teach Wilder to box like Julio Cesar Chavez..” Aight Joe. Next we just have teach Giannis to shoot like Steph and we got the greatest Basketball player of all time
01:51 It's an all timey 🇬🇧 maxim. Queer was originally a synonym. For peculiar or unwell.
Wilder was too exhausted later in the rounds that's why he got knocked out.It could've gone to decision and Fury would've won anyways. Great fight
How many times have we got to go over this, it's a TEN COUNT not TEN SECONDS.  Stop being salty Joe Rogan!
I love Joe but he don't know shit about boxing
Greatest fight ever?!?  Great fight, but not even top ten.
One fight I remember screaming was Dan Henderson vs Michael Bisping the first time they fought
Good summary but you guys look like Halloween clowns in those NASA outfits.
People please do not let your jobs force you into getting the fake shot
Tyson Furys REAL name is Luke Fury.
I mean Joe's really trying hard to make fury's win no big deal
Oh dear Joe. The ref was on point. Its a 10 count not 10 seconds and also Joe please read the rules of boxing again.  Also the boxer follows the instructions of the ref so regardless of the speed of the count an experienced fighter gets up at last moment possible.
This guest knows jack shit about boxing, he’s speaking out of his ass
Fury alway been better then wilder. Wilder only fought Ortiz and fury everyone else was weak. Don’t respect wilder. And fury beat him 3 times. Joe rogan don’t know shit about boxing.
its a ten count not a ten second count
It's was about 1.5second longer because wilder went to the wrong corner, it's in the rules the ref can stop counting and resume  once the fighter goes to the right corner.
Joe looking kind of nutty in that jacket though.
Wilder can't get another rematch, it makes no sense, two KOs in a row
Did joe rogan  just had a trip on moon ?😂
There is a lot of long counts. Some of the guys would be counted out, but with most knockdowns, the boxer is just going by what the ref is saying. They stay down for as long as possible (if they need it) Like what Tyson did.
6:38  No no no Joe youre absolutely wrong here mate.  If the opponent hasnt gone to a neutral corner the referee shouldnt even START the count...........and thats exactly what happened here.  Wilder failed to go to a neutral corner and so Fury got extra time...........as SHOULD have been the case.  This is irresponsible misinformation...and people will believe you because youre meant to (and do)  know about combat sports.
Fury is a master in using his weight. He is always using his weight very well.
Deontay Wilder the heavyweight champion of the world.
The heavyweight championship title is The Greatest Prize in all of sports you don't make a mistake like that and that caliber of fight that was robbery
Joe Rogans opinion is becoming less and less important
That's blatant corruption you don't make a rookie mistake like that in a heavyweight championship fight
Wrong — since the 1920s the referee has had jurisdiction over the count. If the standing opponent doesn’t remain in a neutral corner the ref can pause the count. The ring side count is only there for reference — the ref can overrule it at their discretion.
Love listening to casual boxing fans waffle bullshit to eachother
Reffing combat sports is always controversial.  D1 wrestling tournament is filled with sketchy calls.  I'm sure Joe has countless examples in BJJ.
The Joe Rogan experience... What's that then? Being a complete knobhead🤣
Archie Moore has the record for most KO's. 145 KO's
Can't wait to see Twitter explain how Tyson winning is racist
The ref counted at the same pace for both fighters.
So this is a case of find (yet another) excuse for Wilder and then talk about how great a boxer Wilder would be............ If only he could box 😂
Joe, you need to finally interview Jamie.
Did they change refs at last minute....DA WELP
It's intelligence, most of the elite boxers have a high level of intelligence. This is what gives fury the edge, he is smarter than them all and can learn new game plans easily.
5:00-5:03 I love how Joe is so high he paused thinking "did that come out right? Well,  they're not saying shit, so it must have" lol
I hate how he says it almost didn't matter like Tyson didn't whoop his ass twice already...
Imagine how good Fury would be if went to the gym and worked out.
at this point i can't take joe rogan serious about anything moving forward talking about long counts. wow
"If you can teach wilder he will be great"....stop this bullshit joe..wilder has a yes man in his camp and his own trainer Mike Scott dive in a match just to look wilder unbeatable at that point..I get it he has power he can beat anyone but stop this imagination if he gets more skilled..he didn't learn from 2 fights though he fought hard and didn't give up its a no match against Fury.. And for me this is not a greatest fight of all time. People suffers from recency bias..Wilder cannot handle defeats and since he bullied everyone all his life and now there is a Fat man who knocks the f** out of you ill be no surprise if he quits boxing
If you could teach Wilder this and that !  Forget it, as Tyson is adaptable and will change and can adapt to each sitiation !  If, if if
Everyone knows Clint Eastwood is the greatest name of all time.
The other guy needs to be in the corner when the count starts and not hovering over !  Everyone is trying to knock Tysons win ?  Beat Wilder 3 times now, robbed first time, moaned about heavy suit, horse shoes in the gloves, drugged water and crooked cornermen in the second, and now a long count in the third !  Tyson won accept it and move on !  Just because you want a guy to win and dislike Tyson does not excuse this endless bitching !
How many Rogans tall are you?
"did u see the fight"?  "No" FFS
Rogan lives in the moment. Remember he thought Ronda was a once in a lifetime person and her boxing was elite.
8:13 lol Tony talking about Tekken or Street Fighter in the arcade
Last time I yelled out for an event was Diaz vs Lawler 2
Fury is a fine boxer, and is easily the best boxer around.  He is NOT one of the best heavyweights in history.  Ali, Frazier, Liston, Lewis, Marciano, Dempsey, Louis, Foreman, Norton, Tyson plus plenty of others would all beat Fury.  As Lewis said "never has such a big man, punched so small".
What happened to talking about aliens and interesting shit
What the fuck does he know about boxe? he thought that rousey was on mayweather's level ffs.
3rd option you misunderstand boxing rules Joe and it was all legit.....
The count was about a second or 2 behind but its doesnt matter if the count was slow, fast or fucking spoken in french Fury got UP 8 seconds after he hit the floor literally TIME it with a stopwatch his ass hits the floor he is up within 8 seconds....end of story
The ref count is a part of the "show". It's all for entertainment. Fairness is an inconvenience when money's involved.
I kept waiting for edgy brah to come out and threatening to choke the shit out of them for wearing those nasa suits. God i miss that guy.
I thought the count was suspended if the other fighter fails to go to a neutral corner. It doesn’t keep going.
"Look at the fat, look at the fat, look at the fat roll down"😂😂😂 Joe ass is crazy.💣❤💣💣❤
I don't quite understand the fascination with these Jr podcasts...very very overrated
Why is he wearing that
The fury are as well known for music .  Spell it furey    .  The fureys  or finbar furey .  The lonsome boat man
Ohhh it’s the Juggernaut
White people really celebrated this win lol
Did you also look at the count when Wilder went down as well
Wilders punches weren't clean enough it looks more like a push....
Fury didn’t even looked hurt when he went down , I think he could have  got up at four or five , he was just taking a breather
Geee...bad counts in boxing...say it ain't so...BWAHAHAHA
This commentary is all BS. In the 1970's and even in the 1980's Fury, Joshua, Wilder, Ruiz, and Usik would have been considered mere journeymen. Ruiz was fat and out of form and yet he beat Joshua. Boxing is a scam and these fights are fixed.
At 4:59. Joe made a blooper. 😎🥊
Joe chats so much shit these days, has no idea what he’s talking about regarding the count
There is nothing new on the long count it already happen in the time of dempsey vs. tunney tyson vs douglas wilder vs. fury 1
I Miss The JOE ROGAN Show.
Complete disagree with most of what joe said for the first time, just giving wilder more credit than he deserves for sure
Yes Tyson Fury is a much better boxer than Wilder but you can't discount the 40 POUND WEIGHT ADVANTAGE If they're the same weight Wilder knocks him out
Rogans boxing chat is off so badly most of the time
A message to all Wilders supporters. Your boy lost, 3 times. Get the fuck over it and show some respect.
Man come on tyson wasnt out out ever he was more pushed really
'Ifs and buts' don't mean shit. Bollocks to the count claim. Fury was clearly watching the ref fairly fresh and seeing how long to stay down. He would have simply got up quicker if the count ended sooner.
ASSOCIATION OF BOXING COMMISSIONS "When a knockdown occurs, the downed boxer’s opponent shall go to the furthest neutral corner and remain there while the count is being made. The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner."
was this recorded in the bezos penis rocket ?
*WBF* "When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers."
Considering 50 pound weight difference and still took him down twice.
We all knew he was getting back up more like! :L No chance he was staying down, felt that power before
Jeez this is probably the most shit I've heard Joe say in all of his podcasts. He's like some Wilder fan boy, trying to sugarcoat him and shit on Fury.
Learn boxing rules Joe.
why isn't anyone mentioning the long recovery time wilder was afforded after the first knock down also? fury had his eyes on the ref and followed his count. he did EXACTLY what a boxer is supposed to do.
Was waiting on joes overview of the fight
Lost a bit of respect for Joe after watching this. Analysis was poor and at points just not true.
Joe looks like Dr evil here
No, Joe is just wrong on where the ref has to pick up the count.   The literal rule is that the ref picks up the count from where he left it off. Not from the time keeper. That's just wrong.
Wilder got a long count as well
Greatest fights of all time Joe? Did you see Ali V Frazier. Neither one of the those boxers had the skills of Ali or Frazier.Good fight yes but not the greatest of all time 😎
Joe high as fuck spouting pure tripe and Tony Hinchcliffe is an absolute weapon. Can’t listen to this shite any more.
Joe talking a whole load of shit here. So much I cant even be bothered to unpick it all. just reminded why I dont listen to the podcast anymore
An EXTREMELY LONG count indeed… and he didn’t pick up the count at the right time, and Tyson didn’t know that much time has passed… he didn’t hear the time keeper on the side, so when the ref came back Tyson would have no idea on what the actual time was
I'm british and have no clue who those lads are with joe. He reminds me of myself, when i'm rattling on to people who have no knowlege of boxing. .
His dad called him tyson because he loved Mike tyson
Wilders a million years old, he ain’t got time to learn how to box properly
Whats with the stupid outfits
Need to bring Billy and Tony on together
Have anyone thought, what if Wilder is been fighting a superhuman,alien someone with extra life. The 1st fight got me thinking. Fury it too good to be true. Like him though
4 seconds in…   “did you see the fight?”  “No”
i believe Joe is getting a bit confused with the count rules here.
the referee was perfect. it would've been absolute shame if he stopped the fight earlier or if he counted faster,  that's in the boxing rules, the ref can set the speed of the counter so the fight holds on and it keeps entertaining people i think.
The ref in the first fight made a great call when Tyson got off the deck. Letting the fight go on.
I USE TO LIKE JOE ROGAN BUT NOW HE JUST SEEMS LIKE A REAL PRICK
*ASSOCIATION OF BOXING COMMISSIONS* "When a knockdown occurs, the downed boxer’s opponent shall go to the furthest neutral corner and remain there while the count is being made. The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where *he/she left off* when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner."
Rogan talking shit about boxing shocker, just get that chump scrub on and complete the set.
Don't let wilder watch this clip, or he might use that slow count as one of his excuses
He doesn't come back. His entire attitude since the beginning of this trilogy was to blame everyone but himself. He is so faultless that God himself was against him. Great match but Wilder is a dildo.
To be fair the Count was long for wilder too in the third round. I thought the referee was good that night, let both fighter a chance and stop the fight when it was clear it was over. Sad to see wilder movement looking more like a poorly oiled robot than a real boxer, but i MASSIVLY respect he's will to continue and fight. Fury is the goat, also i am sad he couldn't schooled Joshua but hey Usyk did. Next fight Fury vs Usyk will be a technical masterpiece. Without a doubt the WILDER vs FURY trilogy is one of the best if not the best boxing we have seen.
in this video they actually introduce Elon Musk's next Mission To Mars crew.
i will name my child tyson
Joe know your boxing the rules cleary state if the fighter leaves his corner during a 10 count the referee is duty bound to stop it until he returns to the corner that’s literally in the rule book and in fighters contracts u fool. A 10 count is not 10 seconds it’s literally the referrers count
amazing fight
Count the first knockdown when wilder was down, he got a 13 count
Mr Logical Joe Rogan. commiting suicide i9n front of his podcast viewers. extreme idiot moron.
Joe you are wrong about the count rules  If the other fighter fucks around the ref can pause the count
Fury was born Luke Fury, the Tyson name is a lie, he changed it to Tyson during his novice career am a massive fury fan but the Tyson story is literally made up by him and his dad I only live a couple of miles from him, everyone knows everything about everyone
Rocky KOed 43
*The REF was AMAZING! That counts were NOT bad, and he gave BOTH fighters the same count.* It’s a 10 count, not a 10 second count. Besides, *Tyson Fury said in the ring “I’m fine, I was just taking my time for the count.* Which proves he was fine, and would’ve been up. The referee was NOT biased, unlike the previous ref who continually separated them, and gave Wilder extra time etc.
8:20 why do I feel like he's taking about Tekken
Why did Joe even bring these guys if they didn't even see the fight........the biggest boxing match of this century like what the hell Rogan.
The long count argument is bullshit if the fighter is timing his rise from the ground against the count. Fury was clearly cognisant of the ref's count and buying his time by waiting on the count. If the count wasn't interrupted, Fury simply would have gotten up earlier to match the count. This wasn't one of those ten counts where the fighter is dazed and racing the count to stand up Fury's eyes were clear and he was capable of getting up when he wanted. The only argument here is that Fury may have had a few extra seconds to recover, but that's so negligible given he won every round immediately after the knockdown with ease. The better man won and deserved to win that night. There's no argument against this.
Wilder is the 2nd best heavyweight on the planet. He would ko AJ and Usyk
And what about the doctor when he was in the ring when the round started, now that was odd long count short count it down to the ref how he counts no one else
Julien ' The Hawk ' Jackson  , murderous puncher .
They don't pay a ref to panic
Arturo GATTI
I may be wrong but I understand that it's a count to 10  and not a 10 second count...  As long as the referee is consistent, his decisions can be subjective to his experience.
This episode was so boring I mean there was a few laughs but I was expecting way more with these folks on. Idk 🤷
Fury has got the best chin in the game..no one mentioned it..
I normally rate Joe Rogan quite highly,  but geezus he spoke some crap in this clip.  He was soooooo wrong on so many occasions.  And I'm talking factually wrong.  Not merely subjectively wrong.
Oh please, Fury has now beat Wilder 3 times. Do we have to do a fourth before people will accept it? Let's move on to Joshua already geeze!
The ref knows the rules of boxing a lot better than Joe Rogan!
Fabulous fight. Fury showed he has the knockout punch to go with his ring craft. He's getting better with age. Only usyk can give him a fight.
The fight was sub par at best. Ward/Gotti is a fight.
This is Joe's Stephen Smith moment... He doesn't know anything about boxing. Wilder had just as long a count by the ref for each time he was knocked down, actually longer average
When wilder hurt fury and knocked him down, I screamed and woke my whole family up , prob the neighbors too 😂
what the f is joe wearing?? lol
I would say for entertainment and was one of the greatest of all time I wouldn't say it was one of the greatest boxing matches of all time this wasn't even better than their first one in my opinion other than the fourth-round win Deontay Wilder got those knockdown southernmed it was all of Tyson Fury won every round it was more one-sided than it was in the second fight the only difference is his team didn't stop it Samsung what end up happening in the second Friday would have got ko'd but Deontay Wilder did show heart cuz he was gassed after the second round just to read his out of Sportsman no class but he did get the colonists she was like he wanted now we can ride off into the sunset I know I said he's going to continue fighting but I have my doubts he becoming more and more soft he's broke his hand now three times out of last 4 fight or something like that and even if I have surgery on it again
Wrong about the count rule Joe!
Redbar ruined this for me
Joe called Tyson one of the greatest heavyweights ever in this clip. He says talks about a flaw from his point of view from the ref and most people in the comments are butthurt.
Fury was never out tho he waited for the count to start getting up and wilder had about 24 seconds to recover on first ko
Your boy is schmacked. Joe with the shits 🤣🤣🤣
Joe knows fuck all about boxing
I like that they hype a street fighter with a gimmicky knockout punch so that Tyson Fury's gimmicky hanging and holding a man he so much skilled than. Now we saying 1 of the great fights. Gtfu. Both fighters are wack and weak. 1 is a cheater and family cheaters and the opponent is over hype amateur
As has been said, again and again by anyone who knows the sport, it's a ten count that starts when the other boxer gets to the neutral corner. Fury is smart and always jogs to the neutral corner so the count starts. Wilder is not smart (shocker, I know) and struts around before getting his dumbass to the neutral corner. The end.
MMA guys dont know shit about counting
There was slow counts for wilders knockdown when he missed and got caught with a right hook the ref spent a few seconds putting fury in his corner
Americans always seem to find a conspiracy
He should stick to MMA, his take on the 10 count in boxing is rank bs
His father named him after Mike Tyson!  It’s not a coincidence!
Talk to teddy atlas joe he can explain it to u, the ref controls the count
Fury would have been stupid to get up on 3 when he could wait. He can’t help what the ref does. Also, all of the judges were from the US and the ref was SO quick to stop Fury from draining Wilder in the clinch, so if there was any outside influence on the result… 🤷🏻‍♂️
Hmmmm... Wasn't Wilder throwing a load of body jabs early on in this last fight? He looked a better boxer this time to me. But what do I know. I'm just a casual. Meh!
Am I the only one who kept waiting for Joe Rogan's take on the match. PLEASE Joe do an interview with Sugar Hill!!! I am a massive fan of this guy.  An extended interview with Sugar Hill by Joe Rogan would be the best thing ever.  Better still, get Tyson Fury AND Sugar Hill on.  But, the inside stories that Sugar Hill could tell of the training, the match, and the partying and being part of the Fury camp and family - that's what I want to see!!
In the second fight Wilder's trainer threw in the towel
Will someone please tell Joe to light the background on the guest angle.  The back-and-forth of the camera switching is extremely annoying and straining on the eyes. The Joe angle is “The Strip” in Las Vegas, and the other angle is the backside of a fucking bear’s hibernation cave.  For fuck’s sake!  At least put some lights on those damn curtains to even out the balance, Christ!  if anyone darker skinned than Sanjay Gupta shows up wearing a black turtleneck, the only thing we’ll be able to see is eyes and teeth floating in the shadows.  The lighting in his temporary set-up was way better than this bullshit.  do you see this shit on Jordan Peterson‘s show? Bill Maher‘s show? CNN or Fox interviews? Johnny Carson? The Ellen show? No!! Do you know why? Because it’s a fucking stupid idea, that’s why.  it may look cool when you’re sitting there live and in person. But on camera in your living room it looks like shit. The automatic ambient lighting sensors of modern TVs don’t know what the fuck to do about the situation. Fuck it’s annoying!!
For those who wonder how the ref counts; when a knockdown occurs the fighter must go to a neutral corner. At that point the timekeeper will begin the count, and the ref will pick up that count, which is why you’ll often hear them start counting at 3 or 4. It’s then on them to continue the count at their discretion, and if the fighter leaves the corner at any point they are to stop the count and correct that fighter
Respect for all Fury family, what a fighters and personalities
My boy said Ko weer street. Lol my Gai a🕳fool. new twist on nigiri, even and odds. ⚫️bitch⚪️
This is so hard to listen to, Talk about clutching at straws.your full of B--ls--t. You need to learn the rules of boxing before you comment. The guy who wanted to kill somebody in the ring got flattened by a better boxer. End of.
# CORRUPTION # YOU SAY JOE ,,ABOUT THE Tyson count on the floor, do u mean         A.                                                 ????? FIX !!!!!?????                 LET ME HERE Y SAY IT YOU DRUNK,,,,, FIX FIX FIX FIX             COME ON CHANT IT
Big John explained that count. You are wrong.
Thomas Hearns was a huge puncher who knew how to box well. Hearns main problem was he didn't take a good punch but like Joe said, usually huge punchers aren't great technical boxers.
Hey guys, this fight was on the undercard of Joshua/Usyk at Tottenham Stadium, London, 2nd round knockdown and pretty fair to say the approx 70,000 in the stadium and tv viewers held their breath given the effect to the poor recipient Lenin Castillo. Reports say that medical attention was more or less instantaneous, oxygen was administered and he was taken hospital as a precaution.  https://youtu.be/mBiinb00_0g
Okay let's use our big boy brains. Wilder got knocked down, didn't stay down to rest or make eye contact with the ref. Got gassed in the 3rd round. Fury maintained eye contact for both knockdown and waited for the 7-8 count to get up so his legs and balance got more rest.
Not true about the count..
It was a  total of 15 seconds and the ref was only at 7 when Tyson was standing which is bullshit but Tyson is the better fighter easily the odds is not getting caught by that right hand
This rubbish about the count is ridiculous for many reasons…  Tyson stays down until about 8 seconds because good boxers are trained not to jump to their feet, so if the ref had been quicker Tyson would have got up sooner. Also I’ve watch the count and it’s a nine every time I’ve seen it on you tube I can’t find a slow count apart from maybe slowed down versions created to cause controversy
Joe give Fury the respect he deserves
Americans clutching at straws 😉
The last thing I thought when fury was dropped was this is over 😂
He got beat all 3 times get over it,  coulda, woulda, shoulda
So what about the time at the beginning of a round when fury was waiting and the doctor was looking at wilder giving him extra time? Its all swings and roundabouts now
FINALLY  someone telling the truth about the very long count but what's done is done. Good luck to both
How is joe rogan looking like Dr Evil out here 😂
Get a grip Rogan. Fury got up on 8. He would have got up on 8 no matter how quickly the ref counted. Called ring craft and experience.
He was up on 7....seemed legit to me.
Longest count
The fat is what weaken the punches
Being hurt doesn't mean being beaten! Down but not out! It's different than down without a chance!
Fury didn't make the count in the first fight, if it were done properly. But I admire Fury's resolve to get up and fight, it's inspirational.
Wilder showed heart but fury showed he is a living legend!
I think Nobody in the sport of boxing in the heavy weight division will ever match Mike Tyson's skills ever!!!! I mean Tyson fury is a masterful boxer amazing great skill but he will never match Mike Tyson.
Joe's eyes look like they're orbiting one of Jupiter's moons. Lol brilliant breakdown.
Well, gotta wear something with that tinfoil hat.
The count wasn't too slow. Fury could have gotten up earlier and the round was over. You are full of shlt joe
Fury is a very common Irish traveller (gypsy) name and his dad named him after Mike Tyson but no doubt it’s probably the most badass boxer name of all time
The count starts when the Ref starts, not when you do sitting in your chair with a beer. If you can't understand that, or the fact Wilder got beat fair and square three times. Then watch soccer instead as you Americans say. Don't forget he wore the same gloves as fury too,  with the horse hair so no more excuses guys. Your boy fought well the best I have ever seen him, it just wasn't good enough period.
Someone of your status Joe, I'd assume you knew more about the count to 10? Everything is a conspiracy though isn't it 🤣
This was like a gladiator battle from the Roman days.  Incredible
Fury’s Dad named him after Mike Tyson.  That’s what he said on Tyson’s Podcast.
Like Mike tyson and Douglas fight the ref done exactly the same thing when Douglas got knocked down  it was a long count
Corruption
“It almost didn’t matter because Tyson furry hits so hard”  Nobody corrects him*
Wilder's knocked out 38 complete bums an a 50 year old grandad twice .. ffs Joe take your tongue out deontays ass .
Wilder fought only BUMS. only fought 2 top 10 fighters in his career and just got destroyed by one (Fury)
Joe you are wrong about the count. Get your facts right. You should also count wilders knock down from start to finish in seconds.
NSAC rules state that if the other boxer moves from the neutral corner the count stops and resumes from where the referee stopped. Joe I love ur podcast but I'm a Brit and even I know this👊🏾
13:30. 41 bums and has beens.  Wilders power, though he has power, was well marketted and overrated, as Fury has shown now on three separate occasions.
Let’s see what hot take Joe has today
1.2k haters
Come on bro ,"didnt watch the fight" , these people are dull ,they have no balls!! ,Joe Rogans musk makes these people wet their pants , makes their wives fertile ,something they probably havnt felt in years ,fertile. Musk ,fertile, wives ,jellybabies ,its the Joe Rogan experience.
The  count  being    to long   hmmmm  !?!? 🤔️ ,,    it   has  happened   before  between  Gene  Tunney   and   Jack  Dempsey  on  the  long   count  .....  Things  happen     :-)
Jesus shut up Joe.   About the referee's count being 'too long' - it's one of two things it's either an error or corruption.  Actually Joe it was neither. Don't throw shade at another professional who is doing their job properly because you didn't do YOUR job properly and do even the most basic research by reading the rules before spouting a load of incorrect nonsense that millions of people will see.
Wilder had long counts too. Go watch them
The count was like this...  1...2....3...then the referee 4...5 go to your corner 6...7...8...9 you alright?
read  the  rules of  boxing  everthing  was  legit   mr  rogan
NASA suits?? Really? Cmon Joe, gotta truly wake up soon
Well, Tony, Fury was named after Mike Tyson so that isn’t so much of a coincidence.
It's not 10 second count It's count to 10.wilder should went to neutral corner.thats why ref stopped counting.
Yay, another Rogan conspiracy theory!
ufc expert.   but clueless when it comes to boxing 🙄
that's total rubbish about the count ...of course the ref has to pick it up where he left it or else the boxer could be counted out by the time keeper and not even know it
He's named after Mike Tyson...he tells him on Mike Tyson hot boxin
Why are yall deleteing my comments!! Its true, Joe dont have a clue about fighting and alsways shows his bias always…
"Look at that fat ripple...."
Joe your wrong! I expected alot more from you!! I'm done with this podcast and your gonna end up losing all your credibility!
OMG long count excuses again!!!??? Except the fuckin loss!! He got beat 3 times by the better man!! Yes THREE times as Tyson was completely robbed in the 1st fight!!
Yall know that count was to long. I know you people are not honest
There are so many faults in this episode i dont know where to begin from Joes shirt to the count…..
Long count yes but he was still up at a 9 count!!!!
NASA lies you sold out Joe, you used to expose them, some of us are old enough to remember
Me and Deontay were working the bar beer route for Greene beverage in 2005!! It's amazing how far he's gone since that  quite skinny beer guy.
why is joe and company dressed like astronauts?  shatner?
”We all taught it was over when got knock down” no Joe just No nobody taught it was over. Nobody…… !!
Both Fury's maternal and paternal grandfathers were champion bare knuckle fighters from the travelling community. He was born for this.
“If u could teach Wilder to box like Julio Cesar Chavez..” Aight Joe. Next we just have teach Giannis to shoot like Steph and we got the greatest Basketball player of all time 👍😂
Goddamnit Joe, everything you said was wrong. BUT you gave credit to Julio Cesar Chavez so...
It’s not the shockwaves rippling through his head wilders fist carried on down fury’s head & on to his chest
😀https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCArSAZhsG6UZ-5lERVJmhsw
Fury trains wilder and the boxing gods come down from heaven.
Once again Joe proves he knows NOTHING about fighting and his bias towards other fighters he looks down on.
Mr fury is a good guy see him quite often jogging down the prom & uses an old lifeboat raised level platform like a boxing ring
hinchcliffe sucks
That was a long ass 10 count.  Seemed like it was 20 seconds.
That fat is rolling down !
It’s up to the referee to make the decision on his counts if he saw Tyson was ok a ref will give the fighter every chance to get up! And thats the way it should be
Get Fury on the show and ask him directly
The sad thing is that a great boxer like Fury will forever have three asterisks by his name when it comes to Wilder and even brings in all the other controversies.  Is he one of the best fighter of all or the greatest cheater of all? Regardless of your answer the question will always be relevant.
The only controversy in the first fight was how it was a draw Tyson smashed fuck out of the brown bummer  like he did in the 2nd and 3rd
Been a long joe listener but man hes so wrong. This guy has fallen off the deep end. Sad to see it man.
'if you could teach that guy to move like Tyson Fury does'
Tyson Fury is something special.  Legend
You still raving about training wilder how to box ? He's been in the game long enough and still can't fury is what the sport says a BOXER
12:54 Wilders footwork improved so much.. and it was amazing he stood up most of that fight.... Rogan is going down a rabbit hole sying what if you could train his footwork. He is bambi on ice you cant teach co ordination like that!
Joe, you had better stick to MMA because the pro boxing rule book clearly states that the referee can indeed stop the count and then, start it up again if where he left off if the fighter who scored the knockdown doesn't go to a neutral corner (just like Wilder did). Plus, it appeared that Fury could've gotten up at any time and was just going by the count that he was given! Who wouldn't?
People need to learn the 10 count rule it’s refs discretion and it doesn’t start until the fighter is in his corner it’s not hard
People can call me crazy, but when u look slo-mo, when fury got rocked both times it looked like he definetly was hurt but like minor hurt but because he had a strategy he percautionary went down he fell down on himself both times. Then took his time got up and was fully ready to go. Furys strategy is what won him the game. If he gets wobbled and continues to strike with fury it diminshes his chances. He went down early on purpose to ensure he was at full capacity with this guy each round. Thats just my opinion.
https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
.....that moment you realise Tom Secura is actually Redban
Rogan again kinship towards Wilder... desputing retirement because he knows him.. rather then saying the dude is done.
Joe is so full of shit but that’s ok, he’s representative of the average Joe.
A lot of butthurt brits in the comments when even Joe has nothing but compliments for Fury
You can be powerful but you got knock the f out so it doesn't matter
Fury was named after Mike Tyson
fury put on a masterclass.. gave us history and this is their take.
Joe wtf are you talking about?! The second fight wasn’t even stopped, the corner threw in the towel, it doesn’t matter If he could have gone on or not…..
Joe Rogan saying he believe it was error (opposed to corruption) is a lie. He is in showbiz, playing dumb.
Remember when David Haye beat the 7 foot Russian giant giving up 7 stone in weight
As much as I like Joe he really shows the highest level of ignorance at times.   How can you explain a rule you have gotten wrong. Instead of clarifying the rule and then making a point he thinks he had it right to find an excuse for wilder. It's a 10 count not 10 SECOND count. The ref can count it in 8s or 15s it's up to the ref and the boxer reacts accordingly. This arguement is only said by those who have no clue what they are talking about.  How come it's only fury that got the 'long count' not wilder which he clearly did but that would debunk his argument.   I'm just glad the two got out alive and the best man won on the night.
greatest fight of all time, i like you joe but thats fuckin bullshit my friend! love and respect always
fedeor emilianenko was fast too
Look up long count, happens all the time.
Fuck all wrong with that count. They're supposed to determine a fighter is on their feet and fit to continue within a rough timeframe. Not ten seconds. Takes someone 6'9 4 seconds to get off there arse. And Fury's been a pro for a decade plus, he's going to use the time available to him
Boxing will never make a come back because of the corruption .    This is as close to a boxing coming back that we will ever see until there are major changes in the governing body of Boxing Refs.
Nobody can talk about the count down or anything because the fact of the matter is fury best wilder comfortably 3 fights in a row and because its a trilogy i dont think there should even be a count or ref interference on stoppages it should just be a choice and will of the fighters
Christ what a bloody awful take on the fight lol. As per from Joe when talking about boxing. The last thing we need now though is anything else to feed the idea Wilder didn't lose, Fury won this trilogy, an excellent 3 fights. Wilder is right up there too make no mistake, no matter how much people slate his technique or class of previous opponents. I can't see the likes of Joshua or Dillian Whyte beating him for example. Fury leading the pack atm, clamouring for a showdown with Oleksandr
I wish I had a  outerspace suit now
ALL HAIL THE GYPSI KING 👑
People don't realise a referee's 10 count is not an actual 10 second count.
Deontay should just make a cool 100 mil + starching the rest of the division for the next 3 years
Jamie seems like a real fun guy
Deontay Wilder had the same lung count when he went down So what is the difference And what about the doctor coming to the boxing ring given him wonder more time ??
Almost the greatest and most relevant name of all time… after usain bolt
tried to watch the whole thing - 3 covid rants - think its time to give up on Joe
If Deontay had the Boxing Skil, he wouldn't have the same Power in my Opinion. He reminds me of Tyrone Woodley, just waiting to throw the Big Punch and forgetting to do any of the set up work.
Check out his long count when wilder was getting floored... Was no different
Tony might be thinking about Japanese pro wrestling. They generally have the ringside announcer repeat the ref's count for a countout or double knockdown over the PA.
Tyson defeated wilder fair and square.. Joe talking jackshit
Furys team had the ref changed right before the fight ijs🤣😂🤣😂
Fucking hell Joe, how could you be this wrong about the 10 count rule?
Wilder hasnt knocked out top tier boxers, its all hand picked shit. Guy cant box for toffee. Any boxing enthusiast will tell you that. Also with the counts, stay in your corner and the ref wont start the count again.
Joe Rogan is 1000% correct. Fury was given a long count. He lost. Respect to Joe for keeping it real.
Enjoying the video till the last 8 minutes when yous start talking about counting, ridiculous
His family isn't just into fighting. His great granduncle on his mother's side, Bart Gorman, was king of the gypsies. Gorman inherited the crown from Uriah Burton, who was also related to Tyson on his father's side.   'The Gypsy King' is not just a nickname and 'Tyson Fury' is not a fluke - he was born to fight.
He was a slow counting ref was the same when wilder went down dummys
How are you going to be aware of the count if it's an LCD screen. Also fighters watch the ref for the count and get up on 8.
You americans cannot handle the fact an englishman came over and smashed up your boy. Cormier already tryna make excuses for deontay when he's simply not on Fury's level.
Why y’all dressed up as gay space men
Fury was 40% in that fight.  Fury humiliated wilder in that second fight. Not even close.  I really hope there’s not a 4th fight.  Joe rogan your stirring shit here,  probably trying to get a 4th fight. This trilogy is over I hope
First off, I’m a Fury fan and I don’t believe the ten count was rigged, besides, you can see in his eyes, that he was conscious and not dazed or confused. That being said, Russell Mora is the worst referee to have in a fight of this magnitude, I remember his handling of the Mares vs Agbeko fight(where he allowed Mares to foul Agbeko repeatedly and not deduct a point) and the Donaire vs Montiel( where Montiel looked like a newborn baby stretching his arms out while napping on the canvas, with his eyes looking like 👀, and still continued the fight) fight, he’s the Joe West of Boxing. I don’t know why he still referee’s big fights.
That an americans excuse for losing? The count! Lol
40+ years old & I never  knew someone ringside was counting with the ref. I thought the ref always controlled the fight. A.k.a. Rigged.
Long counts now. Fuck people give Tyson fury the credit.  That referee has been caught up in corrupt shit tho 🤔
That count was dodgy… Even I spotted it.
Wtf Tyson was always there when he was knocked down, just look at his eyes 🤷🏽‍♂️
Joe the real life Toe
Funny pants smith 😂😂😂😂😂😂
People still watch rogan josh 🙄
Why does joe talk boxing with this weasel,   he has no clue,       yesman
Jesus christ here we go with more excuses. TYSON FURY IS THE BETTER BOXER. You yanks need to get over it. He wins everytime like he's already proved 3 times already.
I think Tyson looks so awkward sometimes like he isnt a great boxer. But he is. And the reason I say he is a great boxer because he can change his style of fighting based on the opponent he faces. Look at how he bossed klitschko in the ring and then how he did the same to Wilder but in a total different way (Klitschko he moved around so much so he couldnt get hit and with Wilder, he moved forward and still made his opponent miss). Great skill to do that. Tyson deserves the belt.
he stoped counting at 5 sec
2:13 I was in AWE of the shockwave and leap up saying dayammmm
The count didn’t really matter as he was still up within 10 no matter what way you look at it. You can watch it back and count from the second he went down. So whatever the referee did was irrelevant
hello :)
If the count was quicker fury would of got up quicker. So it's a none issue. Fury gave himself the maximum time to recover.
Not sure JR is entirely correct here. I watched a jeff Mayweather video and he said that the ref was well within his rights to stop the count to tell wilder to get back to a neutral corner,  it's down to wilders own fault why he got a few extra seconds.
Sorry Joe, this was a great fight for today's standards but we have been seeing almost 20 years of sub par heavyweight boxing, so this seems like a great fight. I can give you 10 names that out skill and out power both Fury and Wilder. Ray Mercer, Bowe, Holyfield, Foreman, Tua, Prime Tyson, Lennox Lewis, etc. Power and skill was way superior. Watch Fury vs Wallin, tell me that represents great boxing, 2002 when lewis retired was the end of great heavy weight boxing, we had to go through 10 years of Vlad jab and grab.
Why they in space suits? What the dog doin??
Fury getting knocked down never had me worried but the fact that Drake was supporting was more worrying than anything else.
When you have a podcast at 2 and a moon landing at 6
and the count excuses begin.
Joes never mentioned Tyson fury before the first wilder fight you Americans never supported Tyson your all late to the party. Glory supporters
Waffle
The ref counted the same pace on each knock down, if you say fury benefited from a long count then what about the count wilder got? It was just as long, infact longer he got over 20 seconds before the ref stopped messing about, so it works both ways, when you watch fury he's getting up for 8 as is the correct thing to do, enough with people talking shit about fury, he won all 3 fight, imo, give the man his respect.
Shut up tison  Won
The 10 count is to see if they are fine to fight, not count tjem out
In the first knock down, eleven seconds has passed when the referee gets to eight. So, did Wilder bribe the judges too? In fact, looking at knock downs overall you wont find one where the referee is faster or in time. How do you not know that? Stop making up excuses for Wilder. Fury has beaten Wilder fair and square on his home turf, mind you, twice, possibly three times, Let go.
Tyson fans gonna be mad Rogan stop tellin them the truth they racists
The reason Fury calls Wilder a dosser is because he made the Fury fight when Fury was out of condition hoping to score an easy knock-out.  A dosser is someone who is lazy and avoids work.  It's standard in boxing to avoid boxers who might beat you, but Wilder has made his career by fighting lower level opposition and the first time he stepped up to the elite level he got beat.  He is a true warrior and he has no quit.  Again Wilder is such a sore loser.  Always congratulate the other fighter and say well done, even if they were lucky.  Don't make excuses.  The rules of boxing say nothing about 10 seconds and you are out, they say a 10 count.  The referee determines how fast he counts and it's at his discretion, he is the final arbiter.  Fury was never unconscious in TW3 when he was knocked down.  He was a true professional and waited for the count to move towards 8 before getting up.  Never get up from a knock down too quickly, give yourself as long as possible to recover.
There is usually a fanboy on any boxing video that chimes in with   "In his Prime, Mike Tyson would DESTROY both of them"  Where are you?
This fight was a favorite like Diego Corrales v Jose Luis Castillo, Gotti v Ward, and then SugarRay, Marvelous Marvin, Tommy Hitmen, and Robert Duran era.  Hopefully all those current day small guys start fighting each other instead of ducking great fights for trash fights and small paydays
Joes out here looking like doctor evil
Great fight, but both these fighters are bums compared to the legends
I loled at "difference is out of this world" bc of the nasa stuff
If the two knock downs on Fury didn't put him down, nothing would
Hollow argument, Fury is a genius
Rugby league use a count and it works so well when a whole stadium is giving you a countdown
His dad loved mike Tyson so he was named after him , Tyson says this on the mike  Tyson podcast
It’s ironic that Joe and his guests (who are these people?) are dressed like space cadets…….cause none of these clowns, including Joe, know shit about boxing
I'd hate to be the ringside physician for that fight and be forced to stop it. You wouldn't be able to walk out of the arena without getting pelted with projectiles and drunkards yelling death threats.
Maybe count was loong, but counting when wilder was knock down was just as loong as tyson, if dont belive look før your self
It's a flat earth
Wilder out on his feet multiple times.. end of round 6 that was a clear knock down for FUry. Anyone making excuses for Wilder is a fucking weirdo.. its actually cringe AF from Rogan
I seldom see Joe Rogan discuss MMA with the same level of enthusiasm as he does big boxing matches. He loves the sport of boxing deep down despite shitting on it so much throughout the years. Seems like it only takes 1 big boxing match to make him go back into fanboy mode! LOL
Why are we talking like Fury was given 10 minutes rest during the count? Don't tarnish this great fight please. This was a classic and the better man won.
Joe ,you've watched enough fights to know that a good fighter doesn't rush to get up ,Fury was watching the count and rose for the 8 ,as he was clearly waiting on the count it makes no difference if the count was long by a second or two.
It's always about how hard Wilder punches. No one talks about the fact that Fury has not only taken this punch, but taken it multiple times and hasn't gone to sleep. The man has maybe one of the best chins ever
Wilder broke his hand early and was gassed way too early...perhaps overtrained but he did not have any cardio after 2 rounds. Fury the better boxer period.
A quiet but necessary shoutout to whoever made his studio NOT a sensory deprivation tank
Joe knows a lot about nothing
Joe is actually not that smart
Long count debunked. https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
I just got done listening to the Alex Berenson episode and I cannot believe Joe doesn't have ONE CLIP from that show up here on yourtube. Joe didn't think there was anything from that episode that people needed to know????? As a side note Joe, at about 2:49:00 of that episode you talk about the police state in austrailia and say it's because the people aren't armed....and while that might be some small part of it the main reason countries fall into tyrannical police states is because the citizens of these countries think they can bestow rights onto government and law enforcement that they themselves don't possess.....the right to use violence against peaceful people!!!! You are too scared to have Larken Rose on your show because you KNOW he will shattered your belief in the state. Everyone else: YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO BESTOW RIGHTS TO YOUR GOVERNMENT THAT YOU YOURSELF DON'T POSSESS.  Governments and law enforcement should only be allowed to use violence for the same moral reason anyone else can: FOR SELF DEFENSE ONLY.  And P.S. >>>>>> Laws are just opinions that you can't convince others to comply with voluntarily.....so you have to FORCE them.
Funny pants smith 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Um Joe was right about the fight it was amazing but I hate when he talks boxing because he tries to compare mma to it all the time. Like saying McGregor is the next Sugar Ray Leonard of mma was dumb.
It is the referee's count, not a 10-second count. The referee can stop the count whenever they want.
The "long count" was NOT any kind of "conspiracy"--- and THAT is not the problem in boxing... Boxing's biggest problem is the questionable decisions after the fight is over- Boxing needs a scoreboard that is posted /updated every round... Until they do that, fixed fights will continue to occur.... the best man WON. PERIOD.
Jeesus , you think someone like joe would know about the the counting rules of boxing yet he wants to discuss this “conspiracy”
Can we please get a compilation of everytime Joe has called someone "the greatest of all time"
Ironically Rogan forgets Mike Tyson: skilled boxer AND historic puncher.
Wtf is joe wearing?😂
Rogan wanted Wilder to win so bad it's obvious 😂😂
You can easily tell Rogan wanted Wilder to win... BUT any self respecting person american or otherwise wouldve supported Fury!
Look at the ranks of the guys on wilders records, loads of unranked and outside top 50, his record isn't great, padded like a pillow
No Rogan , we like to keep tradition with the referee counting in our sport thanks 😂🥊
Fury was listening to the count , soon as the ref said 6 or 7 he would’ve gotten up
Rematch Joe? Really? Fury won al 3 fights noone want to see a 4 fight
Tin foil jacket?
That Fight was both "Wild and Furious"!!
"Sore loser! An idiot!" Fury said about Wilder in brief post fight interview. Well said, goes same to mr.joe with his "error counting"
Joe rogan must have missed that Fury was not wobbled when he got up even tho he got dropped. And plz talk about the score cards instead and how wilder could get a draw when he won 2 rounds!
I guess Fury was wilder than Deontay
You go by the ref.. Not the ringside.. Come On Joe this is basic stuff.
Isn’t being hit ‘behind the ear’ the same as being hit in the back of the head? What am I watching here? I thought rogan was an expert in fighting? The fact is wilder hasn’t got an ounce of skill that fury has. You can wish he did until the cows came home! Such a stupid discussion to have
Rogan literally doesn’t know boxing rules but then on his podcast makes a completely wrong assessment of the Clint. Smdh. Just stick to talking about the fight.
5:20 lmao joe just calls out the guy for speaking shit. straight up on his face. 😭
7:09 Joe the mistake is on you pal. Not the ref. This idea has been debunked . Check the rules. Basically wilder was so out of it he didn't know where he was and started wondering around the ring. This gave fury time 😂
Gosh he cannot shutup...too much hooch
Is not a 10 second count is a 10 count y’all need to educate yourself on boxing , seriously.
Regardless of whatever happened. The score cards show that Fury won without question. Wilder got owned in that fight.
Joe Rogan hmmm i agree
Q: Any verbal or physical strategy to convince, control, or compel others to your point of view. A: What is Violence? Q: Who are often victims of Violence in their childhood/earlier relationships? A: What is perpetrators of Violence? Q: Are sociopaths organized or able to maintain normal relationships? A: No.  Sweet Anita
Fury showed that if Wilder hits you, you aren't necessarily fucked. Fury is a monster of a man. You are literally fighting a giant! How is that fair? lol Should be a separate division for giants
& now comes the hate train on Joe for his opinion 😂
Europe does that
If you count it yourself he is off by the slightest but tyson was still fully with it and going of the reffs count as he should it's not tyson fault I believe if the ref counted twice as quick he would of got up he was going of the ref end of the day
Tyson fury the goat 🐐 🇬🇧 🇬🇧  ‘You’ve fought men but have ye ever fought a KING’
Learn the rules Joe, the ref has to continue counting from where he stopped. Wilder ruined his own chances because he didn’t stay in a neutral corner.. that’s the rule. Learn the rules before you speak
Tyson fury should’ve had points taken for all the hugging from round 1 and 2,3,4,  etc.   Then wilder would’ve had a real chance I felt bad for him having to carry around all that cholesterol
People repeat what they hear from the commentator including clearly even rogan here. US coverage was a joke on so many levels. Lennox Lewis was the voice of reason against a cancerous and uninformative commentarty
Joe Rogan rly loves Wilder, If i just listen to Joe i wold say that luck and refs helped Tyson but that didnt hapen.
If you look at Fury's face as the ref was counting. He was fine and waiting to get up when the ref got to 6
FUCK ME! SLOW COUNT! Fury didnt even get dropped the second time but what about the wilder counts. Ignorant morons repeating what commentators say. US commentators are garbage
Jack Reiss was the ref in the first fight who epically allowed the fight to continue. UNDERRATED
the ref explained it here https://youtu.be/W6KykMMXqgw
Are you seriously wearing that shit???  2.24... and I´m out as a spectator
When two people compete its the one without doubt that wins and Tyson has no doubts but Wilder does.
5:20 'your talking shit.. no one knew jack shit.. when he got dropped we all thought it was over' *Speaking about the same Fury who got up from a walk off in the first fight to win that same round. Rogan speaks enough about Furys class but doesnt speak enought about his sheer granite dna, grit and determination.
LCD screen counting down from 10 seconds? Wilder would have been out in round 3 then.
'4:35 joe is super high... he overlaps his words.. and means to say 'Wilder hits so hard it almost didnt matter'
What the fuck are you stoned
its not 10 sec count its a 10 count
Fury got a long count. Everything Rogan said was unbaised atleast he gave Fury credit. He's not just some blind in love fan. I'm a hardcore Fury fan yet I can honor this men's point of view.
I would bet most people here started watching ufc off the back of Joe Rogan... yet Dana White doesnt fully embrace him... Rogan has clearly been given permission to show this.
No Joe, you have it wrong about the count, its a 10 count, not a 10 second count. And Wilder didn't go to the neutral corner, ref had to tell him where to go, that's inexperience from Wilder.
Rogan clearly has permission to show this. Its amazing Sana White hasnt used Rogan more as a mouthpiece not only for promo but for the expert ideas he has put forward.. such as judging (if there were more judges it would force boxing to do the same and that would look unreal for UFC)
Wilder fans desperate for fight to end. Fury wins the fight 10 times in a row
crazy how uneducated Joe is on the rules of a 10 count!   ah well..
Tony Hinchcliffe talking about fighting is like a vegan talking about bow hunting with rogan. And this isnt the first time Tony has done this.. he posed up at a UFC event with joanna jedrzejczyk in th past. He tries so hard to act straight but he is so effeminite it could convert people to being gay just looking at him.
Is deontay called the ‘bronze bomber’ because he won bronze at the Olympics?
Don’t know why people are talking about this as if it was some kind of classic fight, the result was never really in doubt.
If joe thought Tyson was done after the first knock down, he clearly haven’t seen the first 2 bouts between them. Talkin out his asss😂😂😂
habitual fence sitter.. not many americans gave credit. My friend is from Alabama yet he was converted to being a Fury fan... and that is something more than just the spectavle of the fight itself.
The count is not a time count, it's just a count ... two different things.
"The slow count.." is a nonsense argument. Fury was chilling on the ground looking the ref straight in the eyes and he was getting up according to the ref counting. Cormier is a chump for even making that excuse.
LAST 🤬💩
The rules of boxing state that it's the 'referees 10 count' - it's not a '10 second count' and the boxer who's down listens to the referee's count and gets up in time (if he can obviously).
Interview with so scary I thought he was going to reach across the table and throttle me
No that’s wrong check the rules of the count
Its the fighters fault not the ref
"one of the greatest boxing matches of all time" ... That's a stretch in fact it's nonsense , it was a good fight but let's not get carried away
Boxing is entertainment and the ref is part of that. If he feels the fighter is able to get up and continue, he'll give him every chance, especially if he's the champion. You can see conspiracies if you like but at the end of the day the best fighter won, and everybody got entertained even more because the ref used his judgement. After 3 fights I think any question of who's the better fighter have been answered. Wilder fans should move on...
Fury was up within 10 seconds on both knockdowns regardless of what the ref was doing.
disagree with joe, deontay wilder got robbed. he was going to get up
Fury down on the mat looked lucid, clear-eyed.
An All Time Heavyweight Classic Fight! It was the Heavyweight Version of Hagger/Hearns! Fury is a Top British Boxing Great. He's proven he's the Greatest Heavyweight since Lennox Lewis!!! End Of!
Wilder has the heart of a lion 🦁……the legs of a flamingo 🦩 and the footwork of a penguin 🐧
They were both so sloppy. Tyson coming in 40 pounds heavier and just resting on the dude all night was ridiculous. Usyk and Joshua put up a great fight with incredible boxing skill being showed. Wilder vs Fury was one of the sloppiest prime time fights I’ve ever seen in boxing. Imagine having the gaul to compare those two to the likes of Ali or even Tyson in his prime. The gap in skill is very clear. Wilder had one move and Fury still took forever to get him out of there.
No corruption the better fighter won Three times
Yo at the end of the day the ref has the first and final call. Fury would have got up at 8 no matter what. Mental game.
the referee was perfect. it would've been absolute shame if he stopped the fight earlier or if he counted faster,  that's in the boxing rules, the ref can set the speed of the counter so the fight holds on and it keeps entertaining people i think.
The referee can restart the count if the fighter is not in a neutral corner Joe you dummy!
Mexicans giving the world fights of the year every week.  An American does it once every quarter and it's front page of every major sports network.
Tyson Fury is theeee theee theee of all thee
Only thing I can say about wilder is his power punch but when a man like tyson takes a fucking truck to their face 4 times. Went down 4 times in 2 matchs by the best power puncher of my generational time to this day. Tyson got back up like he was woke up, no wobbly feet and still like he's from the matrix.  Wilder is a bum only got a punch, tyson came to a boxing match to box and wilder was checking out his punching power on a machine.
https://youtu.be/OSxLVPa1u-k
It was a good fight but I don't know why everyone keeps saying it's an time classic it wasn't
Lets not forget that fury cheated wilder would've won if Tyson didn't cheat
these guests bring nothing to the discussion
What are these guys going to spac
you can tel Joe believes there was corruption that went on
Joe is wrong on the rules. But if Joe didn't talk out of his ass, he wouldn't have anything to say on his podcast.
Thing is with that count. Tyson wasn’t even remotely out. He was sat catching his breath for as long as he could. So he was gonna get up before 10.
Joe I've never took to you or your show. I always thought you was byes.  But you told the truth thanks.
Dudes reading stat sheets?
It’s not 10 seconds rules say it’s a count to 10. Still should be universal with the speed.
As a casual fan of boxing and not a gambler, I kinda like that it might be a little fixed.
"Fury is just rag dolling him right now" Fury is the ultimate boxer
You going to get alot of hate for this joe 😂
Joe chats bare shit these days....to much dmt has fried the brain cells he had left haha
What a fight but it's not a 10 second count, it's a 10 count.
All of the standing counts were long... Wilder also benefited from a long count.
It’s called a ‘ten count’. That doesn’t mean it takes ten seconds. Opponent has to return to their corner before the count begins.
Joe should talk the Ariel Helwani vs Brendan Schaub beef . Since he’s been quoted how many times now.
Please bring back the podcast to YouTube 🥺
Tony the worst guest ever.  Such a dork
If Fury was American, nobody would be talking about counts. He'd have also got the correct decision in the first fight.
Joes got the count rule wrong, if interrupted they pick up where they left off, law 4.4.  Also this video has tremendous amount of what aboutery dick riding Wilder after he’s been smashed about for 11 rounds 😂 yeah he knocked Fury with hit and hope shots and because of his power he dropped him but he’s was pummelled and I doubt he’ll recover.
Wilder made it easy  for fury   right in front of him no defence  but usyk beats fury as has so many gears
WoW. A new fan of joe rogan!
Wrong about the count Joe. Fury would have got up quicker if the count was quicker.
The count on all 5 knock downs was consistent. It’s not jst about the count, get schooled on how ref’s implement the enire process before making statements you dont fully understand. Great show, peace
Why cant americans accept losing.. every fight there talking shit about how someone got ripped off ffs there shouldnt be a count you only need some eyes to tell if a blokes fucked or not mma leave its to ref boxing should do same
Deontay wilder hit Fury with an illegal blow on the top of the head for his knockdown but you dont hear fury whining about it do you joe..
Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted
This fight was so like a sequel to Rocky III where Rocky and Clubber Lang met again. Think about it, Wilder who is all about the knock out punch, the rage..the power. Fury, who changed coaches for fight 2 like Rocky trains with Apollo Creed, surprises Wilder with his speed, movement and unmovable spirit. The way Wilder is staring down like "dead meat" and Fury just staring his  back like "go for it mofo".   The knock downs, the getting up. How wilder reacts after the fight, unable to handle the defeat, Fury still going over like Rocky would, being a better man..think about it. We just witnessed Clubber Lang Vs Rocky 3 baby.
i never for one second thought fury was gunna lose.
https://youtu.be/QsMWqgZGkpQ  Count was definitely sketchy...For example of proper officiating Look at how the ref counted for Triple G fight in the video I linked at the 2 min mark... He resumed the appropriate count with time keeper after directing fighter to corner and without the extensive pauses in the count...
So now we know Joe sold his soul wearing that BS
Lol, why am I not surprised Joe was more focused on body fat rolling during a punch than anything else. "Look at that fat roll!"
After the fury vs Wilder trilogy I now know that my friends know nothing about boxing 🥊 and are oblivious to the importance of technique and endurance when combined
Julian Jackson was Deontae with footwork
Tony? The Tony? Tony who brings his own bodybag to his fight to scare death himself? That Tony?
Klitschko has more knockouts than wilder
Wilder should have won in the 4th, but the fight went on and the best boxer won
The only reaction video I've been waiting for.  Yeahhhhhhh!!
Yeah but to be fair.. if there was gonna be any corruption it would have been in wilders favour.. US fighter in a US fight with a US ref.. 3 fights enough said
Fury got up from The Goddang DEAD in the first fight! He proved he's KO Proof back then- what's the surprise?!?
This is the equivalent of listening into 3 guys at the watercooler who know nothing about boxing talking about the "big fight" on the weekend. Utterly clueless amateur hour hot takes
Why don’t they use Hawkeye like in tennis. Timer starts when hit canvas no human error
Great fight break down. 1 of the fairest explanations I've seen so far. For wilder to win bronze in Olympics he obviously had skills. But un-practiced skills get lost. With so many knockouts he lost those skills. He needs tune up fights to hone those skills to not rely on power. Because fury is longer sticking his hands out straight  forward did not keep fury away. Wilder needs real defensive training
Ight fuck it. I’m giving in and finally downloading Spotify to my Xbox 😅
Tyson fury ate those crazy punch from wilder and really joe you didn't mention how fury took those shot and survived. Instead you only mentioned how crazy wilder hits, sounds partial to me.🙄
who is it in the orange suit n does he always talk through his nose
i think this was the greatest rant of all time
Ive literally been waiting a week for this.
Wasnt there a moment at the start of a round when Deontay was exhausted that the Ref had the doctor check him? Giving him like 10 or more seconds to recover?
Let’s be honest wilder will never be the same after that beating, his couch should of thrown the towel in plain and simple
Joe,  with all the respect; say whatever you want, judge it hower you want, Fury won.   He's the boxer. He's the winner. He's the best of the best.
The ref counting thing has happened at so many high profile boxing championships.
That Jamie seems like a right boring dosser
Magnes Ver Magnesson is the greatest name of all time.
It's brilliant how many comments on here are actually owning you , Joe. Getting schooled by your fan base.
Have y’all watched boxing in recent years? Worst knockout…I’ve seen worse kos this year
I think Joe wanted Wilder to win, surprised he does not know the rules......Sorry Joseph i know ur a power junkie and Deontay's punch power has you all erect but there is no denying the Gypsy king's mastery of the sweet science.  Of course he could have got up when he wanted after those knockdowns, he played it smart again and utilised every second, he's totally lucid and looking up at the ref waiting for the moment to rise, smart asf.
Sometimes when Joe breaks down fights he kind of ruins it …
The count is down to the ref. It's a 10 count not a 10 second count.its 2 different things
awful annoying guests
The count for Deontay Wilders first knockdown took 12 seconds to reach the 8 count as well. That whole talking point is a nonsense.
I like how Rogan still supports Wilder..all these people hating on him liked their sports team in high school getting the Sportsmanship banner more than the championship banner. I don’t care about handshake, words or w.e I watch what I see in the ring. Assholes win sometimes, take your tampon out
You aren't very clever Joe.
https://youtu.be/NvjxKVcRKXc
Fury boxed his whole life Wilder started at 20 !! Respect to both men !!
if Joe Rogan says you know jackshxt about fighting, then you know jackshxt
The other 🐐
Dave Chapelle of convo!
Until the judges scores are posted every round, boxing is B.S. like MMA..The only sports you don't know where you are in the competition.
Talking like the fact he’s named Tyson was a fluke 🤦🏼‍♂️ Tyson and his father have both said numerous times and even on this very show that he is named after Mike
Lol Joe you full of shit on this one. You just trying to take away from Fury coz wilder is American. You talking about wilder's punches being sooooo bad. What about the the punch that put wilder down?
You can argue that the ref gave wilder extra time by calling in the doctor before the bell rang
Rest in peace joe
How about the time the doctor gave Wilder a extra 30 seconds to recover by checking on him at the start of the round rather than in between rounds? No mention of that whatsoever
The count was good, stop bitching about it just because a US boxer got his ass kicked, we all know you americans cant fight at all🤣
Joe is wrong about the count.
Wilder still has terrible defense
Tyson is just a better athlete. He moves better, has a better jab and thinks throughout the fight. What is Deonsay Whiner's excuse going to be after this beat down?  WHINER is not in Tyson's league. All Whiner has is a right hand. Tyson would beat Whiner 365 days a year. Now live with that the rest of your life Whiner.
It's not a 10 second count its a ten count
Joe Rogan is a clown, he will literally always say what fits just to please people.
Fuck me, Fury beat Wilder in all three fights smashing him in the last 2 and still people are making excuses for him and running down Fury.
Wilder got long also in round 10 when ref started talking to him after the count
Fury knocked him the fuck out no need to count pillow fists hahahah 3times loser wilder
What are you wearing joe 😂
Wow good on Tony for not making a sound for like 4 minutes while joe talked. How strange
I think the rules of Vegas, and other places, say that the count depends on the count of the ref, not in seconds, but as the ref counts, reasonably.
Joe I like you and have respect for you but bud I think you need to educate yourself on the 10 count. Cause it’s not 10 second it’s 10 count.
Don't want to watch Joe's clips on YouTube anymore after his anti vaccine stance. He has lost me as a viewer and will delete him f th o my playlist after this comment.  Goodbye Joe....
Joe Rogan is the truth.
The fight was as expected.  Arrogance vs. Skillful rage. As for Rage. JRE. I am begging you. Address the RAPE in LOUDON. Have the FATHER on your Show.
Long count lol wielder fans making up excuse after excuse u got beat by the better man geeza sleeping in the 11th 😴
KRONK !!!
White fighters get longer counts…. Do the research
What the fook is he wearing
DEONTAY KING OFF EXCUSES WILDER
No controversy at all. Wilder didn't go to the neutral corner so the count stops then resumes when he's in the corner. Plus it's the refs 10 count not a 10 second count
Did that count Klitschko v AJ ...but US is US and knows better ...right 🧐
you are 100% wrong , the ref did it right read the rules as i did , the ref only ptcks up the count the first time he goes down , when wilder left the neutral counter the ref has to stop the count do tell wilder to go back , the count only begins again after his instructions are done by the standing fighter
If only one could teach a kangaroo how to box, it'll be the greatest fighter of all time.
The count argument is total bullshit. It's at the referee's discretion and always has been. When have you ever seen a referee count like Joe did (and the fans did for Giannis' free throws in the playoffs)? Answer: Literally never.
That highly questionable referee came along at the last minute, and replaced a referee who was just fine, and that referee took '15 seconds to get to 8' when Fury was down for the count  -  "HHHHHMMMMM" 🤔
It was a good fight. A good trilogy    But all this “one of the greatest of all time” is utter nonsense.
I want that aluminum foil jacket
Is it just me or are the people around joe not as motivated as he is? I want to like them….trust me. But there was no mutual interest at the beginning
The old saying that “hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard” is the realest quote for this fight
Wilder the rightful winner
Imagine wilder hires fury to train him with kronk
Bruh you don't know anything about boxing. All the connections in life you have yet not one connection broke down the 10 count in boxing to you lol
Fury took every punch Wilder gave him. Wilder got knocked out cold by Fury….so who has the harder punch.
I've not heard anyone discuss if a it's time to divide up the weight class from 200  to 300 pounds. Is it fair to have a 380 pound guy fight a 240 pound guy?
The count - Tyson was looking at the ref waiting it out as long as possible before he gets up. He would have just got up earlier if the count was quicker.
joe needs a spaceX suit
Learn the rules of the count Joe...
The referee stated to both boxers an camps prefight he'd give them both every opportunity to continue if they prove able so no one feels short changed after what happened in the prior two matches.    *And by all account he damn well did.*
Fury would have made the count regardless. He was lucid and looking at referee counting. If the ref cocked up then Fury took advantage of it. Wilder was fucking stupid for not returning to his corner
Why’s Joe in tinfoil?
Tony Hinchcliffe looks dehydrated since 1982
redban listens to so much jre he forgot he was actually on the show..
funny thought fury knocked wilder down hard in round 3 but hey ho... and at start of round 4 i think after wilder gets up of his stool.the doc comes in to check wilder over WTF... giving wilder more recovery time
If he was that hurt Wilder would have finished him. It was on of the best ref fights in the last 10 years
Deontay Wilder is the Happy Gilmore of boxing. He’s a freak with a big right hand.
Tyson played the whole count thing, even if the ref was 5 secs ahead he would have got up on 8, the whole thing was a show
Take the 40Ib weight advantage and fury would get knocked out by most heavyweights, it's his weight that he uses to lean and necklock that wears the other fighter down..without that he's lost half his game.. People want to use the rule book to defend fury beating a count, well then use the rule book for furys dirty tactics, he shouldv been disqualified in all three fights...the guy is a dirty fighter and good riddance when he retires!.
The count for wilder was also a lil slow tho?
Wilder is the epitome of America, massive fire power but has zero back bone and a glass jaw. Fury is typical of the old world, not pretty to look at but solid as a rock and heart bigger than the moon, and the mind of the ancients
Bring some more interresting guests
Wow there is ALOT of nonsense in this 😂
trying to find excuses for wilder? biased talk again.
Joe looks like DR EVIL 😂
Seriously?... 10 counts isn't  10 seconds it's up to the ref his count
It was a awesome fight, haven’t seen that good of a fight in years.
Why is it a 10 count? Why not 15?
I don't think Wilder's power is even close to George Foreman's or Mike Tyson's. He only throws haymakers so he saves a lot of energy and still doesn't punch like Mike or George in their primes.
slow count is not really a very good argument. Fury may have very well gotten up sooner had he heard the proper count. Either way, i dont think 2 seconds is going to make much difference based on the way fury regained and continued the fight.
Americans really can’t take wilder losing….. he’s lost 3 times now n still finding excuses.
Not a big wilder fan but I think his awkwardness is his second best weapon
Joe, fighting is lame Wish you had chose a better sport
Fuck the counting. Just the lethwei style even if u are knock out u can just revive and the fight continues.
The ref was getting Wilder back to his corner when he paused the count, & Wilder admitted he didn’t know where he was at the time because his head was still messed up from being dropped n the 3rd. Fury was also getting up at the 5 count right before the ref paused to get Wilder situated.
I'm sorry but George foreman had 68 knockouts in his career. Wilder would've been killed by Foreman in the first round and so would've fury in my opinion. So saying Wilder with his kos is the most ever please check history.
bottom line fury fucked him up
The fat rolling......was not from the head......it was the glove after hitting head, hit his peck.......come on joe......
Look joe buck
Everyone talking about the fight but no one wants too talk about Joe Rogans Dog having an Instagram..
Joes arse licking wilder, I don’t know if it’s because he’s American or not but wilder hasn’t fought any top 10 fighter throughout his whole career he’s a stat booster who fights nobody’s he only took the fight against fury because he thought he would roll over him because he’d been out for 2 years, also openly admitted that he ducked Anthony Joshua
There should just be a clock... posted above that everyone can see... basically I agree with Joe... why haven't they changed it to where there is a clock counting? 🤔
The only person to take a worse beating in the past week was Sanjay Gupta.
You sure were imterestested on ikms
It’s as if these guys have never heard of a guy named Usain BOLT, literally the fastest man in the history of the world lol
Joe just can’t give the better man his respect, ridiculous. What if deontay started boxing as a kid, what if deontay got up early, what if Tyson fury didn’t get up. Ffs.
Dressed in tinfoil lol conspiracy theorists hahaha
Like Chavez I’m thinkin Ali
Legalize weed in Queensland.
Here we go again tony with the Asians  🤣
I was waiting on a comment on the fat ripple wave
There was no slow count. Tyson Fury is the real champ.
Joe go check Dempsey vtunny so called long count if Dempsey would not go anywhere so the ref stopped  counting  the ref has more autonomy  then people know it's shown  when a guy gets up at 9 then the ref starts telling him to do this that and the other 5,6,7 secs go buy not today complaints then
Tyson fury cheated hell yes he cheated ...how he punch way too many landed 150-72 he too punch too hard he too punch too quick as i see it American fighter didnt anticipate this there prefer slow just like their president biden ..let's go brandon   hahahahaha American are losing everything this day  Tyson fury should have give wilder a break ( only fighter got a rematch after rematch after losing all 3 fight ) and they call this a trilogy
If ya wanna rant on about something like a long count at least take the time to know the ruling and even do ya own count.
celebrating Beltane early guys.
I’m sorry, but I can’t value Joes opinion when it comes to being neutral about fighters. He has a way of latching on to fighters and thinking they can’t be beat. Chuck Liddell, Anderson Silva, Conor McGregor, Broc Lesner, Ronda Rousey, and Cris Cyborg all come to mind. He thought all of them would retire undefeated, and talked shit about who beat them. How lucky they got.
Probably one of the best fights for Fury 😂 Wilder looked outclassed.
Wilder is not a boxer. He is a guy who can punch really hard. Big difference
It’s just as crazy as Usain bolt is called usain bolt, what are the chances
Fury won.  That is all that needs to be said.
Mayweather offered to help Wilder. I bet Wilder would've been beast, if he accepted 🤷
Wilder's main issue is conditioning. If he had a real trainer trainer like Manuel Stewart Freddy Roach it would be a wrap.
Wilder fans punching the air playing detective 🕵
Love your videos
How about a prosperity preacher named creflo Dollar
Was expecting Joe to give Fury a little more credit here, all I heard was a lot of waffle about a long count and worshipping of Wilders punch power.
Joe defamed Chiropractic. Harvard backs it. The government recognizes it as well. Most all professional athletes utilize it. Even Joe. I’m not going to go to my husband (an attorney) for Chiropractic treatment. People should not come to me for legal counseling. Stay in your lane.  Your approach is reckless just so you can “Right fight.” Dr P
According to World Boxing Federation: When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers.
Literally no one in the boxing fraternity is talking about the count, but hey, Daniel Cormier is. Non issue you’re trying to create Joe.
His dad named him after Mike Tyson, which cuts into the odds somewhat. Glad to see Tony back on
Funny pants smith!!! That tickled me hahahahhaha
"Nominative determinism is the hypothesis that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names."
Our Northern men in England are strongest men in the world
Fuck a huge fight ref was in a ring with two 6’7+ monsters
I only disliked it because Joe agreed with DC that it was a slow count. DUMB!
I got a neighbor complaint over the noise coming from my apartment during the fury Vs wilder 3 fight.
Joe "look at that fat ripple" Rogan.
Fury is watching the count…  He’s going to get up just in time every time because he’s buying time.
ha yankie boyz cant handle Wilder got knocked down and beat by a UK master!
Did I mix something? What’s up with the space suits!
Wtf is he wearing?
Wilder is 2 fury is 1 and who knows who’s 3. But wilder and fury are so far ahead
Most good fighters, if knocked down, seem to take the most time they can to recover. He did do that when he "resurrected" himself in the 1st fight. If the count was faster he would have gotten up faster.
Love to be with a group of people while watching the fights!❤
Masterful tho? No hate but relax
Why is joe rogan wearing the fema camp immigrant child from Central America blanket
Brian looks like a fat Tom segura
How come he doesn’t say hello freak bitches
@joerogan ! I’m not famous and I would really like to be on your podcast. You seem coherent in what you’re saying in which is hard to come by nowadays. I’m party authentic. If it helps. I’m full on conspiracies and I highly recommend just 3 hours of spontaneous knowledge. Btw, I love UFC, don’t like boxing because of hugging rule. Anyway, you’re a cool dude Rogan. Def out-strength me. Okay
Damn you think wilder tries to take this to this commissioners to over turn the fight?
Imagine if fury trained wilder   Wilder would be the goat without question
Wilder would beat every other heavy weight. Okay older is the second best heavy weight
It’s not a 10 second count, it’s the referees count to 10. Cmon Joseph, learn the rules
Cap joe, why lie to the people the people. The fight was awful quite frankly...
More disappointing Wilder hype from JR.....
Rogan looks like mini-me, WTF?
Gotta love how people don't know the rules and talk about how things should be
Wilder cant box for shiit, the guy is a one punch loser. He should learn to jab.
Don't watch on Spotify, only see the odd clip on here now, where is Eddie b, haven't seen or heard from him in ages?
Wilder got knocked down-first time went down-got back up at 8 seconds… he walked AWAY from the ref, staring at the crowd and looked back (at 14 seconds) so by boxing rules he got KO’d. Ten count means you GET UP-AND tell the ref you can fight not get up TURN your back to the ref and respond WELL after 10 seconds
Rogan , you’re bad ass bro!
Its a 10 counttttttt!!!!!!!! Not a 10 second count ffs godamnnn why cant ppl understand that already jesus christ 🙄🙄🙄
Starts with picking on Jamie
06:30 Joe is incorrect, when a fighter is knocked down a guy at ringside will immediately start the count, the ref will direct the standing fighter to the farthest neutral corner, the ref will then pick up the count from the ringside dude and continue it on, at that point the ringside guy is done with any counting. If the fighter in the neutral corner leaves that corner DURING the count the ref can stop the count to tell that fighter to get his ass back in the neutral corner, he will then pick up his own count from when he stopped it.  That is why you see fighter get to that neutral corner with a quickness and stay there, if a fighter leaves i during the count they are stupid.
Joe “look at that fat roll down” rogan
The count depends on where the mob has its money bet!
Good job Joe Rogan ! Stay yourself!  That's it!
Fury was smiling when he got knocked down lol
Certain friends that Joe has makes me wonder if he's a dick in real life. Ie.. Brendan and Tony. A few friends of mine met Tony and they all said he was a dick. He treats ppl like they're beneath him and Brendan is clearly a fake who hangs on Joe's nuts. I'm not hating but you can just see it. Maybe Joe likes to keep ppl like them around for some reason. I've never met a Brendan fan before except idiots online.
Why you wearing the devil NASA ? 🤘  DID YOU SELL YOUR SOUL TOO?
Man I wish Joe wasn’t so biased against fury, bare annoying
It does not feel the same this show has Lost the Magic
I’m sure a comedian knows everything about fighting too.. like c’mon man no one is that cool. What you gonna say next, he also hunts.
No one gives redban enough credit for helping to start the JRE podcast
Joe is incorrect. The referee is to look to the counter at ringside to pick up the count. Watch any fight, its been going on for years
Long time boxing fan. Did not realize that there were youngsters around who don't know the term "queer street"... oh, well. Amazing fight!
There should be no count, the fight should only end with a knockout or the towel.
Joe is off base here The referee is in charge of the count, nobody else. Fighters are taught to go to a neutral during a knockdown. so the ref doesn't have to waste time on the count.
This video is so misinformed misleading for casual fans. Do you realize how many great fights and great outcomes we would’ve missed out on if it was a stopwatch count?  Corrales versus Castillo would’ve never happened if it wasn’t for the ref's judgment.  It’s a Ref count, not a stopwatch count
Regarding "what are the odds of the name Tyson Fury" it's not a coincidence.  He literally comes from a lineage of (presumably angry) fighting gypsies.  Sort of like when someone has the surname Baker, there is usually some ancestor who owned a bakery.  In his case, the notable attribute of his ancestors is their fury.  His father named him after Mike Tyson, so no coincidence there either.
Not one of the greatest fights ever. Sloppy garbage boxing match. I used to work for Ring magazine, this is nothing compared to back in the 80s and 90s
Never mind Joe,s mistaken beliefs regarding the 10 second count, what about the `out of sinc` video person who works for Joe? Now he is exasperating to the max when asked to put up a video? With regular monotony if us viewers are lucky, we will catch a few seconds of the video and then it switches back to Joe. Then Joe usually points to something in that video which we cannot see,and carries on talking about it? This certainly makes Joe appear very conceited and full of himself.As if not seeing the selected video properly matters none,as long as Joe is in the frame yapping along.
By the same token. George Foreman did a post fight video stating it was one of the best referee fight he has seen.
It's a ten count . Seconds mean nothing .
Come on joe i thought you knew your boxing.  It was by no means one of the greatest heavyweight fights of all time don't buy in to that hype 😂 take away the knock downs and it was a pretty poor fight. Apart from fury knocking wilder down a few times that was actually the worst performance from fury i have seen in a while. His footwork and head movement that he has become known for just wasn't there and the faint jabs followed by double jabs that he is known for just wasn't there. The whole fight was a clench fest and hug fest by both fighters but the knockdowns made it exciting and the ko was the icing on the cake.
Really Joe, not a single guy has knocked out as many guys as Wilder's 41?  You're a fight guy?  Rocky Marciano knocked out 43 of his 49 opponents and unlike guys like Ali, Rocky NEVER LOST.  Rocky is the GOAT.
Referee saved Fury...fury was down for the full 10 seconds, second knockdown...wtf!?!
Joe doesn't understand the rules of boxing in regards to the count.
Now say this without crying ...  You’re talking about the other fighter’s power for 14 minutes whilst he got knocked out by one punch. Pretend to not be bias and talk about both😅
George Foreman had 68 KOs, many more than Wilder... Just sayin
One of the greatest boxing matches of all time? C'mon, Joe. There's tons of heavyweight fights alone (forget other weight classes) that had guys with way better skills giving a great show.  Dempsey/Firpo Louis/Farr Marciano/Charles 2 Marciano/Moore Ali/Frazier 1 and 3 Patterson/Johannsson 1 & 2 Liston/Williams Ali/Frazier 1 & 3 Ali/Norton 1 & 2 Ali/Foreman Foreman/Lyle Holmes/Norton Holmes/Cooney  And then tons of fights from the 1990s. And I haven't even included many good ones from the 1980s.   Mercer would had whupped Wilder. Just too good of a jab, chin and HEART in Merciless. I'd pick Ray over Fury as well.   Holyfield would had taken both these guys out.  Bowe? Forget it.  I like watching the Fury/Wilder fights, but let's keep it in perspective.   Just my 2 cents.
Great fight? Sure. Greatest boxing contests? Hardly.  Wilder obviously is a puncher, and a fighter, but there really was only one boxer in the ring and even he didn't do much technical boxing. Indeed I think it's easy to make the argument that Fury didn't fight anywhere near as impressively as he did in the second fight. Wilder fought with more heart, but hard to say with any more skill. Gripping and entertaining, however, no doubt.
Mike Tyson had masterful power but also was a masterful boxer. That’s why he’s my favorite of all time. He did not necessarily have to rely on the power. He was Diante Wilder with incredible boxing skills.
Joe knows MMA - but Joe Don't know Boxing..  Foolish to talk about this Count business.  1)  It was clear Tyson Fury had his eyes of the Ref during the whole count and was ready to get up anytime,  he's just waiting for 8 as most Trainers advise  2)  The whole thing didn't have any influence over the fight - as the knockdown was at the END of the ROUND and the Bell rang a few seconds later...  Teddy Atlas and George Foreman said this Ref did a good job.     Tyson Fury is one of the Great Heavies of ALL TIME - he's  a  Masterful Boxer, and you can tell has a high IQ,  and is a physical giant with speed and coordination - very rare.   He deserves all attention and credit...
No odds it’s what his name is ffs lol fighting since 6
Rogan was so wrong about the counts and the rules surrounding then.  It will take you 2 minutes to look it up and realize it was handled exactly the way the rules say it should be
I'll bet Joe has his lawn cut like a proper fig
If Wilder knocked fury out and the count was slow, then wilder had 9 other rounds to finish the job off, slow count excuses how ridiculous. Let’s talk about when the doctor assessed wilder at the start of the round just to give him more recovery time eh?? . The Dr was nowhere to be seen in between the round, but then chose to assess wilder as the round started. Blatant Cheating from wilders camp so let’s talk about that..and It’s not the first time that’s happened either.
“Not a SINGLE guy who has knocked out as many guys?” Uh……. Archie Moore Sandy Saddler
Fury would of been up by 8. STFU Joe
Same shit happened when Wilder went down dude. Chill.
Deonte Wilder was given these extra long breaks when a dr would wait until a round would start and then jump in the ring. We could do this all day. Wilder was given a lot of extra help. And Im glad. Because it was a great fight. Wilder should put him to sleep
Tyson Fury milks knock downs, if the count was faster he would have just got up faster. However doesnt matter as you can just watch the fight and look at the timer on the video. He was up in less than 10 anyway.
6:15 to 8:52 Fury said it he was listening and waiting on the ref. He said he wanted to avoid getting up too early so his legs wouldn’t give causing a stoppage. Fury was following his strategy he wasn’t “saved” by the bell
This guest seems like the guy at the party who stays sober and then calls the cops on the party
I was waiting for GSP to show up
This whole "long count" BS needs to STOP! and Joe you're not helping because you clearly don't know the rules.
PLEASE get Dog the Bounty Hunter on the podcast!!! 🙏🏼
If that's one of the greatest boxing matches of all time, boxing sucks. Wilder had no chance, even when he knocked fury down twice. Never a doubt who was gonna win. MMA is soooo much more entertaining.
Tony knows…..buckeye stuff! O H
Canelo will pass up wilders knockouts soon enough
The ref did a great job though... the count was shit but he did a great job separating them and calling out Furys cheeky dirty boxing haha
There’s too much biased UK fans on these comment sections that it’s becoming impossible to debate.
I'm very surprised none of these guys pointed out that fury was very aware during the counts, fury got.up at 7 both times, if the ref counted faster he'd have been up faster but you can only go by the refs count.
Hey Joe thanks for showing my boy E Pawned some love... https://youtu.be/PyjPTgmgfd0
You haven't seen the refund before. That answers your question about corruption
Sickk of you people jackin two goons off. Wilder is a one punch poney and fury is a clumspy overgrown giant. Snoozefest.
5:00 he said 'tyson fury hits so hard it almost doesn't matter' he means Wilder
Hinchcliffe and Redban's Kill Tony is maybe the best thing to happen to stand up comedy in decades.
BUT HE WOULD HE HAVE GOT UP QUICKER IF HE WENT TO 5 INSTEAD OF 3. HE WASNT OUT HE WAS LISTENING TO THE COUNT
What happened to that red background setting ?
I think Dante Walter took a dive When you are the best you have nothing else to prove really he needed the money  Let's competition in heavyweight boxing  really look at the fight  Dante Wilder's record is crazy And also hes a lot quicker than he He did not do much blocking By the way I like the show   Also good review of  Fight
But Fury didn't need the long count. He would have been up anyway.
Did Doctor Evil take over the Joe Rogan Experience? 😅 just banter, love Joe and a great fight!
Joe is wrong about the count rules. If an opponent does not go to the neutral corner, the referee stops his 10 count (not 10 second count btw) to enforce the rules then continues where he left off.  I believe he may be confusing it with initiating the count wherein he may go with the ringside official to start the count later if he had not already.
Damn I'm glad Joe recognized the long count. So now you have it, WILDER WON, by the boxing rules. Twice!! Check the count of the first fight.
2nd Fight Wilder’s Corner Threw in the Towel
When ufc guys talk about boxing hahaha
But Fury was on his feet before the slow count even hit 8. So its irrelevant if it was slow or not.
I'm not sure that 2nd knockdown on Tyson was legit he was still getting his legs under him from the 1st knockdown
This could be just me but i feel like the bias here for Wilder is fuckin nuts
thye just announced Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder 4
The tan windscreen ultrasonographically judge because box compatibly tame mid a stiff toast. husky, nifty copper
The ref did exactly what the rules state. You have to go to the opposing neutral corner or the count is paused. Fury maintained eye contact with the ref throughout the whole time.  You are trained to take as much time as needed.  If the ref has to stop his count from an inexperienced fighter or a fighter that is too excited to realize he isn’t following the rules.
It’s the refs count nothing else refs count fighter that got the knock down fault for not staying or being in his corner allways refs count
If the ref had counted faster, Fury would have gotten up faster. He wasn't out of it. The "long count" argument is bullshit.
Is the space suit a nod to how high they are? Other than Duncan Trussell does Joe dress up for anyone else?
Muhammed Ali an the famous long count from years ago 🥊
Is it just me, or do Joe's main circle of friends seem to be getting lamer?
Very entertaining.  Thank JRE
According to Big John McCarthy, Joe Rogan is wrong and the ref got it  correct.
When you get hit like Wilder hit Fury. The ONLY thing that carries you on is pure determination to continue on. Right now.. great fight.. the count isn't ten seconds per say. It's a ten count said loudly so the knocked silly fighter can hear the count..
LMFAO.....asking Tony if he watched the fight.....not sure if that's his sort of thing.....
Tyson Fury  For a big man he's faster than dirt leg Lola.
Joe rogan really doesn't understand boxing really should refrain from commenting on it, this was tysons worst performance in terms of boxing skills out of the trilogy e wasn't walking in behind the jab not feinting getting careless and wilder is not the greatest puncher just like golovkin these murderous punchers when they go up in class stop knocking people out tyson, golovkin, wilder it's all the same story
Hey joe, did you ever pay nick Diaz for the slogan? Royalties must be insane lol
4:58 Joe Rogan loses his train of thought, after talking about how hard Wilder hits, that he says "Tyson Fury hits so hard, it almost doesn't matter" 🤔😂😂 I'm guessing there's some whiskey drinking going on in this podcast? Cause nobody else caught that, or corrected Joe's statement 😂😂 4:52 is where the slip up starts
He was named after Mike tyson
Basketball has the shot clock maybe boxing should have a Knock out clock.
Fight of the year for sure. Canelo vs Plant won't come close.
Joe Rogan lookin like a baked potato
Boxers play the count, as in they get up at the last moment to make sure they're steady. It's a well-known occurrence. to say the count was long or not, doesn't matter. the boxer was there, for both.
"theres maybe one or two other humans that have ever lived than can punch as hard as this guy"         dont tell me you believe that smoking Joe
The nerd on this show all the time is a fukn muppet.
FURY is unbeatable end of story the greatest heavyweight i ever seen
now even Jimbo Joe is jumping in on Wilder's excuses...what next.
I feel like Deontay could have been a Heavy Weight  Julian Jones or Tommy Hearns. Still, best man won, and both men are Warriors.
Joe Rogan proving he knows f all about boxing
Hey you people at the bot farms. Leaking this story to TMZ that bots farms and the list of the comments and account is worth millions. Quit your job rich. You know you aren't loyal to anything or anyone.
Fury Knocks down Wilder more times and knocks him out but all they show is Wilder's knockdown. Slightly bias there Roe Jogan in your stupid space suit, been listening to Scaub to much.
You’re my hero Joe !!! Calling-out a liar.....👍👍👍
Well the ref did get changed at the last min and the judges too.
your not a boxing person are you MR (JOE I KNOW EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD) ROGAN!
Joe sounding way too much like a know-it-all.
All this bullshit about the counts, do people realise it was the same referee who counted twice for Wilder too?  His counts might have been slow but they were for both fighters and Fury was up on 7 to 8 on normal counts regardless of the referee's ones.
What's with the stupid NASA suits. Morons.
Stick to the UFC joe. Fury saw that punch coming and braced for it. He can take the "biggest punchers" punch and still sing a song after the match.   Get it together, wilder is a bom dosser
Another brutal knockout was canelo vs kirkland
Love when Joe reps the Astronaut suit 😝
I watch the fight it was a good heavyweight belt. But to say it's one of the best fights ever that's pushing it a little bit. You want to see a real fight watch Roberto Duran and Iran Barkley that fight was unbelievable
Joe is wrong how counts are  done
No skill involved.
Honestly let’s just say fuck all these what if this what if that Ayee things aren’t perfect but that’s what makes us human let’s just appreciate it and hats off to both men helluva fight
There is no words. Americans like this truly are ‘without a doubt’ delusional. Isn’t there sane normal proper people available to have a public voice in the USA. The representatives of this once mighty land of the free are an absolute disgrace. This world is done
Why they wearing super suits?
Tony still not letting the AIDS beat him
I come from a family that's known for fighting. We lived up to the name.
Tyson Fury's father named him Tyson after Mike.
What is Joe Rogan?
Wtf are yall wearing🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pisses me off nobody talks bout height and reach advantage with  40 pounds and better boxing lol imagine if wilder was bigger than fury
Big John said the count was legit.
People are making this fight into something it's not, fair enough wilder put fury down, and it was shocking in the moment, but in context with the rest of the fight it really meant nothing. People calling this "the greatest trilogy of all time" "greatest heavyweight fight ever", and even going as far to say this makes tyson fury is one of the greatest heavyweights ever are just delusional. I'm sorry but there is just so many heavyweight with superior records, and title defences.
whoever the guy on the podcast is , he's so fucking annoying I hate the fact that joe rogans amazing thoughts on the fight are being inturpted by his uneducated opinions
all boxing ten counts needs to be on a clock
Lmaoo Y’all so mad in the comments cuz he recognizes the greatness of wilder. Pathetic
Wait. What happened with Kanye? 😂
Its a 10 count joe its not considered 10 seconds.very dissapointed in ya.you should know alot better
The reality is there in different weight classes. The same thing adasanya felt fighting blackowicz 30 pound weight difference makes tye difference
Loser! guests on the Rogan show as usual. That fight was RIGGED!! Like you wouldn't believe.
Come on cameraman, everyone’s looking at the screen discussing the knockout and we are just looking at the side of Joe’s head and his spacesuit.
Without the long count, the fight never would have been EPIC!!!
I'm gonna be known as funny pants Smith from now on.
The fight was entertaining due to knockdowns but it was one if the sloppiest fights I have ever seen.
I have a problem with a deliberate  +40 lb weight advantage, especially with somebody who lays on a guy. I don't see that disparity in any other division or combat sport. Takes nothing from the skill of Fury, but c'mon.
Tyson has Wilders number. I feel if they fight 100 times Tyson would beat him 90 times. Tyson just figured him out.
Wilder got some serious stamina issues, only two rounds and he is sloppy and tired, yes, Fury's weigh might be the answer to that but still, happened in the second fight too. Can't deny his heart though, fought with no gas tank lots of rounds, one of the best fights I've seen live without a doubt.
We cannot say that Deontay is a bad fighter. He just doesn't have the technique. Fury was more skillful but this was a great fight no doubt. One of the best I've seen.
Is there a reason why they are dressed like astronauts! lol
Fucking hell...denial is a hell of a drug.
The doctor came in the ring for wilder giving him more time to recover so it is what it is , and the ref counted slow for both fighters
I can’t believe anyone hasn’t commented that Tyson was named after mike.
This must be the worst Era of boxing, jelly rolls and lack of skills. UFC is a bigger appeal but the money for boxing is still evident. I think it's sad  Edit: yes corruption still exists
joe "i dont even remotely know the rules of boxing" rogan
And I’m just here wondering why the fuck they’re dressed in astronaut suits
Making a name for your self. Trying really hard
You DON'T START the COUNT UNTIL OTHER BOXER IS IN  A NEUTRAL CORNER. 15 OCTOBER 2021, FRIDAY
Joe is so off with the 10 count "controversy" but at least he sounds confident about it 🤣
Joe finally getting ready to go into space to finally prove to Eddie that the world is not flat
how stoned are these guys
fury and most boxers wait for 8 or 9 to get extra time to recover and fury was wide awake looking at the referee so if he's never interupted fury gets up a second or 2 sooner. you should always take as much time as you can when you go down. don't get up at 3 or 4 lol. so that isn't a great excuse
Where can I get that jacket?, shirt?
Nice shout out for Youngstown, I live there
Tyson Fury: *Named after Mike Tyson, trained from 7 years old for boxing* this guy: "Bruh what are the odds"
Joe looks like DR. Evil ...lol
Had Wilder run immediately to the neutral corner after dropping him -  he would have knocked out Fury twice in 3 fights
I find Joe to be insufferable these days.
Wladimir klitschko  has more than 50 ko's
And why were white americans rooting for fury? I mean y'all supposed to be so patriotic.
wilder is just not a good boxer. period.
If a fighter doesn't go to a neutral corner or goes to the wrong corner, they effectively get penalised. The ref always stops the count until the fighter complies. For example Dempsey vs Tunney 2 from 1927. This shit has been happening for a hundred years, literally.   Here's the Dempsey vs Tunney 2 highlights video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM3-ozVVsXc
You can’t teach wilder how to box at age 35. He’s too old to learn new tricks!
Stick to UFC Joe. You know nothing of boxing.
Joe rogan is "boxing stupid." How does he not know about getting up from a knockdown too early?? Fury could have gotten up no matter how fast the count was. Even in there 1st fight the 12th round knockdown WAS NOT THAT BAD. Look at the replay, he was acting hurt and got up at the last minute on purpose.
Why are these astronauts talking about boxing?
I Think the count was fine, the man still wanted to fight lol
"When he got dropped we all thought it was over" Absolutely not. I'm sorry but at no point did I think Fury was out. Even since he got up in their first bout I came to the understanding that he is literally a fucking T-800 disguised as a man.
Rogan is way off on this one.  The referee can stop the fight. The referee is in the ring. He knows how the fight is going and it is up to ref to determine if the fighter can continue. If the ref feels a fighter can continue...he will give a fighter EVERY opportunity to continue at his discretion no matter how he counts or what the rule book says!!!!! This has never CHANGED throughout the years in boxing!!!! Boxing is not the UFC and there is a reason why fights like this are way more popular around the world then any UFC fight in history!!!! There is alot of money and alot of prestige at stake....especially in a heavyweight championship fight!! I challenge anyone in the comments to point to a CHAMPIONSHIP boxing match where a ref started a count where the boxer looked like he could EFFECTIVELY continue in a championship fight and the ref  NOT give that fighter EVERY opportunity to continue!!! I'll be here waiting......There is many reasons boxing is called "the sweet science" one is because some things that happen within a bout defy the structure of what is really going inside the ring...and it is beyond math as simple as COUNTING!!!! I know that hurts some feelings but its the truth!!! Science is not perfect....I think we can all agree when it comes to things such as this so called "pandemic". There were many times where Fury hit Wilder with combinations and looked completely punch drunk were SOME refs would have stopped the fight. The ref even had the doctor come in to look at Wilder allowing him an extended rest before I believe round 7! So let's stop with the excuses... It was well known Wilder wanted to go out on his shield so the ref allowed it! And his ass went to sleep in the 11rd. Wilder didn't do enough to win. Period! You want to be the champ you have beat the champ no matter what!! THAT'S BOXING!!!! Wilder didn't do that! Just another excuse for Wilder and his delusional fans. Rogan enables this 🐂💩 thinking here!!! It's A damn shame! 🤦🏼‍♂️
Calling someone who almost knocked him self out with an uppercut one of the greatest of all time it’s funny
I thought that was Daniel tosh
The skinny guy is so full of it. He just seems like he bs’s a lot
I dont even like wilder but you people can say whatever you want. The man punches like a fucking mack truck. Fury said it himself in an interview that he couldn't even believe how hard the man hits. Obviously he's not some skilled technician of a boxer, but there's probably few people in boxing that hit as hard as he does. Its also telling that, padded career or not, he didn't start boxing until he was like 21 or something, quickly made it to the Olympics, and won a friggin bronze medal. Getting to the Olympics is a feat in itself. Medalling puts you into like the top 1% of all athletes on the planet. The dude is a phenom.
Clearly like many others Rogan doesn't realize just how great Oleksandr Usyk is. Everyone will know in a year from now when he hands Fury his first defeat and becomes The Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of The World.
Joe at home watching: "OH HE'S ROCKED, HE'S GOT HIM HURT!"
NOT TRUE JOE. The referee has to stop the count to tell the fighter to get into the neutral corner. And plus Fury could have gotten up whenever. He was not concussed, his eyes were on the ref the whole time. He did what you were supposed to do wait until 9 to get up. Look at all of his kockdowns, he always waits till 9. No trainer tells you to get up right away after you get knocked down, if you do thats a bad sign.
Joe  Rogan - “if you eat McDonald’s every day, you’ll probably die”  Also Joe Rogan a second later - “not being vaccinated every day during a pandemic won’t kill you”  (paraphrase of Joe trying to wiggle his way out of the trap he set himself up in when the guest made a great analogy)
This podcast is garbage. Fuck Spotify. We got Lex, Helwani and Al Iaquinta holding it down right here on YouTube.
Joe won't debate smart people?? Cenk from TYT called you out HARD right here Joe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqrKuxr99us
Yea buttt the way fury wakes up and keep fighting is insane
Has Joe ever talked about Anthony Joshua, swear I’ve never heard his views on him.
Cenk from TYT called you out for debate, Joe.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqrKuxr99us
Who cares about the count  People want to see someone totally lights out
"OVER THERE."        WHEN A FIGHTER FAILS TO REMAIN IN THE NEUTRAL CORNER THE COUNT MUST STOP,  UNIVERSAL BOXING RULES.  AS IT STANDS ITS THE REFS COUNT.    THE REF MUST COUNT IN A DELIBERATE MANNER SO A DAZED FIGHTER CAN HEAR IT.         FURY WAS ALREADY STARTING TO GET UP AT FOUR.     ITS NOT A TRUE 10 SECONDS.  A SYNOPSIS OF A QUOTE BY MILLS LANE.
So funny you are discussing this with Tony is absolutely fucking hilarious!!! Your personal Stephen A. Smith.
There just shouldn't be a 10  count
Yea why the f is it that basketball has a shot clock and boxing has a dude with a subjective lapse of time on how long a second is…
Not a bad/long call by any means.. The red had to make sure Wilder was in a neutral corner and also, Tyson isn’t counting in his head after getting knocked down, he’s gonna get up when the ref is around 7-9 if he can🤷🏻‍♂️😂
Wilder is still an ass clown 🤡
Joe, they don’t teach to aspirate before injecting an IM vaccine because studies showed it it’s irrelevant. In 2016, we stopped doing this. Again, you don’t know what you’re talking about. And while I respect a neurosurgeon’s opinions about healthcare, he doesn’t administer vaccines as evidenced by his ignorance on that topic. Also, instead of having a neurosurgeon on, why not a virologist, epidemiologist, or immunologist, to discuss COVID? He may be a neurosurgeon, but COVID isn’t something his speciality lends depth and breadth to as far as conversation goes. I probably would’ve schooled you worse than he did because of this fact and I’m an ICU nurse.
What is Joe wearing
Wilder is Clubber Lang character in real life!!
The counting doesn't matter cause if you time it it's still under 10 seconds
Fury could of gotten up when he wanted to. Why not use the full count regardless of how long or short it is. Just a smart move to rest. If the referee had counted faster Fury would’ve gotten up faster. Fury in control most of the fight. Had Wilder landed that knock down shot on the chin instead of the top of the head, he just might be champ today.
Joe's missing how the count works here.  And no it shouldn't be ten regular seconds
Fury is a beast boxer...a chin of stone...=results.
What up Rogan, that is an Awesome idea, the fight needs a clock for sure! Then Mike Tyson wouldn't have had his lost to Buster Douglas! 100%
The slow count was largely irrelevant as he was already up. You are just speculating..  Wilder got his ass handed to him end of.  He landed more than double the punches.  You can't teach natural talent like fury has.  Lay off the weed Jo..
This fight was so out of this world that Everyone had to wear spacesuits. 😆
What an amazing fight! Greatest fight of our time.
Wilder literally had to go to the hospital for multiple serious injuries. What is Joe going on about?
Did anyone at all see superbon knock out Petrosyan dude. Shiiiiiit.
Love Fury, but honestly I watch a lot of boxing and older fights, this is not a very good era of heavyweights. Cormier stick with MMA because you and Joe are both sounding like rookies with the count, Fury was very alert and watching the ref the whole time with both counts and got up at 8 both times. He could've gotten up by 4 both times
I cant believe rogan doesnt know the rule, it only takes like 10-20 seconds to find the rules online.
Fury was up in 11 secs. The count is a ten count as the ref sees fit and doesn't have to be 10 exact seconds.
Miss the show Fuck Spotify
Move like Chavez and Hit like DW!!! WTF??? You would have Mike Tyson!!!! That who that guy would be!!! Cmon Joe!!! that fighter would be Mike Tyson.😅😅
I say this again Wilder has titanium plates in his arms.
May have been a long count but some fighters ride the count out...he may have been more urgent getting up...I believe all fighters would tell you that
Fury would of got up when he needed to he was watching the reff to get up when needed,wilder fans just need to realise fury is way superior and it’s 3-0 first fight was 10 rounds to 2 and everyone knows it
In wilders defense.. they probably shouldn’t have stopped the second fight
its hilarious to see joe wear a shiny puff daddy nasa suit when he doesnt believe that we landed on the moon
Awwwe! The little boys look sooooo cute all dressed up in their little spaceman suits!
Either way he beat the count , and beat a dosser 3 out of 3
This is probably the last time they fight.  No need for a 4th fight, Wilder needs to move on to someone else in the heavyweight division.
Wilder’s ridiculous accusations and blaming everyone and their cousin for his losses make him look like an immature, amateurish, clown 🤡
Wilder only has a right hand but it’s a hell of a right hand,can’t box but
What are the astronauts names
The counts were just as long for wilder
When you watch with a group, it’s like your watching with a crowd.
The only controversy over the count is over ignorance. No wrong joe, the count starts the opponent is in the neutral corner.  Joe doesn’t know about boxing rules clearly
The referee did a great job and didn't make any mistakes.  Watch interview with Tyson vs Douglas.  The referee will always stop the count if a fighter leaves the neutral corner.  No corruption, no long count, please.  There has always be a 10 count, never a 10 second count in the history of the sport of boxing.  After watching numerous fighters getting counted out, the 14 second knockout is common place.  Joe, you're spreading misinformation.  Please stop!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg3Vnfu4Pk&list=WL    ....... get this Tim Gielen on your show
Screamed out when fury went down in the 4th for sure
Same thing happened in the Tyson vs Douglas fight .... people forget the round before Tyson lost ... he knocked down Douglas and the ref messed up the count giving Douglas 13 seconds... To get up and just one round later he knocked out Tyson
Tony’s voice never hit puberty
The long count argument is so stupid with this fight, when fury gets knocked down he doesn't rush to get up, he gets his bearings looking at the ref and knows when to get up, no controversy
Fury could of got right up but if the ref counts slow a smart boxer will take advantage so fuck the slow count bullshit the better man won all three fights. Wilder is lucky to have got a mercy draw in the first fight because he lost every round but the two he went down but in the two he went down in the first fight he finished them two rounds winning the rest of the rounds. Fucking stop
It's already commented on here, Tyson Fury is named after Mike Tyson.
George Foreman 68 KOs Mike Tyson 44 KOs Roy Jones Jr 47 KOs  There’s actually a lot of guys who have more than 41 workouts.
Yeah he knocked out 40 tomato cans
joe clearly does not know boxing well
He was named after mike tyson bro, it’s not an accident.
Fury is not a god fool,he is just good. So stupid
Tyson 20 sec count Fury
Love ya joe
damn i missed redban. gonna have to listen to this tonight with a j.
Tyson Fury admitted he was named after Mike Tyson hello?!!!!!!!
Fury was named Tyson after Mike Tyson. Mike was his dads fav boxer.
Joe "look at that fat" Rogan.
referee has the discretion to stop start the count. it is the responsibility of Wilder to go to a neutral corner. there is precedence for referee's stopping the count because the fighter is not complying.
Why is everyone hyping this fight so much? Wilder got his ass beat for the entire fight. Fury only seemed hurt one time. I’m the first knock down seemed more like a stumble. Fury dominated the whole fight in my opinion.
What is this is Joe Rogan a space cadet?
I think the count thing is the referees discretion
When a boxer goes down, he takes enough time to recover following the refs count. If the count was faster or slower, Fury would have gotten up at 8 anyway. This was a dumb argument made by Joe Rogan. Sick of this guy always rooting for Americans.
Who is the spaceman?
This is the second time the count was questionable.  Wilder brought up the slow count on the first fight they had.  Just saying.
Wilder needed speed and movement not power , he should of never have turned down Floyd Mayweather Jr's offer . Instead he hired a coach he knocked out in rd 1. He was always going to lose
Психонавты
I don't know if this is right but I saw somewhere that the rules for the wbc are that once the fighter is knocked down the count can only start once the other fighter is in the neutral corner
Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson in 1988
Boxing is corrupt
I wanna hear him talk about it wit someone who knows fighting
If we accepted Fury's count as long and he was KO'd, then it wouldn't have happened in the first place. Because that would mean Wilder would have already been KO'd from his own long counts. So the long count arguments just don't work.
When will joe realize that behind your ear is the back of your head.
With great power…
No one realizes they’re in nasa suits wtf
Some of my favorite young memories are big fight get togethers with friends and family
The guy with the btch voice, in orange, shouldn't say everything that jumps into his head.
As long as BOTH fighters are getting the SAME count and treated equally..... then the end result is fair
It takes a lot to impress Young Jaime.  This fight wasn’t it. Do better.
I wonder if Joe seen Sanjay go to Don Lemons show and completely throw Joe under bus again saying he took horse dewormer
I have the greatest name of all time. "Moses Freedom"
Julian The Hawk Jackson had more ko's. He wasn't a heavyweight but had more ko's
Everyone always points towards the long count, but fighters always adjust to the count and either way fury would have still gotten but fair he might have been more dazed when the fight continued
Corruption
Wilder had a 25 count if what rogans saying carries the day
And Fury is in his prime. No one beats Fury right now. If you haven’t seen the YouTube short of Fury talking about the power of the first jab he received from Wilder. He said “if that’s the jab wtf is his right hand gonna be like? “ lol
The count doesnt have to be accurate every count is different you count the champion out, Fury won that fight.
Fury hav the right trainer
Apparently the original referee was sick
It says in the rules the count stops and picks up again when the ref gets the opponent to the proper corner. It’s written in black and white.
How about the fact that they switched the referee last minute?
People got amniezia when it comes to the 15 second count
Utter garbage, the fight was pathetic.
Tyson Furys dad named him after Mike Tyson. Furys father was also a heavy weight boxer and mike tyson was his idol. Tyson Fury said this on Mike Tysons Podcast a couple years ago.
A lot people knew  when Tyson fury got knocked down he was going to come back and win the fight
I have to disagree. Fury went down, but the guy never looks hurt. His eyes always look like he's still coherent and ready to get back up. Most amazing chin I have ever witnessed.
Hey.  Wilder is not much of a boxer, has a weak chin and defense, poor stamina and misses a lot of punches.  Fury pressured him and he folded.  It doesn't take a great fighter to beat either one of these guys, and I don't think this was a great fight at all.
RINGMANSHIP. That's the word you're looking for, Joe!
@PowerfulJRE you have to bring crowder back on man he is getting screwed right now i hope they cant keep him off here forever.
That's completely wrong. The ref picks up the count from the timekeeper, then if he has to tell the opponent to get back in the neutral corner the count ceases while he does so. He then continues the count from where he left off. It's the fault of the opponent for not staying in the corner if the ref has to do so. It's irrelevant anyway because Fury was still fairly lucid for both counts and timed getting up from the refs count. Even if the count had been a second or so quicker he would have still got up, and if you think different it's only because you're a Wilder fan.
It wasn't a long count though, Fury still got up within the real 10 seconds
When you get knocked down, your job isn't to get up before the 10 count. Your job is to get up before the referees 10 count. If I was Tyson, I would have taken advantage of all the time the referee is giving me.  And wilder probably could have gone the distance in the 2nd fight. But wilder wasn't showing anything to show that he was in the fight. He was just taking punishment for 7 rounds. The corner had to stop that.
wtf are you wearing Joe???
Tony is confusing Chinese boxing with Punchout on nes....
D man get knock out
utter bullshit regarding the ref. tyson wasnt even that hurt he was buzzed for sure but you could see he was all there.
Why are they dressed like astronauts?
The count argument is pointless in this case Tyson didn’t look like he was struggling to get up very much he did what every boxer was trained to do get up on the 8 or 9 count and that’s what he did had the referee counted quicker I think he would almost definitely get back up.We have the evidence, we have seen him knocked down and he always gets back up and goes right back into the pocket.
Awesome!
That’s incorrect about the count. Rules state you stop the count, get the other fighter into the correct corner, then carry on the count. And it’s not 10 seconds, it’s a count to 10.
Questions surrounding Joe… is he on our side, the system or who… Does Joe really believe we went to the moon?  Lol. The science is laughable, even contradicts itself. Van Allen Belt radiates thousands of degrees temp higher, so it’s impossible for rockets made out of aluminum alloy to get past it. The. And the phone call, land line mind you, from the President speaking to Apollo 11 astronauts… LOL… can you hear me now… no, Joe’s not that stupid!
👊✌
Born 1989, 500 gypsy lane youngstown ohio..
Iron Mike used to be underrated back in the days and now we know him as the best heavyweight of all times.. living legend if u will.. Same will happen with Fury he will go down in the history as the greatest heavyweight of all times, he never even lost..  Ali lost, Mike lost, Fury didn’t...
Looking forward to when you meet fury and accuse him of corruption . 👍
Funnypants dangerfield
Joe's account of the count and how it works is wrong by rule. Its not a 1p second count. Before the fight the ref says I'll give u your every chance as long as u can defend yourself. So if u look ok u can get up and carry on. If u face plant or weeble wobble your out. It's all about reaction..by rule
Shout out to wilder. Take some time off. Learn footwork like Joe said. He needs to stick n move n slip in n out more. Forget fury n go for Joshua or ruin. Find God brother that's all we ask
Why are they all wearing Nasa suits...
There is no rule stating that a fighter is who is down for exactly loses. All the matters is the count of the referee.   In this fight, if the ref counted faster, Fury would have gotten up quicker. 'The long count' in the Tyson-Douglas fight was the same. Douglas would have risen faster if the count was quicker.
Bruh... from round 6 it was just wilder trying to survive
The Champ grew up in a old school British travelers (Giypsy) community, they live under a fighting code of honour to settle disputes with firsts, even if they know their on a hiding to nothing if they cower on being called out they'll get a slapped then cussed and loudly humiliated by their wives, not for losing but for humiliating her by turning yellow, it's the Giypsy way of it, Proper Hard
Special talent? Now I wouldnt fight wilder but ray Mercer 27. Rocky Marciano. 24 49-0 by the way. Aj 19  Ken Norton 24. Wilder is not the first to start late. Athletes are athletes.
Dude he took the standing 8 both times....I mean you ppl don't know boxing. Isn't fury fault the ref blew it. Fury was lounging n got up n was fine. I agree fd up mistake but wilder couldn't of done it . Like Rogan Said wilder would got knocked out period.
Tyson Fury was a bear knuckle Gypsy fighter. Which make him tougher that a coffin nail.
Fury took those punches well, wasn't affected, got up like no other man could
It was rocky 7
No one: Joe: look at the ceiling while giving opinions
THANK YOU for mentioning the SLOW count. 🐌
Joe has the rules wrong here.  If the ref has to pause his count because of the other fighter leaving his corner, the ref is supposed to deal with the wandering opponent, then turn back and start counting again where he paused.  In other words, when Wilder wandered out of his corner, he gifted Fury the time it took the ref to order him back.  It was all correct and according to the rules, and more evidence that Wilder is an idiot.
Can tell Joe lost a good few bucks on this fight lol the bitterness is obvious.
Hard to say because a downed fighter also times their stand up based on the count. They can use as much of the count as possible to recover. The long count doesn't mean Fury couldn't have gotten up earlier, unfortunately we'll never know if it hurt Wilder or not.
The boxer goes off thevrefs count fury would of still got up.....just saying
Joe always thought power punchers win and talks about his party. The truth is 9 out of 10 times a boxer beats a puncher. Aka defense. Hit and not get hit. A so called fighting expert with muscles knows fuck all about fighting.
Prime Mike Tyson vs Prime Tyson Fury 🤔
Fucking hate watching any combat sports with people! Especially people who have never fought in or out of competition. “He’s quitting” “Punch harder” “He has no breath he’s in bad shape” “I could’ve made him tap” “He punches so soft”… the bullshit magical fantasy world that people live in, is astonishing! I have no earthly want to ruin my weekly indulgence of Martial Arts by having some Kyles and Karens try to process human combat with me preset. 🙄
Maybe top 10.. It was a good entertaining fight. But best of all time?.... Meh
Wilder has a low standard to comprehend the match.... ( too many punches on his stupid face )
Fury knew when he was going down so he went down without taking one more shot  clever man
About the long count … the rule is you start the count, if the opponent doesn’t go to the neutral corner or comes out, THE REF STOPS THE COUNT UNTIL THE FIGHTER GETS BACK IN THE CORNER. THEN THE COUNT RESUMES WHERE LEFT OFF. The ref did his job correctly.
Joe saying if you could get Wilder to learn better boxing skills he'd be one of the best of all time, is a bit like saying if you could give Fury that one punch knockout ability of Wilder, then Fury would be the greatest of all time.  Wilder will never match Fury for boxing ability and Fury will never match Wilder for punching power.  What this trilogy comes down to is that Fury could take Wilder's power.  He was knocked down 4 times over the 3 fights, and got up 4 times.  For most of the rest of the time, Fury outboxed Wilder, Wilder maybe wins 3 to 5 rounds other than his knockdown rounds over the 3 fights.  So over 30 rounds, Wilder at best wins 8, and that's being generous.  Personally I'd give him 6 rounds.
I imagine that Tyson fury grew up like Brad Pitt's character from snatch.
JR your to cool
I like the spacesuit, elon has been killing it
I watched a boxing podcast which addressed the long count question. The host claimed that Fury went down at 10 seconds and was up at 20 on the ring clock.
Haha they keep saying wilder only needs 1 shot but tell that to Tyson. Pretty sure Wilder landed a few bombs over 3 fights.
Tyson fury is the king so joe please just shush.
It was a good fight no doubt but one of the greatest fights of all time, gimme me break, in the old days Wilder and Fury we be club fighters at best, Fury is a decent boxer but saying he is masterful is giving him too much credit, and Wilder once in a interview said that when he trains, he doesn’t do any running and even before a big fight he does not always train.  These guys talking about the fight don’t know shit about boxing, that is what’s wrong with boxing, people talking about the sport that don’t know shit and using boxers as commentators who are boring and add nothing to the event and women who look pretty announcing the fight because they are just pretty, I miss the old days of boxing that’s for sure.
You should have Nevada ref and boxing judge Robert Hoyle on as a guest.
You don't know shit about boxing it's not a ten second count it's a ten count basically the refs discretion! Anyone who knows boxing knows this!
Deontae was Wilder than last time……………………………………………………………………………
Redban the man!
Maybe You bet to Wilder chiken leg and You Lost your money. Hahaha You Lost My friend.
That fight was all heart.....no conditioning by Wilder or Fury....even tho fury carried himself better and won...that said Usyk out boxes both of them and AJ gets fooked up again too....facts
Joe just making stuff up as usual.
How the fuck do we make money fixing boxing matches if you start making these silly rules Joe?
didnt wilder get his ear busted? 2nd fight?
Whoever said joe king needs to climb out of joes asshole haha
Hot take: fury wasn’t that hurt.
Tony is so fake
That was the same ref that let a boxer getaway with 23 low blows  and one he counted  as a knock down. He is dirty and a last minute replacement
I disagree. Ali Foreman.
Joe is wrong about Deontay having the most KOs.  George Foreman still has that record.  Deontay may have the highest KO to win ratio though.
Boy mike Tyson has 44 knockout wins haha
Joe Rogan: wrong! 1) the referee can stop counting if the other fighter does not go to a neutral corner, the COUNTING DOES NOT CONTINUE while the ref is telling the other fighter to go to the corner that’s why the counting picked up where he left off.. 2) I’ll admit the counting was slow, but that’s why it’s called a 10 count, not a 10 second count it’s at the referees discretion
Really great to see the first podcast from Mars, the guys must have been tired after their flight since they didn’t even change out.
Here we GO!!
I’m only a casual watcher but surprises me there’s not more outrage or at least disapproval of Wilder’s unsportsmanlike behaviour at the end of the fight. I know he’s disappointed but so is everyone. When people attack boxing eg as glorified thuggery, I point to the respect and discipline it brings to the lives of young men, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. I know we are talking here about big business but I still believe Wilder should have done the manly thing. Maybe it’s just my team sports  background. What do boxing people think?
What a solid fight. Fury really just is the better fighter, and in my opinion the better sport too
Whats with the astronaut suits?
The cell phone footage from the crowd of the knock out is way more brutal looking
surely the ref counts the same for each knockdown, i think we are talking semantics, no cheating, best fighter won
Tyson was named after mike
Joe looking like Dr. Evil in that suit 😂
Panicking, he's in the ring with 2 killers, may have pooped himself a little
330 Meng If u know u know
wilder had a long ass count also a much longer one....
I thought it's a 10 count not a 10 second count
Long count? Like Tunney/Dempsey?? 🤔🥊
Tony sopranos
Fury changed his name btw
You don’t scream at things anymore do you ?
What’s Joe looking at on the ceiling?
J.R BAD AZZ SUITS BRUH
They all dressed 😂 as astronauts
We need furry vs Joshua or Ruiz next
Im sorry. Fury one all 3 fights, it was no contest. 99 out of 100 fights he beats Wilder, and he absolutely crushed him in the second fight.
It would have been nice to hear Joe & company recognise and mention how Wilder has no class. The guys a bum and he deserved to get his ass whooped.
The ref was changed last minute from original scheduled ref. The slow count ref is no other than Russel Mora. That pretty much sums it up if you care to research further………..
It’s a 10 count, not a 10 second count idiot. Unsubscribing.
If Tyson KO’d the biggest KO artist ever doesn’t that make him the biggest KO artist?
YouTube and google are too big and dangerous. Should be broken up. No good for America.
If the count was at 4 or 5 when the ref got back to fury he would have gotten up accordingly. Not to say he didn't benefit but he would have made the count either way.
does anyone think taking growth hormones is pathetic?.. dont want to name certain names, but this certain pod experience does..
Joe Rogan knows nithing apparently.
Lol he spends more time pumping up Wilder aka the 3x loser than talking about the King. Just a lil bias showing thru.
Surely 1 of them knew furys dad named him that because he knew he'd be an amazing fighter etc he willed it into existence
marquis of queensbury rules state its a count to 10 not a 10 second count. wilder left the neutral corner he was instructed to go to. therefore it is within the rules for the referee to continue the count where he left off.
It's Commercialtube not Youtube anymore!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey is Tony the 5"4 guy unfunny comedian that is racist?
Nah joes a prick for this one yeno hasn’t got a clue fury could have got up if he wanted to ffs, 10 mins in and joe just talking up wilder you would honestly think wilder won all 3 with the way this mans going on, fury is so sooo underrated it’s unbelievable
Joe sounds salty the yank lost .
Wtf is joe wearing 😳
Does he know Tyson Fury was named Tyson because his dad named him after Mike Tyson and said when he was born "he's going to be heavyweight champion"
This guy need to see naoya inoue fights, power and skill
How could it be a great fight when the outcome  of Fury winning was almost at 95%???? So in my opinion I don’t think it even came near of being a great fight…
In basketball referees count to 5 when players are inbounding the ball and they count to 10 when a player is shooting free throws. Both counts are all over the place too. Humans counting is just prone to inconsistencies.
Yo wtf are y’all wearing 😂
How does a 35 year old put 35lbs of muscle on ? Please do tell ? I’d like 10lbs
There was a person who broke down the counts. The counts Tyson got in the 4th were the same length as the one Wilder got in the 3rd. They both were down for the same length of time
Joe “greatest of all time” Rogan is back
WRONG Joe! Do your research. Get your stopwatch  out and time from the moment Fury’s ass hit the canvass. He’s up on 9 seconds!!! THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL THAT HE GOT A 14/15 SECOND COUNT. I am REALLY SURPRISED that a man of your caliber would make erroneous comments like that, without even bothering to do that!!! It won’t take you 15 seconds Joe. It will take you LESS THAN 10! Shame on you!!!! And I’m a big fan of yours and CANNOT stand Tyson Fury!!! UNBELIEVABLE that YOU would be so reckless!!!!!!!
Wilder interrupted the count (which is not an accurate 10 seconds in reality). In the rules it says that fighters must beat the referees 10 count. No where does it state that the fighter must get up before real life 10 seconds. When in the case the ref is interrupted he must RESUME THE COUNT WHERE HE LEFT OFF. In this case Wilder left his corner and interrupted the referee.
A.i referees, and it will happen in all sports eventually.
Kelly Pavlick a great???
Same long count bullshit happened during Tyson/Douglas.  Tyson won that fight LONG before he got knocked out.....
How does anyone like Tony Hinchcliffe?
I find it super annoying that news articles never let users post comments anymore. A Washington man threw his new born baby around like a football until the baby died and I wanted to wish that man a special place in hell. But I'm not allowed to make any comments or have a say in anything and my anger builds up until I have to come to your channel and vent. It will be super horrible if youtube stopped allowing comments because I have a need to get my 2 cents in even if no one reads it.
Every count in boxing is exactly like what happened. Every fight I have seen you will see the referee stop counting as the boxer is getting to their feet and I have never seen a boxer counted out unless he is prostrate and not moving or is clearly dazed on their feet. He will ask if the boxer can continue (on top of the count) and will admonish the other boxer if he moves before he signals to continue. If a boxer jumps back up quickly then the count will be a little over 10 seconds. Most pro's won't start moving till 8 is counted.
When fury got dropped we all thought it was over? 🤨 did u miss the first fight joe? Guarantee alot of viewers out there knew fury would bounce back and win the fight.
I could listen to Jo explaining different types of cheeses and it sound interesting 😀
Tyson got up before the count of 7 by the ref. Probably by 8 or 9 in a regular count anyway.
Can someone please for christ  tell Joe rogan that liveleak doesn't exist anymore?
What the fuck man - wilder was dead after the fifth. It wasn’t great at all. It was damn near negligent by the red to not stop it earlier
Fury's eyes were wide open and clear, so he wasn't that bad off.  And he is going off what he hears, so Joe your kinda starting trouble with that comment in my opinion.
Come on Joe.. u should b better versed in count' protocol .. makes u sound like a newb.
Mike tyson knocked out 44 fighters in his career. Joe Louis and wladmir klitschko had 49 career knockouts. So Wilder's record is not insane. Insane is Fury taking those bombs and getting back up, can anyone knock this guy out? Unlikely since Wilder couldn't and even after the fight Fury looked like he'd just stepped into the ring.
Joe are you auditioning for star trak
Apollo Creed KO. I forget which Rocky
tony is such a douche.... and the fact he didnt watch the fight just confirmed what i thought for years. id always skip tony's and andrew schulz jre's.
I know Joe is not a football fan but the count thing he is talking about is done pretty well by the NFL. The refs stop and start the clock but may be corrected by an official timekeeper. Sometimes by as little as 2 or 3 secs.
fantastic monologue
If you pick up the count, without disruption, Fury gets up at 8. Non issue.
💥Recorded Pfizer saying there is no FDA-approved vaccine available in the US. https://youtu.be/9ZqKJJs9ZnY
Worst fight companion ever!   Also, the world is flat and Jesus is king
Love joe BUT Tyson won no doubt no matter the count
Agree those counts were long and he also pulled Wilder's head down into uppercuts twice that I seen.
Beautiful man Joe rogan you got it figured out you did something right.
Joe Rogan should get arrested for wearing that spacesuit
Been thinking through the last few weeks, wilder usyk is an epic battle of styles
Joe knows fuck all about boxing 💯
Joe gotta stop talking boxing to people who don't know about it. Plus fury was named after tyson so no coincidence
I didn’t like both of these fighters but this fight changed it.
When are you interviewing Steven Donziger?
"He was learning how to box from the time he was a small, small boy." Travellers and Romanichal are well known for bareknuckle boxing like the Travellers in Snatch. Also, he was named after Mike Tyson.
Roburto Duran had both..at one time
Anothony Joshua is also a current great heavy weight
The long count didn't matter. If the ref counted faster, Fury would have gotten up faster.
It's called a 10 count, not a 10 second count Joe.
The count is why boxers take their time to get up.  Apparently the count is at the referrers discretion fair play included tho
If I barely smack my wife it sends a shock wave of fat rolls all the way down to her cancles
Lennox Lewis Joe. Lennox Lewis was a masterful boxer and had one punch ko power. SMH
Can you think of any heavyweight both past and present, who can possibly beat a 6' 9", 277lbs guy who moves like a Lightweight in Fury? 😂  Plus, he's got incredible heart, guts, iron chin, (bodyshot-resistant fat 🤣) and he's master boxer.
Joe didn't just talk about Wilder, Joe was talking about how hard Deontay Wilder hit but at @2:36 Joe Rogan said this about Fury "But the level of skill was so evident. The difference is Tyson Fury is a masterful boxer" then went on to talk about how Tyson Fury's strategy was amazing.
He was named after Mike
I played Black Sabbath at 78 speed?…then what happened?…. I saw god
What's with the space suit
Joe actually talks shit I know this now
If you knock someone down and you don't go to the neutral corner, the count stops until u go there. Joe Rogan didn't know that because his brain is saturated with Kimuras, RNCs, low kicks, triangle chocks.... etc.
At the end of the day this  way a really good fight. Both fighters put a lot in to this fight. That’s what klitchko was missing all those years.
When was the last podcast joe smoked weed on?
People need to stop. Wilder was not in a neutral corner, therefore the count stops until he goes there. Learn the rules
Anybody down talking this fight or either opponent are haters period.   Best trilogy in heavyweight probably since holyfield and boe.
The referee needs to control the count. When you get hit that hard, you have no idea wtf is going on. The boxer needs the visual count from the referee, not to be looking around for some “LED screen”… Also, Joe’s point on the referee’s count being halted because a fighter isn’t in a neutral corner… boxers know they are suppose to go to a neutral corner when a knockdown occurs. The longer they take getting there, the more of an advantage the boxer who went down has. The count is good the way it is in my opinion.
Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson. Plus, both sides of his family had gypsy bareknuckle champions, known as the Gypsy King. Therefore his nickname. The Gypsy King.
boxing is so corrupt not only the judging but the fact that a ref can do his own count rather than having an actual timer start from the time the fighter gets dropped and then counts up to 10 seconds is beyond me
Shilling NASA
Joe is great cause he doesn't ever side or rule anything out. Just open dialog and it's refreshing
Joe is wrong, the ref picks up from where he left off not the time keeper.
Rogan vs. Cenk over 3 rounds is what we want to see
Joe forgot about Joe Lewis..
Earnie Shavers was the only heavyweight in history with one punch knockout power like Wilder.
Can anyone think of an excuse that Wilder and his fans didnt use?
Wilder is not a good boxer. Wilder has fought 38 bums. Only fought 2 top 20 fighters. . Says it all
The greatest! Too big too heavy and too slick for anyone in the history of heavyweight boxing and that’s without mentioning his chin! Embrace every moment with this man cos when he’s gone he’ll never be replaced 🐐
I LOVE YOU JAMIE
I counted during both knockdowns on replays ...... i had to speed count fast to count Fury out during both knockdowns.
Watch Crawford vs indango and see how fast the count was
Love the title. "Joe on Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder 3" Sorry I was confused for a sec, I thought PowerfulJRE was Hinchcliffe's show.
Fury wanted to fight the way Wilder fights. There is no way Fury takes the shot to the head if he didn’t want it. Fury could had run around the ring for 12 round and won. But he didn’t want that. He wanted to prove he beat Wilder at his own game.
The phrase " Guy got hit so hard he's on queer st " Is like a 100 year old line used when a guy gets rocked. Tony's woke buddy couldn't resist to PRETEND it was funny when ya know he's just woke and it grabbed his attention.
Idk joe… I think everyone thought Fury was going to win
Joe rogan doesn't know much about boxing. as old as he is, and as much as he's watched it. he still hasn't got a clue what hes talking about. he especially doesn't understand the rules, nor what wins fights- character, intelligence, will. he doesn't understand that there was no way that fury would ever lose to wilder...because of his character and will is ten times that of wilder. you can try and have a person like Joe understand this by telling them, but they won't ever truly understand because they just dont get it, the real meaning of it all.
Rogan keeps mixing up names and making this a completely different fight. Lol fun listen
Second fight needed to b stop only issue was first fight long count third fight long count one more issue.  Horse hair gloves by fury.
Rules state that you continue the count where you stopped, you don't keep counting. Fury was up in ten seconds anyway
Sorry Joe but you're wrong. Once wilder leaves the neutral corner which he did the count stops until he goes back to neutral corner.
arturo gotti and mickey ward is still some of the most exciting boxing i’ve ever seen.
Who won, Joe!?
Joe mate the refs a hall of famer
Boxing matches have an official timekeeper who starts counting seconds as soon as a boxer is on the ground. At the same time, the referee pauses the fight, sends the other standing boxer to a neutral corner, and then picks up the count from the timekeeper. This is why you usually see the ref start counting at 3 or 4, and not 1.  Once the ref picks up the count, it’s up to them to finish at their pace. For example, if the standing boxer doesn’t stay in their corner then the ref will pause the count to give more time to the fallen boxer as a deterrence.  Notice that it’s called the 10-count rule and not the 10-second rule. The count doesn’t have to be exactly accurate, and it almost never is.  When the count is excessively long, it’s called a slow count or a long count, but it’s not illegal because it’s up to the ref, even if it causes a lot of controversy.
Stop saying he's the hardest puncher look at his opponents not the greatest chins, set ups for knockouts. He's a hard puncher but far from the hardest puncher. Get off his nuts Joe
The British have always  been better at boxing than the yanks.  Its why Americans are so obsessed with guns, the great equaliser.
No Joe, most experienced boxers know that Fury was getting up bc he wasn't that hurt from the knock downs. Then on top of that, we all know that Fury doesn't give up.
Mike Tyson prime vs Tyson Fury Prime, who wins??
They cheated Wilder.
Tyson not a masterful boxer he good but holyfield Lewis or bowe would have beat him no problem
No mistake. I think corruption. I could be wrong.  It was 17 seconds thou
What the fuck?!!!
Joe is so stoned 😂
I make funny content and have to make u laugh or my miget mom will send me to Africa!!
I make funny content and have to make u laugh or my miget mom will send me to Africa!!
I always trust stoned comedians wearing space suits. It's just my thing man
corruption??? f$ck off Joe Rogan, Wilder was beaten not twice but three times by Fury, and he could fight him 100 times and we would get the same result, you, Wilder, and the rest of the USA need to get over the fact that the Heavyweight champion of the world, is from the UK?
If my sister had balls she would be my brother? Good fight fury won! Moving on 😜
Joe Rogan's fascination with the fat with another man glorious fat fascination of Fury lol
10 count isn't seconds.
Stop hyping up wilder. First time he fights a real fighter and he gets destroyed
Deontay sucks
They could atleast have a metronome start when he starts counting at a speed predetermined so the ref is still counting but keeps a rhythm.
By looking in Fury's eyes when he was done, you could see how hurt he was, he looked quite aware.
6:50  Gimmee a break.  I'm pretty sure that Fury would have gotten up at the count of 9 no matter if the ref picked up the count from the ringside.
Mike Tyson claimed the same against Buster Douglas. Long Count
Baked to the gills
They both got up until one did not so that’s what the point is
It's not 10 seconds it's a refs 10 count..
Joe "I know a few of em" Rogan
When I see space suits on JRE I’m in!
Rogan looking like dr evil 😂🤣
Tyson fury was actually named after Mike Tyson, Tyson F said it on Mike Tyson’s podcast great story.
Oh please give me a break .. Tyson was fully conscious when he got knocked down and could of gotten up whenever but just waited. You’re a fucking fool if you watched that fight and didn’t think fury would get up. Specially after that round 12 knock down in the first fight  where he looked like he was out cold , and still got up from the dead  Also . I’ve never seen someone getting so much praise for getting their ass kicked over 3 fights lmao
The count thing,tyson wasn't hurt that bad where he wouldn't make the count though,he took the time giving on purpose,Absalutly had nothing to do with him winning or wilder winning over the count.
Eddie Bravo has to be gritting his teeth if he's watching this episode with Joe wearing a NAZA jacket.   🤣
boxing is the only thing more corrupt than washington, dc
Queenbury rules says the ref picks up the count where he left off.  The ring side count is used initially so the ref can direct the opponent to the furthest neutral corner then pick up the count from ring side but then he controls the count ultimately.  I don't really agree with the rule personally I think it should be 10 seconds but that's what queensbury rules say
DO THE 1 WITH THE PEOPLE WHO GOT CAUGHT SELLING PRIVATE INFO SUBMARINES
People complaining about the long count in this fight are probably the same people who were quiet about the first fight being a draw even tho wilder lost about 10/12 rounds
What about the Wilder count?  The ref was slow for him too
It's a refs 10 count not a 10 second count
Julio cesar chavez 100 and 0
After a knockdown, the fighter who scored the KD has to stay in the corner the ref tells him to go to. If he leaves the corner before the ref restarts the fight, the 10 count is paused, then continued when the fighter gets back in the corner.
I hope Rogan has a deal with Shure microphone. If not I’d cover it up.
Completely wrong ...clearly Mr Rogan doesn't know the rules regarding a count
I'm mad because I fell asleep and missed the fight. The best heavyweight fight of all time was Lennox Lewis vs Vitaly Klitschko in my humble opinion.
How did they let wilder in there with an wild animal. Can't let a puppy in a tiger cage
Imagine being American and talking about he count when Fury has beaten him 3 times. Absolute weapons.
The reff was on a slow count when wilder went down too, so yeah he was slow, but he was slow both ways
Joe Rogan is extremely biased towards Tyson Fury 🤣 like get dudes nuts out of your mouth man. Acting like an analyst for CNN and shit lol
The corruption from fury is so unlikely considering he got robbed in the first fight
Tyson’s dad named him after Mike. He was a boxer. It’s not an accident that a guy named Tyson Fury is heavyweight champion.
jab backhand hold, jab backhand hold, jab backhand hold... for 11 fucking rounds = one of the greatest HW fights of all time...................the fuck outta here
Tyson Fury’s parents actually did name him after Mike Tyson
What a disgrace Duncan not being there to wear the Nasa Suit but i guess Tony and Redban are a Compromise.
No such thing as a mistake
Because he was named after Mike Tyson his dad was a huge boxing fan and if I am not mistaken was also a heavyweight boxer himself.
Like ALMOST DIDNT MATTER!!!!!
Boxig is easy to learn- World class boxing is the difference between Fury. His inside fighting is as good as it gets- in any era. People rave over Usyk's 'footwork' cos everyone else does- that footwork aint  gonna mean shit against a guy like Fury- just like it didnt against Chisora. These two dont know shit about boxing. Andy why would they- MMA is a diff sport.
Fury headbutted that punch. If he didn't he'd a been out like a light. It increased the impact (probably cracked his skull, massive shockwave of backfat, mitigated by the padded gloves) but reduced the backwards acceleration of the head (that's what causes concussion, the brain sloshing around). He's a hard bastard.
Hey guys. We must say we love your work. It sounds like you didn't like the fight because of the fact that Wilder lost. An American mindset ... Why even talk about time and corruption when we all know every sport has corruption whether we like it or not. It was a great fight but Wilder didn't show respect as a sportsman when Fury went to congratulate him. Unfortunately we followed every detail before and after the fight started. We believe Wilder is overrated because of his punching power. After saying what he said to Tyson after the fight... We know now he is a child. A view from a different point of understanding. Don't get me wrong Joe, we love your work and feel it brings out feelings from within
No one is teaching Deonte shit at this point. He had 2 years for this fight, it gave him round 1 with boxing and the rest he did his usual bullshit
Crazy part too is im most certain wilder had a broken hand early. Im pretty sure i heard it snap in round 2 iirc. Epic fight regardless.
The rule days this on boxing... “Keep an eye on the standing boxer and make sure he stays in neutral corner. If boxer comes out, stop the count, put boxer back into neutral corner and then resume counting.”
In the first fight, you can tell Tyson's soul is outside his body until the four count. But damn! The amount of will it takes to get up...
Only reason there was a 3rd fight was due to biased judges and yet Joe complains about counting lol, the best fighter one
One man dominated this trilogy - what's your point Joe!
Joe Rogan doesn't know boxing rules.  It's a ten count, not a ten second count.  If the fighter isn't in the neutral corner then the count stops.  Fury was looking at the referee and waiting as long as he could.  You can't call that a long count.
If me auntie had bollocks, she'd be me uncle.   Tyson wins 💥
Fuck no corrales vs Castillo way better shit Gatti Ward was even better not mention Hagler herns Ali Frazier I can think of another 12 other fights I put ahead of this one. This was okish
A legit conspiracy kigwahhahahahaha
Boxing rules require the timekeeper, after a knockdown, to immediately begin calling off the seconds, indicating the count with a motion of his arm. After ordering the other boxer to a neutral corner, the referee is to pick up the count from the timekeeper, indicating it with a motion of his arm.  "Once the ref picks up the count, that's the official count," referee Mills Lane, who regularly works fights in Nevada, told the Associated Press.
Tyson Fury…named after Mike by his dad Big John Fury from the Fury clan one of the greatest Irish fighting family’s ever..not chance..destiny was being created from the day he was born..fighting ☘️ Ireland 🇮🇪
I was thinking the same thing I saw a fight where the count was on the loud speaker
Joe "Let me see that fat ripple again" Rogan
I thought fury was faking the knockdown. Trying to make it more dramatic. The way he gets backup so easily makes me really question at. Even in the 1st fight..... The man is the gypsy king and he knows how to play the game.
What are the odds he would b called that? He was named after mike tyson. He was born to fight, his whole family were fighters... what a stupid thing to say
his father was a Mike Tyson super fan he named him after Mike Tyson because he knew he would be a boxing champion the day he was born its not a coincidence it's fate it's destiny it's just the way of the world and the people in it
Fury could have fought 24 rounds, Wilder was done in 3. I wish us Brits and Irish could have travelled over, the atmosphere would have been amazing.
That ref has a long history of bs in his record. Really he shouldn't be a ref with that many mistakes.
An astronaut and....an inmate?
The odds are higher than you’d think considering he was named after Mike Tyson and comes from a boxing family 🤷🏻‍♂️
Fury is better…..
It was human error at the heat of the moment
I always thought 10 counts were like strike zones in MLB... Every official has a unique technique
emanual steward would b perfect for wilder  RIP
Suddenly they the boxing experts how to ref 😂😂😂
Wilder would destroy Joshua with the Mega Punch and Joshua's glass jaw.
I think Joe is scared of Deontay Wilder because hes always trying to butter him up in some kind of way and discredit Tyson Fury.
And this is going to be found on the hunter biden laptop computer?
I think the greatest thing about Fury v Wilder is the fact that Fury will cheerfully fight him again, and again, and again.  He said so himself, that he’d beat him as many times as he’d keep coming back.  Fury is from a fighting culture literally multiple generations old.  Fighting is as natural as breathing to him.  That’s an underrated aspect of what’s made him unbeatable.
Delay mega punch 👊 : Mr. Satan DBZ
Ok, so the question ive always wanted Joe to discuss and debate, is who's the bigger puncher Wilder or Francis Ngannou?? Ive always wondered...one side of says Wilder given that he does his damage with bigger more padded gloves..but another side of leans towards Francis adding his massive size + power in comparison to Wilder's size...so fight fans what do you think?
Joe Rogan shows how stupid is! Greatest boxing match of all time those guys didn't box a single minute it was just Haymakers the whole f****** time! I didn't see any boxing I don't know what fight Joe slogan was watching?
They don't advertise the weed smoking now that hes in Texas
This guys don’t know the count tule , it’s not a 10 second count, it’s not mma where they literally don’t care about the fighters health
What the fuck you waffling on about the count for joe ,like WTF ,There was fuck all wrong with the count ,Fury new exactly what he was doing !Theres only one Tyson Fury!🥊👑🇬🇧
As much as i like joe rogan  its like we're living in an altered world Wilder doesnt have basic boxing skills in 3 fights he won 2 rounds. This is the worst trilogy in the history of boxing!
Super Saiyan shock punch ✊✊✊
So Joe says he doesn't fully know if the rules change at heavy weight and doesn't know perfect the rules but then says there is only 2 options that it could be 1. Cheating 2. Mistake  How about...... 3. Joe in fact does not know fully the rules as much as he thinks
Talking shit here, Fury was still up before the 10 count no matter how you look at it. Long count?? , Rogans acting like it was 14 seconds.
Joe & Cormier is wrong about the count. The rule is the ref stops the count until opponent goes to neutral corner
Joe had same conspiracy in first fight
and it absolutely didn't matter that Fury came in fatter and slower then he ever has been lol. I'm actually shocked that Joe is so impressed by Wilder when he was a one trick pony that got lucky with genetics. Either way, I highly doubt an American boxing ref is going to intentionally help a boxer from the UK beat up another American...
The fighter follows the refused count to guage when to get up. Secondly, if you follow an ordinary count from the point he goes down to when he gets up he beats a ten second count. And lastly there are rules instructing the refs to stop the count and then resume if the knocker does not go to a neutral corner or exits it.
I think people feel so bad for wilder that they created controversy. It's always a different cheat accusation just admit you can't beat fury and move on.
Finally i was waiting for Joe's opinion he really needs to do fight companions on big fights.
How can we tolerate what is being done to our country. Apparently we need to gather in large groups with torches and pitch forks and go to all government offices and take control of our country again.
Joe ‘I pander to racist Wilder fans’ Rogan
Fury dug spiritually deep where only God gives one strength 💪 to rise from bottom. It's his understanding with the Lord he puts his faith to Philippians 4:6-7, 4:13 Jeremiah  29:11. DOWN BUT NOT YET OUT
Fury was down from the 17 second mark. When Fury got up the refs was talking and fury walked away and he said come here. Fury had no idea where he was at when he first got up.
Wilder also had a long count. And Fury count wasn't long it was 9 sec. He could have got up sooner but he looked at the count of the ref.
Even though Tyson fury was in fact hurt from the big punch, both of his knockdowns came as a result of being pushed down from the back of the head by wilder.  Specifically the second knockdown.
Actually regarding the count that is not the rules. The rules state: “Keep an eye on the standing boxer and make sure he stays in neutral corner. If boxer comes out, stop the count, put boxer back into neutral corner and then resume counting.”
Wilder is zero wins 3 losses to Fury... TILL THIS DAY!
Slow count my balls, he was up before the 8 anyway...
The count stops when the ref needs to send the other fighter to the corner.
Joe, I love you mate but ease of on doobies. You should know better the rules: it is not 10 seconds but a count to 10 and the ref has to stop the count if the other boxer leaves the designated corner. You're clearly in awe of wilder (fellow american and all) so you end up spouting opinions rather than facts. Gonna give a thumb down on this one, sorry.
The count BS is cause Wilder did not go to a neutral corner
Feel so good having two white men as champions again
Awesome break down
It’s a shame that the only way I watch Rogan anymore is short clips via YouTube. Ahhh Nostalgia. Fuck Spotify I refuse to submit
The bad call in the 4th is total trash. For starters, Fury wasn't out. He was fully awake, aware and able to fight on. He just chose to take the full length of the count to gather himself. All of this controversy surrounds a video that claims the count was 13-14seconds long, so 3-4 seconds longer than usual, but doesn't factor in the fact that they were counting from the point where Tyson was hit and falling, not fallen and out for the count. Also, didn't factor in the time it took the ref to tell Wilder to get into a neutral corner. Disregarding the fact that Tyson was up before the refs 10 count anyway, so what does it matter.
Wtf is up with outfits?
Wilder stumbled when he was walking towards the ref and he let it go on lol.
WILD VS FURY!!.👊
At 11:20 joe is soo baked
I am now completely positive that Joe has something for big, muscular blq guys.
Fat shaming fury
U think after all his knockout's u think he known to run to the neutral coner , every cont ,conts... Would have won the first fight , in stead of prancing about ring. It's how it's been 4 ever
Hey! They are out the red tube studio!
Joe. There are people in boxing that have more than 41 KO's. Julio Cesar Chavez is just 1 example. 84 KO'S!!  Mayweather isn't even close to this legend!!!
Isnt this guy big trump supporter. Like racist
You are wrong
I got a contact high just by watching this!! Thank you Joe!!
Joe is full of shit. And someone teach him to dress. Guess he thinks Wilder lost because he didn't take DMT and elk meat before the fight.
Joe needs to learn more about Boxing rules. Jesus Christ. Talking about corruption when it's the rules. Well done misinforming millions of people.
Wilder is 2-1 and is the winner 💯💯💯💯
It's hard. Because Fury outclasses Wilder so much, but, now twice wilder has knocked fury out but had the count stolen from him. Fury is definitely better. He definitely won. But the red stole it from wilder 2 times. 2nd fight his equilibrium was shot.
I feel like I'm missing some context but why are they wearing space suits?
12:40 Let's be real here. Wilder is 6'6" and Fury is 6'7.5"
I've been waiting for this!
Not that big of deal
Glad to see Joe Rogan brought back one of his favourite sayings.
Always watching alone 😎📺😁💪 greetings from the Northern Peruvian Amazon Jungle 🌴🌴🌴
Stick to ufc joe...
Can only believe my lying eyes but I saw him resume on 6 and by 8 , Tyson was ready to go again ?  I’ll have to watch it back .  Tyson dipping that left hook then clocking him with a right was the highlight for me. Sad to see wilder not having the endurance to keep up with the gypsy king .
Joe talks a lot of 💩 here I couldn’t listen to it all
Yea joe is ignorant of the 10 count rules and yes he is a wilder fangirl but he did say fury Is a masterful boxer which is about the best thing you can say about a boxer
Definitely talk boxing with the biggest, most closeted man? Ever.
He's wrong. The ref that officiated the first fight, explains why they count the way that they do. You can find that video on YouTube. They count them out if they are out, if they are aware, if they look them in the face, they are already reading the fighters body language. The reason he isn't counting super quick, Tyson is looking at him, he's not limp, so he's going to get up once he hits 7 whether that's a moment slow or quick. More importantly than the count is that body language, and then whether they have strength when they check that, then they make them turn and take a step, if they can't do any of that, if they are slurry, the fight is over. The count really isn't what is important, everything else tells them if the fight should continue. They ask themselves if the fighter can defend themselves intelligently. Then they make a decision. The ref is right, we have hindsight, and Fury went on to win. Clearly he could still fight. He did the same thing for Wilder. He didn't the last time because, body language and his eyes, he was out as out gets, fight over. Joe acts like he's officiated fight. An actual expert says he is wrong.
When you cant knock out everyone you better learn to box
The referee should absolutely be in charge of the count. This isn't MMA. Boxing people will understand the count.
People already went over the rule and it was Wilder's fault and the ref had every right to pick up where he left off because wilder didn't want to be in a neutral corner
You know you are deep into martial arts when you call rules “laws” lol
Fury vs Usyk is the fight to make. Would like Wilder to K.O. AJ also.
Oh my life  the suite was to heavy  the water was poisoned  the count was long  what piss poor losers  you still sticking with wilder getting a draw in the first fight. Was this one of your errors or was it corrupt  for me. Fury 3 Wilder 0
Watch the fight highlights, regardless of the Referees slow count, Tyson is up on his feet by 8 seconds for the first knockdown, and just after 9 seconds for the second one. Even more importantly, it's obvious Tyson uses every second given to him by the Ref before he stands up, if the Ref were counting faster, he'd have been up faster, no doubt.
Id argue he never made it back from 2nd fight. Put on weight for 1st time, if he believed 2nd fight wasnt lopsided he wouldnt felt need to add weight. Was lookin for confidence anywhere but Fury owned him.
Yeah but the only one who can communicate directly with the fighter ( who has just being knocked down), is the ref....
Seems like somehow Joe knows when he needs a podcast like this. And he delivered
So Joe has watched boxing long time, but don't know shit still.
I disagree usain bolt is the greatest sports name of all time
Not to mention Fury is an undefeated title holder is record holding statistics!!!
In boxing, referee's count is not the same as second count.
Wilder had longer time before Tyson did. So unfortunately you're flat out wrong guys. Overall the fight was as fair as fair can get, and even though the ref has all power in the ring people who don't know wtf they're talking about like to throw as much shit at the wall praying something would stick when their "Guy" gets his ass whipped.  Tyson Fury beat Wilder again fair and square. Wilder just cannot compete with Fury, big fckn deal that's how boxing is supposed to be.
Fun fact Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson
“Fury” and “Wilder” are 2 very coincidental last names for 2 of the greatest heavyweights
Love that ‘pillow fists’ delivers the most devastating KO to the so-called most devastating KO artist in history.   Fury massively underrated
a group of guys wearing nasa jumpsuits are calling someone else crazy
Love how mentions how good wilder would be if he was good with his feet , what a warrior etc , and saying fury had way to long on the floor , but doesn’t bring the fact wilder walked out of the ring and didn’t want to congratulate fury , what a sore loser from a previous champion .
Joe Rogan doesn't know the rules of boxing...
I saw about 40 minutes the day after on YouTube. I was entranced. I had one of my earbuds in and my wife was pissed at me for ignoring her. Haven't seen boxing that good since the 90s
PS the counter outside the ring got to 4 be4 the referee picked up on the count then he stopped to tell Wilder to go to his neutral corner this excuse has already been debunked u just have to want to see the truth not to lie that u wanted it to be
The rules on the count are not quite as Joe describes. The ringside counter starts the count the moment the fighter hits the floor. The ref then syncs with him and picks up the count. From that moment on, it's up to the ref how quickly he counts, depending on many factors. Contrary to popular belief, it's never meant necessarily to be a ten second count, but simply a ten count.
The PPV numbers were half what they expected because nobody cares about boxing since Logan Paul took a huge moist dump on the sport
Tyson Fury, Usain Bolt, two best names ever
is name is lucas. he named himself tyson after mike. fyi
Tyson was named after Mike... and with his genes there was always a fair chance he'd be a heavyweight boxer... but a legend though? That's something else.
counts werent long, Fury still was up before 10 secs both times so it didn't matter
Wish they had talked about Jake Paul and tommy fury , and Tyson fury saying if tommy can’t beat jake he might have to change his name and the bet between Jake and tommy where tommy has to legally change his name to tommy fumbles for a year if he loses to Jake.
Ive got a haunch Joe might have bet on Deontay😂
He was named after Mike
Jesus christ Joe couldn't be anymore obvious he doesn't like fury.  jesus.
That kind of count happens in championship fights.
So Joe Rogans shirt.......🙄
Wilder < Paul from Tekken punch
Wilder lost pure n simple stop spreading bull shit con spiracy theorys
It would have been a bad count if Wilder would have been in his neutral corner but since he wasn't the referee has to by regulation make him go his respective corner during that count
It’s not an error to ask a boxer to return to the neutral corner, it’s the rules. It happens all the time- right back to Dempsey v Tunney. How does Rogan know so little about boxing?
Joe trying to spark controversy over a count and two knockdowns. Joe just mad Deontay got his ass whooped a 3rd time. Deontay stalled the fight and changed gloves that weren't the 3 that he issued. Fury knocked his ass down 3 times and Wilder was saved by the bell on 4 different occasions. Just wait until November. Canelo will have 58 wins and 39 by knockout after he's done with Plant making him Pound for Pound on every title of his division
Fury was ready to get up at any time during the second time he was down he was just watching the ref waiting taking as much time as possible
One sided analysis, absolute rubbish. Seriously need to check yourself Rogan.
It’s not a 10 second count, it’s the referees discretion especially when the opponent doesn’t go to the neutral corner. This is actually in the rules and regulations of boxing.
Joe Rogan best MMA commentator ever
Spent 10 mins talking about how good wilder is instead of just appreciating tyson fury who really is the whole package... seems biased towards wilder
Just usual fight, nothing special
Joe is spot on in regards to the count. A perfect solution for the problem.
Much respect to these fighters, however, Wilder, such a devastating power puncher but, if he actually knew how to box, he could be so much more dangerous. Also, I strongly agree with Joe with the counting. Boxing should have another method for counting for when boxers go down. Many boxers have been screwed because of that.... famously Mike Tyson, when he lost his first fight, against Buster Douglas.
In the boxing rule book, if the other boxer isn't in their corner the count stops until they go back to the corner. Thats why they don't just have a regular clock, it would be insanely easy to fix but its not that straightforward
The count thing is bullshit. Ref counted slow for wilder as well
THANK YOU JOE for being you and not giving in to the mainstream. Love you for that brother!!!! That's what makes you special.
It is not 10sec count , check it.
It wasn't a long count. There's a video showing all the knockdowns from the ringside and you can hear the ringside count and the ref picks up the count correctly. Even simpler count it yourself. Fury gets up at around 6 or 7 both times. Move along. Nothing to see here.
The is boxer in Snatch Tyson Fury?
His dad names him after Mike Tyson and the whole family legacy is boxing so it's not that much of a coincidence 🙄
Fury was watching the count he would have got up at 8 either way mate
Tyson Fury is not his Christian name you dopes lMAO I thought my weed is strong
Cmon joe you’re letting yourself down here. I watched it live too and u apply the same count the wilder and the ref was consistent with both fighters. The best guy won and it was a great fight.
I like Joe but any real boxing fan knew Fury was going to win this fight and it best be the last time it happens for a good while because Wilder has no right to a title fight in the immediate future.
Tyson Fury isn't his real name...but still one hell of a boxer.
Kelly Pavlic??
The best fighter won.end of
There’s a different rule if the other fighter doesn’t immediately go to the neutral corner the count doesn’t start watch the extra time wilder got on the first knockdown bc he held fury’s legs
Do seconds count when you get rocked, yes they do. Did Fury win? Yes he did.
Ngannou vs Wilder in boxing. Make it happen Dana
So what’s up with the space suit’s…?
wilder one trick pony
The problem too with the counts is that the fighter getting up hears the guy in front of him. So you can’t count to the side and then skip 3 numbers and the fighter who is delirious is like wtf!   The key is that the ref needs to stay counting the entire time. Consistent. I don’t agree with the LCD screen. It’s like taking calls away from reds in baseball. It’s a thing. And part of boxing is the relationship between the boxer getting up and the guy counting in front of him. Fury may well have been fine at 7, but he has to be able to hear it.
The WBC ruling for a count is exactly what happened. The ref picks up the count were he left off. End of story. The ref also did the same for Wilder when he went down. He stopped the count and continued when Fury was in the neutral corner.
Have more than 500 pounds combined ever fought in a heavyweight championship fight?
Coulda shoulda woulda... MMA fights get stopped for nothing sometime, look up the refs recent video: "I made the right decision".
The count was long!
Wilder is not that good. He fought a bunch of nobodies for most of his career. His endurance is weak too.
10 count should be like a shot clock and the turn buckles light up at 10.
Joe yur wrong a refs count is his count only, nothing to do with ring side, a ref can take 15 seconds to count to a real 10 seconds if he wants and nobody can do anything about it, its the refs count only how ever he sees fit and how ever long it takes and thats it, fury’s not stupid he’s not going to jump straight up he’s gonna chill there till the last few seconds because why not if he can there’s no rush
Tyson did get up in 10 actual seconds if you time it with a watch from when he goes down
You can count to 100 and I would'nt have  gotten after the first ko
He got hit HOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRDDDDDD
He did talk shit Joe!@ hahaha. Wtf this dude even talking about with his "touched her shoulder "
Wilder is Not a boxer... He can just punch hard
Wilder got his ass kick, this fight was not as close any Joe makes it out to be...Wilder was punched over 150 times
No Joe. People knew Fury had a chance to come back because he proved it in the first fight.
I need both jackets
So i guess jaime wasn’t invited to joes watching party😂
Reffing in this match was some of the best boxing reffing I’ve ever seen. He just let them box and work in the clinch, ref was remarkable
Fury takes the full 10 count. Wilder gets up instantly like he’s embarrassed
You're right the ref is guilty of something. The ref is guilty of following the rules. Wilder got extra time to get up does anybody mention that? No, you turn a great fight into a conspiracy theory. The ref followed the rules there was no error. The other point is fury was fully conscience staring at the refs count. It's just absurd to have Wilder fans cry afoul every time he takes an l. It always has to be a conspiracy not that the better man won convincingly 3 times.
Best  boxing heavyweight Champion fight in the last 20 years!
I feel Joe overrates fighters sometimes. Deontay is one of the best champions for sure but his power doesn't seem like the sledgehammer people made it out to be in my opinion. Mike Tyson, Rocky Marciano, Razor Ruddock, Roberto Duran, Sonny Liston, Jack Dempsey ect were known as hard hitters for sure.
The ref counts to ten, how fast he wants. Nobody has to continue counting for him!?
Even with the count fury was still there he would've got regardless just another excuse for Wilder
because wilder was not in his corner he staled the count. which is legit wilder needed to be in his corner
YES!!!! THE NASA OUTFITS!
Imagine being that one guy in the room not having watched the fight.
13:32... Julio César Chávez has 86 W by knockout
8:14 I think tony is thinking of Japanese Pro Wrestling. Traditionally it’s a 20 count for a count out (out side of the ring), and the ref has his own count, but the ring announcer mimics the count on the microphone for the audience.
Joe "look at the fat ripple" rogan.
Bull shit , the counting was good and any changes gonna destroy the boxing
One of Deontay's counts was also slow but as he lost we don't talk about it...
Too bad Rogan is wrong about the counting rule
I wonder if all 3 fights were in the UK the result would be different
Incorrect the count pauses when the opponent is not in his corner. The referee was brilliant and professional
Tyson Fury was in fact named after Mike Tyson.
One of the greatest boxing matches of all time? Shit. Not even top ten heavyweight fights. Not even top 100 fights of all time. It was mostly mediocre. Joe Rogan is a fucking moron.
After izzy vs Jan ... I just can't trust Joe anymore with the " he's hurt" thing....
Wilder is not on Tyson's level. He got skooooled.
Joe Rogan is wrong about the referee's count.  The unified rules of boxing state "“Keep an eye on the standing boxer and make sure he stays in neutral corner. If boxer comes out, stop the count, put boxer back into neutral corner and then resume counting.”  Wilder was moving around the ring.  The referee stopped the count, told him to go to the neutral corner, then resumed the count.  He did it by the book. Blame Wilder for the long count, he's the idiot who didn't follow the rules.
Sorry joe you are wrong about the count .. the ref has to tell the other fighter to go to the neutral corner , then the ref continues  the count .. No one else involved . And it’s not 10 seconds it’s a 10 count …. Joe I’m disappointed in you being a man of combat sport not knowing this ..
The sloppiest, most horrible heavyweight fight that I have seen in a long time.  They looked like two amateurs trying to survive the entire fight.
These guys are part of the Real Life Squid Games lol!! Hahaha
Boxing is corrupt WBC is corrupt.ask canlo🤣🤣🤣
Wilder was obviously on PEDs for this fight
Love the show but it's not a ten second count in boxing, it's a ten count to judge if the fighter is good to continue. That said, I wish he would of gone back and actually timed it as he was up within 10 again seconds anyway!! Shame to bring that up and not Wilders lack of respect as that was the very real and non made up and only let down of the fight. Great outfits though Joe lol classic
Actually the world boxing federation rule is if the opposing fighter leaves a neutral corner than the ref will stop the count redirect that fighter to the corner and continue the count where it was interrupted
Hardest hitter of all time.... 3 fights, hit him with his best shots and couldn't knock him out. Watch some Mike Tyson fights Joe.
In fairness, Furry was staring right at the ref, waiting for him to hit 8 before getting up
I find Hinchcliffe annoying...🤷
Fury got knocked down in 4th Round with 17 seconds on clock (0:17 when his forearm was on ground), and stood up with 2 seconds remaining. That is 15 seconds which is 7 extra seconds. You can check this by looking at the clock when he falls down and gets up again. Stop talking about how wonderful Fury is, he was beaten fare and square by Wilder. Boxing is corrupt, too much money.
He as named after Mike Tyson.
Can I ask why they are wearing space suits? Does that mean they getting high as fuk
Wilder has fought nobody’s his whole career
The point everyone is missing is that it’s a 10 count, not a 10 second count.
Entertaining fight but it was not close. Fury dominated all three fights. Holyfield vs Bowe trilogy will remain the best trilogy IMO
Yeah he knocked out 41 guys. But who did he out.. Ortiz and who else??
all you race fans are mad Rogan is giving props to wilder? How sad go cry 😭 😂
11:13 The left didn't miss. Stop bulshitting.
It would be a bucket list choice to watch a good fight, live, with Joe rogan
I've been waiting to hear Joe talk about this fight!!
Fury is a boxer, wilder is a puncher with a huge right hand but everything else is subpar compare to Fury. Wilder has not really a footwork, defense, his offense he swings so wide. He has heart and that god given gift right hand. Also fury is huge so he always let you hold his weight in the clinch
41 ko’s , around 40 bums fought
Not an error on the counting, every ref does the same thing
Japanese boxing with Chinese words?
In a country that has such rich boxing history, it is shocking how little people know about the sport this 10 count is not controversial, it happens in a ton of fights. It's explained in the comments here, I would expect Joe to know this. He is giving wilder way to much credit here, other than rounds 1 and 4 wilder had nothing, if you want a decent break down go to Teddy Atlas youtube channel.
ay joe, u eating too many cockroach?
The Japanese will do a countout in pro wrestling when they get thrown out of the ring (Minute 8:15)
like some people can’t be taught power - some people can’t be taught how to box
Rogan has gone to shit
Joe looking like Dr Evil
As a boxing fan it is hard to listen to these unqualified casuals talk about this fight
It seems like Wilder was missing leg-day for several years or his entire life. He is constantly out of balance and once he gets a bit of punishment his feet are instantly gone. completely gone. He was on wobbly feet for the majority of the fight. I don't understand why his trainer or staff didn't recognize that weakness and finally made him train his legs. Its probably too late for him to learn proper footwork but at least make sure you stay on steady feet.
It's really frustrating that such a popular podcast would further this nonsense about the "long" count.  Read the rules, as someone has aptly shown below.  Furthermore, even if you went by this start the clock when Fury hits the ground on the second knockdown, he was up within the 10 seconds.
waited for this for a fair analysis, just for joe to give excuses… guess a american is a american 🧂’y boy
Are we really carrying water for Wilder's bullshit and his fans' racism?  Like fuck off. Fury was perfectly aware of the count, and was not in danger of going out. He was using all the time that he wanted in order to recover. The count here was inconsequential to the results of the fight.
He was named after Mike Tyson.
No mention of the no count for the Wilder knock down and no knock down call when Wilder took a knee.
So we all acknowledge that fury only won because the ref turned a 20 second fall into a eight count…….. if the ref did his job correctly it’s over in the fourth. Wilder was robbed period.
Bruhhh when is theo gunna be back onnn
'Look at that fat ripple.. Look at that Fat roll down'... 😂😂😂
Yo people watch king of the travellers Bartley Gorman, Bartley was king of the UK gypsies and is a close relative to Tyson, Wider a great boxer but this shit is in Tysons blood.
Wilder had 2 extended counts also joe
I remember hearing the name Tyson Fury, and I honestly thought it was a stage name it sounded so good.
Arrrrghhhh!  How many ppl don't understand the ten count? IT'S NOT TEN SECONDS!!!
Rogan should interview these two, they still alive and kicking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJu5PdK2314
Rematch it like the saints 2020 it was corruption
Tyson wasn't badly hurt and waited for the count of  8 - 9 before getting up it's not 10 seconds it's the count of 10 there was no long count stu what's wrong with you people.
Big John Mccarthy explained it himself. The rules state: “Keep an eye on the standing boxer and make sure he stays in neutral corner. If boxer comes out, stop the count, put boxer back into neutral corner and then resume counting.” Joe is right in that when the knockdown first happens the ref picks up the count from the ringside counter if needed. But if the count is interrupted part way through by a fighter leaving the neutral corner then the ref stops the count, tells him to return, then picks up where he left off. This rule is to keep fighters in the neutral corner or they risk giving their opponent more time to recover. Its the simplist and best way to ensure a fighter conforms to the rules, if they don't they are effectively punished by a long count for their opponent.
To think Joe Rogan understands boxing lol.
Tony is thinking of Japanese wrestling.
Same thing happen to Mike Tyson in buster Douglas fight Referee slow count referee with the white gloves on outside of ring keep up with count … Something like that can take the fight out you knowing…anybody can be brought anybody can bet…
They are exactly right about the count  Mike Tyson beat buster Douglas Cause the ref didn’t continue the count of the ringside count  Douglas had 13-14 seconds to get up That’s nobody gives AF about it
fury was no way out in the 4th - any boxer would make the most of the referees count - regardless if the count was quicker fury would have been up in time - he just made the most of what was given to him - wilder got given extra time when the doctor stepped in during the start of a round - end of day Fury fully deserved his win
Yeah it almost didn’t matter! Out of a possible 36 rounds wilder won a maximum of 6 at best! Yeah almost
Joe your the goat man
Funny pants😂
The difference was that in the 2nd fight Wilder had 0 offense, He was taking punches non stop so they threw the towel in. In this fight he was still dangerous even when he was battered and fatigued
Can we see ngannou v wilder
YouTube 402nd knowledge seekers workshop the first UFO has been released(tic tac)can fly from one point to another anywhere on this planet in 5 or less minutes and 2 of them are takeoff and landing out in space can fly faster than light(by order of magnitude)seats four people and inside it projects field energy like the intestines or 3 layers of the skin so you don’t have to eat or drink they’re showing 2 other devices that look like tanning beds one stands vertical that basically puts a biological spacesuit on you(alien depictions)to be suited for where ever you choose to land in the universe a horizontal one that can repair every cell in your body to return you to how you were in the womb of the mother,the exhibition centre where you can see and learn about them is in Linz Austria Germany.
Even if it was a 'slow' count, he got up within 10 seconds
U know what...I am just glad Wilder congratulated Fury online even though he doesn't deserve it...but, as long as it makes Fury and his fans sleep at night? Then good...Let them have it..they need a win..they desperate for a win even when it entailed overlooking banning a glove cheat regardless of the effect of a "near bare knuckle/horse hair fisting" on Wilder in fights 1 & 2 & 3.. Fury is great! Fury wins! He is the GOAT! ALL hail for the GOAT
I has never been a 10 second count.  Wilder should have known what the f to do. Fury was ready to get up anyway.
The first time Tyson dropped u can see he slipped watch his foot now the second one was bad
Wilder messed up by bulking up. He was gassed out by the 3rd
I didn’t think it was over either joe arrest me
Fury dusted the shit out those feathers boyeeee
Tyson Fury was born 3 months premature and weighed 1 pound. When they finally though he was going survive, his father named him after Mike Tyson and the doctor supposedly said "that's a terrible idea because he would grow up to be a big man"... Look at him now. Much respect to Wilder.
Joe is clearly thrilled; I got to see it!
Rogan needs to get Fury and Wilder back on his podcast, and try to get them both on together. That would have been something. Gotta appreciate both fighters :-)
1:54 Joe WAS MAKING SURE he didn't get canceled! Gave a whole history lesson on the word queer🤣🤣
the boxer when he goes down ,,,,,,,,,he watches the ref for the count.........he's been stunned...and decides what tie to get up for best rest.......if u make it auto where does the boxer look,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and its a 10 count not a 10 sec count from ref.......his judgement
Please sue CNN!!! Please sue CNN!!! Please sue CNN!!!
Deontay Wilder lost this third fight cause he was already 76 years old, but some people who know him very well say that he is really 137 year’s old. Deontay Wilder is known for lying about his age.
Joe, you're wrong here. Both Deontay and Fury got counts longer than 10 precise seconds. In fact, most (if not ALL) boxing counts are over 10 seconds. I don't think I've ever seen a count that was under 10 seconds. Either way, Wilder benefited from plenty of recovery time as well. They even sent in the doctor to examine Wilder in the beginning of a round when he had been badly hurt the previous round just to buy him time. The claim that this is curruption on Fury's part is complete BS. In the first knockdown in the 3rd round, Wilder got exactly 14 seconds to recover before the round was resumed. Does that mean the fight is corrupt? Of course not. Go back and watch any knockdown and time it. I guarantee you that it is around 10-14 seconds before the round continues.
are you guys doing sober October
Corruption or you could do the research of the rules. Just sayin…. Love ya joe but that’s a bs take when ya don’t know the rules.
Ya Joe ru forgetting about the long count with Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson?
Anybody know where the full fight will be uploaded? Will it be ESPN+? HBO?
God, here we go again. The long count, the horsehair in the gloves, excuses, excuses.   It's getting really tiresome. Give it a rest.
Hey man, I think the ref did a good job. Honestly, I didn’t care who won the fight, but Mike Tyson got screwed by something like this. Honestly Fury just flat won the fight. If the PA was calling out the count, he’d have gotten up. I just think Fury wins, 10 out of 10 times. The first fight wasn’t a draw, the second fight was an ass kicking. This fight, though unbelievable was reasonably one sided though probably one of my favorite fights of all times
About the count.... just look at Fury during the count. He is ready to get up and looks at the referee who holds his fingers in front of him and screams: FIVE.... SIX.... he is ready at FIVE to stand up but he waits until 8 to get  3 seconds of extra rest to make sure his legs are ready. Fighters often make the mistake and standup too early... at THREE or whatever and their legs are still completely gone. You can't blame Fury at all. Whatever the Ref tells him... he is gonna react accordingly and take the 8 count. Only look at Fury during both knockdowns and you will see that he was literally waiting for the referee to get to 8 before standing up.
Why there is no consistent count on a big screen in boxing is beyond me.
Tyson Fury is a name that’s as good as Usain Bolt.
theres no set count pace so thinking someone else outside the ring could pick up the count the same pace as the refs is silly in its self. wilder should have went ot hi corner and tried to show boat.
I didn't watch the fight but the fact that Wilder won makes a rematch really compelling, thanks for such great analysis Joe!
wilder was knocked down in 3rd round and the counting lasted 15 seconds ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSxLVPa1u-k
First I watched in a while, fckn great
Tyson fury is named after Mike Tyson , he was born premature and nearly died at birth .....Come on Tony & more Joe you should know this Sheeeet !!
Joe "look at that fat roll down" Rogan.
Joe doesn't know shit about boxing
Rogan acts like he knows what he’s talking about regarding the count and the time keeper. He couldn’t be more wrong and someone should correct him. The time keeper only comes into play on the initial knockdown. The ref tells the other fighter to go to neutral corner and picks up the count from the time keeper, which he did. That’s why the count starts at 4. Then wilder left the neutral corner and at 5 the ref per the rules stops the count and puts wilder back in the neutral corner and then resumes the count at 6. The time keeper is only a factor on the initial knock down. But because wilder left the neutral corner in the middle of the count the count was paused. This is text book and this referee did it perfectly. Rogan is a Jack ass who pretends to know shit he doesn’t know and says it with authority
His dad named him after Mike Tyson, which cuts into the odds somewhat. Glad to see Tony back on!
It's not a coincidence he's named Tyson though
It’s a 10 count not ten secs
This podcast was so boring.  Yikes
I love that jacket!!! Want one. Badly!
I was definitely on my feet during yelling and going crazy during this fight. Amazing trilogy
Joe there is a law about the count ! When interrupted by wilder the count stops and resume where he was that’s the law of boxing
The slow count is a joke. Fury would have just gotten up faster if the count was faster. I don't think it effected the fight at all. Also Wilder was not penalized for the blatant rabbit punches.
Tyson is named after Tyson.
Just imagine if Wilder had started boxing as a child. A well rounded boxer with that kind of power would have been a sight to behold.
What was joe wearing😂 a very unique jacket👀
Fake news. Wilder corner stop the second fight.
I may be high as shit but they bring up the boxing ref count speed after how many decades of boxing😭🤣🤣😂
Prime make drops him ??
It's like balls and strikes. It's like the referees when I wrestled in hs. Some are quicker to give you the 2 point takedown or 1 point escape. He counts faster or slower for a 3 point near fall. As long as the ref is counting consistently for both it's fine.
Tyson was trying to knock him nothing more. He hardly put a skills display on cause he was just pusghing forward throwing bombs. First fight tyson put on a clinic
I’ve heard the same argument about the count when fury was knocked down I have gone back four or five times and re-watched it and Timed it. At most  fury got up and was aware at nine seconds and that is the most amount of time
That was a good fight though
Joe loves drama talking about long counts, what a load of bollox, give him credit. Wilder got smashed in all fights. Schooled in the first, smashed in the second and then brutally knocked out in the 3rd.
I have said this so many times why Joe do you keep having this guy on your show? And everyone knows who I'm talking about he's the most unlikable guy I've ever seen your friends with very very unlockable bad people
He never has a chance against fury , he even had the dr over  at the corner to give him more time.  How many times does fury have to beat this guy, he’s a one punch wonder and if you can take his punch he’s done
If you look at the actual time on the round count, Fury is up in 9 seconds on both occasions, regardless of the count. The great thing about boxing is literally having a clock counting exact seconds at all times, so no need for conspiracy theories.   He gets longer to recover after getting up in the second count purely by virtue of Wilder not following the referee's instruction and staying in the corner. But that's literally the rules of boxing.
This was not an all time great fight, and if you think so you need to watch more boxing. It wasnt competitive enough to be near the best HW fights of all time.
Greatest heavyweight fight ever????? Greatest boxing match ever??? Wtf Joe
"If you could teach wilder how to box you'd have one of the greatest fighters of all time" one of the greatest fighters of all time? You mean like Tyson Fury, Joe? Get your tongue out of wilders arse and have respect for the actual legend that is Tyson Fury, man.
Typical bias americans who know F**k all about boxing. 40  fights for wilder which were against old, slow overweight or basically nobodies has padded his fighting record out. Wilder has been found out and 100 % retires because he now realises his lack of boxing ability will get him hurt
Corruption that's y boxing died
He's talking about Mike Tyson at the end of course!
Joe's talking out of his ass here. Should at least say how fury was completely fine and alert when going down. He immediately  turned over on his hip and looked up at the ref wide eyed. Wasn't hurt at all. He was waiting for the ref to count to stand up. Not to mention the strategy of just taking a knee after taking a big shot to prevent getting completely ko'd. Fury Got buzzed and saw wilder following up, he's big and awkward so he just fell over.
The "law" of boxing, for all of our entire lives, have been corruption.   It's fantasy wrestling but with real punching.
Why is Joe wearing a tin foil suit , did Eddie bravo advise it ?
George Foreman commented on the referee , and he said that he was one of the best referees he's ever seen.
Funnypants Smith
I knew Joe would just talk about Wilder lol dude loves big black men. After every fight they've had he just goes on about Wilder
Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson.
If a boxer leaves the neutral corner the referee wil stop the count and order the boxer to return to the neutral corner and the resume the cout when that boxer returns. The count does not start until that boxer has reached the neutral corner. The long count was Wilders own fault.
both times fury got knocked down he sat down till 6 or 7 then got up, he could have gotten up right away both times, now things could have gone terribly worse for him if he didnt get the "long" count. but frankly fury indisputably won the rest of the fight so i say its a good call regardless. nobody wants to see anybody win by technicality. knowing that it goes down the way it does after that round everyone should be glad that we got to see one of the greatest boxing matches of all time instead of a sore crybaby getting handed a win he doesnt really deserve.
Kaweeer street
Joe’s wearing his Apollo spacesuit for the podcast….
Just wanted to add that there was a fighter with amazing power who was also technically fantastic with amazing movement and footwork.... and Tyson Fury is named after him.
Hey joe was the whole crowd at your house wanting the same guy to winFURY GYPSY KING
Tyson fury is a great fighter. But could he beat the old school legends of boxing?
Look I respect Tyson fury I think he's a good boxer but the thing that bothers me is after the first fight he said he was going to put on 20 to 30 lb so he can handle deonte's punches better if you have to be 50 lb bigger than someone to actually beat a man that's a problem cuz in the first fight while he went around he couldn't hurt deonte no matter what he did he had to put on extra weight and be 50 pounds bigger than him that's a tall test someone to be the man 50 pounds bigger than they are
it's the Joe Rogan show, Joe Rogans guest, Joe Rogan.
I love how it took Joe a week to talk about this. Like he needed time for it to digest. It was bar none the most exciting sporting event I have ever witnessed and I am so glad I watched it live. After the UFC that was on that day, this match was the elixir I needed.
Or corruption!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Unrelated to the fight but it's so nice to see a shoutout to the ghost, i loved watching that dude fight.
I remember when mike tyson knocked out buster Douglas and the count was like 20 seconds,  crazy cheating .
Tyson Fury was down collecting himself and then got up later into the count. It looked to me like he could have gotten up sooner if he needed to do so. Even if it was a little long, I don’t think Wilder would have won by KO even if it was exactly 10. I think Fury would have just gotten up a little sooner.
Wtf are you wearing jo ffs lol
U know how to learn ur 10 count  u stick to smoking weed way ur yes friends sucky sucky
Wide shot of 3 them sitting in space suits is priceless.
It wasnt a long count Joe,f*ck up!! The timekeeper has to stop the count as well if the fighter moves from a neutral corner.
Love u Joe but it was the TV coverage was off from start of bell I watched from start of bell Nd it was bang on the ref counted it right but the screen knocked off at 15 sec so it looks like it was off loads of videos of it !fury looks at the ref Nd he got up
Fury would have been up before 10 no matter what so its all good...
Those Americans can’t handle that their boy lost.
This other guy is a boxing expert
Even if Tyson Fury had been counted out in the first fight , he would have still had a rematch and beat Wilder.
It has never been a 10 second count, embarrassing Joe
I really don't think Wilder should come back. He's getting up in age and the entire trilogy with Fury made him look pretty bad from a PR standpoint.  I don't think Wilder has enough time as a boxer to change his public image AND get another shot at the Lineal. I can't blame the fella for trying, but he really ought to put up his gloves and just enjoy the 41 wins.
Tyson Fury vs Deontay not-so wilder
Sorry joe but your wrong about the count
stick to dewormer and anti vaxx bs
The same thing happened in Taylor Ramirez makes me think it may be a rule in Nevada
Joe knows mma but don’t know that much about boxin
f'n idiots...  Tyson Fury was literally NAMED after Mike Tyson....
Aren't they having sober october this year?
I screamed JOE
Does the ref start the count at the point the boxer hits the floor or when he stops skidding and comes to a complete stop❓😂😂😂😂😂
The count argument is bullshit. It's not like Tyson only just made it to his legs. He waited for the count to give himself a rest. Low level analysis from Joe.
Joe" wrapped in tin foil" Rogan
Regarding Fury's second fight stoppage, just because Wilder "could" continue doesn't mean the fight shouldn't be stopped. At this point his future is at stake, health Is simply more important.
Yes Fury is a great technical boxer but does anyone really believe his level of technique over Wilder is what let him take those shots and get up and not the 40lb advantage he had? Does anyone believe his strategy would have worked without 40lbs advantage?   Wilder has fought and beat a bunch of opponents who are technically better boxers than him but they didn't have a 40lb advantage.   Fury can outbox Wilder 100% but if you think he could do what he did to him in the last two fights if Fury weighed 240 you're delusional.
Joe looks like Darth Vader when he takes the helmet off
A count isn't a timer. Plus this was Wilders approved ref.  I see the problem. But a count is much more fun and entertaining. But Fury would get up to the count no matter what I believe
Fury is the better boxer by far but Wilder's story and record are also impressive.
Same thing with the count in Tyson/ Douglas fight. Tyson actually should of won
Top 10 trilogies of boxing matches ever...! Tyson Fury is in my opinion the Kobe Bryant of boxing. copying or mimicking Mohammed Ali punches & movements... and it works for him excellently.  "The Gipsy King" has Single handily revived the heavyweight division.
Big fan of the podcast Joe but apart from the first and fourth rounds(where he dropped fury twice) Wilder took an absolute beating. Fury is the better boxer and the best heavyweight.
Tyson is trained to come up to the count. Jesus guys!  It's not controversial. If Tyson hears the count he gets up accordingly
Fucking teddy atlas and now joe talking wilder more than fury.... give respect
Video title should be tell me you know nothing about boxing without telling me.
5:04 Rogan sounds like he was vouching for Wilder lmao
Joe always gives Deontay Wilder WAY too much credit.
Wilder was too dumb and too busy showing off by leaving corner
We're gonna fuel the rabid Wilder fan club by stating wrong interpretations of the rules, then why not discuss the doctor who came in late to tend to Wilder at the start of a round when he could have come in during the 1 minute break.  Wilder had taken a hellacious beating in the previous round. Dr coming in at the start of the next round rather than during the break was tantamount to giving Wilder an extra 30 seconds recovery time. No one's talking about that though are they.
Tyson was watching the ref and was timing the count. He would of gotten up faster if he was close to ten
In the words of Mike Tyson   ‘So fxcking what it’s a fight, shit happens’
Bullshit joe. Tyson never looked koed.
Oh if boxing expert Daniel Cormier says so then it must be true
When fury knocked wilder, from the point of wilder hitting the deck to getting up and back to action was 22 seconds.... but we dont talk about that do we ;)
Nobody mentions the Doctor being brought into the ring!! Jeez joe disappointed in this analysis,  stop licking wilders arse
OHHH! Oh! He wobbled him! *Grabs shoulder*
I need that space suit
Joe still shouting “OH MY GAWD ITS OVER”
Its all good and well being high as a kite untill you realise you're talking bollocks
14 minutes of how hard Wilder can punch....he lost all three fights to a superior boxer.
His dad named him Tyson after mike.
Imagine being a caster for decades and don't know how a knockdown count works..
Ask yourself why does the Ref. Have to count with Fingers and show the count to the boxer who is down ?? You think the Boxer who is down has to guess about the seconds the timekeeper has it? Lol
Lolol he thinks Tyson is his actual real name lololol what an idiot. This guy probably thinks tiger woods is his actual name.
I think you're wrong Joseph, the ref is god within the ring, and if a fighter is, like wilder moving to his own corner for coaching from his corner during a count a ref has the right to pause the count to force the cheating fighter to move to the neutral corner before resuming the count. Seems fair as fuck to me.
Tbh he did the same Count for wilder so it was even and wilder had the count first.
Oleksandr Usyk is up next. HE WILL BE THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD!!!
Nothing like that feeling. I remember  watching Barry vs Kongo
fury taking advantage of the count.  theres no reason to get up at 3 and get killed when you have 7 more secs to get your legs back
Could’ve kept going…?? You realise how if they got knocked down like this in UFC it’s OVER. You have to save fighters from themselves sometimes.  Talkin shit…
600k PPV nobody watched basically
Yeah the same thing happened when boxing legend Henry Cooper beat Mohammad Ali
There is nothing more cringe than Rogan pretending he knows boxing
The 10 count starts when the opponent goes to a neutral corner so if wilder got out of his corner that made the referee stop counting and telling him to get back in his corner that's on him(can't remember how the count went me to rewatch it)
Awww look how cute you 2 are in your NASA suits .haha Earth's flat dipshits!! Check out Warner von brons grave stone.. interesting the dude that put the applo on the "MOON" IS  is talking about a fermament...
Oh I really can’t believe Joe to be so naive in boxing rules !!   Joe was worse the average Boxing fans about the count , unbelievable!!!
All these excuses are pathetic. Black people are allowed to lose too.
“Hardest puncher off all time”.  Where do they get this stuff from. Boxing was dead and buried, they created this nonsense to attract people’s attention. Get them back, create excitement. You simply can’t come to that conclusion with Wilders record . He simply hasn’t fought anybody bar Fury and a 40 odd year old Ortiz who beat him  the first fight.  I’d encourage anybody to go back and look at  how hard the heavyweights hit 20/30 years ago. Wilder would have been swallowed up by them. The fight here also wasn’t good . It was a pretty poor effort in fact. Fury didn’t fight well while Wilder actually  did for a guy that doesn’t know how to box , he  didn’t look off balance every time he threw a punch ! Having said that he was gone after 4 rounds. Yes it was exciting but some of it was absolutely all over the place . Hardest puncher of all time , Tyson fury got behind that, in fact probably started all that just to build him up …….. only to chop him straight back down .
Joe "toe" Rogan rewind to the only part of the fight Wilder had a chance lol
Fury got up at 8 and wasnt even that hurt. Their isnt a referee alive who would have stopped that fight, fury just got caught was concious the whole time.
Joe is wrong on this one. Go listen to some boxing heads like big john explain the count
Can Someone tells Henchclif tyson fury is LITERALLY named after mike tyson, and his dad was a boxer too with nickname “fury” and that’s why he’s called tyson fury. 🤦🏻‍♂️ I hate it when these guys hype sh*t up like wow this is extraterrestrial stuff going on here. And it’s funny how they know nothing or near to nothing but act like they’re hardcore fans with tons of knowledge about boxing. 🤦🏻‍♂️
One of the best boxing matches I have ever seen.
Hinchcliff looks like the least knowledgeable person ever when he talks to rogan
His dad names him after Mike Tyson. Come on man, research 😂
Deontay never faced adversity (starting at 19) and never had to learn footwork to be as awesome as he was.
The ref had a good night overall and he looked after wilder by being on top of Fury's leaning and head locks. He probably made a mistake but looking at fury whilst he was down during that count he probably could of been up quicker if needed so I think people need to overlook this a little bit and not let it taint a battle of the beasts!
Imagine being a wilder fan 😂 fools
Im sorry I think mike tyson would have a hard time again tyson fury
Tyson fury is crazy first fight absolutely
So she felt bad for the guy who literally was winning 90% of the fight. Hmmm. I wonder whyt that is
So did fury have a long count or was it consistent?
Id bet bing bong is big mad Tony ain't cancelled....the left is losing their super power lol
Cormier's take stinks like Joe's last elk carcass. The simping for Wilder by Joe is just pathetic...but we know his type ; )
Wilder might as well retire
Wilder's punch is like perfect boobs on a pretty girl; they're not really going to ever develop the skills because they never really have to.
Fury was always getting up at 8 regardless of whether the count was slow. There wasn’t much time left till the end of the round, and although this aggressive style he’s adopted does allow him to get caught, Fury is superhuman man. Never seen anyone recover from a knockdown as quickly as he does! Wilder would’ve knocked out every other heavyweight on the night though, he deserves a lot of credit.
Nice ending to a great week.
Joe didn't you know that Rocky Marciano knocked 43 guys out of 49 fights. So Deontay making cherrypicks don't make him all time knockout king...
The Long Count Bull Crap does not hold water. Fury was ready to stand up at the count of 3 and waited as long as he could, gathering rest and totally lucid. Cormier is 💯% wrong. It’s one thing if a fighter was struggling to make the count. Fury was taking advantage of the situation.
The ignorance of boxing is huge in this clip.
"Muh slow count" ... so much cope from the Beyonce fangirls...
My dad used to always use the term queer st when we would watch fights 😂😂
The ref CONTROLS THE COUNT AT ALL TIMES! Even if the towel is thrown in the ref can REFUSE! DEYONTAY LOST FAIR AND SQUARE!
Aw the count now not his gloves 😂
Or the ref should have a mic for the countdowns so everyone can hear it lol
The hardest puncher had 1 minute to knock fury out again which he did knock him down again but couldn’t keep him down no excuses Fury is not a human that’s what we should say and at the same time wilder deserves huge respect he has a lion’s heart
I don't think Hinchcliffe gives a shit about fighting, just going along with it lol
i feel sorry for joe rogan, when he tries to explain fights to people who dont give a shit about it.
WHO Would win Mike Tyson or Tyson Fury? In Prime?
You always get long counts in big fights. They want the fighters to continue if they can.
Fury wasn't hurt once
Joe missing the joke and taking things litterally is my new favourite thing
How come we not talking about Furys 40lbs weight advantage over Wilder? And how he used it to lean on and wear wilder down. I believe that if they at the same weight level wilder would win all 3 fights.
Spot on Joe!
i personally cant believe that after all this time if he could learn he would. some ppl just don't have the foot work ability of others and its not new in sports and thats why we value good foot work. At this point he is second best heavyweight in the world he just has no chance with fury
Give me a break! Fury won every round after the 4th and they split 1 - 4, at best. Greatest fight ever? Oh hell no!
Why does Joe have the tendency to absolutely suck off black fighters? I swear every single time he does nothing but suck off their physique and thinks they're marble statues. Example would be the Adesanya v Jan fight.
Fury wasnt out though, if the ref was counting faster fury would have got up faster. You can clearly see Furys just chillin
I guess none of them know they named him after Mike tyson
Tyson fury on the rogan experience please
The rule is that the referee counts you out so when Tyson gets knocked down you can see he is waiting for the ref to start the count so he waited for the ref to do his job. Sure the ref may of stuffed up with not picking up the count but Tyson could of got up quicker if he needed to, he was hurt but he wasn’t that hurt that he couldn’t continue
Joe’s definitely drunk or on benzos evry interview it just became apparent
Rogan should have worn that for Gupta
Rogan is not allowed to have Jason Christoff on his podcast
I’m bored of joe rogan
Wilder has knocked out 41 tomato cans or guys coming back after an extremely long lay off from their last fight.
This talking baloney roll in a space suit has a point.
Great fight, they wanted to take each other's soul in there, but it wasn't a great boxing match, I mean from the technical aspect it was very poor.
To me fighting is all about your equipments. They both are well equipped  but not for fighting each other. It's like a bulldozer vs a tractor. No way.
Bring back the fight companion
Is that dude smoking a microphone??? 🤔
Joe, please have Paul Gilbert-(guitar virtuoso) on and have him noodle around with his guitar 🎸just to digest his talent. Greatest guitarist IMO of our time. I played with a band that opened for him long ago. Your outfits remind me of an album he released years ago with his old Band Racer X.
How the hell is Wilder the fighter with most KOs with 41 of them when Mike Tyson has 44 😂 Rogan is tripping… wilder is not the heaviest puncher of all time
the hard on Joe has for Wilder is obvious .... the guy is Not a Boxer just a 1 punch hopeful..... totally outclassed & Fury still took his best.... Sore loser too lol
I think your account of Christopher Columbus is a bit off. Steven Crowder debunked the lies about Christopher Columbus
The ref could probably feel those punches & it had him freaked out a little.
Rumor has it Joe had guests on this episode...
Rocky marciano 49/0 46ko
Fuck the count. Fury won.
Tyson Fury, best British boxer ever?
Damn that nasa jacket 🔥.
"Look at his fat ripple." "Look at that fat." 😆😂🤣
Julian Jackson was a scary puncher as well. Was also a more complete fighter. Ran into issues when other boxers would stand up to the power
No joe….. you Americans might of thought he d be knocked down. Us brits knew he was getting up 😊😂
Is Rogan trying to sweat out all that hrt?
Fury would’ve got up before the count ended anyway. He was sitting there catching his breath before he got up.
Joe when are you going to have Sammy The Bull on your show!?!??
14 minute video talking up a loser 🤷🏼‍♂️😴
Not in real life...no ref on streets
From when each boxer hits the floor until the ref says box fury had less time than wiilder so the counts favour wilder
Joe is so full of shit.  Fury got up before 10 seconds and he doesn't even know the rules.
I think Tyson was named after mike tyson lol
At first I was like oh it’s Tony. Then I seen Redband and was like hell yeah!🤣
Joe's knowledge of boxing is like Redban's knowledge of how to successfully run a podcast
Fury deserved long counts after the disgusting decision in the first fight
As an American I don't agree with all this long count excuss bullshit, respect we're respect is due 👏
The two other boxers that punch that hard in my opinion would be mike tyson and george foreman!!
Horse hair gloves VS padded gloves🙈 how about get both fighters padded gloves and do a rematch.
No…if you could teach Wilder an educated jab and a legitimate STRAIGHT right hand.  Fury would still be asleep 🤷🏾‍♂️
Why hasnt Joe admitted were living a false flag? Where Eddie Bravo when you need him?
Joe “look at that fat” rogan
Hel yea. His good bud redban making him walk back his statement about Biden faking his shot
Beyonce wilder should ask for only  5 seconds count than he might win
LMAO what is Joe wearing?!
Joe, learn the rules. The ringside counter stops when the ref picks up the count. Stop feeding the false narrative.
This is the second fight they have done that it’s corruption and errors it’s not coincidence they changed the ref for a championship fight of this magnitude last minute smh
WRogan is spiting controversy and is wrong coz ref done superb job on the count as he had stop it directing Wilder to the mutual corner and then resume it again at the point it was stopped,there fore robotic counts would never work as you dealing with human factor here!
Yeah you have they do it in wii fit 😅
Besides the timing of the count, a decent boxer waits as long as possible to recover hence waits for the referees count, if the referee takes ten minutes to count to 8 that's great for the recovering boxer but doesn't mean he couldn't have got up after 5 seconds.   They're waiting for that number!
If only Charlie Zelenoff had time to train Wilder. You can only amagine.
The problem with the count is this ... when fury goes down !look at the bloke and tell me he’s not ready to fight straight away... and then look at wilder when he goes down 🤷‍♂️he looked fucked from the 2nd. he got lucky with the 2 knock downs in the 4rth and fair play to wilder he’s a strong warrior and a brave man , but Tyson is the DON
I think halfway in the fight Fury was playing with Wilder. He could have finished him earlier but I think he felt bad for him
Joe wanted deontay to win so bad. the desperation in this video
That count shit is bullshit. He was still up well before the count and he was timing it so he got the most time to recover. Bs Bs bs
Well we know who Joe wanted to win. He talked this whole video bout how good deontey could be and would be, the chump got beat by Tyson 3 times, why is everyone still on wilders nuts. He lost all three times, this time by KO give Fury his eyes. Greatest heavyweight boxer ever to fight. Deontey in my opinion isn't even in the top 5, maybe top 10.
Youngstown!!
Their accents break me 😩
The count isn't 10 clock seconds and the other fighter MUST be in the neutral corner, its more ceremonial than punctual within reason of course. The significance is to make a judgment on if the fight can safely continue. Its not a pro wrestling three count pin. Why does Joe not know this?
Besides those knockdowns it wasn't really a close fight.
Michael Venom Page would be a great teacher for Deontay for movement skill as he is a similar build.
Joes wrong on the count thing. The ref is supposed to send the fighter to neutral corner, pick up the count from the ringside and then he continues with the count from there on out, if he has to send the fighter back to the neutral corner that’s at the detriment of the count.
For someone who’s watched so many boxing matches, it’s disappointing that Joe doesn’t know the WBC rules regarding the counts. Everything the referee did was correct and in line with the commissions ruling. As much as I respect Joe, he needs to go over the WBC boxing rules.
look at it roll down
joes the type of guy to scream boom 💥 boom 💥 after every dip of the chip
"Look at that fat roll down"  What you see shortly before being knocked the f out by a huge sack of Guinness and Potatoes
40 Knock outs... all school teachers and bus drivers journey men!!!!
Pretty sure he was named after Mike Tyson lol it’s really not that amazing.
What happened to supporting the AMERICAN 🤔 white people stay on code
Get big John on the podcast
Really just Joes takes on fighting and fighters for a lifelong practitioner as well as analysts and commentator is so shocking. The only thing I think he can breakdown to a great level is BJJ. The other calls and takes are just so off. Remember when Ronda could beat Mayweather and half the mens bantamweight division in the UFC for one.
Have a look at Jack Dempsey vs Gene Tunney..from way back,now that was a long count..as for Wilder?..I didn't like his lame B.S. excuses for the last fight..it was rude and disrespectful to almost everyone involved..no dispute this time..he got his lights put out!
Joe is full of shit. He thinks he knows everything.
Omg Brian Redban is slowly turning into Rob Reiner?
FURY GOT UP BOTH TIMES BEFORE TEN SECONDS SO ITS IRRELEVANT. HE ALWAYS GOES TO THE REF'S COUNT AND WOULD GET UP AS FAST OR AS SLOW AS THE REF'S COUNT.
Stoked to finally see Joes take on the fight. I don’t think Deontay can simply “learn good footwork” because his curse is butterfly legs, and even at 209 he had too much upper body mass to use his base to counteract it.
Is Joe after coming from space or on his way?
YOUNGSTOWN
Wilder cost him self for not returning to his corner witch cost him seconds on his count witch cost him the win in my opinion
Julian Jackson was like that. Arguably the hardest hitting pound for pound boxer ever. He would touch people and literally lift them off their feet. He used to fight on Mike Tyson undercards, and was notoriously underpaid, but he knocked everybody out. He was champion of the world as well. He would put people to sleep with jabs, let alone when he would actually power punch them. It used to sound like someone swinging a 2x4 into a punching bag, it was so loud. Like a slap, but with 16 oz gloves. Scary.
🤔Did they just Say Youngstown Is a Boxing Town😂😭😭 Listen Bro idk what they told you but You kno what NVM
Joe is talking more and more shit with every podcast
Man Joe is insufferable now
Fury A Celtic Bare Knuckle Brawler...
Redban Segura
Sorry Joe he is not even in the top 10 hardest punchers, Marciano and Foreman are the hardest, then Liston, joe Lewis, Norton, Tyson, and so forth, watch those matches you will see,
i want a space suit.
An I the only one who came here for “7” or “Olive Garden”?
how could anyone be the best just by beating one guy three time? how?
The refs job is not to allow a hurt/injured fighter continue and risk more injuries. Fury was conscious and maintained eyes contact with the ref, took the time he needed from the count and came back. And no point in time did he look as if he couldn't continue fighting.
Really the skill that helped Tyson Fury win it was the ability to get up and the actual Gracie needed to beat the count but in real life he won the fight and in real life Deontay Wilder won the boxing match
Pretty obvious that Rogan knows way more about mma than boxing lol
The dislikes are the Wilder fans 😂
Go Blue
tyson fury is the defintion boxing technique, zero muscle and literally all technique. he is superb.
There is only one controversial point in the wilder vs fury trilogy, that is that there was a 'draw' in the first fight. Fury is 3-0 over wilder without dispute
Tyson Fury has said on a podcast where Mike Tyson was there that he was actually named after him
Rogan needs to do his research cause he chatting bubbles about the ref count... Easily to find the official rule  When u watch the fight notice fury watching the ref. Even if the count wasn't stalled he was resdy to get up after 3 seconds both knockdowns but having knowledge of how boxing works means fury played by the rules also wilder has knocked how many guys down?? And he didn't know he had to be in a neutral corner  Rogan doing a cnn here
Mayweather said it was normal and he believes that Wilder won the first fight (even without the potential KO). Rogan is off here. It's a 10 count not a 10 second count. zzzz
Joe “look at his fat ripple” Rogan
"I'm not that versed in referees... I know few of them. Used to know more, but know a few of them." - Donald Rogan
"this is the greatest fight i've ver seen in my life"  "yah, so fun"  lol why is that the least macho response ever?
Yeah it was a great entertaining fight but not one of the greatest of all times. Someone might be a little too high Joe lol
Man, disappointing pod cast. Just kinda lacking in something. Tony's great on stage but imagine him as a friend. He's like the last resort guy that you hope doesn't find out you invited your other friend first.
I dont think tyson was as hurt as his 1st match with wilder.  his eyes after being knocked down were all on the ref to get up at the right time.  In the first fight the knockdown looked desperately bad as he lay motionless and bewildered.  IMO wilder fought very hard and should feel proud to step in a ring with such a goliath but the fact really is he was beaten 3 times if people are honest with themselves and he overwhelming won 90% of all the rounds they faced each other.
Joe's expertise is not boxing, sorry.
FURY WAS WATCHING THE REF COUNT THE WHOLE TIME.......             WHETHER THE COUNT WOULDA BE SUPER SLOW, OR IF THE REF WOULDA COUNTED SUPER FAST FURY WOULDA GOT UP ON THE 9 COUNT BECAUSE HE WAS "SUPER CONTIOUS" OF IT😉🥱
Joe please sue CNN
LETS GO BRANDON!!!!!!!!!!
Great video. Imagination creates reality. ✨💫🧘🏽‍♂️
Wilder is not the hardest puncher of all times let's get real
Does Joe not like redband? I feel like he just doesn't like him sometimes
WTF? it was really fitting we were an hour away from Youngstown? How desperate is he to make some kinda unneeded connection. Just enjoy the fight you idiot
Where can I buy that silver jacket?
Nothing funnier than joe shutting Tony’s made up story down straight away 😂
There's people overseeing the ref's count though with stop watches. Also fury got up by 8 in the first knock down and 9 with second. All that matters though is fury took the time to get his head together with the ref's count silly not to take advantage of the situation when you've been rocked like that ie Wilder doing the stanky leg.
If anything ref was more aggressive to Fury he kept physically pushing him back after every clinch. Didn’t touch Wilder. That dosser.
Unbelievable fight Tyson Fury is a superstar what a character
https://youtu.be/ZCpGSBLt2g8  elbow hits at 17 seconds, 8 count ends at 2 seconds. plenty of time in between telling Wilder to go back to his corner. 4th round knockout.
He was a great ref . Fuck you Joe . Dont knoe shit abt boxing .  Tyson was in shape . It was more of a push down . Wilder was stumbling all over the place and the ref kept giving him a chance when another ref would have stopped the fight .
Why the fuck does JOE still think it is 10 seconds and not a 10 count and none of his little bent guests challenge him because he only talks fighting when he is the authority
Tony was pretending to be masculine
There's a reason alot of the best boxers will often jog to their corner immediately after knocking down a opponent before instructed to by the referee. The count starts quicker, giving less time for recovery. Wilder was so used to everyone he knocked down with a strong right hand staying down and mostly unconscious! He didn't learn from the first fight that Tyson Fury has a iron head and remarkable recovery. It's possible that affected the outcome but I think wilder was too gassed to really capitalize on it.
If the referee was counting quicker, Fury would have got up quicker. Simple as that. The man was fine
If anyone thought Fury was done after the 2 knockdowns u dont know boxing. Wilder is infamous for lack of stamina! All Fury had to do was last another round bc Wilder punched himself out
As the weed smoke waifs over Joe and Company!! Hey Joe I want some too!! 😂
Wilder was exhausted for like 4/5 rounds and his legs wanted to give in badly
PLEASE NO REMATCH. 3 is enough. Time to move on, before somebody gets really hurt.
Biologically Irish that gave him the edge, father from Galway mother from Antrim,also cousins to that great Irish folk band the Fury's.
Joe Rogan has the count rule wrong and the time keeper doesnt work like that
Joe that is revenge and heart rippling in his body not fat
Tony... The most dry, soft soyboy that everyone convinces is funny. Uh.. I miss Uncle Joey and the fight companion... :(
The biggest difference between Wilder and Fury is the fight IQ level. Tyson fought completely different from their first fight to their second. In the third fight, he even made changes from the second fight. Wilder added a body jab to his toolbox.
Ali is rightfully the greatest but there isn't "a man born from his mother" who can beat fury. I can't think of a boxer ever he wouldn't beat
One day, way in the future, Joe will talk about the non American winner in depth & give him props.
One thing for sure, the W.B.C.  wanted fury to win, but that victory is all fury.
One of the greatest fights of all time 😂
fury is used to being on dope so his body/brain is at other levels of resistance.. you ever seen a crackhead get hit by a car and stand right back up? thats what happened
Wasn’t a long count, fake news Joe wtf😂😂
Joe was high watching that match 2. At no point in that fight was Fury in trouble. He got knocked down even rested while he was down then got back up. Wilder on the other hand... had none of the cardio conditioning he needed...
Wrong Joe. Primo Carnera knocked out more. Klitchkow knocked out 53. Learn the history. Just like Carnera, Wilder knocked over tomato cans to build a fake resume.
The non point about Fury getting a longer count, is nonsense. Watch at least one of Wilders counts, the ref gives him absolutely tons of extra time, after he is up. Folk need to forget this controversy nonsense, Fury won, basically for a 3rd time. Accept it.
What the fuck is Joe wearing a fire blanket?
Didn't think Tyson would come back , and then proceeds to talk about the 2nd fight when he came back! are you stupid! of course he was going to come back. Stop with the excuses he done him twice move on.
@4:00 Cause his dad was a boxer and named his son after Mike Tyson.
Fury might not have the resume yet, but in head-to-head matchups I'd favor him to beat most all heavyweights ever. I mean this guy would toy with a Joe Frazier or Ken Norton
In smaller fights guys the ref doesn't even start till your in the neutral corner could very much depend on the state commission thingy aka corruption
Lmao Cormier stays mad his boy keeps getting fucking embarrassed.
Absolutely wrong on the count. The ref controls the count.
Wilder hates doing road work, fighters need that running but wilder was getting away with not doing it cause of his power.
Fury just head-locked Wilder in the early rounds and leaned his 280 pound ass on him to make Wilder’s legs jello. He is very skilled, but this fight wasn’t a good performance for Fury at all.
Fury still got up before the 10 count even though the ref was a little off.
very silly argument about the count joe fury waiting for the ref like most boxers they wait for the 8 to get up you know this
Damn, Joe still looks some what the same since he started JRE while Brian looking like Alex Jones 2.0. Them gas station dick pills done aged that man
Have to disagree with Joe Rogan here. The rules in boxing are, if the guy who scores the knockdown doesn't go to, or stay in, the neutral corner, the referee must pause the count until he does so. And in any case, if you time both counts, Fury was up at 8 both times anyway. So no controversy at all in this fight.
He was named after Mike Tyson
You guys were great in Pittsburgh.  Go Youngstown!
Hey Joe Tyson fury kick his ass if we were watching the same thing
I hate seeing all the holding and mostly Tyson fury was holding not leaning. At times he would just lean then then he would go back to holding. The ref even gave Tyson a hard warning but let it go after
Joe Rogan looks Roasted in this video 😂.
“Fury’s hurt”
as a fighter I'm surprised u don't pick up on that. look back on some of the greatest fights. ward/gatti 100% wouldn't have taken place the way we all remember it.
The count was not long. Wrong about the time Joe. Count the damn count yourself on the standard video. It was not more than 10 seconds, either time. Second. The downed fighter relies on the count he hears and responds at eight. If the count was shorter, he still would have responded at eight. Don't imply it affected the outcome. It did not.
Joe doesn't know how the count works because he never got up anyway.
This fight isn’t even top 20 all time. They’re seriously gassing this thing. All 3 Ali vs Frazier fights are better than every fight in this trilogy.
It’s all staged and rigged ...sheep
11:19 why doesn’t Joe show the hit? That would easily fall under fair use, no?
Both fighters got slow counts.  As long as the referee is being consistent it's ok.  I thought the ref did a great job keeping them apart.  he had to separate them at least 10 times per round
What Brian said is true and I will not buy any ppv boxing only MMA
Deontay did say something about the count maybe he wasn't B..S'n this time.
Uh wtf is Joe wearing?
Both fighters got the benefit of a so called long count, they do it a bit differently these days, if there up they want to make sure there fit or not, there's a video on YouTube with Jack Reiss explains the count in Fury Wilder 2, the 12th rnd knockdown
so many fights in the past have continued and ended up being some of the greatest fights bc the ref knew the fighter could continue. if a machine takes over is takes so much purity out of the sport.
Joe your a combat sports analysis. Come on do your research on the rules my brother lol
Hey Joe... you had a video with Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock.  I heard the statement something like this.  Our planet is like at an intergalactic intersection at 4pm.  Please tell me which video is this, so I can watch it again!
Joe is funny asking Jamie "Did you shit your pants" lol.
and if u let that 10 count go we don't have one of the greatest fights of all time. refs kno when the fight is fully lost.
this is why you shouldn't take drugs don't end up like Joe the toe
Who really gives a fuck, we just gave up territory to a terrorist organization. Who really gives a fuck
Fury would have got up he was listening to the count
So disappointing….
Imagine drinking fine champagne and spitting it out. Who told these men not to inhale fine cigars. Its OK to inhale cigars. Not every puff but every other puff or the tail end of every puff. Feckin ejits 😃👈  Will also help with restricting hunger. According to Ernesto Che Guevara Lynch.
How in the hell can Rogan not know the dynamics of a ten count? Bewildering Also Archie Moore knocked out 145 and Foreman had at least 65+ Foreman also was the heaviest handed boxer I know of.....he lifted joe Frazier off the ground.
Fury was a deserved winner
If the fighter leaves neutral corner the red stops count. Know wtf you're talking about
No error, no corruption. Tyson was getting up at like 8-9 seconds and ready to fight. What’s one second? Tyson wasn’t dead, he was getting up ready to roll. And good thing it didn’t get called there or we would’ve been robbed of the best fight in recent memory.
Fury would not have been a top 5 back in Mike Tyson's day......shows how bad today's boxing fans yearn for a great boxer
The long count argument here is silly. Tyson was looking at the ref the entire time. He was never out of it. He was waiting for the ref to get to a certain number, and then stand up. Most fighters do that. . An actual long count was Mike Tyson vs Douglas. Douglas was down for 14 seconds, and I don't think he would've been able to get up at 10, or even 11,12, or 13
How do you make a boxing segment on the greatest podcast ever, with two geeks who did not see the greatest fight in the world?
Very nice to finally meet ya Jamie!!! I honestly thought u were an Alexa type thingy.
the count doesn't continue until the opponent is in the neutral corner
Fury was still up by the eight count if you keep the count going you can get up at one and the ref still counts to 10
Oh fuxk off Rogan !  It's a ten count, not ten seconds.
AFAIK the rule is a 10 count not a 10 seconds count second the fighter needs to be in the neutral corner FIRST before the ref can start counting...Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson because his father is huge fan of Iron Mike.
Fury lost in the 5th round. The 2nd knockdown the count was extremly slow and was extemded. F--k Fury and those that claim Fury as a the heavyweight  champion.
Smoking in space suits!? Wtf am I doing with my life!
The ref made this fight a special fight another ref would have fucked it and waved it off early multiple times
The man has too be in the corner or rewind time
Not a single guy with that many KOs? Check again there is plenty lol
Watch the 10th when wilder goes down, exact same thing with the count. Nothing controversial about it and annoys me that it’s even brought up, takes away from a great fight
The King of The Gaels Gypsy King Tyson Fury.
The refereeing manuals even state that the count process will go over 10 seconds.  Joe always looks like an idiot when he talks boxing.
Wrong joe ref picks up his own count if the other fighter moves to a different corner then directed
Not Queensberry rules then.
Tyson fury mental state is just on that other level. He has been on the  Verge of death and came back and know everyone has big respect for him. Even in England when he won the title against Klitschko no one was impressed by fury but has he become a great boxer and gets more respect that he deserves
Sorry to piss up your parade but he was named Tyson after Mike Tyson. His family has generations of boxing history.
The fact Joe doesn't know there is another guy counting for the commission ringside is wild
Wrong about the count read the rules
Joe Rogan is always so fair, reasonable to both sides.
Tyson Fury schooled Wilder for every second of every moment of all three fights, barring the KD's. People are grasping at straws with this long count.
K-1 (Japanese kickboxing organization) does counts over the loudspeaker 📢
sue cnn rogan
Its not a 10 second count, the referee can start the count and take his time analysing the fighter, so with won't necessarily be 10 second long it could be 12, 13s etc
Swear fury’s real name was luke fury and not Tyson
Most power punches rely on power and can't box but Lennox Lewis could do both.  You might even say when Lewis retired - his boxing soul was split into two where Fury got the boxing and Wilder got the KO power.
Who even likes tony? Stand up is terrible. Kill tony sucked. Most cringe guy joes friends with.
Damn it, Joe bring the podcast back on here already
💢Im no boxer but I have some great PUNCH lines. New Comic wants ur OPINION!! 👀 Comic Bombs first... 👈
There is always a ringside count started by the time keeper with a stopwatch in every professional fight, standard. Obviously the ref didn’t go with that.
U can't coach wilder he doesn't wanna listen I don't like him at all n he got what he deserved period
Joe knows his boxing! Love the way he put Gupta on the spot as well, the other day!
If, if if... wilder is what he is. All boxers have something they could fo better. Hes fought bums for most of his career. He would earn so much more going into acting now. Thats his destiny. No one gets hurt. Get over it USA.
Joe rogan smoked so much weed that he things he is on moon
has joe rogan ever been  at the brink of live or die point?!...and all he had was fists and fury?! ..no?!..ever?! ..then hes bs all around...im nobody and i say if joe rogan still believes ufc is the shit...hes such an idiot..😎..if it comes down to kill or die ufc is kids play..six killing points on human body..just hit them and opponent is dead...glamourising sports makes idiots think theyre great...
Ah shut the fuck up. Realtime it was like 12 seconds. Perfectly normal. Don't talk BS, Joe. Like it's the first freaking fight you ever watched. You're a Wilder fanboy, we get it.
I just can’t believe Tyson Fury’s gas tank
Please stop talking about boxing Joe. Just stop.
Wtf , moon suits!!!!
The count comes full circle.... ref messed up that count granted.    What about the dr coming in the ring to check wilder over. Why isn't the dr in the corner dealing with it.  But the dr comes in after the bell goes so the round has started which GIVES WILDER MORE TIME TO RECOVER.   WHY NONE OF YOU YANKS ASKING THIA QUESTION.   IMO.  THEY BOTH GOT A LITTLE EXTRA LUCK
This is what happens when you're an arrogant Luciferian and you're faced with a true man who bows down only to the TRUE God; you get knocked out! Tyson Fury - the TRUE MAN OF GOD ALMIGHTY!!!
Tyson Fury 👑was named after Mike Tyson...🥊💪🏽
Joe still hard for wilder eh?
Sore loser and hood conspiracies always trying to find an excuse
His dad was a mike tyson fan and named him after mike...it was on hotboxn with mike tyson
He beat him 3 times what more do people want 😂😂
furys dad John named him tyson after mike  who was John's favourite  fighter
You can tell now that Joe Rogan is biased towards Deontay Wilder. Nothing wrong with this obviously but barely anything said about how great Tyson fury is.... He is the Best!!
This fight went crazy. I watched it in florida and as I looked out the window there was a raging thunderstorm behind my phone. Lightning all over the sky. Best experience.
like Anthony joshua vs the new Ukrainian champ they stopped the fight 5 second too early!!!
Everyone is looking for a controversy everywhere nowadays. It's getting quite tiresome and monotonous.
I know I've seen Joe wear the nasa stuff before but now everyone in the video wearing it. What am I missing?
Ernie Shavers had 68 ko...
Come on joe y’all should’ve looked up the ten count rule before saying these things.
The 2nd fight stoppage was correct. He was fucked
Fury was unfit for boxing in this fight , a fit Fury would have finished Wilder in the 7th round
I disagree with Joe I never thought Tyson was done when he got dropped. Especially the one where he landed on his butt. He looked more frustrated than anything. He never looked like he was lacking consciousness. Amazing fight.
Idk if it this matters or not because of the rules of boxing. I rewatched the 2 knockdowns with a timer and fury gets up on time both times. Also yes the second count was definitely like 2-3 seconds behind.
*Wilder and the US have massively over-blown his record.* Fury was the 1st elite boxer Wilder took on & he only did that because he thought Fury was finished.  Parker, Joshua, Klitschko, Chisora, Whyte, Povetkin, Fury... These guys have all been fighting each other & all are/were better boxers than Wilder.  Can Wilder rely on that punch with all those boxers at that level? No.  And don't mention the 40 + year-old Ortiz. Please!
Sorry Joe I never thought it was over. Fury knew Wilders power
Fury was watching the count, and would have gotten up if the referee did the “right” thing. It was very obvious.
Too me the fight should not happen because wilder is just gonna make excuses again
Gee, what other fighter out there was about in-your-face pressure? One that perhaps Tyson linked up with this year before the fight that might have offered some assistance to his training for only a few hours? Yeah, I'm thinking Nick Diaz.
Did anyone else notice that judge non stop touching Furys Boob :D
The count for Wilder was 14 sec as well
your wrong mate , the referee counts as he wants , and as fast as he likes in the rules mate
For the millionth time a 10 count is not 10 seconds
I was shouting at him to get up
Nah its Luke
Jamie is the borest guy
He we go joe making excuse
Nooooo, the astronaut suits don’t hit the same without Duncan 😭
Sad that these boxers are being called greatest the heavy weights from the 80s , 90s and 2000 would wipe up both of these guys guys what skill is Joe seeing. There is no talent these days so it looks like they are good but its only because there is no competition out there and any mediocre fighter against mediocre fighter of course it should look good to watch that doesn't equal great fighters..
The count starts when the boxer who scored the knockdown is in the neutral corner. That is it. Watch young Mike tyson run to neutral corners. Cus taught him properly
Why in the hell are we still having to explain that it's not a ten second count? It's a ten count. As long as it's done in a reasonable counting pace, it's a valid count. Bunch of rookies on here and it shows.
Instead of pointing on the count on Fury, where he was obviosuly ready to go up almost immediately but just rested a little like any other boxer in the history of the sport have done....I should say that I was really worried about Wilder's health, he was clearly gone at the end, the refs were playing with fire, HUGE balls from the fella, HUGE, but I would be pointing more on the state of Deontay in the last two rounds than anything else, there were moments that I felt that Fury could have dammaged him really bad....but I guess that such a huge proflie fight nobody had the balls to call a technical KO.
Wilders like Conor he’s gets wobbly legs when he’s gassed
Oh Joe, chatting shite again, pull out 10 little fingers or 10 little toes and  count 10 seconds from when Tyson was knocked out, yanks are too funny n full of chit 🤣🤣🤣
You're uninformed about how the count works. The referee is in full control. Seconds have nothing to do with it. No one over rules the referee count.
f*ing idiots. I am already 40 minutes in and I am deadly sure that this is what we are here for. Go listen to the episode..... love you all
Tyson Fury  is a boxer   Wilder is an athlete
It doesn't matter if it was a slow count or not, Tyson always takes advantage of the full count.  He doesn't get up on three.
his name is luke not tyson
They all talk about his skill (which is fair enough) but I don't think Tyson gets enough credit for his chin. I mean, taking two massive clubbing shots from Wilder and getting up?! C'mon, that's granite right there.
Count wasn’t long. It’s not like he was counting Wilder faster. They were both been counted the same speed. It’s a 10 count not a 10 second count. When wilder was dropped‘ it was the same speed count.
It was a great fight but anyone who says it was a great boxing match shows how much they don't know about boxing.
Ortiz was trash ..but ultimately beaten on deontay I believe is what exposed him in the end. People say he knocked Ortiz out but neglect to realize he NEVER should have been In the danger he was
Why is everyone trying to talk up Wilder like this? The dude lost 3 of 3 fights! Let's give the flowers where they belong!  Tyson Fury deserves all they attention, great champion and great story behind it all. I highly recommend everyone watch his back story.
Joe Louis 66-3 52 ko’s. Sit down wilder
Fury was looking at the ref the all time cmon he would've got up but there's always something to say right
Joe: No one has knocked out more guys in the history of the sport (talking about wilder) Rocky Marciano: Am I a joke to you?
These guys could fight 10 more times, and Fury would win all 10.
What about the docter jumping in the ring when fury nearly finished him in the 8th or 9th and the do ter jumps in the ring talking to wilder for about 15 seconds giving him a chance and its not the first time a docter jumped in the ring happened in the ortiz fight aswell they diddent want wilder to lose and the pbc commentary is so bias its unreal
Tyson Fury was literally named Tyson by his father's Hero, Mike "The Goat", Tyson! 🥊
No joe that’s not correct he resumes the count where he left off it’s in black and white… this is why a schaubs argument of fighters are better then journalists. Fighters are lazy and don’t do their homework. Takes five seconds to look up…"The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner."
Tyson fury was named after Mike Tyson. Tyson fury's father was a boxer and a huge Mike Tyson fan.
Joe couldn't you have gotten better boxing fans to have on this show?
He does have power...but he fought absolute nobody's...shiverne was his top fight and that guy is trash...he had to fight a nobody twice to get the win to fight wilder
Please have Thomas Sowell before is too late!!
Tyson Fury is literally named after Mike Tyson, but this guy is asking "what are the odds?" LOL
Tyson fury would've gotten up at the count of 6. Regardless of how long the count would've taken
Wilder count was long also and the doctor gave him extra time .
Joe your wrong
JOES IGNORNAT GUEST : SO MY DAD GIRLFRIEND HAD HER HEAD IN HIS PANTS
‘Twas a shit display of the sweet science but an entertaining scrap for sure.
Salty salty American shame on you joe fury dominated every round Where’s the credit for one amazing boxer ???
I thought Tony was full of shit at first and not a true combat sports fan but after he asked about the 10 count being read out loud that showed that he watches the real shit. If I’m not mistaken that’s only from K-1
A name that's coincidentally directly suited to that person's job title is known as an aptronym
He was 270 joe
If the count had gone quicker then Fury would have gotten up quicker. He was just using the time the Ref was giving him.
The jacket of JOE is the  brightest of all time.
I been say it awhile   without of doubt Tyson fury is on greatest heavy weights of all time without a doubt".  Now Rogan others see it.  Fury going by the count he gets up as he hears the count. He gets up fury no matter what .
Hes named after iron mike tyson
Joe is wrong about the count, he's talking nuance.
If you look at the clock when Wilder gets knocked down in round 3 he was given a extra two seconds and the same with when Fury went down in round 4.
Anyway, back to Aliens
Damn no Duncan
"Boxing God"????  Calm down champ...
It’s official Joe Rogan has fans, colleagues, and stooges; and few friends. Sad 😢
That fight was the shit but Tyson seemed to fall on purpose to add to the drama.
Who cares about the forst fight count..fury demoshed wilder in the last two.....get yourself together joe
Where’s Duncan??!!? WTF Uncle Joe??! You’re not supposed to have on any suits, ESPECIALLY NOT ASTRONAUT SUITS, without Duncan! Someone get Duncan on the line we need to make sure he knows the level of betrayal!
I had to stop watching JRE on Spotify because it drains my iPhone 13’s battery.
Can we just throw mad credit to NASA for sponsoring this video? 😂😂😂 👽
Well Tony, Tyson was named after Mike Tyson😂
@02:04 fat ripple 😅
Fury's classic response to wilders message AAAH i love that guy
Joe’s such an idiot sometimes when it comes to fighting… let’s give the Wilderettes another excuse to why he lost… Dumb meat head Joe don’t forget to mention he gave Wilder an extra 30 seconds after one of the knock downs to recover and it goes by the referees count..Fury would’ve gotten up quicker if the count was quicker
Give it up, Wilder lost end of.
What is up with the R.I.P. JOE ROGAN comments in all Livestreams??? Somebody please explain...🤔
Shiiiiiiiit I been waiting on this
Both are absolute warriors! Would they both beat AJ?
🇨🇴💪🏿👁💪🇺🇸👊🏿
That fight was amazing.
Deontay wilder hasn't responded to his loss 6 days after the loss. The released statement was not his words.
Can easily call it the one of the greatest heavyweight bouts of all time but best boxing match in my opinion happened last year: Loma vs Lopez. That was the best!
In his prime do you think tyson could have beat wilder easily ?
Joe become a Michigan Wolverines fan to piss Jamie off〽️
Wilder lost 3 times , gtfo
The 10 count rule is different than what Joe said.
John Fury his father named him after the heavyweight champ at the time he was born. The Fury name is one of the most famous fighting gypsy families in the UK. So not as much of a coincidence as you would think.
Joe do you research on boxings 10 count. It’s not a 10 second count there’s a lot of rules and regulations involving that step. Fury won all 3 fights no question 🤘🏼
U r so wrong
Why do I just want to always punch Tony in the face. For no reason.
Well said Joe! Great breakdown of a great fight!
My god Joe you gotta get your facts right people believe you like you are Jesus talking. The count doesn't work like that
Ngannou vs wilder boxing with 4 oz gloves would be beautiful
Fury was down for like 11.5 seconds.
completely disagree with the count controversy, Tyson was watching the ref count the whole time he was on the floor.
Id almost think Wilder knocked out Fury by Joe's piss poor analyse.
Daniel Cormier is always backing the black dude in a fight
Drunk a Lager,bottle of wine,saw that puff off smoke Rogan blew at beginning n smelled weed n I ain't smoked in ages 😁😂🤣😂🤣😂😎🐒😄Fury is the Boxing TERMINATOR up n forward 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦸
I screamed a shit ton during that fight! Great fight man, it's got to be one of the best fights in years. And it was a trilogy fight!
N.ever A. S.traight A.nswer
Fury would of easily got up he kept eye contact with the ref the whole time he was smart and got up on the refs count if the ref counted quicker fury would of got up
Joe had money on Wilder
Man, surprised Joe hadn’t touched on the “no signs of respect” at the end of the fight & I’m at 10 minutes so far.
Joe is the next one to go to Space and tell Eddie Bravo about the shape of the Earth.
Again with Joe talking about how great the guy Who Lost Is. And the 10 second count which is not a 10 SECOND count. Just a 10 count.
Joe was so damn high haha
4:03 tyson fury was actually named after mike tyson
joe rogan knows nothing about the rules of boxing ! mma maybe but thats a different game .
Lol Joe's incorrect about the count again lol
Tony is sort of funny.  I mean ... we all know a semi funny smart ass. Thats really all he is.   No serious talent here.
Joe you got it wrong with the count stoppage
With the count… you also have to consider the fighter is using the count to get up within the refs count… it’s down to the refs count that dictates it. Just like when a ref caps it off without a count. It’s subjective to the ref and adds to the drama for me… just my opinion though. I can see the other view point too.
Watched it slow and he seemed to miss a second in the count,but fury was up at 8 so seemed like a mute point. Both legends,best fight ever. Horse hair rules.
I had to watch Teddy Atlas praise this peice of ish and now Rogan… and barely give credit to Fury very disappointing
I don't think joe wanted fury to win but he did and wilder will never get the opportunity again it's done
ITS ALL Rigged
Joey Diaz Needs to be with them During space suits
Fury took Tyson into deep waters and Wilder just said... hope you can swim motherfucker!
Can we talk about how Wilder wouldn't shake Fury's hand after the fight and told Fury that he didn't respect him?
“There’s not a single guy who’s knocked out as many guys as Deontay Wilder.”   You’re right, there were several. George Forman had 68KOs, Joe Louis had 52 KOs, Tyson had 44, Wladimar Klitschko had 53 KOs, Marciano had 43. Just fyi Joe. 🥊✌🏽
Its a count not a clock. And that is legal
The third time loser is still a loser 👍
What's more shiny, Joe's suit or Joe's head
Anyone hear this  “Shelley sent me,let me know if you need more time to recover” The despot in the ring.., who was he?  Well he was the the big boys boxing medic.
That's true but fury was watching the refs hands he would of got up before the 10 count he was all there.
Long count in Tyson / Buster  allowed Buster to win
Counting rules aside, the ref did count slow except he did it for BOTH boxers. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
joe rogan sounds really stupid here (as usual lol). if there is corruption it was in favor of wilder. the first fight a draw? LMAO
No referee born from his mother wants to stop a fighter from a count that's not truly out of it. That's human nature Mr Rogan. 🤙
the reason for the count is not to catch the boxer out its to deem whether he can continue or not and clearly giving the following 7 rounds tyson was well able to continue.. cmon joe you're the expert here you know this
There’s the old brush off with the ten count. It’s a ten count not a ten second count. So whatever that means.
Theres only 1 tyson fury
Any good coach tells you to use the count and get up for 8, so you dont and stumble up and lose your balance on like a 3 count, because if a ref sees you looking like Bambi on ice during a count he's calling it, stay down till 6 and centre yourself, take a big breath and stand up looking sharp, adds drama too if your the sort who goes in for that.  That's why I never bought into the miracle get up for the round 12 first fight, you see his eyes snap when he'd have been training to get up after having an extra second to realign jis chakras so to speak, if the ref had counted quicker he'd have been up quicker, simple as.
Sorry Joe the ref was correct with the count.First it’s not 10 seconds the ref counts loud and he,s got to show the fighter his fingers.If the other fighter is not in a neutral corner the ref has got to tell him then continue the count from where he left off.
Joe Rogan : this is boxing rule (6) When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall direct the opponent to move to the farthest neutral corner of the ring. If the opponent leaves the neutral corner, the referee shall interrupt the count and will not resume the count until the opponent returns to the neutral corner. You have said something about somebody else shall continue ćpuny , but it is not true.
Joe shit the fuck up bro. Tyson didn't get extra count. He battered Wilder from round 5 onwards. Also round 3 Granted Wilder was ganderous throughout. Wilder will end up with brain damage or punch drunk
Gupta is in every CNN program trying his best to back peddle 🤣🤣
If you look at the count he's already up before the ref would even be near ten
"Did you know Deontay Wilder  raises coyotes and uses the reverse hyper machine?"
Wilders record is a joke. Aj would have kod all the opponents he did but probably quicker. He's just fought bum after bum. Just check his record
Learn the rules rogan it’s not seconds
It’s not 10 second it’s a 10 count from the ref, there is no controversy except those that clearly wanted Wilder to win so bad, despite him getting pummeled. Fury was wide eye and waiting to get up at the right time, if you want to talk about extra time why not mention the Ortega vs Volkanovski when they brought a chair to Ortega and got insane extra time at least 2 times including like a 20 sec extra when the round was supposed to resume. Everyone also passes up the power that Fury obviously hit him with knocking him down and beating him punk drunk half the fight.
Joe had his “oh fuck I’m really high” face on here a few times.
The guy exists, his name is Gennady Golovkin
tyson fury will go down as a legend forsure. But i’m curious to know what people think deontay wilder will go down as ?
Tyson Fury has the power of guy that’s 6’9” ~270 but moves like a guy that’s 5’9” ~160 lbs, it’s just not fair 🤣🤣
Every time Tony is on all I think is...How are you a comic?
Surprised that rogan brought up julio cesar chavez as a prime example of highly technical fighters normally non mexicans bring every else but him… rogan might now more about boxing than he thinks he does.
“He’s got a dead baby in a Jug, in his basement”. Great full episode 😂
So Furys fat rolls protected him 😜
These fucking stoners looking for conspiracy theories in what was a great fight. Drop me out..ref gave very similar counts to both fighters! Kids...say No to drugs 😂😂
I thought the count was not supposed to begin till the fighter is in a neutral corner.
Tyson Fury - the greatest sporting comeback of all time
Joe rogan!!  I have a great story for your guys
I hated when Joe kept calling Wilder Tyson Fury
It’s not a ten second count rogan
The wild Julio Cesar Chavez reference, that guy was a boxer.
I'm losing respect for joe on boxing. Deontay has the most ko's? Archie Moore had 132
Also Wilder had extra time to recover in the ninth
if anny cormier thinks a Hwboxing match should have ended after the 4th round when tyson was absolutely fine to fight on then he is smoking rocks man, a fight should be stopped if a fighter is not deemed able to continue and tyson clearly was.. wilder was stopped, fury was not
You cant lose if the ref gives you unlimited time to revive just like the first fight.
Its not an error check the Nevada rules. The ref is explicitly told to stop counting when someone is not in a neutral.corner. Also.if you check the Wilders counts across the fights when he hit the deck the count was over 10 in atleast two of them wilder had two counts
Only Rogan could make an analogy relating crocodiles to boxing
Wilder fan boy
A prime Fury could probably beat a prime Ali, Foreman, Liston, Marciano, Mike Tyson, Shavers, Frazier, Norton, Lewis. I don't see any of them outsmarting him or being big enough.   He's too tall too heavy too much heart and too strong of a chin
Damn you would’ve thought wilder won. He’s got flatlined
If we wanna talk about extra time the ref gave fury why don't we talk about the 4 rounds extra the ref gave wilder, when he was clearly done
Fury probably trained 2 weeks whilst his new born was in hospital. The first fight he was 60% the second he was 100% and this one 70%. All estimates forget wilders excuses and still won all 3 fights.
Once again Joe hasn't a clue to what he's saying.  Fury was conscious the whole time and would've beat the count regardless of ref count and regardless of rules.
Same thing with David tua vs Lennox Lewis as far as a puncher vs the boxer
Joe should know better. Fury v wilder 1, deontay wilder claimed the refs count was long. This fight only a handful of ppl saying long count.
somes fight have a stand 8 count rule which means the referee stops the action and counts to eight. ... If the boxer is unsteady on his feet, or seems unable to focus on the referee bout ends on tko which is why you see so many referees stop fights in what seem to be an early call. when the rule in not in place a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeeper's count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers." WBF RULES,  plus all counts are 10 Mississippi unless the ref is paid off somehow/corrupted.
It's a ten count Joe the fighter has to beat the referees count not a stop watch
Not fare Tyson Fury had whores hair * in his gloves * a spiked drink Wobbly legs ,i truly think Wilder was on a Tinder date .
the first two fights were better than the third, but even so, this might be fight of the year
Jamie's a weirdo leftie.
could Joe Rogan just keep on talking forever we'll never know
Julian Jackson knocked out 49 opponents out of 55 wins.... with 6 defeats
A ten count is not ten seconds. It's a count to the number 10. A ref will use their own judgement during the count to see if the boxer can carry on safely.  In this case, he made the correct decision to elongate it slightly because he saw that Tyson had miraculously recovered quickly. One of the best decisions I've seen in boxing. Please stop with the 10 seconds bs. That doesn't exist.
Fury was listening to the referee counting and got up at 8... its the referee's count to 10, not 10 seconds. Joe should know that.
I thought joe knew boxing? its not a 10 second count its a 10 count. Also both times wilder got knocked down it was longer than 10 seconds.  Also why is most of this clip about deontay wilder? Fury is the greatest heavyweight of this era and hes obsessing over wilder?
Im not sure ,but I heard its ab10 count not a 10 second count.
Joe thats incorrect. How long you been around boxing. Read the rule
Check the rules  Your wrong  It’s the refs discretion as soon as the standing opponent moves  Wilder changed corners  Do your homework Joe Stop fuckin around in goofy space suits and get your head out of your ass. NASA… lol  Get a fuckin grip
Joe making more wilder excuses than wilder now 🙄 fury won and would win 10/10 guys. Get real
That is 100 percent incorrect Joe  Rules are that if the referee has to tell and remind the fighter to go to which ever corner he needs to be at , the count is stopped  The referees in Vegas go into the fighters locker rooms and explain that to the fighter  In this instance , the ref had to stop the count to tell wilder to get back into his corner . That’s the correct rule.
Joe Rogan needs to talk to Big John McCarthy. He's wrong about the slow count
"when fury got dropped we all thought it was over" Nope.  We all knew fury would win by hook or crook because hes so much mentally stronger than wilder. Anyone who knows boxing knew fury was gonna win
its a 10 count not a 10 second count
"Look at his fat ripple" 😭😂
NO LOVE FOR FURY HERE  xxxxx
Tyson Fury the champ..I don't think the heavyweight division has been exciting since I was like 15 and im 37 now though.
That fight was not one of the grearest heavy weight fights ever. The hell you on Joe?
You can tell there aren’t many boxers in chat but fighting someone even 20lbs heavier is an enormous disadvantage. Both are great fighters but I’d call Tyson a super heavy weight
I wonder if Joe is gonna play ESBC? I wonder what boxer he would play?
It was a damn good fight, there was not a long count. It's not 10 seconds Fury waited he is a smart fighter he got up in time.
Joe needs to stay in his own wheelhouse.   The rules state: "When a knockdown occurs, the downed boxer's opponent shall go to the furthest neutral corner and remain there while the count is being made.  "The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner."
Wilder is the GREATEST EVER according to you guys lol lol lol
I wish Wilder and Joshua would fight next. Both have something to prove again.
Joe, it's a refs count to ten not a ten second count. Slow or fast it is what it is. Also there is always somebody keeping the count at the side of the ring who the ref can look to if he needs it but also if the boxer doesn't move to the neutral corner and stay there after the knocking his opponent down the ref shouldn't start the count.
or maybe your too high Joe. The ref count is just a count, there is no seconds writen in queensberry rules.
Fury was listening to the count.... certain numbers really trigger him.
Even if the ref had picked up the ringside count fury still would of got up at 8 or 9 no sooner for the most time to recover and still chinned wilder all counts were the same
Its not an error the count the rules are the count cannot be started until the other fighter is in the neutral corner
Tyson was born at one pund!   6’ 9”  280
Jamie was so happy when joe asked for his opinion on the fight 😂😂 joe is slowly treating Jamie better.
He's sort of like if Connor wasn't a cock.
Should re name this "joe rogan sucks off bronze bummer" 😂
Damn. Hella monologue
"it's Chinese words or whatever"
It took 15 seconds for the ref to count to 8. It dont take all that extra time to tell a fighter to go back to their corner.
Wilder is still a beast! Respect to both fighters!
i think the best combination of power and skill in boxing history was mike tyson. His punches were laser sharp and deadly. unforutnately, when you are given one thing, you often lose another. Holyfield was able to use his even greater skill, reach, and IQ to keep tyson down. There is always something to greatness beyond natural talent.
Deontay’s primary issue is CONDITIONING! He looked ok in the first round. But once he gets tired, everything is out the door.
Time stamp in the episode?
Long count my arse
Dude foreman had 76_5__68 .68 fucking knockouts wtf u mean he's got the most.wilder is a one trick pony.any top fighter would just bully him and box his eyes out now Tired of this bullshit
But Fury  was never OUT ! lol lol
Hahaha Joe you got that count rule wrong.  Once the ref takes up the count from the out of ring counter, that person stops counting. If the ref has to stop the count to deal with the other boxer the ref then continues his count from where he left off. They are the official rules. Plus seconds have nothing to do with it, it's a refs 10 count. And if you wanted to use a stop watch you'll discover when Wilder went down by the time the ref had counted to 8 for wilder it was approximately 15 seconds  the ref was consistent in how he does the count for both fighters, plus he followed the rules exactly whilst doing the count. There is no controversy other than what wilder fan boys are creating.
Why these guys wearing astronaut outfits?
if you got any sense you'll get up on one knee to the count of eight, then stand up.
Uno this name is Luke Tyson furry lol
SMH he need to end the Spotify deal
He was named after Mike Tyson
That fight was great. I need to see Ruiz and Fury in the ring next!
Jamie's soy levels are so high he can only yell at Fortnite these days. 😂👌
8:52 - right, thats the thing.. Fury was basically ready to get up anyway and was just riding it out for the rest... so he just took advantage of the refs screw up, rather than the ref giving him an extra chance.
Could easily flip that around and say that Wilder nuts will always find another excuse, as if not problems do occur in all directions all the time and like Wilder never benefited fro ma fluke, strange thing happening, need I really say more?  But also Tyson was never out in third fight, clear as a day he took the smart route and utilize the count cause frankly, why not recover as much as you can after getting stung decent? Use the given to you, he would have been up faster had the referee suddenly jumped 2 number forward, better believe that. The one sided bs repeated by a tiny minority looser on YT etc is often too crazy for me to even be entertained by, feel truly sorry for people living in that denial of a reality, a total fantasy world, some imaginary construct of reality itself. It's not nice to entertain sick people in their twisted beliefs, honest thing to do is to call it out off the bat and hence provide them with a t least a chance to reflect on the crazy being said?
Guess what Joe, beyonce got one hell of a break in the first Ortiz fight !!!! And if beyonce would have gone to a nuetral corner, this would not even be a conversation,  facts!!!
Buster Douglas had a long count to against Tyson it happens even so Fury was still aware and smart laying in the ground to get a breather and gather himself instead of popping right up smart man
It was awesome went to the movie theater to watch it only 12 people were there unfortunately if you aren't Canelo Alvarez most people don't care
Why didn’t Jamie look up the wbc rules for 10 count right away???? Conspiracy????
That dude in the Orange monkey suit has a TERRIBLE podcast voice. Good move by Joe to keep talking on this one.
We are now reaching new levels of bollocks. A Gypsy from the UK who lets face it, as a people aren't even liked in the UK get preferential treatment in America against an American. Yeah ok.
Just remember  The Dosser Beat The Charlie Zellenof  Tyson Fury has been ducking Charlie for years  The Dosser is the Real Goat
It would be useless to teach wilder footwork and the 40 KOs where nobodies and washed up bums. Wilder will not put the work in to be able to fight 12 rounds
Theres only ooooooooone Tyson Fury!!!
Total OBLITERATION of the dosser!!
What's with the tin foil shirt you look like a oven ready chicken 🐔 and 70s gay disco...
Wilder got a long count as well, went down 0.37, ref only waves him in at 0.20. Simple fact is that it is a 10 count and not a 10 second count
It don't take 5 seconds to tell a fighter to go back to the neutral corner. Tyson Fury's elbow hit the canvas with 17 seconds on the clock, count was finished with 2 seconds, and the bell was a few seconds late to end the round. The ref was counting. The ref took his time with the count, take a few seconds back and it was still a slow count.
Fury is down and listening to the count. If the count had been faster, fury would have gotten up sooner.
How dare you guys disrespect Duncan by putting unfunny tryhard Tony Hinchcliffe in an astronaut suit.
Did you get the vaccine man? Tim Dillon 😂
Fury is a giant heavyweight that can box and move like a middle or even a jr middleweight. Fury is the only good fighter Wilder has fought. Wilder fought 40 washed up bums before he finally fought Fury. It is a joke for Wilder or any Wilder fan to start making excuses yet again. I give credit where it is due. Wilder has great height, fast hands and great power. But he will not train appropriately. Watch all 3 Fury/Wilder fights. Wilder was tired in every fight by the 4th round. There’s a chance Wilder could have been great. But because he is lazy we will never know. And to say the ref gave Fury to much time to get up! Seriously? Don’t be soar losers. Be thankful Wilder doesn’t have brain damage. Then again he might have.
Glad to see that Jamie is let into more conversations.
You know joe high asf when he pull out the space suits 😂
Greatest fight every Joe. No Joe, super entertaining..no doubt!!!  Greatest every no.
What are the odds that they named Tyson Fury after Mike Tyson you ask?100% buddy.
Imagine having Tony on this much, he's useless
Can't believe Rogan fell for the countdown bullshit...Fury was conscious the whole time, he could have gotten up in a second if he wanted too!
Wilder was out on his feet from 8 on.
*Tyson Fury is the GREATEST Heavyweight boxer of all time. He'd of beat Ali and Tyson in their prime plus he is undefeated! He is a Living Legend!*
I've been an advid boxing fan for 50yrs without a doubt Fury is among the best of the best but what most forget is Ali's "prime" was stolen from him by the government. Just how great he could/would have been we can only guess at.
Don’t think Joe knows as much about boxing as everyone thinks
My god  dude was not that hurt.jesus joe
Deontay Wilder is literally the greatest boxer to ever walk this earth! I’m a Boxing savant I’ve seen them all come and go Wilder is the best over ever seen! Watch ESPN tonight and you’ll agree with me by the end of the show…Joe Rogan I’m still coming for you punk 👊🏾
He was named after tyson
It’s sad when a sports biggest problem is counting to 10
Come on Joe, Fury is great be hes no Ronda Rousey who Joe called the greatest female fighter of all time. lol
why are they all dressed like knob heads?
One fc
tbh best decision joes ever made was kicking redbans ass to the curb :/
They cheated him with that slow count I saw ref counted to 13
All sports are at some level corrupt, especially boxing.
Tony is right k1 has the overhead counter
Bullshit on the count. It has always been the same and that's why Rocky Marciarno used to run to the neutral corner, so the ref wouldn't stop the count
No the count stops the minute the ref gets the count from the timekeeper he takes over the count and it stops if he has to direct the other boxer to nurtral corner.  Geeeerz
Damn if only we could have a Mike Tyson x Tyson Fury fight wow
We need a forth.
Boxers are trained (to subconsciously) get up at the 8 count. Long count , short count ...most pro's will get up at 8 regardless
A count can be stopped if the other boxer isn't in the corner read the rules
Too cool got suits to get high n. Rocket man episode
Tyson Fury is not one of the greatest heavyweights of all time. Tyson Fury is just the great white hope.
When Wilder sees the stills it may be worse than the footage of the downfall
The two friends of Rogan that I can't stand.
Joe Rogan, professional fight commentator, lifelong boxing fan, doesn't know the 10 count rule. Figures.
The ref was well within the rules man. Plus even if the count had been long fury was still up in time either way. This sort of speculation takes away from the fight.
No one talks about tysons chin he has the baddest chin you just aint gonna knock him out
Fury's greatest strength is his internal strength. Incredible recuperative abilities.
Boxing matches have an official timekeeper who starts counting seconds as soon as a boxer is on the ground. At the same time, the referee pauses the fight, sends the other standing boxer to a neutral corner, and then picks up the count from the timekeeper. This is why you usually see the ref start counting at 3 or 4, and not 1.  Once the ref picks up the count, it’s up to them to finish at their pace. For example, if the standing boxer doesn’t stay in their corner then the ref will pause the count to give more time to the fallen boxer as a deterrence.  Notice that it’s called the 10-count rule and not the 10-second rule. The count doesn’t have to be exactly accurate, and it almost never is.  When the count is excessively long, it’s called a slow count or a long count, but it’s not illegal because it’s up to the ref, even if it causes a lot of controversy.
A great fight consists of two great fighters with more skill than throwing a particular pinch harder than anyone else.  No footwork,  no set up strategy, no ring generalship...nothing beautiful to watch that defines the "sweet science". To listen to people describe this fight I've been disappointed.  It was entertaining, there was alot of excitement...but a "great fight"?  ...Definitions differ I guess..  Ali/ Frazier.  ....Great Fight.   ..,two Great Fighters This fight had a little back and forth when Wilder landed a few in the fourth but other than that it was one sided and the threat of a nasty punch was present.... ..to me, if it were a great fight, a fighter would probably have to do more than one thing that I could appreciate during the fight, not just one thing that would end it.  Tyson fought a great fight..that is true.
Tony talking about combat is like Schaub talking about comedy
i thought you distanced yaself from hinchcliffe the racist, bro brogan?
I think the Showing the Numbers and countdown was STREET FIGHTER 😂
Who bets some mma rag takes joes "this is the best fight we've ever seen" to suggest hes saying fu to mma.... 3...2....1....
Jeff Mayweather spoke on the ref count. He thought it was fair and did not see any issues.
So there have been 3-times where there were slow counts with Tyson Fury benefiting from extra time.  Technically, Wilder won the first fight and the 3rd match is debatable whether he could have continued without the extra few seconds.  There was just about an equal amount of knockdown for both fighters but there was NO controversy when Wilder got up.
IMO, Fury let Wilder get to the 11th to punish him. I don't think Fury was ever hurt. Look at the 2 knockdowns. The first wasn't from a punch and the 2nd was mostly a pulldown.
Joe Rogan is correct about the Wilder weight in Fight 1. He was barely above Light HW. However he looked the best in that fight and I’d urge that he actually won that fight. Wilder is a natural Light HW and could rule that division.     Sadly, if Wilder stays a HW in a division occupied by Fury, he could end up dead prematurely. I fear that Wilder may have already suffered irreparable injuries in these 3 fights with Fury. Fury is a freak of nature. That third fight was one of the greatest HW Fights ever in the ring.      The second fight was the best, however. Both men were in top condition and well trained & prepared.
No joe, that is not how a 10 count works. Don't speak on what you don't know when you have such a large platform and the influence of thousands.  1. It's a 10 count, not a 10-second count. 2. A ref can stop the count if the other fighter is not in the neutral corner and continue from where they left off. 3. The count that is being questioned was Wilders second "knockdown" which was a result of an illegal punch. 4. Wilder also got "long counts" when he was knocked down.
Read the rules uncle Joe mintball head.
How I see it is, it was the right call made by the ref because end of day Tyson came back and won. To count him out there would have been a worse decision
Fury's Dad named him after Mike Tyson. Fax.
Not long count
Tonys voice is like nails on a chalk board
Crazy to think too that Tyson Fury was born 3 months premature. Had to fight from the moment there was light. GOAT
Young Jamie with the on point instant replay 👏
Hinchcliffe will go down as the worst comedian ever.
His name is luke
There's not enough time for Wilder to learn how to box like Chavez
Rogan, stick to your business empire, Rocky Marciano KO'd 43 of 49 opponents, record of 49-0
Wrong Joe. Ref is supposed to pick up the count from where he left off in cases where he has to interrup his count to instruct the other boxer to return to the neutral corner.  The timekeeper's role ceases when the ref picks up the timekeepers count at the beginning when he starts counting.  The ref is God in the ring.  The ref did it right. Anyone who says otherwise is just ignorant of the official rules of the WBF.  You can look this up.
The craziest off-the-floor comeback in history is when Holmes rose from the dead after taking Earnie Shavers right cross, that was truly insane
It took me 1 minute and 8 seconds to say wtf joe wearing
Joe: Look at that fat roll down Me: *fetches microscope*
Joe "There's not  A SINGLE GUY who has knocked out as many guys as Deontay Wilder has."  Archie Moore with 132 KOs "Am I a joke to you...."
Joe, wrong on the count situation. If the ref has to stop his count to send someone to the neutral corner then the count stops. If the ref picks up the count having originally sent a fighter to the corner then it's different. Come on Joe, stop trying to create controversy
Ya but if the opposition needs to be told to get away. It’s on him for screwing things up
Seeing the space suits makes me miss my man Duncan Trussel.
A memorable heavyweight fight but dude! Not “one of the greatest fights of all time” please!
Wilder blaming the long count for his loss, just another excuse, fury wasn't that hurt that he couldn't get up two seconds sooner, he's just a sore loser.
so if it went to points? who would have won?
Joe really knows how to wrap it up  ☺️glad he wasn’t wearing saran  wrap 😳
Should there be a fourth fight tho? Just because of how great of a show these two warriors give us!
Looked like a Rocky movie that fight!
Ball sacks
btw rocy machiano ko 43from 49 so wilder record is not the best
I don’t like wilder much anymore cause when he loses he doesn’t accept it and he has no sportsmanship, but other then that wilder came in so freakin huge!! He did way better then his last fight which means he actually got better at boxing. I just think that on a boxers level that if fury is #1 then wilder is #2 cause who other then fury can beat wilder???? Especially after the trilogy and him being so big no one else other then fury can beat him.
Lets implement this exact 10 second count rule so we can be robbed of great fights by bullshit technicalities! Thats proper boxing, thanks Joe! Ok Joe, would you of ended the Lawler Askren fight because of the rules? Askren was fucked
Tyson moved brilliantly and went at him , amazing 👍☘️🇮🇪
Fury benefited from a ref that not only counted long, but also didn't care  about headlocks.
Simple fact was when somebody finally took a punch from Wilder and got back up, Wilder would be in trouble.
Anyone know why I can't find the video of Rogan calling out the liars at CNN on Rogans own channel?
fact check: there are fighters with WAY more knockouts then Wilder. BUT, there is no one with his ratio. Going into his first fight with Fury he was 42-0-0, with 41 wins by knock out. thats just absurd. For me, he has proved himself as undoubtedly the hardest puncher in boxing history. Harder than Tyson, harder than Morrison, harder than Moore, harder than Baer, harder than anyone to ever step through the ropes. But he also has some of the worst technique. Makes his whole story that much more impressive though, that he could starch anyone with one punch at anytime. Doesn't need a combination, and usually doesn't need to finish the job, one punch is all it takes with over 95% of his opponents. Pretty incredible what he accomplished, and to me, he is still the probably the second best HW on the planet right now, and the guy he lost to is a guy who could go toe to toe with any legend you want to mention.
I still don't understand why refs can't just have literally a stop watch and then click it when a fighter goes down and then click it when the fighter gets up
when you think youre drippin....
Been waiting for this
Folks appreciate Tyson Fury now while he’s around I’m in my 60,s and trained young amateur boxers for over 40 years. I have never seen a boxer including Ali that tries so hard to entertain the public he feels he owes you something. Tyson Fury would beat any heavyweight in history . The only one that I would give a small chance would be Lennox Lewis.
Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson. Not a coincidence. Tyson Fury was born premature and his father named him Tyson because he pulled through and was a fighter.
3 Americans making excuses for the American……………shock
Rogan with the shiney happy funky top. It's so easy on the eyes
The count stops if the referee has to tell the fighter to go to his corner after he has started. This is a clear-stated rule Joe is wrong
Notice how this fight went all the way to the 11th round and Tyson Fury’s left hand wasn’t flapping around and showing through the bottom of his glove, and his knuckles weren’t protruding through his right glove. This is what happened during their 2nd fight which is a clear indication that he tampered with his gloves so Wilder could feel more of his knuckles during the second fight.
Wilder is a punk
Fury was listening to the count though. he can only react to what he hears. The second count did seem long but he was listening to it. Wilder got a moment to get his senses in rd10 too. I thought the ref did ok, he could have stopped in rd10 but Wilder scored with shots in the closing moments so fair play to the ref
Wasn't very excited for a 3rd fight between the two. Figured it would be essentially a re-run of the same fights as before, and it was. Both are great boxers but Fury is just on another level.
Fury was eyes on the ref and ears on the count. Ref slow yes, but nothing to do with Tyson. The big criminal was Malik Scott letting a onslaught continue to a brutal knock out
How cool I live in Youngstown Ohio we love you Ray Boom Boom
FYI its luke fury  aka tyson fury  ;)
Only thing I heard wilder why talk about him he’s done nobody cares on to the king Tyson
Tony.H might as well be a brick wall. Probably the worst podcast guess ever.
Waaaaaaaaw!
If Joe Rogan is lying about the rules of the boxing count, why should we trust him about ivermectin, or anything? 😅
Joe looks like a burrito 🌯
If you ask me... the guy with the 50 pound advantage was supposed to win.
Why doesn't Joe invite Jamie to watch the fight?
3 out of 3 for Fury, Wilder is not even close to the same level. Fury is one of the best heavy weights to ever live
Listen... Close your eyes... I hear it.... Redbar is coming to get....you... Red....bar....red..... bar.....
It was an okay fight found it to be a one sided beat down, not even close as people make out to be. Wilder only had a punches chance. He really only had 1 good round, and Fury wasn't even hurt. Wilder was gassed out majority of time, predictable punchers, no movement & stiff. One of the best KO's in boxing history!
I hope Rogan sees this, since he was talking about the referees long count....look at this fight.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-nMJ4hWM4s    ......guy is crooked bastard.
I regret not watching it live
While someone else has noted the rule in which the ref can stop the count in order to correct the standing fighter and the continue where he left off, Tyson was aware of what was happening. It’s not ten seconds, it’s a ten count, there is a difference. I might be a Fury fanboy but to me that second knockdown felt more like Fury taking the 8 count, knowing the round was nearly done and just avoiding another big punch. Either that or the punch that put him down was back of the head so really it shouldn’t have been ruled a knockdown. Besides if you count from the time he goes down to when he gets up it’s within 10 seconds, it’s a tight but it’s 10. If the the ref wasnt made to stop the count due to Wilders error, I still believe fury would have gotten up. Ah well, great fight and like all great fights, people will find an issue. Or spend 15 minutes talking about how great the 3x loser was.
Man these days Joe just seems to waffle and waffle without ever saying anything. Seems a like a different show from the good old days tbh...
Definitely one of the best trilogies ever.  But joe....  Fat rippling can be done easily. I can smack my chest and watch the ripple.Im not super fat.fats jiggly .  Make someone’s fat ripple is not much of a feat.
Tyson talks exactly like his dad I can't tell them apart
This guest don’t deserve a space suit.
Deontay hasn’t been back on the podcast for a reason.
Jamie looks confused and worried that Joe's going to beat on him after the show raps up 😂
There's been controversy after ever fights...take your pick of excuses
Every American analysis on this fight is how great Wilder was. He was basically a walking punchbag.
Let’s go Brandon
In my opinion, Fury could have gotten up, but he also knows the rules of boxing and Deontay doesn't know them entirely. He should have known about the neutral corner rule and that its the referees count. Fury took advantage of it and got up at his own pace. Its the same thing with every sport. Some players know some rules and others know ALL the rules and take advantage of the rules if it comes to them. I don't think there should be this big of a controversy when the ref was just doing his job. Plus the better boxer won that night.
10 count aint 10 seconds count, Joe should know
If you watch the fight Fury still got up within real time ten seconds not tye refs count
No error, no corruption. It’s a ten count, not ten seconds. Some states’ boxing commissions do require ten seconds coordinated with side time keeper, but not Nevada. It’s a simple ten count.
Yes there is a rule.. Wilder has to get into a neutral corner so no you are wrong Joe he can start the count again if the fighter wont get in the corner.. The only corruption is Americans doing cheat theories. Would all these theories be floating out here if Wilder had won, no i don't think so......
Come on joe,  the rules are not that way for the count
Please look at Wilders opponents and tell me everyone in this comment section wouldn’t knock out 25 of them cmon!
They keep talking about the slow count for Fury, but the ref did the same thing with Wilder. I don’t see any corruption there, just human error. If you want to see corruption at its finest, watch the scoring for the first Fury vs. Wilder fight.
I like to think when joe watches a fight at home he still shouts “OH HE’S HURT”
"Scousers don't get knocked out, we crack on!" Paddy Pimblett
The count doesn't start until the fighter is in a neutral corner.
Shame 50% of this is about such a non-issue like the count. Its down to the ref to decide the count, know one else.  Yes it was slow but Tyson was 100% beating both those counts and the ref knew that. When its so clear a fighter is going to beat the count, who cares how long the count is! The fighter is going to continue. Total non-issue that now mentioned on a very popular podcast, will sully the fight for some.
Fury was sitting up looking back at him. It was fine. The count was not a problem really
Americans trying to come up with excuses cause the gypsy kings better
I mean yeah, your understanding of the count is incorrect
6’9 , 277lbs throwing bombs 😵‍💫😵‍💫
He got battered. If you could teach wilder footwork lol.  What a stupid stoner question.  His 41 victories were mostly road sweepers cmon.
It's almost like Joe is pissed that Fury won.
Joe, review the count rules before you babble.   another thought.. The competition that Deonte Wilder faced in order to get the belt in the first place was not at the same level that many of the greats have faced.
Fun yes, the best not even, it was only one boxer in that ring and that was Fury, the fact that Wilder could put him out an any moment due to his power make the fight intense yes, but the low level of skill of Wilder make no sense,  it be even unjust if he would keep winning fights base on only power,  I can see that in MMA but since I admire boxing and a good boxing match this fight was just fare in it own right.
I need to know... does Joe Rogan think Deontay Wilder hits hard?
Chuff me hahaha hahaha hahaha Americans literally haven't got a clue about boxing. Tyson futy was named after Mike tyson. Waaaw.!
The referee was slow in 10 count in round 10 for wilder and he called doctor in for start at 11.
I was on the cusp of Tyson, Mike.  Never born durint Ali's reign. But I saw Anderson Silva and Conor. (And Canelo)
Wilder has little talent when it comes to boxing.  Power, yes...in spades. But, a good, BIG boxer will beat him. If one loves the Sweet Science he/she will find rooting for him lacking in satisfaction. It's ugly. Fury, conversely, is a masterful boxer with a high  boxing IQ, who can still take guys out. Even watching him go 12 rounds is enjoyable, something not all classic boxers can pull off.  I love the little "hop" Fury does before feigning or launching his classic one/two. He is light on his feet for a guy that size. Great fighter. Wilder,  not so much, albeit kudos for his raw power.
I've seen the ref receive high praise from people in the sport.
Does anyone else think Tony is completely fake as f. Dude thinks he is the shit and the best thing ever. However is annoying as f and isn't even funny. Jmo.
Joe didn’t watch the fight he’s lying  He was on a fishing trip
Teach him how to move like Mike Tyson and my god wilder would run everything
Nobody thinks its 10 seconds. Its based on how the fighter reacts to the count.
13:37 According to Joe, Wilder has knocked out more guys than any other boxer in the history of the sport??😂😂  Vitali Klitschko has tied Wilder with 41 KOs and he isn't even the good brother Nevermind other greats like George Foreman who is closer to doubling that number, absolutely ridiculous
I like Tyson and he’s better than wilder but he got a 15 count twice
always an excuse when fury wins
I'm English and a big fan of Fury, but he's not an all time great yet. He's only fought 2 major fighters which are Klitschko and Wilder. Yes, he totally schooled both of them but his fight CV is very thin outside of those two names and for the record, I don't and never have rated Wilder.  He's had ample opportunity to fight people who are in the upper eschelons of the Heavyweight division but has instead taken lesser opponents. I don't say this is Fury's fault, I'm fairly confident in saying that he'll fight anyone and beat them but the team(promoters) around him chose the easier and less competitive route.  If you want to see what an all time greats resume should look like, you need look no further than the man who was a co-commentator for the fight, Lennox Lewis. That man beat every single top contender of his era, except for Riddick Bowe(who ducked Lewis so blatantly). If Fury can add wins over Joshua, Whyte and Usyk to his resume then his status as an all time great will be worthy of conversation.  And god damn it, stop talking shit about the ten count. It's not a ten second count, it's a ten count.
NO! You’re RIDICULOUSLY WRONG, Joe! 1. The count DOES NOT continue with the timekeeper at ringside, getting picked up by the referee after he made sure the other fighter’s in the neutral corner. 2. It’s NOT timed in seconds… it’s the REFEREE’S COUNT! This is a POPULAR MISCONCEPTION! 3. When Wilder went down in round 3, he got about 20 (time) seconds!!! 4. When Fury went down he was LUCID and aware of everything and waiting his time to get up… he’d have gotten up in time even on a fast count! When Wilder went down in the previous round, his eyes were closed and he was groggy. Hence why the doctor came in and hence why he got about a full 20 seconds! There was NO ‘long count’ on Fury!
Wrong on the count joe. Correct about cnn and their lies.
its embarrassing when joe goes on these expert tangents despite talking out his ass..
Someone call Jah!
My guys, what's up with the suits? Like some kind of running gag? I'm so confused xD
This fight is NO WERE near top 100 HW fights of all time. Reality. These 2 guys would not of lasted 6 rounds in the HW division in the 80s or 90s. Mike Tyson said he wants to have an Exhibition against Fury a month back. Wonder if he's got the Balls Roy Jones at least did.
any kind o fighting ur talkin bout,he's an expert lol
Cant wait for LDBC to grab this clip of Joe Rogan talking about the slow count as evidence that Wilder was cheated again
If the counting wasnt that slow, tyson would have gotten up faster
Yeah, Joe's wrong about the referee/ringside counter counting for the knockdowns. Because think about it, if the standing fighter takes so long to get to a neutral corner that the ringside counter gets to 10 before the referee can pick up the count, is the referee supposed to wave the fight over? Is the downed fighter supposed to be watching the timekeeper?  Basically, the referee gets to determine what the count is in a given situation. Plenty of refs will count even if the standing fighter isn't in the neutral corner. It only really becomes an issue if the referee's count is egregiously long, or comically fast, or inconsistent between the two fighters.
Joe rocking a tin foil suit
Usain Bolt is the most fitting name of all time
Making excuses for the american failed boxer. Fury waited each time until eight.
Joe, your compatriot got beaten badly. The US referee said so, the trainer said so, the ex heavyweights said so, the fans said so and the boxer said so. Never in history such a great talent got beaten so badly. Not once, not twice but 3 times. Remember the name, “Tyson Furyyyyyyyyyyyyy!” from 🇬🇧. God save the Queen 👑. Pay respect and stop being a bad loser.
Fury was not "hurt" at all when he was down and didn't show any signs of being exhausted or stunned. Zero. He kept sitting longer than 10 seconds simply because he was allowed to.
he was named after tyson
The ref and his counts seemed fair and consistent for both fighters, to me.  Hell of a fight all around
His folks named him after Mike Tyson. It isn't a coincidence. His folks are like actual gypsies. But great fight, I do think the fight got stale after the fourth round.
I'm not a fury fan at all....but when he went down he was still there. I think he went down to slow the fight. Look at how wilder body language was after fury got up the second time....he was beat his heart sank and it reminded me of rocky when apolo knocks rocky down and like distraught he keeps coming lol
that's joe should be doing and talk about Marijuana..stay away from trying to explain to a NEUROSURGEON( that was a candidate to being a POTUS doctor) what "GAIN-OF-FUNCTION" is...that was ridiculous ...leave science to scientist
One of the greatest matches ever pfft there are honestly 1000s of better fights, don't get me wrong it was a Frankenstein fest nothing as violent as we use to see
Look forward to joes breakdowns of big fight breakdowns until i see hes speaking with people like tony kreisher segura etc haha
Until your in a neutral  corner there is no count or the count is stopped lol that's fact
It's a good job Joe knows fuck all about boxing
I don’t think Deontay needs great skill, but he seems a little more skilled than a Toughman fighter. If he had Razor Ruddock boxing skill he would be super special. We can say something about every great fighter though.
Dude how many times has Wilders ear bled after these fights, he might end up brain damaged
Imagine if Hearns trained Wilder. That ability to move and jab and utilize both arms.
The part where you was saying he hurt him later was the end of the 10th when Wilder made his last big stand with a late rally nothing but respect to Wilder a true warrior
When is Eric Dubay coming on joe?
Wilder kept leaving the corner, that’s why he kept stopping
Sorry Joe you’re wrong on this one It’s a 10 count, not 10 seconds  Daniel Cormier doesn’t know boxing either  It al goes according to the ref. Not the timekeeper
I don't think he's one of the best of all time.  We're just in an age of heavyweight mediocrity or less. Wilder has absolutely no boxing skills except for a powerful right punch.  That's a God-given ability.  He doesn't even know how to set it up.  Fury is a great boxer with great recuperative abilities and can take a punch.  The 40 pounds of extra weight wore down Wilder as in the other fights and will in every fight they ever make.  Pressure wears everything down.
Fury: "you lost like a man" Wilder: "your not my real dad!"
Joe, you need to lay off the weed. It is clearly affecting your mind. Also, Fury was not going to loose even after those 2 knockdowns.
The counts are way to long but the lose was legit
I just watched all 4 counts live with timers. Both fighters were up in plenty of time for each of their 2 knockdowns. The 2nd fury count was indeed slightly longer but nowhere near knockout long. The counts between both fighters were consistent for the fight. To be more specific, the shortest count was 11 seconds to reach 8 on Fury's 1st down. The longest was 14 on Fury's 2nd down. However, Fury was completely standing on 6 of that count. Both of Wilder's counts were 12 seconds at 8 count.   The average fight resume time was 21.5-22 seconds throughout the fight. The exact seconds were 20 and 24 for Wilder downs, while 20 and 23 for Fury downs. Fair fight.
Fury won cause he knows JESUS not some bum ass “ancestors”
I’ve trained 6 months for this fight, and I loose because of 2 seconds 🤨
Deontay Wilder Lost 3 time to the same man.  That is consistent.
Joe is making this fight seem like it was close, it wasn’t. Fury literally destroyed Wilder and the only round Wilder had a chance was round 4. Wilder looked drunk and was just swinging late into the fight
Can we get a young Jamie interview while redban produces? It’s what we all want!
wilder should hire lomachenko's dad
Wouldn't it be refreshing for Joe to actually read the rules of boxing and actually use the podcast to dimiss this long count horseshit rather than ignorantly lean into it.
Joe is right on that count. So many fights have happened where a guy was totally smashing an opponent and then got his ass knocked out or down. Everyone who isn't agreeing that the count was off is just saying that because Tyson is a better boxer then Wilder and they favor him for it. The fact is that if the ref had done a proper count, Fury would've been out! And if the ref had just done his job correctly, we could've had a monster of a 4th fight! That's 2 fights now Fury has had that he was knocked out by Wilder. If Wilder was white and Fury was blk, everyone would be screaming that Fury was knocked out. By that I mean all the race fans of Fury. They don't even care about Fury! Just happy a white guy beat a blk guy. This is just for the "race fans". I'm about fairness, and Fury was knocked out it the 2nd fight and should've been counted out in the 2nd. Now Joe does make a point of if Tyson could've gotten up on time if he heard the right count. But we'll never know, and that's the part that left a bad taste. Still one of the best fights I've seen, even when compared to the old classics. Fury is a excellent boxer and has tricks for days that Wilder wasnt ready for. Those uppercut on the inside fucked Wilder up! He kept walking into Furys jab and straight. And where the 🤬 was Wilders defense! Much respect to Wilder for getting this fare with his heart and with what skill he possess.
Love how 3 ass whooping n a row equals "the greatest trilogy fight" n history gtfoh.. fury n a league of his own.. 3rd fight shouldn't have even happened.
Americans like to reach. It’s embarrassing.
Tyson Fury has said his dad named him after his favorite boxer, Mike Tyson
Hated listening to joe on this one….
Count didn't matter because Fury isn't getting up anyway until he hears 8-9 whether he counted too fast or too slow, no reason to get up any sooner.
Imho Fury would retire from boxing if a digitally displayed counter was implemented..
Who cares about climate change or getting energy if we have Joe’s jacket and forehead !
Hands down, Frank Cappuccino is the BEST referee boxing had ever had.
appreciate you keeping it 💯 on all subjects boxing 🥊 is starting to take a dive with all the loop holes. Question is would Tyson have gotten up because Tyson is a smart fighter and perhaps he knows he can use that down time to rest given how loose boxing rules are. Great fight
Fury waited to get up at around 7-8 regardless of what ever horse 🐴 shit 💩 long count bollox you waffle about
Didn't wilder get knocked down too? How did the ref count then? Was Tyson in the corner or was he still near Wilder ?
Yall are just talkin shit at this point. Tyson won fair and square
just give deontay another excuse why don't ya!
Rogans take on this fight is pretty solid.
epic
Ugh - Regardless of rules or count Fury is listening to the ref - sooooo end of story.       Pls no more excuses or conspiracy theories.  2 GREAT Fighters, one a bit better than the other.   My biggest issue is the lack of sportsmanship by Wilder after.  I'm not a fighter so I can't grasp the emotions but man, he is so animated when he KOs everyone else but when it's his turn - lack of grace and excuses.  Not that it matters but he kind of lost me as a fan after last 2fights.
Fury beats Wilder 9 times out of 10. Hes just that much better.
People acting like fury was on his back with his eyes closed. If the ref continued counting Fury would have gotten up quicker. Plus wilder left his corner. Crazy how after 3 fights taht fury dominated he still got "controversy" around him. Well atleast real boxing fans know what's up.
Joe Rogan= Nuance for Dullards
Joe will literally say anything but the obvious fact that Fury is the superior fighter, through and through, as if two rematches isn’t enough to prove that somehow. Wilder won’t need to come up with insane excuses at this rate. Reminds me of the Blachowicz vs. Adesanya fight, it becomes so obvious when he shows clear bias for his wanted outcome.
Joe Rogan just opened a door for the Wilder fan boys 🤦‍♂️ “see even joe rogan said wilder won. Fury cheated he has the complexion for tha protection”
Days are numbered.
rule says ref can not start to count before fighter is in neutral cornor. and if he dont go ref dont start to count before hes there. no stopwatch would help with that problem
real boxing fans have seen casuals fall in love with these big punchers with limited skill sets (liston, iron mike, wilder) knowing they'll eventually be found out by a real boxer & create a million excuses for them, most of us are too young to know about the excuses they gave liston, but we all know about mike & his legendary 'prime' where he only fought certified bums (was even favourite to beat holyfield even after his 'prime') & nw wilder a guy who can't box, is 36, nvr faced a top opponent b4 fury & now has a slowmo/telegraphed right hand that will NVR land in pro boxing again. His opponents were either: smaller than him, coming off a long lay off, brutality knocked out a couple times or older than him. So good bye casuals, in 10 yrs we'll fight again on social media when u eventually make a 'prime' unstoppable wilder. Plus IF he fights again more guys take that shot better that also happens to exposed punchers
Yea if Wilder  just a tiny tiny little bit better he could be the GOAT easily.  Ive never seen a fighter with a cannon like wilders
Joe is right.
I was actually thinking about this the other day.  It almost seems as if these two were destined to meet and give us this trilogy from birth just based off their names.  Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder.  Like, those aren’t just normal names you see every day lol.  Both giants.  Both fearless.  Both unique, warrior like names.  It was was destiny.
I’m not 100% Joe, does Wilder hit hard? Did you cover that? 🤔😂
What is joe wearing🤣
Lol Tony, Tyson's real name is Luke. It's not a cosmic coincidence.
Joe look at the rules for the count
Loved Laura Beitz on the show a few months back. Cool that they actually hang out
Fury Vs Usyk  Wilder Vs AJ  Whyte Vs Ruiz
Drop NASA  Pick-up Jesus Christ
joe watch fight again in real time and add your own timer , hes up by 9 seconds , ignore refs count do your own
count was not wrong, it have always been like that
Joe out of all these boxing experts you should know better man Wilder wasn’t on neutral corner that’s why the ref started counting from 5 again, it was Wilders fault, if he was in his neutral corner than it would of been long count ,  Before spreading fake news do ur research man ,
Wilder knocked Fury out twice. In the 1st and 3rd fight. They gave Fury long counts  because he has the Complexion for Protection. They let him get away with being a drug cheat and used masking agents to cover the use of PEDs - that’s why he could recover and last those rounds. Plus did you see the gloves? The gloves were already broken into and no padding. Smfh 🤦‍♂️
Look at the these commentators, so high.. 🤣 🤣 🤣
Ron white definitely sounds like he inhales cigars
WRONG, the timekeeper depends on the ref. Joe got it the wrong way around.   Boxers typically run to the neutral corner, specifically so that the count happens ASAP and isnt interrupted.
One of the greatest BOXING matches of all time??? Come on lol one guy (Wilder) can't even box, no head movement, no faints, no combination punches, no parrying shots w his gloves, no balance, no jab, no stamina , literally nothing but a right hand 😂
Only Rogan can pull of bringing on 2 experts to talk about covid and vaccines and in the same week do a podcast wearing a fuckin space suit 😂
Why on earth does a count matter when the guy is up and ready to go
Japanese wrestling has a faster 20 count than the American variation. Tony might have been thinking about that.
The counter ringside is only if the ref hasn't started the rules say the ref can stop the count and start again from the same point.
Tyson Fury said blocking Wilder's jab felt like someone hitting his palm with a hammer, insane.
Fury would would have got up sooner but He took his time getting up when the ref had his fingers stuck in his face.
Not the rule Joe.  The referee will pick up the count from the timekeeper after he directs the other fighter to the neutral corner.  The referee is allowed to stop the count if the other fighter comes out of the neutral corner, which is exactly what happened.  It is also a 10 count not a 10 second count.  These are boxing rules the referee will explain to each fighter in the dressing room prior to the fight.
I am so glad that a good ref counted fully the first fight.
Glad Joe brought it up Wilder won that fight the ref screwed up
Joe stop it, you quote one butt hurt guy about the slow count..come on man, wilder legs was jelly after round 3.. wilder was well beaten..
He came up with the name Tyson Fury that’s not his real name
@8:20 Is Tony confusing Super Punch-Out! on the SNES with real life?!
Joe "I'd make bad calls all the time never let me be a refere" Rogan
Tyson isn't his real name though is it. His name is Luke Fury LOL
Joe looks so high man haha
Fury followed the count.   if the count was faster hed have got up faster.... if the count was slower he'd have got up slower.
Tyson Fury is the best HW of this era but not of all time. Joe is so full of shit this is the guy that thought Ronda Rousey was the greatest thing ever.
The second fight wasnt stopped by the referee Wilder’s corner threw in the towel …why did it seem like Joe was blaming the ref?
Joe when your fighting no bodies, bums you can do that... Take out Fury and Ortiz, name another decent fighter he has fought?...
I like Joe but he needs to stop when he doesn’t know. A lot of fools listen to everything he says and think it’s facts
Sorry Joe love ya your wrong they only take the count from the side judge to start if a fighter leaves his corner he stops redirects and picks up where he left off that's the actual rule which us exactly what he did and he told the guys that in the locker room and deontay wasn't even In the right corner
Does this mean that Wilder should have won?
Wasn't a long count ref had to stop count due to wilder no going to neutral corner. Joe always gets boxing rules wrong lmao
It's surprising how clueless Joe is when it comes to boxing rules
Y’all complaining about joe not knowing how things work and speaking on it haven’t realized he does this with everything?
Typical Joe Rogan, going on and on about how great Wilder is and how controversial decisions go Fury’s way… and yet Wilder still lost… again.
Tyson 'the bullet dodger' fury
Lost my voice for first time in any sport ever that night never had that experience before!
EARL HEBNER should have been the Fury vs Wilder Matches Ref.
Shiiiiiit I woke up my whole house and my neighbors 1/4 mile away 🤣
Gotta agree with Joe....when Wilder throws a right cross in an arena in Vegas, for example, his elbow cocks back to St. Loius.
Is this a bit Joe does where he asks a guest who clearly has no interest in the fight game whether he watched the fights or not. First it was Bert and now it is this bird looking man Tony right here
fury maywather vs paul` d wilder carried him fakes to falls to keep it interesting. i promise
joe “smoke crack and listen to techno “ rogan
Don’t believe that’s the rules. The side line count is solely for the initial start of the count after a guy goes down and the ref is telling everyone where to go etc. I don’t believe the side line ref is involved after that point. The ref can interrupt the count of the opponent isn’t doing what they should be doing.
Tony sounds like my mom trying to do a Fran Drescher impression.
Fury was still up before 10 with the ring side count so Fury still knocked his ass out
Tyson Fury was named after Mike Tyson
Joe really is good at bullshitting about how much he knows about boxing when it comes to facts
How has Redban been around Rogan for this many years and claims to not be familiar with the phrase "queer street"....
Joe theres like 20 guys that have KO'd more guys than Wilder has jfc
Should've taken Floyd up on his offer. He let his pride stop himself from training with one of the most technical and defensive boxers of all time. That skill set added to Wilder's insane power would have been a real problem.
There is no 10 second rule, it's a ten count at the referees discretion.
Fury won stop taking away from the champ
When fury went down the second time. According to the clock on the t.v. fury was on the ground at least 10 or 11 second. Watch the 4th  round clock.
Pacquiao has 39 knockouts
I want a cigar now
Fury has said it himself, "I'm a generational fighter" and he's right.  I missed Ali, I saw Iron Mike.  Fury is on that level.
There is only ONE true God, of creation. Quit with the idolatry BS
WTF told these clowns a 10 count means 10 second count!!!!!
Long count, maybe, BUT....keep in mind Tyson is sitting there listening to him count. If he needed to get up quicker, he could and would have.
He obviously doesn't hit hard enough!!  Nah I knew Fury was gonna get up, as much as I like Joe, sometimes (not very often) he chats doo doo.  Fury's chin is on a next level, he took loads of Wilders heavy rights in all 3 fights.  The ring side counter doesn't keep counting as it is in the rules, usually he is well read up.  No Joe you've made a mistake you numpty. The majority of his KO's fall in the Cruiser weight division Joe, how many mistakes are you gonna make?
...Joe Louis
Joe loves surrounding himself with unfunny comedians.
@3:55 I mean, when dude is born into a boxing family and the dad not only names him after Mike Tyson but trains him to be a stone cold killer in the ring, the odds aren't that high lol.  Dude needs to read like one Tyson Fury Wikipedia page and stop worrying so much about 1980s WWF bullshit.
Joe is a handicapped 5 year old that doesn't know the rules of boxing he is talking about, or literally 90% of anything else he ever talks about.
Joe bruh I love you man , but please stick to mma .don’t talk about boxing of you’re not familiar with the rules…it’s just that simple …if you like wilder that’s fine , but he was ko’d and that’s that
Big power / snap = false sense of security
Gets hit with wilders hardest punch, gets up, wilder gets hit with furys hardest punch and doesn't get up, who hits harder then?
Well his father did name him Tyson because of Mike Tyson soooooo.....  He knew his son would be heavyweight champ of the world since he was born.
we need a fckn duncan trussell podcast
At this point does the count even matter if you get up from that at all and contine fighting you've earned it
Sponsored by bezos and amazon!  Lmao.
in the 2nd fight, wilder was bleeding out the ear and was beat up by the 7th.  It was time to stop it.  Well no shit Joe,  All fighters have strengths /weaknesses.    If you could teach wilder how to move OR if fury had wilder's hammer, then yes they could be the perfect fighter.  They are who they are....Arguably, they would both beat Ali, given their size, strength , chins and stamina.
3:57 Usain Bolt
Sorry Joe the ref stops a count to put the other fighter to move them to a neutral corner, and besides the point Tyson was watching the count like any good fighter taking as much time as they can to get up and get extra seconds
The ref's job is not to count out the fighters as fast as he can. It's to make sure the fighter is okay and can still fight. Fury was conscious and never out of it, and experienced referee Russel Mora did an excellent job. This is an ignorant take here from jre.
What about furys power, not just the right hand every punch fury threw look like foreman hitting people! Tyson has power in both hands
Joe’s ignorance of the 10 count rule is exasperating. While it’s true that the referee picks up the count from the timekeeper initially, as soon as the ref picks it up and starts counting the timekeeper stops and whatever the referee counts is the “official” count.  Anything that distracts the referee during his count effectively stops the count, which will then be continued after he gives whatever instructions that delayed the count in the first place.   Also, it’s not a “ten second” count, it’s a count to ten. Some referees count fast, some count slow (both within reason). The referee in the 3rd fight was more on the slow side, but he was consistent in his pace for when both Tyson and Wilder were knocked down (people have synced videos of them to prove it).
What does Tony Hinchcloset seriously have to say about boxing?
Joe "Dr. Evil in a space suit" Rogan
Americans obviously want the American to win.  No surprise, it’s predictable.
Wilder got vaccinated that's why he lost 🤷🏻‍♂️
I think the count shud come from the time keeper anyway.  Shud be loud ebuf for all to hear
Jesus Joe just look up the rules before you start talking about them. They werent long counts. As plenty of people have already said the ref did the right thing when Wilder moved from his neutral corner
Fight was ass to me
I think the misconception people have is it's a 10 count not 10 seconds. Sometimes the ref goes quicker sometimes a little slower
Fury wasn't that hurt on the 2nd knockdown, Fury was kinda resting and getting up on the count of the ref. If the count was faster Fury still would have gotten up on time
It was a great fight!
No one talks about how Kenny Bayless, in the 2nd fight, basically gave Wilder every opportunity to win that fight. Soon as they got close to each other he would jump in every time. He wouldn't allow Fury to work inside (like  the 3rd fight).
Not sure that either of these two are skilled boxers. Both big and strong, for sure.. Skilled? Not like Ali, Tyson, Fraizer, etc.
My god I hope this whole episode is not about mma.
Joe Rogan: "There's not a single guy that's knocked out as many guys as Deontay Wilder has"    Earnie shaver, George Foreman, Mike Tyson: "Hold my gloves"
You r correct relating to the count but this ref gave too long for both fighters.  I just think it was the refs lack of awareness..nerves.  but the fighter does respond based off the count and i think Fury cud have got up in time regardless
Joe you are wrong on the count. The ref picks up the count from the ring-side counter after first directing standing fighter to neutral corner. If the ref needs to tell the fighter a second time, because fighter leaves neutral counter, the ref stops count to redirect fighter to neutral corner. That’s the punishment for fighter cheating by leaving corner. The ref only picks up count from the ringside after first directing fighter to neutral corner. Thereafter the ref will stop fight if fighter leaves that corner and pick up count after. Wilder screwed himself. He should have stayed in corner.
The Joe Rogan set feels like Waynes world 2 when they cashed in
When are people gonna stop pretending that Tyson Fury is not the greatest of all time? You really believe a 225lb Muhammed Ali could ever stand a chance?
This is so much shit.... Fury literally won 10 rounds and got hit hard twice in the 4th. He was not struggling to beat any count on the 2 knock downs and was back in his face the next round. Hardly saved by the referee. Wilder is the one who was saved in the first fight by the judges.
Joe starting Tony's rehab tour
It was a slow count, but Tyson was actually on his feet by count 9 (my own count) on both knockdowns, so the slow count is a moot point anyway. Just watch a clip of it and start counting 1 Mississippi etc. yourselves.
I'm not implying anything, but if Tony was an astronaut he would aim his rocket directly at Uranus.
Tony is so cringe when he tries to sound knowledgeable about fighting, actually scratch that tony is cringe when he says anything
He should’ve came in the match with better  defense and footwork smh lol
10 counts was spot on rules says it’s so
Bullshit both had long counts go take a look , funking yanks fury spanked him
everything he sees is greatest ever
Fury is fury because he's from the traveller people in the UK bro. You ought to research this segment of British society. Brad Pitt sort of played that sort of character in snatch.  As for the slow count, bollocks
Joe your 100% right. If Wilder learned how to box it's a wrap he'd be one of the GOAT'S
It was a great beatdown if you are being honest Wilder landed 3-4 good shots the whole fight and got beat up the rest of it.
WAC 36-12-140 (6) When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall direct the opponent to move to the farthest neutral corner of the ring. If the opponent leaves the neutral corner, the referee shall interrupt the count and will not resume the count until the opponent returns to the neutral corner.
I legitimately think the count was a mistake.
why was Fury got knocked down in 4 th round ?    Well Wilder always uses the opportunity to hit with right hand leverage power punch When opponents momemtarily lose concentation . Tyson Fury was blocking his face with both hands which blinded his eyes and lost his concentration immediately he didn't see the  right hand of Wilder coming to hit. Only way one can dismantle and thwart the danger and effectiveness of Wilder's  right power punch is by jabbing with combination right left punches. continuous jabbing instead of covering your eyes and face with 2 hands.
If the guy is not in a neutral corner , the count starts again.
Nope only joe thought it was over we all no tyson would get up.
Wilder was world champ for 5 yrs. Rogan wants to make it sound like he has no experience. He has almost 3 times as many fights as Usyk who Joe says is a masterful boxer.
The thing is maybe the count was slower than usual but fury was getting up anyway it , it’s wasn’t a jeopardy like in the first fight in the 12th round
I watched the fight with Antonio Banderas & Anthony Hopkins in my hacienda.
Joe "I don't know the rules so I made up some in my head Joe Rogan" Rogan
despite wilder being 40lb ligther than fury and still being able to deliver enough power to knock him down twice back to back is pretty damn amazing.
So wilder is one of the hardest punchers of all time but he got all his best punchs out on fury and never knocked him out once for good. On the other hand fury knocks wilder out so i guess he has the hardest punch now!
Joe about to be cancelled for saying “Queer-Street”  😂 LGBTQ going to be FURIOUS
Can someone please remind me who won this fight again? Listening to Joe, I assumed it was Wilder. Lol
Fury was actually named after Mike Tyson.That’s when he was born.
Fuck Spotify.
Love seeing Joe include Young Jamie in conversation!
Listening to Rogan here you'd think Wilder won
Joe stop discrediting Fury. Great fight. Great champion. Fury is very aware of what's going on. If the count was quicker He'd have gotten up quicker. He stays down as long as He can every time so He has more time for his head to clear.
Every time I see Redban back on the JRE makes me realise how amazing of a human being Joe Rogan actually is.
Joe stop talking shot on the count . Read the rule book .Its up to the ref alone . shut up and stick to UFC.
i think you are talking wilder up too much joe.  he has fought 38 bums in shopping malls, then about 4 boxers.  1 of which was a good boxer and he lost to him 3 times.  his knockout record is a lie built in those shopping malls.    and also you said when wilder hit him fury was fucked.  in no point during those 3 fights was fury fucked,  he got up every time.  i never had a doubt in my mind that he would win even when he did get knocked down.   and the hardest punching?  who got knocked out by a punch?   wilder did.
it was harsh to watch though in 3rd fight, everything after 9th round. round 10 it was crazy not yo stop the fight... most referees would have stopped the fight...
Greatest heavyweight fight of all time.... Let's Go Brandon 🍺
5:00 “I touched her shoulder and said” 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
Wilder is a big dosser.
In huge fights with championships on the line the referee give the benefit of the doubt to the boxer. If the guy is conherent and can get up, just because a boxer isn't up at Exactly 10 seconds doesn't matter. Imagine the outcry that would happen because a coherent boxer got up at 10.1 seconds. I think the ref wants to be the last person to decide a fight over technicalities. But for safety it's a different ball game.
Foreman won gold 9 months in
Joe Rogan is always absolutely clueless what comes to boxing. Just focus on UFC, he is brilliant there, but boxing. Cmon dude, nothing controversial about the count.
How come Joe has been watching boxing forever and still doesn't know the rules on the referre count. As a wise man once said, "most people don't know shit about boxing".
Joe - MMA is taking over boxing . Also Joe - Boxing has one of greatest fights lol
YEAH! TONY AND REDBAN! Oh man I'm so stoked to listen to this one!
06:00 According to Teddy Atlas it’s called a “Ten Count” not a “ten second count”.  With respect Joe I know who I get my boxing advice/truth from mate. 👍😂    It was an exciting fight though!
If’s and buts and Hindsight! Three great words that keeps us wondering!
dude how do you play so dumb and try to sound so smart fuckin hell Joe
Was semi excited until I saw redban
Watching Hinchcliffe struggle to talk about man-shit is hilarious!
Even on a mediocre Day like that Fight Day, Tyson Fury is a far superior Fighter compared to this one Punch Wonder called Deontay Wilder.
Joe is making it sound like Wilder walked off the streets & fought Fury. Wilder has 45 career fights. 10 more than Ali & 10 fewer than #1 P4P Canelo Alvarez.
Took me a few seconds to realise why Joe is dressed like the chicken I put in the oven last night
It was a great trilogy. I loved watched them go at it because you knew they were going to get back up every time
Fury was fully conscious and talking to ref after knock down, he was hurt but not in major trouble. Did they expect the ref to wave that off? fucking moonmen these lot. Gone to his back yard and beat him convincingly 3 times
He's totally wrong on the boxing count. The count starts when the other boxer is in a neutral corner. End of discussion. It's not debatable, the ref is the counter there's never been a ringside counter for knockdowns ever in the history of boxing.
5:00 Hinchcliffe's gf? i thought he was gay? didn't he at some point say he was gay?
Let's set this count thing straight, a count of any kind in boxing has nothing at all to do with seconds, a count is 100% down to the discretion of the referee,
13.41 There are many boxers in boxing history with more knockouts than Deontay Wilder. Even Big George Foreman had 68 KOs. Sugar Ray Robinson had 108. Archie Moore had 132.
It's called a count not 10 seconds also the downed  fighter is listening to what the ref is saying and acts accordingly.
The point everyones missing is that Fury follows the refs count before getting up at 8 both times. Its not like he couldnt get up immediately had he really tried, but most trainers i know insist to make the most of the count if you're knocked down. If the refs count was bang on Fury would still have got up at 8 both times. Its a hollow argument.
why are you talking sports with this man child? he is the symbol of unsportsman-is.
These guys don't know boxing. His dad named him after Mike tyson. They knew he was gonna be a champion from birth. Its breeding programs
Wilder shoulda went to his fucking corner LOL he blew it hahah
Really best ,sloppy at best ,
no joe, you are not right here. the referee can look at the guy and count as he wishes or stop yhe fight right away, because fighters are in his hands. so sometimes as referee you can see much differently because you are so close to a fighter and sometimes you can clearly see if a fighter will get up or not way before anyone else sees it. so if referee can see that the fighter might get up, he can easily count more slowly to give boxer a chance. it is boxing, you are supposed to get knocked down and get back up, no matter couple seconds slower or faster.
Joe literally doesn't know what he is talking about. And whats with all the dick riding, is Wilder due on the show soon.
I've watched the fight back and counted from as Fury is falling to when he gets up, without pause, and a lot faster than the ref did. Fury still gets up within time. Second one was about 9.5, so arguably close. People are really clutching at straws here. Great show from two tough fighters, though.
He was named after Mike Tyson. Having Fury as a last name is the icing on the top.  Why is no1 talking about the long counts of Wilder too?
Wait I didn’t know about the referee count situation. That’s so bs. Why is boxing always filled with mistakes from judges/refs? There can never be a fight without controversy. The winner should be the winner with no excess labels attached
He ko'd dishwashers and cooks
If the Village People had an astronaut character, it would be Tony Hinchcliffe.
When all you have in your armoury is The Hardest punch in boxing history and you opponent gets back up well there only one result ,1st fight Wilder was handed a boxing lesson ,(how to box) 2nd fight Fury took it 2him change of style Knocked the shit out of Wilder 3rd fight a mix of the first 2 Wilde gave it all and stood on his shield but there can only b one winner , when the man you face can take your punches you have nothing ,Tyson will pray for you all to ask his god to soften your hearts ,Tyson Fury Great Boxer Great Person and very humble
Should look at the fury 10 count compared to the clock
Tyson Fury said he was only one pound when he was born.  My daughter was premature and only three pounds and she was insanely small,  I can’t even imagine what one pound looks like.
Fury won fair and square joe. The body rippling was due to his punch connecting to Fury's abdomen too joe. You need to chill out on the fanboying joe
One thing I like about youtube, it tells me when to switch over to Spotify for JRE.
Maybe the count on the 2nd knockdown was a split second slower then it should have been....BUT it was irrelevant. Fury was not out of it he was utilizing the count. He was waiting to get up taking a breather, had the count been that split second faster he would have been up faster.
The fat helped dissapate the blow. All apart of the plan.
No way! Not of all time for real real but it was really awesome to see Tyson beat the blood 🩸 out of his face again again then to see Wilder not act like true sport congratulating Tyson after the fight.  Hey Wilder, work on ur chicken legs little harder to have some strength behind ur physics instead of all upper body. For real real Wilder has legs like a 10 year old little boy that can’t get hit and come back due to No strength !!!!!!!  Wilder needs to play Golf with OJ Simpson now just giving it all up. All that talk too but it is what it is 😎 bro
Thnx for at least not wearing a Blue Origin spacesuit Joe 😎👍🏼
Nasa pre flight planning has changed alot.
This was horrible lmao.. this was like listening to two middle schoolers talk about the fight. Maybe it's target audience is middle schoolers, but this is a waste of time if you're interested in hearing about the fight tbh.
Joe is another who believes it's a 10 second count. It's not. It's a 10 count at the referees discretion. Also if the other boxer leaves the neutral corner the referee is supposed to stop the count until the boxer is back in the neutral corner and resume the count.
Fight of the year contender. Also Wilder reminds me of a UFC fighter turned boxer, by the fact he just loads up the right and waits
Being an Irish Gypsy, there wont  be a man alive that will beat Tyson. He has the heart of a lion and as  hard as a coffin nail.
Joe "look at that fat ripple" Rogan.
Cromier needs to stop cryin'. Wilder after getting up was held by his hands for a half an hour by the Ref. Maybe there's a reason Cromier doesn't like Fury. Like so many other many americans of a certain Ilk
13:50 you can't teach Wilder Joe. He already thinks he's great and one little thing. He's 36 not 35. He will be 36 in a few weeks. He's done. All he can do now is get a few interesting fights going and retire. He will never be champ again
They rule supposedly stipulated and written is that  the first thing that the ref suppose to do in a KD is to put the standing fighter on a neutral coner and then starts the count. If at any moment with in the count that fighter leaves the corner, that count stops till that fighter returns to the corner. Then and only then the ref starts the count where he left off. 🤷‍♂️ that's what I just learned this week. Idk. Can someone confirm?
Watch snatch the movie where Brad Pitt plays a gypsy bear knuckle fighting champion.....Give you a clue into Tyson Fury the Gypsy Kings heritage all be it moviefied..lol...fun film though.
One of the most entertaining fight of all time but seriously far from being one of the "Best Fights!" of all time.  Simply because the skill level of these 2 boxers was literally day and night makes this fight almost a novelty at best.  Wilder has no idea what to do in defense of himself, how to move, where to be and more importantly where not to be during any match.  He only knows how to swing away!!  Once he gets hurt added w/ fatigue, he puts himself in the most dangerous position that was scarily apparent during this fight......very one-sided match!  NOT even close to the greatest fight ever.
Slower ref counts clearly sell more tickets and make for more interesting fights, so I say the slower, the better. The main purpose of padded gloves is to prolong the fight, same logic. You can talk about health all you want...at then end of the day, it's fucking boxing...
Of the 41 knockouts Wilder had 39 of those were bean cans.
Ppl are totally wrong about the 10 count. Daniel Cormier doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Nor does Joe Rogan.  So many ppl have the 10 count wrong.
Long count🤦‍♂️…we don’t want to hear any more more excuses Joe
Dear oh Joe, take your time son.
It was not one of the greatest heaveyweight fights 🙄
Good fight.. one of the GOATs tho? People are either prisoners of the moment, or have short term memory. I will admit its the best HW scrap we've had in years.
Love listening to JRs show but dont agree with him here. Plus i really cannot fathom how there is a proportion of yanks who think that fury was lucky, lost the first fight, and that wilder was robbed....
Fury would have got up at 8 no matter what. He waited for it.
The count was fine look at the timer on the round.
Cormier and Rogan are both wrong. They need to educate themselves regarding the rules in boxing.
The fight would've been over the top great if the boxing commentators were more exciting and actually reacted with enthusiasm when the knockdowns started and action was heavy. Thats one of the things that makes UFC fights so attractive, is the commentators, especially for their PPV events.
We was waiting on this shyt 🪘
No you forking morrons!!! Please do urselfs a favor and read KO count rules on boxing, that about the ref criteria + there’s another man below de ring initiating de count, but doesn’t goes by the second, even the other fighter should be on a neutral corner prior de count starts…. C’mon Joe, I can spect that from the guests but you’re a man that know really well the fighting world.
Hmm...got to see the video of the loser punching the winner but nothing showed of what Fury did...pretty lousy coverage.
long counts are bullshit but both ways like tyson was awake with eye contact through the full count so he was gonna get up at 7 or 8 wether u counted fast or slow he just took the time the ref allowed
We counted Wilder’s counts too. I swear he got 20 seconds on 2 of those knockdowns. Please watch and correct me if I’m wrong
This outfits are blasphemous
If anyone cares to help me find the saying, "On career street," please tell me if that's what he's saying. I looked it up and couldn't find. Thanks!
Anytime I think about boxing I re-watch Mike Tyson's first 20 or so fights as a Pro. It's a really quick watch his punches launch his whole body off the canvas and when those punches hit they launched boxer's across the ring
Fury was getting up anyway, regardless of the count.
you should get tyson fury on again
The Reffs got every right to interumpt the count if the opponent is not in a nuteral corner, once that’s established, the count may continue!
Joe what are you talking about.  Yes a good fight but the best fight of all time. Get real.
13:32 George Foreman??
The space suits 2🤣🤣😭😭🤣🤣😭😭
Slow count doesn’t matter, the boxer gets up on the 7/8 count always have always will
Wrong on the count.    Joe go read the rule book.
Is it Halloween... What the hell?
How can Joe talk so much rubbish 😂 the ref picks the count up from the timekeeper for the initial knockdown BUT if the opponent isnt in his neutral corner the ref will PAUSE his count and order him to the corner!! The fact Joe said its an error or corruption is fuckin baffling 2 me!! Get Jamie to look it up next time ffs
Joe complains about the count but is perfectly OK with Wilder pulling Fury's head down and clubbing him in the back of the head for the 2nd knockdown?!?!
No one, Not one of Wilder oponents can take a right hand from Wilder. Fury takes the hardest hits and gets up
NEWS ALERT 🚨 mcgreggor says he wants fury for his next fight 🚨🤞🏼
Fury got Wilder's game figured out.
Same thing with wilder kd long count
I saw that shock wave to Fury forehead and watch the ripple effect tinkle down his spinal cord, so I bet in Fury later years he’ll have speech impediment or ends up with parkinson disease from taking shots from one of the hardest hitting men on earth
No Joe, it's not a continous count. The rules clearly state that. The outside ref you're talking about starts counting at the initial knockdown and then the ref in the ring picks it up after he's directed the fighter to go to a neutral corner. The ref in the ring can stop a count and pick up right where he left off. Literally every boxing bout has this happen. This isn't new.  I blame Andre Ward for this confusion because by his logic he should've been counted out when Kovalev dropped him.
That’s the WWF counting rules. Someone was supposed to go hit him over the head with a chair while the ref was distracted
Digital count sounds so American
Joe Rogan is wrong. If the Ref has to stop the count to tell a fighter to go back into the neutral corner, the Ref resumes the count where it left off. In other words, it's a "penalty" if the fighter leaves the neutral corner. If not fighters would leave the neutral corner all the time to get an advantage to rush the knocked down fighter.   The ref was right.
Don't matter how the ref counted, fury had his eyes on the ref at all times and again got up when the ref counted 7. He was in full control of his stand up
Why ignore the Fury knock downs?? Typical American commentator with pernicious attitudes to sell that the American fighter fighting in America with American judges somehow wasn't treated right. Typical and expected.
Hey joe it’s a ten count not a ten second count
Joe looks like Dr. Evil dressed up as a DJ for Halloween.
Joe talking shit again about the count go watch it and start a timer he was up in 9 seconds but hurt because the fucking yank lost
C'mon Joe!! The reason for this is to make "sure" that the other fighter is obeying commands!! Every fighter that delays the referee by not going to the neutral corner gives the other guy a break!! This is old school knowledge....
Wilder hit Fury with his best shot 4 times, and 4 times Tyson got up (and then dominated the fight afterwards).  We saw a “B” version of The Gypsy King last weekend. He didn’t really want the 3rd fight, he got COVID twice and almost lost a child in the past 18 months. Yet still, aside from the 2 knockdowns (one of which was a behind the head illegal punch) it was a one sided beatdown.   I can’t wait to see Fury vs Usyk or AJ.
Wilder has been knocked out like that before, he really doesn’t know how to give up
If you do every count for every knockdown there actually the same he counts slow for all the knock-downs but if you only concentrate on that one it seems slow
Common sense in boxing immediately go to your corner and stay
@7:00 bs about a long count 🙄
Joe doesn't know the rules on the 10 count lol what a casual
The ref stopped the count because   wilder wasn't in a neutral corner
6:10 wrong again Joe. You did this in their first fight. Look at the official clock. It's about 11 seconds from the time he hits the canvas to the time he gets up.  that's normal! There is a reason it's called the "official" clock. Look at it it's at the bottom of the screen
WHATS THE ODDS HIS NAME IS LUKE???
Who hits harder Francis Ingano or Deyonte Wilder?
Tired of 2 faced Joe Rogan, the only reason he says the count was wrong is because his buddy said it. Read the rules, the count was fine and Wilder was also down for more than 10 seconds. Even if Fury was down for too long, he was responsive and sitting up, he wasn't dizzy or confused.
Looks like it's pretend to be a astronaut day for ol'joe there.
Tyson fury was named after mike tyson.
Tbf Fury was totally with it watching the count so if it was faster he’d have still got up in time
Actually to you bigots Wilder won that first fight but the powers that be wanted there hope to win so the ref slow counted, but plus if that was anybody else they would have wave off the first fight
Yes but they threw the towel in in fight 2. DW has been beaten in all 3 fights.
Joe is becoming a full on libtard
I'll still take the Ward gatti trilogy  or correlles comeback over this one
Reband gets fatter each time he is on..
The count wasn't long. If you go back, you can watch the count and continue it yourself. Fury got up in 9 seconds.
Knocked out 41 bums 🤣  .. name one top 10 fighter in their PRIME that hes fought??... I will wait .... 👀 lol. There has never been a heavyweight in history that has had sooo many hand picked opponents, and literally because hes Americas ONLY hope at a belt lol.
Love Your show Bro. Your the man. Def one of the best Heavyweight fights of all time
Man every time I want to give Rogan another chance he comes back with nonsense that made me stop watching him It’s not a 10 second count it’s a count to 10  Watch this thing and count for yourself the latest I reach 8 maximum 9. Rogan has no clue what he is talking about focus on ufc
where's young Jamie when Joe needed him to pull up the boxing rule that says Joe manufactured misinformation here.
Saw Joe in Pittsburgh that night and then went to the bar to watch the fight. The best fight of my life so far electric atmosphere.
Does anybody want to know what the Best fight in history was? I bet you don't even know? Marvelous Marvin Hagler vs John the " beast" Mugabi it's not even debatable!!
This conversation should be about how good Fury is, not how good Wilder could’ve been if he had better foot work !!!
I patiently wait to hear Powerful Joe's thoughts after big fights.
Fury is a boxer.  Wilder is a hard puncher.  Big difference.
Fury fell two times. Wilder fell 3 times. The referee fell 4 times. I fell 5 times. The audience fell 6 times and Rogan fell 10 times. Greatest fight in a long time.
Soooo, I thought Fury won. Let's kiss the loser's ass for awhile instead.
Who were these guys Wilder was knocking out?
There's always an excuse when a white guy beats a black guy.
Good but just a shame he’s talking to 2 people who haven’t got a clue
The Dr Evil Experience
If 28 lb makes you either a better fighter or a worst fighter that's all in your head buddy LOL somebody a hundred and seventy pounds can beat the brakes off of somebody 300lb you don't believe that you ain't lived life very long and payed no attention to the things around you
Same thing when MMA referees make an early stoppage. Human mistake
Wilder also had a long count. Counts were equal.
Been waiting for this
Just like when the doctor had to speak to wilder wich was a few seconds worth of recovery
The thing with the ring count is that the referee is the arbiter of the count, he can count as fast or as slow as he wants.   The ref did his correct job
Early 90's I'd always watch Tyson fights with a bunch of buddies and it's way more exciting that way.
Fighting traveler family and i feel the connection im a traveler and i not say im a tyson fury 😄 But we grew up different if i come home after a beat down i proberly get a beating when i got home lol. Only a win counts hahaha and if i would run away in a fight i would get wake up in the hospital because my dad would kick my ass 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
TOTALLY SCRIPTED, TOTALLY FAKE!. ALL THESE WEASLES SHOULD'NT BE TALKIN ABOUT REAL MEN. THE SCRIPT TOOK A TOTAL OF SIX DAYS!.
No one knew? hahah No Joe, lots of us knew that Wilder was dangerous but he couldnt put Fury away.   Great fight but there really wasnt a very strong chance that Fury was gonna lose. Round 4 controversy was bullshit.  It wasnt an error he followed the rules.  WIlder's record may look good but  its a lie. He didnt fight great boxers he fought bums with gloves on.
Now it's a slow count. LOL
Fight was almost as good as the old Ali/Frazier/Foreman ones...
Absolutely agree there should be an screen with count down
Who gives a fuck about the count, fury won 3 times, end of story
"Tyson Fury has been boxing since he was a small small boy of 6 foot 2"
It is supposed to be a ten count. It's not supposed to be a ten second count.
Has there ever been a time in history where two heavyweights have been this BIG fighting for a championship
Joe. I am a huge fan. Just please learn to use the word I correctly. Early in the video it should have been me not I. Still a huge fan.
Also.... yall keep forgetting the fact that Fury Is not even known for his heavy punches ... infact, the opposite... and STILL knocks Wilder down with ease. Lol
you can't equalize everything joe
I hate sore losers. So it was extremely satisfying watching wilder get destroyed AGAIN.!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Absolutely the best most deserved butt kicking ever.!!!!!!!!! The Gypsy King has earned my fandom for life.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Didn’t matter Fast or slow, each time fury was going on the refs count and got up accordingly.
Always love Jamie being awkward in front of redban
Slow count... excuses were slow in starting too. At least they have started now
If only Wilder could respect his trainers instead of believing his own hype...
Still haven't been on Spotify
Fury was his first real test he faught bums
Time is of the essence especially when you can smell the essence
He might’ve have been able to go on at 30 years old, but when he’s 50 and he can’t remember what he had for breakfast and he is slurring his words he will wish it was stopped earlier.
Wow Redban + Hinchcliffe... Joe only talks to Jamie?
Long counts are a wild goose chase. The fighters listen to the refs count and act accordingly. If the ref is fast or slow the fighter will get up before 10. Very very rarely is there ever a full 10 count and the second before or after even matters.
I said that guys coming back You’re talking sh!t, you didn’t know jack sh!t…. 😂😂😂
Fury leathered him 3 times. Yet this clip seems like wilder was the champ
Not for once did I think Tyson Fury was out of this fight? What fight were you watching? It looked like he went down on purpose just to get a breather. He beat the piss outta wilder.
Nothing better then seeing Wilders wife in tears
The better man won
What fight were you watching? Other than those two knockdowns, Wilder was never in it. Sore loser too
U need to hear big John explain this ...very clear...not a slow count
I had a teacher  named Joe King
His real name is Luke tyson fury,,, Marciano 49 wins 43 knock outs No losses. Joe rogan needs to check out Edwin valero too
Fury was totally ',all together' and 'with it' when he went down. Looks like he woulda beat the count however quick or slow it was....contrast his condition at knockdowns to Wilders and any other fighter really. Fury is not normal 😂
love your honesty, go Beavs ... from antifa Portland
The counts didn’t mean shit.  Wilders was long too.  Fury could of sat there and waited until the ref said 9 on both counts and stood up immediately.  He was present the entire time.
So stupid the amount of controversies in these fights and all probably because it's an American. Would've been a joke if Wilder won anyway, won about 3 rounds in 3 fights. Doesn't deserve shit just for having power... Fury literally changes his whole style to get the win, had heart and intelligence instead of being arrogant enough to think he could win with one trick... Idiotic to think Fury should've been counted out there, was totally with it.
So the long count was because of the neutral corner rule which does allow the ref to stop the count and pick the count back up from where here left off
Watch wilder will win his next fight by 3rd round KO lmfao.
Even if the count was slow - Fury was lucid on the floor and using the referees words. IF the 8 was earlier he would have got up earlier. WHy are we focusing on how long the count was and not the fact it would have made absolutely no difference.
ALI - Frazier 1, best Heavyweight ever
These guys , on their wikipedia , have the voice "joe rogan's friend" ?
You can look it up but the count was completely legal and has been, wilder was not in a neutral corner, the ref resumed count where he left off, there's a whole page on this just look it up, and wilder got a nice break with the doctor
Fury was amazing, he got up and knew where he was. Started parrying and that’s his skill of boxing. Fury was undertaker in first match in round 12. Heavenly stuff Really feel Joe is Total Wilder fan. Fury won the 3 fights imho 🤷‍♂️
Watch footage from the ringside - neither man takes more than 10 clock seconds from hitting the mat to standing again. Fury won fair and square. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ihI4PAU_I&t=42s
There shouldn't be a count at all .....they should just fight until one of them says I quit or is completely knocked out to the point where everybody in the building knows that dude is knocked out and has lost
Thing is Fury wasnt actually unconscious ... he literally just sat on the canvas resting until the ref got to 6 or 7 ... IF the ref counted faster Fury would have been up sooner... stop trying to make excuses for your technically awful boxer lol
LCD screen heh, Joe? What's this, 1972? lol
We all need to know Tony Hinchcliff’s opinion on fighting sports. He’s as talented in talking about self-defence as he is at stand-up.  ….meaning he’s terrible.
Think your wrong Joe refs count is the official time is ts why you get your ass to the corner it's to protect guys from ground getting hit
Made me mad that he counted so slow when Fury was down and instantly waved it off when Wilder hadn’t even hit the floor yet
Tyson Fury hits so fucking hard it almost didn't matter"😂
Nonchalantly says "hit him behind the ear" like it wasn't a blatant illegal neck holding back of the head punch lol
"When a knockdown occurs, the downed boxer’s opponent shall go to the furthest neutral corner and remain there while the count is being made. The referee may stop counting if the opponent fails to go to the neutral corner, and resume the count where he/she left off when the opponent reports to or returns to the neutral corner."
It's no secret that Tony hated the English though
OMG! You Americans are always like whining kids as long as you fail where you fuss that you are the best. The counting for both boxers was the same.  Before I started watching the video, I knew Joe would award Tyson that victory and then excuse and praise Wilder the rest of the time, 90%.  He does the same with Adesanya.
You got the rules wrong. Joe you know shit about boxing
The cigar smoking spaceman complimented Joe Rogan on this boxing episode well. I don't know why the other dude was even there!?
Fury dominated all three fights. Wilder was powerful enough to knock him down on the rare occasion that he landed clean but he met his match and more. Both were great. People are ducking giving Fury the credit he deserves. Give the big Celtic Gypsy King his due...can anyone today best him? No. He's an all time great champion.
Here we go again, Joe talking nonsense, Joe doesn't sh*t about boxing, it's a count of 10 not 10 seconds in time, also the count is at the referee's discretion, the referee's job is to give the fighter maximum time (within reason) to carry on or to stop the fight to save the fighter from getting seriously hurt
Wilder should retire. 35 and lost his last two fights. He's done.

The Royal Rumble countdown... But count up for Boxing!
It’s not a 10 second count morons.
You're wrong about the count rules
Well Wilder could have just went to the corner he was supposed to and we wouldn't even be having this conversation....
Wilder - devestating power at the expense of technique. Usyk - Technique at the expense of devestating power. Joshua - bit of both but room for improvement. Fury - A Beast, knock him down at your peril.
More proof that joe doesn't know shit about boxing and fighting. He's pure shit.
fury was named after Mike
On the counting you are wrong Joe. RTFM ;) Also box professionals like Teddy Atlas and others also congratulated the refereee for allowing a nice fight while also making it clear to the fighters he wont allow blows on the back of the head and other stuff like that. At the end this was a pretty clean fight, and the referee counted well, once again RTFM !
yanks trying anything to justify loss to a better man
Another example of the "Nomenclature is Destiny" idea
Space suits?
Dude Joe...you got it wrong here...you should come out with a video where you give the right info on how the count works.
There’s a rule Deontae broke. Stay in the neutral corner. The rule is that if the ref has to stop the count to tell the other boxer to go to neutral corner, they then resume the count where they LEFT OFF.
Joe is wrong about the count; here is a quick vid explanation: https://youtu.be/P8wa9GZY3TY
Damn I was waiting all week for joe to talk about the fight
5:19    lmfao Joe told him  str8  ....you was talking shit
See what Teddy Atlas says about the count. And stop talking shit about referee errors or conspiracy theories.
The boxing rules state if the fighter isn’t in the neutral corner the ref will pause the count
9:40 Mario Yamasaki would have let the fight keep going
The only decent fighter Wilder has faced is Fury and he got beat 3 times. He knocked out nobody’s.
If wilder could learn to move like Ali in his prime he would be the goat
Boxing just can’t get out of it’s own way. You have this great fight, with amazing highlights by two of the best to ever do it, and the refs can’t count. GGG/Alverez was supposed to be this outstanding fight to push boxing into a brighter spotlight, and you had a bought judge.
Please don’t take so long next time
Joe explains this incorrectly. The referee did it correctly. Shame that it is explained wrong because instead of talking about how great the fight was they jumó to something that was not a controversy. Hate that people don’t understand boxing rules and spread misconceptions about the sport.
Such respect for both fighters.
Long count? Buster Douglas.
Joe describing watching fights with a lot of people finally understands why people enjoy going to football/basketball games. When that many people are cheering together it is spiritual. Only music and sports bring people together like that
That fight could have gone 20 rounds and fury would have won fury’s back was barely on the canvas he was just waiting for the count
The power guys tend to burn out quicker, Holyfield vs Tyson is a good example. Ali had a long career because he was strategic .
My entire house full of people was on edge! Great fvkn fight!🥊
Stay in your neutral corner and the count won't stop.   The Rule:Stay The time keeper starts the count when the fighter goes down. The ref picks up the count from the time keeper. Once the ref picks up the count that becomes the official count from that point forward.  If he has to stop to tell the other fighter to go to the neutral corner, he stops his official count and starts it back up. The time keeper is out of the equation at the point.
Wilder needs to make his own statement, his team was speaking for him. Almost 2 years straight of stupid excuses and baseless accusations is not going to go away till he owns them. But he won't, and that will be a big part of his legacy, it already is
The ref done the same thing for wilder when ge got knocked down  and he had more time when the doctor came in no more excuses fury smashed him back to back
Cool thing to me about fighting… two in one out. It just shows who’s better any given encounter
1. corrupt? you mean like the first fight when Fury was robbed by the judges in America in favor of the American fighter. 2. Rule: the referee picks up the count from the timekeeper initially after a knockdown as it takes time for him to instruct the fighter to go to a neutral corner. If that fighter isn't staying in the corner he will stop the count and instruct the fighter again and doesn't pickup the count from the timekeeper as a penalty, instead he continues from where he stopped counting. 3. Tyson Fury would have stood up if the count was early as he wasn't out and was watching the referee count to stand up at the right time.
So surprised their  lack of understanding and information ....
People still making excuses 😴 How many times does Tyson have to fold Wilder up like a fucking deck chair.
If the ref carried on the count fury would have just got up faster
Teddy Atlas says the count was correct because if the ref has to usher other fighter back to corner the count stops. But what does he know...
Ffs dont be starting excuses for wilder too give  Yes i noticed the ref did a slight pause on the count when he told wilder go to neutral corner... so i rewound it and i timed it from the second fury hit the floor to him getting up, its 7 seconds  People should think to time it themselves before saying and damn nonsense
The same stuff happened to Mike tyson, he dropped buster Douglas and buster Douglas got a super long count, he should have been counted out and Tyson should have won the TKO in Tokyo.. you can even see in the footage the ringside guy is doing the right count, but the referee is doing a much slower count..
Fury look older than Joe, I thought his dad was his brother first time I seen him.
wow deontae loss the fight because of a count
I counted myself and he got up at the latest on 8. The ref was on 6 or 7. I counted a few times.  Edit: I counted as soon as he hit the mat.
there was no controversy....when fury got knocked down he still seemed very coherent..cut the bullshit
Stop saying “I mean” so much Joe. You have been hanging out with DC so much.
Dude... The rule is the ref makes the call.  It was not a long count.  Fury was watching the count. He was not that hurt. Look at it again.  You cannot measure exact 10 seconds. Wilder was not in the neutral corner. Also. In the 10th round, Wilder got extra time.  This is a heavyweight championship fight.    How about Wilder vs Ortiz and look at the Wilder dilemma in that fight.    Wilder was not competitive. Look at the punch stats even in round 4.  Fury could not fight a perfect fight. He schooled Wilder from round 6 to 12. There were some 10 -8 rounds against Wilder not called out.  Soooo.... I think you need to look at the fight again.
It’s crazy how all Americans go for Fury. The country is low key so racist
Wilder got beat so bad, because he is so bad. Wilder is a shit fighter. Only fought bums. He won't fight again.  Goodnight bum.
John Fury named Tyson Fury after Mike Tyson.
Re: the long count complaint, Tyson took advantage of it, he saw what was going on and took those extra few seconds, had the outside counter had continued counting, he would have gotten up. Some people always need to see a villian. Thats all it is. Fury got up from two knockdowns and won the fight. For the first time ever, Wilders taken a loss like a man and has not blamed everything and everyone, its a dishonor to him and the sport to cry foul now.
I don’t like boxing and I purposely didn’t watch I could of seen it for free. But choose to play madden instead. Fast forward to now, do I regret it no! But forsure all over the clips
Wbf rules state of boxer leaves the corner, the count stops
If you watch the fight, and, with a stopwatch, time the count on the controversial knockdown... you will see that Fury is up at the 8 count... Don't believe me, time it yourself... The "long count" is bullshit...
It's not 10 seconds it's the count to 10. There's a difference. Joe you should know better.
Yes Joe watching with people is more fun 🙄
The first time Fury knocked Wilder down, the referee gave Wilder 20 seconds from the time he went down to the time he let them fight again.
Count or not they both Got knock down multiple times and got back up this was a fight all the way no Excuses Wilder got knocked out.
If the count had of been done correctly,  Fury still would of got up. If you get dropped, but know you can fight on  well then you buy yourself time on the ground. Fury may have benefitted from the extra long count, but there's no chance fury would of been counted out.
Joe. Watched the covid video with CNN health expert. Loved it. You are a pit bull my friend. I really admire your persistence,  and tough stance on CNN lies. I would love to see you as a fox coraspontant, grill jen psaki.  I love your your tough , no holds par approach.  Tired of this runaround from the White House. Take care
Gotta love the “hell yeah” at 12:36  Classic “I don’t know what I’m saying but I want to look cool” line
If you think that’s a ‘long count’ you are a VERY casual boxing fan. Fury was also clearly reacting to the ref’s count.
The count is nothing there rules state there is either a long count or short count it’s been like that for years. When mike Tyson fought Douglas Douglas received a 10 count down that lasted 14 seconds. Nothing in the rules does it say it’s got to be a 10 second count
DC is just a nutt rider!!! Fury got up on a 6-7 count!!! Think he got too many blows to the head by JJ, LMFFFAAAOOO
I AM SO SICK OF PAYING FOR SPOTIFY PREMIUM AND STILL HAVING TO LISTEN YOUR ADS!!! 😠 😡 🖕🏻
All this shit about the slow count is retarded. The count was stopped because wilder wasn’t in his corner, the count is supposed to be stopped if the fighter isn’t in his corner. The count was at exact the same speed as all of the knockdowns in the fight
RED BAR
I like where the heavy weight division is and Deontay Wilder has one hell of a KO record with 41 KO but but boxing is civilize compared to the barbaric times of yesterday to thank George Foreman KO 68 men in 81 fight is impressive but never mentioned when ever hardest punchers are brought up
furry getting up before 10 seconds, even though a count isnt about 10 seconds its about 10 counts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEiPdjn4rGM
I NEED SPACE
Fury is the best in the world, boxing is very controversial, but in every way fury is better then wilder, and a fourth fight now is not necessary for the reason that Tyson fury has given wilder too many chances , a fourth fight is an insult now to fury
Great fight terrible boxing match it really was .
Utter shite, so much looking for excuses for Wilder! Wilder had his ass handed to him fair and square. Its called boxing not punching and in terms of boxing there was only ever going to be one winner, Fury.
Joe flicks Jaime in the nuts all the time.
I love how Joe, even after saying Tyson is amazing, brings in the contraversy. No matter what, Joe leaves no stone un-turned. Amazing as always Joe, WE LOVE YOU BRO
There's only one Tyson Fury 👑
Sleep soundly bumsquad, Wilder lost....
Furry was watching and waiting on count so if ref was quicker he would've got up sooner - many boxers will wait on refs and get up just before 10
On the slow counts Fury would of got up quicker if count started sooner, not rocket science, he always gives himself as much time as possible
Wilder got saved by the bell too. The count shit is nonsense. Fury is better period. There's no excuse he lost!!! AND Fury is arguably the best heavyweight of all time. He is too big for the old school boxers. Sorry but true. He would keep them off.
Im from Nepal its pain in the a** to Use Spotify. Plz help
Jamie is always talking on the podcast but never show his face on it
I thought Wilder's corner threw the towel in? What is he talking about early stoppage? I'm confused
The count talk is bullshit.  The biggest heavyweight title fight in 20 years and the craziest 2 rounds back to back and everyone is an expert on what he should have done.   The building is exploding and it’s a war and loud and everything is happening in seconds. He handled it fine and the fight was excellent let’s not cry over spilt milk here.
The fact there in space suits makes it better
The Ref was actually brilliant that night, wasn't a slow count either...No Excuses this time...
For the love of God, Wilder had a really long count also. Give tyson the credit he deserves.. notice how no-one is talking about the PBC doctor that came in to save wilder.
It wasnt really that great of a fight. Fury fucked him up from the 5th on. Before that. Wilder started okay, but other than the 4th rd, he only won 2 other rds. How is that close? Also, Fury wasnt badly hurt from thos knockdowns. Relax dorks lol
Why is it when people get famous they only hang out with other famous people
You know Joe is getting baked when he brings out the nasa jacket lol
Joe "it's great watching a fight with a small crowd, it's like you're watching a fight with a small crowd" Rogan
they count slow and clear because the boxer is dazed. the reff needs to make eye contact with the punch drunk boxer and be in his face and count "1" "2" with his fingers and voice, its to make sure the boxer knows whats going on to give him a chance to figure out he needs to get up. its been like this for 100 years, its not 10 seconds, its a 10 count, most 10 counts are way longer than 10 seconds.
Jamie is the man who stood by Joe through out!!
After all those years, Joe is still a casual boxing fan regarding the rules.
Listening to Joe praise other fighters is so satisfying
By the way the great George foreman said he thought the ref did a great job and was one of the best referee jobs he had seen...he d isn't mention anything about the count being slow and he's a wilder fan
Put a timer above the ring so everyone can see it or on the big screens. There is too much controversy in boxing anyways. Eliminate the excuses.
The fat rolled down because the glove hits Fury's chest.
The fight really wasn't close. Fury dominated a majority of the rounds and Wilder looked out on his feet for over half the fight.
Wilder vs Joshua please!
Fury would have gotten back up at any count you gave him. He’s proven that
everybody loves a conspiracy
Joe talking about these fights, reminds me of my kids talking about what they think they are getting for christmas.
Make sure to show video Joe's watching. No point keeping camera on Joe if he wants to show us something.
that was two old men fighting behind a bar. I want to box tyson fury !! the fury vs the shoe !
Once again Joe Rogan spits some absolute BS stats! Larry Holmes had 44 professional knockouts and was 10 times better than either one of uncoordinated goofballs Larry Holmes greatest heavyweight champion of all time
Noo is not he could stop count if the fighter don’t go to the coner
Joe there are tens of people with double the amount of knockouts as wilder
Tony Hinchcliff is insufferable
Fury knocked him down three times, but all he’s going on about is wilders knock down. Never gives fury the respect he deserves
Wilder has devastating straight right hand but ONLY in the end range of the punch and to call him maybe the hardest punchers of all time, that's simply disrespectful to people like Earnie Shavers, George Foreman, Sonny Liston, etc. Doesn't matter how those people hit you - jab, hook, cross, in the pocket, outside of the pocket - you feel it in your entire body even if the punch was hitting your gloves. Sorry but Wilder is no where near a puncher like them. If Big George and  Mohammed Ali say that Shavers is the hardest hitting human being....you better believe it.
@1:50 is where I hear someone scared of cancel culture.   Crazy times we live in where u have to explain a saying like that. Joe literally went into damage control immediately.   Bring back the 80's and early 90's comedy asap!
Bad sell out wearing NASA outfit 🤦‍♂️
What took you so long?
Schaub On His Show: One of the greatest heavyweight fights of all time?...I don't think so. Rogan: That was one of the greatest heavyweights fights of all time! Schaub: I totally agree.
DC needs to STFU.....
Tyson was getting up at 8 count no matter what.... it's not his fault thencount was slow. You take as much time on the ground to regroup. Tyson wasn't knocked out
u wrong joe
Joe Rogan @13:41- ''There's not a single guy that has knocked out as many guys as Deontay Wilder has''  Rocky Marciano knocked out 43 of his opponents in 49 fights.
“Of all time”
Knocked fury down 4 times in 3 fights...fury got up every time. Power must not be that insane.
Wilder seems to be an emotionally weak man
Im tired of hearing this nonsense about the count, Joe said the exact same thing after their first fight and his fans told him the rules. Then he says it again? I might have to stop smoking weed because I dont want my memory evaporating as fast as Joe's seems to be, very disrespectful to Tyson to even bring it up as it is discrediting his victory.
Astro Joe is back
I was blessed to find a live stream on Twitter and saw this masterpiece for free
In my opinion fury was listening to the count.
Joe ‘look at the fat roll down’ Rogan
Great fight. Fury once again proved he’s the best.
Tony asking Jamie if he yells out for Buckeye stuff, like he already knows the answer. Bc both are from Ohio and most of us lose our minds about the Buckeye lol
Tony makes every podcast a grueling bore. Goodness buddy show some life
I looked forward to Joe talking about this fight... Then I realised Joe knows nothing about boxing 😂   Please don't keep echoing this bullshit theory that the countdown was long. It's just more excuses wilder fan boys can jump on. Fact of the matter is wilder is a terrible fighter and fury would win 100 times in 100 fights
Joe better learn the 10 count rule.
If a fighter leaves the neutral corner, the count is stopped until the fighter returns to the neutral corner... This is not a comment if the Fury long count, as I could t see where Wilder was.
Let's face it.. YouTube misses the JRE!!
Tyson 'The Gypsy King' Fuuuuuury 💪 x
Wilder hasn't been the same since he was KO'd by Charlie Z.
The white guy won.
what if loser scraps
mma guys don't know shit about boxing
It was debunked about the count was to long the 1st knock down he was 8 seconds and2nd knock down he got up 9.87 seconds
I want to hear this kid talk old-school wrestling .
love how Rogan  dismisses w "you don't know shit" out of an insecurity that noone knows more than him about fighting, even tho he's admitting he was wrong in that exact moment
Joe- if someone’s getting fucked up some refs let that shit go  Mario Yamasaki- if she die she dies
Your wrong Joe. If the other fighter causes the interruption by not going to the neutral corner the referee can stop his count to escort the fighter to the neutral corner.
That aint 10s its COUNT to 10
Honestly I think wilder can take out AJ and usyke .
Ref has to stop the count until the opponent is in his corner. That's why you always see Tyson jog to his corner when he knocks his opponent to the ground. Wilder lacks the boxing knowledge.
It wasn't a long count..I've boxed for over 30 years now..none of these guys have ever boxed you count at a certain speed..everyone who says this is because they are counting too fast..also, even if you count fast fury was still up before the 10 count..people just like controversy cuz it gives them something to talk about which is the whole point of these internet show anyway which is to have something to talk about..anyway s who gives a fuck wilder lost to fury for a third time get over it
He was losing a lot of blood in that 2nd fight though
Mayweather explains it on his channel Joe's wrong as usual fury was getting up when the ref says 8 no where in the rules does it say the count is to be 10 seconds
You don't know the rules to boxing. First of all it's up to the referee and the way the fighter looks. It's all up to the referee. There's no rules on counting..
Jon Jones wants a rematch vs his wife. Lets hope that fight never happens :(
Joe talking out his @$$ again. Fury was knocked hard but wasnt in trouble at all. He was the far superior boxer up until the time Wilder caught him. Was clear that he was going to win unless Wilder caught him again. When Fury went down he was clear as day. He probably thought that ‘I just got clipped so lets go down and just assess the damage and Wilder can’t hit me during that time’. If the ref was ‘quicker’ Fury would have just got up quicker.
Joe is lying for black fighters again. Combat sports biggest cuck and liar. Fury easily got up.
Wait so Wilder is called the bronze bomber in reference to his Olympic medalling? Or is it some other thing
The count is an arbitary count. Its not a 10 second count! The purpose is to access the damage to the fighter at the refs discretion. Joe doesnt understand this🤣
Have you noticed after every event Joe just saw “One of the greatest fights of all-time”? Also, come out of the damn closet Tony
Joe knows it all Mister know in all. Your mad because your boy lost.  I'm sure your liberal ass loves Biden. 💘
Joe Dr Evil Rogan
Fury was up in 8 seconds real time on the long count so it made absolutely no difference whatsoever in the fight.
You right Joe. At my moms we used to watch all the fights on the 90s with family and the cheers for and the boos against are awesome. Great dynamics
Whys he wear that
His dad named him after Mike Tyson!!!💯 His name is no accident.
Redban was so fast with “Joe King”
wilder should of won this fight because of that count that was bs
In terms of the counting,  I think Fury would have gotten up sooner if the ref was counting faster. I think he was just milking the count for all that it was worth. The shot behind the head seemed like he wasn't completely hurt
Joe he not a masterful boxer, he's brawler who's 6'9 .
Wilder had a 20 second count for his knockdown your point means nothing stop reaching. You can tell joe wanted wilder to win
Tyson fury dont just fight for himself he dont just fight for he's family for the money for the belt he fights for the everyday man the people who work and struggle  everyday to put food on the table he fights for the outcasts the kid thats being bullied at school he fights for the underdogs. Hes the peoples champion no fighter in history has connected with the people like tyson he is a once in a lifetime champion dont get me wrong champions come and go but none will leave a legacy or have such an impact on the public like tyson hes an inspiration. He is the champion of the people for the people he's a gladiator of our time a real life rocky and he still has another sequel to come
"One of the best boxing matches of all time" OK Joe....
It was action fight. Yes but quality it was terrible
Check out the third round knockout,when Wilder went down.Was a slow count around 12 seconds,but was 20 seconds before Wilder re-entered the fight.The boxer can only react to the refs count,and right or wrong both fighters had slow counts.The ref gave a fair count to both,if he fast counted Wilder but slow counted Tyson then i would say there's a problem.But as it stands,no one can really complain because Wilder would have been counted out in round 3.
Joe the astronaut
I lost 50$  putting money on the fight ending in the 7-9th, only for it to end in the 11th. God bless Fury tho.
It's a ten count not 10 seconds.
i wish joe was my uncle so bad
I think they keep the ref counting due to any disruptions that may happen from a corner or the opponent not following directions.
Tyson Fury was literally named after Mike Tyson, so it's not that coincidental
That is bullshit regarding the count btw the time keeper is only there for assistance if someone isn't in the right corner the count STOPS it stopped on 4 it starts on 4 it's that simple
Why is Joe dressed like Dr. Evil?
I’m so sick of hearing this. It’s not Fury’s job to count to 10 in his head and get up, it’s his job to get up to the count. Could he have got up quicker? Maybe maybe not, but to speculate that Wilder would have won if the count was made off the atomic clock  and negate all of what Fury did is just fanboy dick riding. Wilder got beat 3 fucking times, it’s enough already,
UFC  Fan who bought ggg vs canelo 1 as my first boxing ppv. Adelaide Byrd made me despise that sport.
"look at that fat! Look at it roll down!" Hahahhaaahhahahahaaha
JOE ROGAN. IF YOU CAN LET YOUR FANS SEE THE SRCEEN, WHEN JAMIE PUTS SHIT UP FOR YOU, THAT WOULD  MAKE YOUR SHOW PERFECT!!! THANX JOE
All these comedians think they have balls now after the Dave chappelle special Lmaoo
The first count of Wilder, The fight should of been stopped, he was out of it! 👍
No one seems to be pointing out it was Wilders fault the 10 count was interrupted for not going into a neutral corner and it’s for this reason I don’t think they was any corruption because how did he know Fury was going to knocked on his back side and that Wilder would not do as he is told by the Ref.  Wilder is a soar loser because Fury won 2 of the 3 fights and should of won the draw really because even all the boxers in the seats around the ring said Fury had won it.   It does Wilder no favours and makes him look like a bad sportsman spreading lies and trying to taint fury’s win with doubt when he won fair and square every time.  It’s wrong and he’s out of order for being part of it and but still fury extends the olive branch each and every time and gets it thrown back in his face……
That's right Wilder won .SURE PAL
NO he is NOT 'one of the greatest of all time" STFU
Fury was up long before that "long" count would have reached a legit 10.The boxer is also using the count to recover before he stands so he's basing that off the refs count.He may well have got up earlier if the count was quicker.
Good thing Cormier doesn’t box and either does joe.. just fan boys
Watch the counts again, ref basically started counting on 3 then corrected himself against the ringside count.
Lol dude fury could have got up even sooner but he's smart waiting for that 8 count drop this bull shit count shit
There was a long count for wilders knockdown, plus there was a 15 second when wilders doctor came in the ring at the start of the round
Joe knows little about the rules 🤷‍♂️
A ten count in boxing isn't 10 seconds and not only that the ref went to both Lockerooms and told both fighters he was gonna give them both every opportunity to keep going
I agree 💯 with joe hogan fury is so good I watched him from  start on Eurosport tv I new he was best and was special 😝
Canceled lol
What Joe said about the count is completely untrue. I’m very surprised he doesn’t know the rules. Tyson was also clearly waiting for the 8 count, had it been sooner, he would have gotten up sooner.
It was not long if you know the official rules. Good grief
Those guys around Joe need to be kicked out  “Did you watch the fight?” “No” “Long day tired”  Imagine staying awake till 5 in the morning UK time you DOSSERS
In Turkey we always do everything communally, much more fun…
why does he have to constantly spew misinformation? Like he's speaking so confidently about the ref count rules here but he clearly has no idea what he is talking about
Who’s hands are heavier, Wilder or Ngannou?
It’s Fury’s job to get up by 10, and he did. I see no problems.
I wanna see wilder vs ngannou
Yuck Tony.
Fury & Wilder both got long counts…
Yeah it was a long count, but Tyson got up before it would have been 10 anyways and Wilder winning would have been better money wise. That would make it 1-1 and a draw, they'd have to have a fourth fight!
That Mike Tyson guy was a pretty technical fighter with extreme one punch power...at least for the prime of his career.  He wasn't a goliath like these two guys though.
Reread the rules wasn’t a long count
Joe talk more about the weight. There seems to be a weight range for all weight class except heavy weight. The weight range for all other weight classes seems smaller than the difference in weight between Fury and Wilder. Does there need to be a new weight class?
Ffs Joe, you, Scholz and others that i follow all of a sudden have guests that know nothing about boxing right the next 1-2-3 days after one of the greatest fights have happened in modern history. Really a  bad timing. I would ahe loved to see a guest knowing about boxing and about Fury, Wilder and the world of boxing.
Even after Deontay got schooled Rogan is still obsessed with his power 🙄 just give Fury his flowers Joe
Was waiting for the fight analysis from Joe!
The odds you bozo? They named him to be a boxer, dummy..
Fury did to wilder what stipe did to Ngannou the 1st fight
I think Joe enjoyed the fight
Every black person seems to be making excuses for wilder.
Yes, the fight was corrupt in favour of fury, who clearly won the first fight but left the ring with a draw
your beginning to believe in your hype where everything you say is real.....you need a chill out time to check yourself...Still think your the man.
It’s kinda funny how Joe is talking about this fight to a bunch of casuals that didn’t even watch this fight 🤡
Redban looks like a cheep Tommy Buns now.
lol. Look at the fat rolling down...
People don’t understand though that a count shouldn’t start till the boxer that knocks his opponent down is in their corner. How many times does Wilder fart about dancing instead of running to his corner. Fury knew this I feel, I don’t believe that if there an LCD screen with an actual 10 count that Fury wouldn’t have got up in time.
Come on guys. Counts like that happen a lot in Boxing. It's just been highlighted much more in that fight.
So biased towards wilder lmao fuckin dosser
It’s like either way Tyson came back and beat that but
Wilder was also go extra time.
Lol the Tyson Fury thing adds another to the list of sloppy placeholder names for significant individuals in this simulation. Anthony Wiener sent wiener pics, Bernie Madoff made off with a bunch peoples' money, Trump might not fit that well but there are others I can't remember at the moment... Keep it goin.
Joe looks like he has a welding suit on lol lol 😂 lol 😂
Has anyone seen CNN roast Mr. Rogan on their one sided, communistic, agenda Featuring Dr. Sanjay Gupta?
Oh for fucks sake it's so irresponsible to suggest that "corruption" may have led to a slow 10 count when Fury was down. What is it about Americans and not being able to take a loss with class???
joe , if wilder stayed on his corner when he knocked out his opponent , the ref would be doing this thang ....he walked across for no damm reason ..wilder can only blame himself
The narrative about Deontay's power is getting a bit old. Fury literally knocked him out, so why isn't he a harder puncher than Deontay?
John fury (his dad) named Tyson after Mike Tyson and because he was a warrior who was told he might not survive birth.
Fury stated down and took his time. He took the time he's allowed because he's smart. Fury could have gotten up right away.  It's not fuckibg corruption. Fury won 3 fights. Americans making excuses for wilder
Isn't it funny how Joe Rogan plays dress up with gay people?
Remember folks, Joe has to point out the 15 seconds of Wilder winning first so he doesn’t be labeled as a racist.
Furys the daddy 💥
Joe should know better than this. It's not a 10 second count it's the refs count. And also Wilder did not do what he was supposed to do and go to a neutral corner.
Success by failure is what deyonte suffers from, he had little to no boxing technique compared to all other boxers.
dam, do you think fury could beat jake paul even?
Rogan shouldn’t talk about boxing with guys who don’t know boxing. Fury’s dad was a boxer and literally named him after a boxer
Furys fat saved him, dispersed the energy.
Joe was incorrect about the rules here
The heavy hitting power of deontay Wilder work for him because most heavyweights are typically slow but Tyson fury has great footwork and great boxing technique
you are losing your cred now with this shit joe
How do go on the rogen show and not watch the fight
Joe doesn’t know the rules of the count
Tyson isn’t pretty to watch. But so much heart, and smarts…
Even if a count is slow you cant say fury shouldve lost because he was coming up to the count he heard
I love when the original crew of friends are the guest, truthfully.
We knew he'd come back....
Its amazing that Deontay Wilder has accomplished all he has accomplished,  on basically not much other than Grit and a Sledgehammer right hand !
JOE exaggerates everything ROGAN
Fury only had 6 week training camp, let's not forget that!
If the ref thinks the fighter is really hurt they do a fast count if they think it’s not a bad beatdown they slow it. It’s for the fighters safety not about who wins or looses, at least that should be the primary concern.
Ten count vs ten seconds count ... if it was seconds we would have a clock and the ref would have a stopwatch ... idiots
No sober October ?
Love joe Rogan, lets go Brandon 🤣🇬🇧🇺🇸Glasgow uk
I hear a lot of what if’s but wilder will never beat fury
I never tire of the saying "drag em into deep water"
Wilder got put to sleep 3 times before the ko in 11th
Nope. That is wrong..the count stops if the opposing fighter strays from the farthest neutral corner..
Do you think Americans knows what it’s like watching huge boxing matches at 5am?
“You seen the fight ?” No no what the heck why you taking to people about the fight when they not Even interested and don’t know jack about it lol
Good fight, not the greatest fight ever though lol
They should have a digital clock and they should show the score after each round 🤷🏻‍♂️
I'm glad you put that CNN doctor in his place
Stop disrespecting Tyson. He’s not just skillful he knocked wilder tf out he’s got power
Fury had more knockdowns
Wilder has a good right hand, but he is a posterboy. I'll let YOU guess for 'who'...
That shit was garbage
Hey Tony, his name ain't so "crazy" when you consider that he comes from a family that has been boxing for generations, most of whom are 6ft4+ and he is literally named after Mike Tyson...
Ringside counter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 is NOT A THING IN BOXING 🤣🤣🤣 omg joe
Fury fell over twice fury put him to sleep all curled up on the floor out clean night night haha
Counts are always inconsistent in boxing.  I would love to see some historical analysis.
Who cares Daniel Cormia. Fury us by far the better boxer shouldn't shouldn't have been 3 fights
The count didnt matter he got up at 8 on the true count
Is Fury and Joshua still on the cards? Delighted for Fury. Unbelievable mental strength the man has. The way he got back up in that second was like god saying "you ain't done son" unbelievable moment that was too!
doesnt matter if the ref takes 3 hours to count to 10 seconds. its the refs decision. not ours
joe knows nothing about boxing
Well Tyson Fury’s father was a boxer and named Tyson after his fathers idol, Mike Tyson. So no it wasn’t random that his name was Tyson
Joe Rogan you are wrong on the 10 second count situation, boxing rules are that it is a 10 count not a 10 second count,  so the discretion is up to the referee also there is an official outside the ring who begins the count as soon as the opponent is knocked down,  And the referee takes up the officials count and then it becomes the referees count, If an opponent leaves the neutral corner the referee orders the opponent back into the neutral corner, the ref then continues the count, what people who are ignorant of the rules of boxing, They believe the count is 10 seconds to get the boxer out of there, the 10 count is an opportunity to give the fighter a chance to recover safely and continue the fight if possible not for some  Referee to count a hundred miles an hour to end the fight, the ignorance of the rules of boxing by some people is staggering, never mind joe Your still a legend and you get 1% of stuff wrong this being an example of that.
Best heavyweight fight of most of our lifetimes... Top 10 in history for sure!!!
Nobody:             Joe Rogan: “Look at that fat ripple”
HERES THE DIFFERENCE: LOOK AT FURYS EYES , DURING BOTH KNOCKDOWNS - HES ALERT AND FULLY CONSCIOUS . NOW WATCH WILDER S KNOCKDOWN - HIS EYES ARE BLURRY & HIS LEGS ARE UNSTEADY . IN A STREET FIGHT WILDER WOULD HAVE BEEN BATTERED
Salute to wilder a boxer that don’t know how to box but somehow made it this far. Hopefully he learns how to box he’ll be unstoppable.
The long counts had no bearing. Fury was just waiting on the refs count he was totally lucid. He was never that hurt especially after the second knockdown.
No referee would stop this fight earlier. The referee did his job correctly. There's a guy with the counting rule is here somewhere in the comments
tony 'the gay voice' hinchcliffe
Tyson fury will go down as one of the greatest heavy weights ever.
Fury  100 more punches.. Wilder  couldnt get past the long limbs
"If you could teach a boxer with power how to box, foot work, head movement, combos, be in the right place at right time, you'd have the greatest boxer ever."  Yes, his name was Mike Tyson at 21 years old.  When Cus D'Mato was still alive, and Mike was listening to him, Tyson had everything.  Crazy power, combos, head movement, timing, punching at angles, precision, footwork.  He was everything with a peekaboo defense, with one shot knockout power, and with 4 shot combo knockout power.  Young Mike Tyson, under Cus, was the single greatest boxer of all time.  When Cus passed, and he fired Kevin Rooney, and got arrogant, he started to headhunt and lost alot of his head movement and timing.  He was never the same.
When joe doesn’t know the rules of boxing and try’s to claim he does
F off fury knock out clean fury put him to sleep
How about the doctor who stepped in to talk Wilder when he was hurt? Playing that recovery time for him..
Let's go Brandon
Joe fat roll down rogan
Joe is wrong about the count rule. Check the marques of Queensbury rules. The count guy on the outside counts to start then the in ring ref takes over and his count is final. He is allowed to stop the count to get the other boxer to a neutral corner and then carry on where he left off. Please check the marques of Queensbury boxing official rules ffs before spouting shite
Tagg them upp. Break down the body.    How usman over done mazvidal . vs how chaos demolish Woodleys bone. Over head thinking  not even seeing .

White boy knocked the hell out of that big black buck
I was curious to see how Joe would play into Dante's hands since he is such that ass-kissing fence-sitter
13:37 Joe Rogan needs to look at Wladimir Klitschko record, he has knocked out more people, who were better fighters too, so yeah not the craziest boxing record as he believes.
Well, if you could teach Wilders aunty to grow a cock, she could learn to be Wilders uncle! It's a redundant question.  Here's an What if. What if Fury hadn't had Covid? And more importantly  What if Fury hadn't missed weeks of training, whilst his new born daughter was ill in hospital?  Fury is an absolute beast. He's remarkable, his fortitude is unmatched.
Wow didn’t think Joe would be stupid enough to believe the long count thing... thought he was better than that and knew more about the sport and rules, it’s a shame cus now people will use this to say Fury ‘cheated’ like last time which is disgusting
I yelled out while watching the Liam Smith fight last week. I’m a big fan of Liam’s, and the last time I yelled out before that was while watching the fight between Nick Diaz vs. Gomi…….it’s a very rare occasion
That fight was the best sports entertainment I ever saw in my 64 years
Shout out to John Gruden. Where my dogs at? Arf Arf!
The big screen in the stadium should do the count, so everyone can follow along The problem with that is now some guy in a booth, you can't see, is in charge of the outcome, and starting the count on time?  There is no perfect system, but there should be another system, on top of the ref.  There needs to be checks and balances, unless you are just that corrupt
It wasn't one of the best. Wilder gassed out by round 4, and he showed some heart. That was all.
I don’t like black people but fury should have lost
Lo9k at the far RIPPLE
I’ve been waiting for this
Heavy muscles got him gassed
Should be a stop watch
The counting thing is bull shit.  I watched the fight again last night and he does exactly what Joe says he should do. He was actually ahead of my count. He stops and comes back at a higher number. Both the counts were perfectly fine. He counts the correct way each time.
It’s called a standing 10 count not a 10 second count.
As a hard-core Wilder fan... The better man won... I thought for sure he Would have won. Especially after the 1st 4 rounds... Fury just built different.  It's wild asf. Only man to ever get up after being hit with a brick
Be careful joe, can't hurt gay folks' feelings.
Did Wilder break his hand in the 3rd round?
of course fatman didnt see it
Little late joe
I thought the count wasn't supposed to start till he's in the corner
Look at that fat roll down rogan
as soon as I clocked Redban... I left
Fury whipped your lad, kicked his butt as you say...
Tyson Fury was up in 10 seconds 28 milliseconds in the second knockdown on the 4th, first knockdown(4th round) he was up way before 10 seconds.
Joe is wrong big Jon knows best 🤷‍♂️, also it's called a count not a timer.... There's a reason for that
THEY WONT LET DUNCAN ON THE PODCAST 🤦‍♂️  NOT THE SAME SPACESUIT SESSION
That is not true at all, no one continues to count but the ref. look at the rules, The ref if he hast to tell Diante Wilder or anyone else to get into the furthest neutral corner away, he picks up where he left off not anyone ringside that is absolutely not true. And is everyone saw both of those knock downs he was only sitting on his butt, he took his time getting up because he was paying attention to the count, if that count would’ve been quicker he’d gotten up quicker that’s obvious. Wilder got knocked down on his back, and then took a nap.
have been waiting for this
Nasa is a movie studio.
Tony hinchcliffe talking about fighting is so cringeworthy.
So many nerds and emotional casuals watching these fights I hate speaking on it. "I DoNt lIkE WiLdEr" smh shutup
Wilder is a cry baby and a sore loser. It's why is we as Americans couldn't get behind him. So glad Fury put him down.
The fighters won't get up until they hear the refs count at 8. He was up before it would've been 10 anyways. I'll have to see it again to make sure
Yes it was legendary but Yhr way they where explaining the fight until the very end you would have thought WILDER won with how far up WILDERS ASS JOE is .You need to rewatch it cause FURYS PERFORMANCE WAS WAY WAY BETTER THEN WHAT YOU WXPLAINED JOE .
I’m just imagining them being dressed like this while being stoned af🤣🤣 (THAT WOULD BE A MUST WATCH)
Count is not in seconds, experienced boxers wait until the end of count to get up, to recover better.
"Did you shit your pants?"
space suite Joe  !!!
I knew he was gonna wait till friday...
Ive read the count has to stop if fighter isn't in corner
Tony can't help himself with the Chinese 🤣
Check out the history and DNA of fury, Bartly Gorman documentary by Shane meadows and you will understand the king of the Gypseys honour and the fearsome family of fighters that runs through their veins.
Suger Rey Lennnon.  Only guy ive seen run in boxing ring vs tomm hearns.
There are plenty of videos with a stopwatch along with when exactly fury hits the mat and it shows clearly it was NOT a slow count.
Imagine watching a fight with your friend, hanging out later and then your friend talks for 12 straight minutes to you describing what you both saw.
ALL HAIL THE GYPSY KING !!!!!!!!
I would pick Fury to beat any boxer that ever lived.
Joe you are absolutely wrong: "When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall direct the opponent to move to the farthest neutral corner of the ring. If the opponent leaves the neutral corner, the referee shall interrupt the count and will not resume the count until the opponent returns to the neutral corner."
Joe is rarely wrong but his info on the count isn’t right. It isn’t a 10 second count, it’s a ten count, if the fighter isn’t in the neutral corner then he can stop it to tell him to go to the corner and he doesn’t have to pick it up from the ringside official. Also - watch the count again and look at the clock at the bottom left, count with it, he’s up by 10 seconds. There is no controversy, even Wilder hasn’t come up with this excuse and he’s the master of excuses
i fucking love joe talking about boxing
The count debate is super interesting, on the one hand the other guy should have won by the rules of the count was too long, but in this case Fury presumably got up at 12 seconds and then proceeded to win every round and knock him out. Also, if he heard the accurate count he may even have gotten up quicker. It almost reminds me of Volk v Ortega, by the rules they probably should have stopped Ortega from answering the next round as he was out, but when they did allow him he came out just as hard as before.  One is justified in saying “I should have won because the count was long”, but in reality if the guy needed only 12 seconds to get up and destroy you then you really didn’t win in anyone’s eyes (the old Diaz argument lol)
This was Clash of the Titans, great fight.
This is like Sagat discussing his fighting skills with Mario and Luigi
Extra weight? As long as footwork weight comfortable.   Like izzy gained ten pounds  not 5.    Rjj stays light weigght for his ft wrk to grt the punches iin.
2:02 that guy Not knowing what "queer st"  is, is funnier than him laughing about wtf is that that he didn't know.  English is my second language and I know it.  I guess I'm from the 70s and 80s.
Thank God, I was waiting for this for so long lol
This fight reminded me of the last episode of the 2011 FX show, Lights Out. Very good show.
Too many excuses being made for Wilder
Giving credance to the slow count babble. Absolute hogwash
Joe "loot at that fat" rogan
I screamed when wilder knocked him down . I couldn't believe my eyes
10000000% screamed at my TV 😂😂
It was a good fight but not a great boxing match. Wilder is the most over hyped boxer in the pro ranks today. Tyson is best heavily weight of modern times but you can't judge him by the Wilder fight cuz he's that bad it make him look better. Tyson has bin down an had really hard fight with some propa past it fighters. John mcderrmot. Neven palkic. Steve cunningham
Let’s gooo bumsquad got slept
Joe and DC are wrong about the refs count learn your boxing guys
INCORRECT. Its a ten count, not a count to ten.  stick to MMA Joe, because you dont know shit about boxing
Space suits break-in mine out
Vitor ready for Prime RJJ!!  Sweet style. Similar to Roy youungerself
Joe should stick to mma. He knows nothing about boxing. Its 10 count, not 10 sec count.
Joe's guest speaks straight through his nostrils 😆 So annoying, Somebody get that dude some benadryl 🤧
He said his parents named him Tyson after mike
get a new studio
NASA SUIT PODCASTS RULE!
Dam Joe, don't give the delusional Wilder tards any credit. Fury win that first fight but was robbed and we all know it. In the 2nd fight Fury absolutely dominated and destroyed Wilder and yet was forced to fight him again. I'm sick of the racist Wilder fans overlooking those FACTS. Fury is a better boxer and he's beaten that man I'm all but 2 rounds of 3 fights. Wilder broke his hand against Fury from hitting him so hard and yet he couldn't knock him out. Let's move on from this matter. Fury is better and that's obvious to all but the racist.
Tyson Fury beats Deontay Wilder 100 times out of 100. He's simply got Wilders number .
Tyson & Wilder gave boxing a gem with this one. The fans are the real winners here 🙌
Wilder vs Joshua, Usyk vs Fury Next!
I want Joe's jacket
Think joe hasnt seen an inoue fight
Joe, you're chatting shit about the counts. Fury was totally in control of that fight. Even if the counts were faster, Fury would just get up quicker.
Do some research Joe. Deontay is nowhere near the top of KOs in history. Archie Moore holds the record for most KOs with 145 KOs
Of course Cormier gonna be on wilders side
Jesus christ the stupid bias toward Wilder is insane. The counts were completely normal, Tyson was sitting on his hands just watching the count waiting to get up at 7, questioning whether a 1 or 2 second delay would've made Fury lose is fucking delusional. Just accept that there are no mitigating factors, Wilder would get beat 99 times out of 100 by Fury.
Wilder had slow count too when he got knocked down in the third. Fury got up at 9/10. Then he put his hands up.
till this day
Joe starting a career as a corner robot  cowboy
Wilder is Happy Gilmore next to Tyson, as Arnold Palmer.
"look at his fat ripple" ahah love it Joe really is high as an astronaut masterclass by the Gypsy King, bring on the Ukrainian Champ who's name i can't spell
“Wilder has knock out power” but he couldn’t knock out Charlie Z 😂
Hot take with the golden pony. Nice
One of the greatest fights of all time? Come on. Wilder looked like a zombie
It’s a nice thought n all the fat rolling down from the punch but it was clearly fury’s arm closing in to his body that caused it 🤷‍♂️
Holly shit is that Dr.Evil ?!
Wilder benefited from a slow count too.
Tyson had no problem being up in time..he also clearly would have gotten his shit together faster if he would have needed too
Tony literally looks like a Lobster.
The 2nd fight. Fury cheating hook to the head.    Bas rutten would teach . palm defense.   Nt much needed of power to hurt sumeone.    Blind fighting  brain still active.
they def gotta go to a visual count aside from the ref human error is too much of a chance to have these fights outcomes possibly changed from it it's bullshit wilder could've won with that hit watch the count
he woulda got up faster the fighters get up based on the count they hear they buy all the time they can getting up
Ugh redban.... here to ruin a good podcast. Idk why. I just don't get it. He's not funny...
Joe Rogan wearing his NASA suit like a good little sell out
Joe “he got hit HAAAAARD” Rogan
One of the greatest fights of all time? That shit was Terrible. Deontay's footwork was attrocious... he clearly did very little road work because he was tired by like round 4 and aside from the 2 knockdowns he landed on Fury, he looked like a drunk stumbling out of a bar at 2 in the morning. And Fury looked unusually sloppy as shit in the fight too. The undercarda were better.
Glad Joe Rogan is talking about the long slow count on this fight...no one else want to touch the issue because they hated Wilder
I think there is a rule in boxing that the counting doesn't continue if the opposing boxer is not in a neutral corner. Tyson was judging himself getting up, based on the referee. Which is what he should have done.
Wilder got robbed again
I don't know about you guys but I just want to outlive Tito's kids.
Boxing matches have been ghey since ‘90s.
I forgot how annoying Redban is
I don't think as many people as Joe says believed Fury was in trouble. He didn't look hurt to me. His eyes were wide open, he was coherent, and he was looking at the ref. He didn't look out of it the way Wilder did when he got up those two times.
everyone talks about wilder's heart , but god damm give props to fury for taking the biggest punches in round 4 from the greatest one punch KO artist TWICE and laugh it off, eat it and knock the spark out off wilder , thats heart ..that man is destined for greatness and the worst part is he dont give 5 flying fucks
That guy on the show with joe is clueless lol 🤦‍♂️
People talking about if the count was faster Fury would've lost. You all do realize that Fury was setting there taking a break waiting for the count to be over and he could've easily got up if the count was faster? Even though he was knocked down, he was fully conscious and didn't even fall flat on the ground. If this goes to show anything, it shows how superhuman Fury's chin is.
Lost all respect for wilder after his racist crap.   He’s a coward and a horrible sportsman’s.     All respect though to Fury.   🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
RIP Bryan callan
Lost me at the 2nd knock down controversy bit
Fake
Tyson vs Usyk would be an amazing fight for boxing.
The count might have been slow but fury was also slower to get up because the count was slow, he didnt hurry because he knew how much time he had to get up.
Cejudo ability to wrestling.  He csn wide back roll under the kickboxers kick.    And or swi lng out n take a single leg. Ooo      Turtle Back Wide. The rou d kick rolls over.
That fight sucked
I took the vaccine so I dont have to treat myself like a pig or a horse.
Fury may have benefited from a slow count but so did Wilder...he didn’t give either of them special treatment.
This fool has no idea just spewing lies. Him and DC have no idea what the rules are. If the ref has to step away to ask the boxer to go to the neutral corner, he resumes the count where he started. He doesn’t look to the ringside to figure out where his count is. DC is wrong, Joe is wrong. We can argue whether the rules are faulty, but they are the rules and they were enforced properly.
The fight was rigged
Some slight bias coming from joe towards wilder. He got smashed. Simple as that. Fury is the superior boxer
Self Defense Humor: https://youtu.be/RfOeXJpw3sI
Tyson Fury has it all, not just skill, Wilder's right hand met it's match, this match was fated..like Hector vs Achilles or something haha
its really funny to me that they didnt know Tyson fury was named after mike tyson? at least thats what i was told...
Stick to UFC and dmt
but the question is how often do pros beat pros 40 pounds heavier than them at that level? take 40lbs off of Fury and run it back.
Joe, no. The timekeeper starts the count and the ref picks up THAT count. Once that count is picked up the time keeper stops. If the ref has to stop the count because he has to guide the other fighter he must RESUME the count. So your analysis is incorrect.
I've waited for days for Joe's take on this fight and it sucked and why was he surrounded by a bunch of assholes..you can do better.
Fury was going off the refs count. He would have gotten up sooner if he had to so if the ref did count slow I don’t think it matters because I believe Fury could have gotten up in time. However, if he did not get up in 10 seconds I can see how some people would think Wilder won
Finally no more fucking politics and covid. Love these takes
appreciate your commentary here Joe but your two buddies here don't know enough about boxing to contribute
Why is joe talking shit about some imaginary time keeper?  He just trying to back cormier by making up bullshit?   The ref counted correctly because Deontay wouldnt go to his corner,  Joe should know this.
I watched the knockdowns several times. Fury wasn't down for ten real seconds, much less a ten count
Joe is wrong about the count though. The referee picks up the count where it was after the opponent returns to the neutral corner. Not the count from the ringside. This is only used in the beginning.
Imagine being Deontay Wilder and knowing you're one of the hardest hitters to have ever lived and KNOWING the other guy will still get up and beat you into the ground.
Why is the count such an issue? It has been like this forever! It’s not a 10 second count, it’s a 10 count. The ref has every right to interrupt the count if the other fighter isn’t in a neutral corner. Fury was never knocked out. He was paying attention to the ref the whole time.
Finally Joe with his foil
2:08 How do you rewind like this?
It was a great fight. Don't start with that long count shit again though, that shit happens all the time in boxing, a count might get interrupted for a few seconds so the ref can tell the other guy to go to the corner. It's normally in boxing.
Can't wait to hear Tony Hinchcliffe's take on this..
Hey Joe, saw your interv where you said you won’t take any vaccine because your immune system is powerful and taking the vaccine would only take away it’s power. Ok fair play. But……you ran as fast as a scolded cat when you got diagnosed with Covid and within 30 mins you were ringing any and every doctor you can to get medicine. You took more meds, injections and pills that a opiate junkie within the first 3 days of getting Covid, so if your immune is so powerful and treatments reduce it’s power, why did you take all you could when you got Covid? You look a coward Joe and a big mouth. We always thought you could only talk the talk and not walk the walk, and now we know for a fact what a beta male you truly are.
Count wasn’t slow. Rules of boxing specifically say that the referee is supposed to stop the count if the the fighter leaves or is not in a neutral corner. Had wilder went to the neutral corner earlier, and stayed put, the count may have worked in his favor.
That is not correct. The count was just fine . Exactly by the book.
For Godssake somebody tell Rogan to read the fucking rules of boxing. He's DEAD ASS wrong about how the count works.
I love Tony!! you can see why joe had his back all these years he is so funny i love kill tony
I need a soundboard to talk bollocks at 'OHHHH TONY'
Me:☕️🐸  lol….watching Tyson Fury fans ignoring THA FUCK OUTTA the slow count conversation…. 😰👀
Wilder threw 3 or 4 punches. He got beaten all through and people say it's the best fight. He was hurt and wouldn't be able to come back from this. His confidence is wrecked.
Fury is a common last name in Ireland particularly for Irish Gypsies. It is amazing that he is called Tyson Fury.
Someone tell them Tyson fury was named after Mike Tyson
209lbs at 6'7" is pretty lanky.
You're wrong about the count Joe. The ref can stop the the count to tell the fighter to go to a neutral corner & pick up where he left off. He only picks up count from side timekeeper on initial count.
Tyson knocked wilder da fuck out. Ya'll remember that punch right.... I mean wilder went to his maker!! Right??!!
oh no, please dont add fuel to those Wilder excuses.
So Joe is in favor of UBI.  So why does he not start hiring and paying people from his enormous millions?!?   I’m not hating on Joe he has worked hard and I respect him but it’s real easy to be for those things like all these other people and they actually do nothing about what it is they do all this talking about.  He has made his money off of being capitalistic entrepreneur.  Just sayin!
Tony hinchliffe has the most punchable face in the world.
American sports lol ponzi
Wilder could be best ever if he trained at early age
Why go to the extremes of fairness and take away the magic ?!?
Why nasa suits lol
Why does redban look like Bart krescher
Spotify employees gonna be mad when they see Tony
NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE......Joe you are DEAD ASS WRONG and you're spreading bullshit. Shame on you. It REALLY hurts your credibility. You DO NOT understand the rules of boxing. Once the ref picks up the count, the ringside timekeeper STOPS keeping time. Their job is OVER and DONE. The ringside timekeeper starts the clock when the fighter is knocked down. The ref picks up the count from the timekeeper. At that point, the timekeeper is IRRELEVANT. If the other fighter does not go to the neutral corner, the ref is supposed to pick up where he left off. Why? Because it's a TEN COUNT....not TEN SECONDS. Either learn how it works or stop talking about it.
23k dislikes!!! People are fighting for you... not they need to... you slayed.. I wish you would have body slammed gupta...
Julian the Hawk Jackson had 49 knockouts so 9 more than Wilder but he was middleweight.
Am I the only one seeing joe in a space suit or....
Dude, as soon as I saw Tony's space gloves I cracked up. He went all out.
i been waiting for this JOE ..JOEEE ....like the great ALI uttered your name once lol
Imagine calzaghe training wilder. If he could pull it off, well.....
Tyson gets up at 8 no matter how fast or slow the count.
Tyson not only out boxed him but out classed him as well
Made me so happy to see Deontay's blm loving butt get his ass whooped.
If you time both knockdowns in the 4th, Fury is not on the canvas for 10 seconds in either of them.
Joe is wrong here. Only because DC said some bullshit he doesn't have to agree. Count for yourslef, put a timer on your phone. You will see he gets up before 10s both times. Wilder is a bum, simple as that!
Not sure how this was the best boxing match, guys so overweight he just threw the odd punch and then hugged it out and leaned on wilder. Ultimately landed a half decent right hand 🤷
Been waiting for joes reaction to this 😍
I dont think he is a worthy guest for Joe to dress up like he would for Duncan.
TRUMP WON
Love Kill Tony
Tony Hinchcliffe is one of the best stand up comedians around. Such an important figure in comedy. Making history every week. Kill Tony is one of the only things l really look forward to each week. also please don't let joe kidnap your show next week with his drunk loudness.
Joe its wrong
It was a slow count but if you go and watch it. Fury was up in 6 seconds for the first knock down and was up at 8 seconds (even though the ref was at 6) for the second knockdown.
yo that fight was EVERYTHING by far the best fight in the past 3 maybe 5 years
Tysons real name is Luke
Joe “look at his fat ripple” Rogan
Not there fault.  2 count to 1 count..  Check count  1 tag pin 2  as 1 count.    Check 1 speak on 2 a count.
It's not a 10 seconds count! It's a 10 count - two different things. Y'all clearly don't know much about boxing
Tony looks out of place in the space suit
I'm not implying anything, but if Tony was an astronaut he would concentrate on Uranus.
Joe drippin
We need the Chris Webby episode.
Cut the gloves off and fight is over inside 2 rounds . Fury on a different planet skill wise in this match up.
Everyone wants to conveniently forget that Wilder got a long count too when he was knocked down. Get a life people. Tyson Fury was just better, there's no conspiracy here.
A great BRITISH campion!
Word has it no one has ever ever seen Jaimes face.
That was the punch that broke wilders hand.
Joe is incorrect about the count. Once Wilder goes to the wrong corner, and the ref has to direct him to the furthest neutral corner, he doesn't have to pick up the count. The ref did everything correct.
His father was a fan of Mike Tyson… that’s why he named him that… lol it’s not crazy luck
Like if you’ve been waiting for this video  The fight was definitely LEGENDARY!
“They do a count in Japan but with Chinese words or whatever”  Wow.
Can’t do it with this vocal fried closet case 🤦🏽‍♂️
It was the best heavyweight fight in a long time but nowhere near the best.
The count wasn't slow. They seemed consistent for all of the knockdowns, for both fighters from what I saw. Didn't even realise there was talk about it. Not to say they couldn't improve the rule...
This week of guests was tense. Great way to finish off.
Not going to mention Wilder's long count? He had more time than Fury had! Not only that but Fury was never not there. Wilder was stumbling drunk from the 3rd round on. Look at them both after the fight and who looks like they were in a fight? Fury looked the exact same after the fight as he did when he was walking to the ring. Now look at Wilder. He looked like he was in a bad car accident. There's absolutely nothing Wilder can do to beat Fury. He can't out box him, can't out power him, and he can't out heart him.
fury stays down til the 8/9 to let his legs recover, slow count or not he was getting up, just excuses from old black power daniel cormier
it wasnt a slow count at all
tony doesn't know what he's talking about
"Walkin' In Vegas" pitch perfect after an 11 round slug-fest?  That was pretty special too..
I was just literally going to search Joe Rogan on Tyson Fury fight and I see this.
Here we go again. Tony can’t help but to be racist against Asians again with his counting machine.
Not sure if I would count this third fight as one of the greatest heavyweight fights because of the skill gap. Even the first fight was a see saw. Whyte Vs Chisora wasn't even for a belt but was a real back and forth. I'd say AJ Vs Klitschko was better as well.
Brian starting to turn into jabba the hutt
Great fight and the count looked long but Fury was up in time.. Wilder needed to stay in the neutral corner after what happened in the first fight .  Fury won fair and square and Wilder is the second best heavyweight in out era , so far .... Deontay should be proud of his performance  .
Didn’t Tyson fury fight a Russian guy with 60 ko’s?
Is he wearing tin foil
RIP Joe Rogan
What's with that gay a** NASA outfit? 😂🖕🏻 NASA = Never A Strait Answer. Eart is flat and no astronaut has EVER been to space. P. S : Tyson Fury rules and Beyoncé Wilder is a racist crybaby
Was looking forward to this... _but_ Joe is in his space suit... Meaning he is going to be a bit less coherent than usual...
The count wasn’t slow. Wilder wasn’t in his corner and that’s why it was stopped.
My neighbour literally just tried to stab me. Just saying. Sup homies.
It was in K1
He was down for 17 seconds, to damn long
Joe, invite Max Kellerman as a guest!
If Wilder could just move his head just a LITTLE bit, he wouldn't have taken many punches and would've won that fight. He just didn't have the skills.
Cage fight needs 235LB championship bracket.  Middle heavy
Prize Fighting: The Red Light District of Sports
"When a boxer is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent to the farthest neutral corner of the ring and pick up the count from the timekeeper or the official counting for knockdowns. Should the opponent fail to stay in the corner as directed by the referee, the referee shall stop the count and redirect the boxer to go back to the corner and resume the count at the point that it was interrupted. In the event of any knockdown, the timekeepers count will cease when picked up by the referee whose count shall prevail and be relied on by the boxers."  This is from the WBF rules.    I found it in 30 seconds.  I wish people wouldn't talk so much nonsense when you can easily check it online.   Wilder moved away from the Corner he was sent to which is why the count was stopped.
Wilder was robbed, that belt belongs to America.
Was looking forward to this discussion but had to turn it off due to your guest. Whoever he is, he is beyond annoying. Hard to listen to.
FUNNYPANTS SMITH
Damn Joe I finally heard u say something that I know not to be true the ref doesn't start count right away he 1st has to tell the standing boxer to go to neutral corner then he starts his count if that boxer moves from that corner the ref will stop counting. & Even if u think he got a break Wilder got a break after his knockdown the bell saved him then when the round started the doctor jumped in the ring & he got extra time to rest we need to accept that Fury won fair & square. But overall just enjoy that it was such a great heavyweight fight no doubt
3 furys are professional fighters
Let's Go Brandon!
Joe's bias shows again, judges were bias too! Towards Wilder! Have you seen THE scorecards! They were giving rounds to Wilder that were obviously Fury's! Second knock down was back of THE head. NO klnch allowed
Joe is wrong, sorry. If the fighter that scored the knockdown is the cause of the count being interrupted i.e. because they did not go to the neutral corner as instructed then the ref should pick up the count where he left it. The count should not continue during the time that the ref pauses to tell the fighter to get to the neutral corner.
Tony deserves zero airplay.
Wilder KO'd 40 bums. The one quality fighter he faced, he lost three out of three.
It's a fight. We needed a fight. We got a fight. Thank you Wilder and Fury. Appreciate your work
Deontay lost because someone stole his hamster, the police were in on it as they refused to investigate. The ring girls were part of the conspiracy because they kept holding up numbers for no reason. Deontay can't be stopped its been 20 months and till this day TILL THIS DAY he will not acknowledge these fake ass months Deontay knows there's no such thing as months. There's only days and he has been in a daze since the day.
Redban looks like tom when he was fat
Why is Joe wearing a stupid nasa suit?
You can criticize Wilder on his boxing but you can’t criticize his heart. Fury is a fucking beast though.
Fury really adopted alis body roll odd ropes?? Aahh
The boxing count it’s not about the number it’s just a thing to give the ref time to call the fight or continue the fight some fights they stop it when the count at 2 or 3 so it’s not about the number it’s about is the boxer in good place to continue the fight
I’m watching this as I smoke a blunt laced with ivermectin.
Kill Tony is a great hilarious comedy show.
we want Eddie Bravo
This is ridiculous. Fury was just following the count. He could have easily gotten up on 6 seconds. Why would he not give himself the most time possible?
There's a video where in every fight the ref does a slow count.  But bc wilder wasn't in his corner the ref stopped to tell wilder to go to his corner
Fuck! Now all the pro wilder channels are gonna be making this long count excuse,  and be quoting joe Rogan!
Like whatching in the day Monday night football
These guys don't know anything about boxing. Stay in your lane wankers.
Aren't the long counts just a standard part of boxing now? Like fouls in football (soccer). It's the refs call to keep the fight moving.   Also, Joe's too blazed to remember that Wilders corner threw in the towel in the second fight. The ref didn't stop it early.
We all wanted to see a true knockout, meaning the other guy can't get up. To hell with that 10 count. The ref was just as slow on the wilder counts.
Has Tony Hinchcliffe come out of the closet yet ? Or is he still pretending to be straight ?
Joe is absolutely incorrect on the rules. That is not the process of how refs are suppose to count out fighters. It's the other fighters responsibility to go to the corner. If they leave the corner you stop the count and pick up where you left off
Only people saying it was long, including joe, don't know the rules.  They can stop the count, and pick up where it was left off. Not what Joe said. Such misinformation
Hmph.
The count conspiracy is bs According to the rules (often not followed) the ref is only supposed to count when the Wilder in this case is in the opposite corner. Besides, the ref counted super slow on every knockdown
Maybe what the ref didn’t was wrong but still watch the fight and do a fair count yourself fury makes it up just in time before 10 I even did it with a stop watch fury gets on his feet in time 2nd one was close but he got up in time this was rocky shit
Tony!!!
Wilder claims he is demon possessed when he fights. He said he stands outside his body and watches. Fury claims his power comes from God, specifically Jesus Christ. The interview is online. Wilder said, "my god (satan) will defeat your God" and Fury said "my God has already defeated you" meaning The Cross. Then he knocks his ass out. Pure picture of glory 😍
I like the Space suit of Rogan
Fury was still very clear eyed when he was down. He's a savy guy & dragging it out for the 8 count. Point is, he would've gotten up just the same. Wilder should've been more composed, got to the neutral corner immediately & stayed there.
Wilder would beat AJ easily
The long count "controversy" is nonsense. At no point was Tyson dazed or out of it. He stood up, as you're supposed to, as the ref got to the end of his count. If the count was quicker, he would have stood up quicker.
Bomber was closet to the ko count.  Fury like who?  Well seening wilders ko..
Rogan come on man it wasn't a slow count. Stick to UFC. The count is 1 Mississippi 2 Mississippi, it doesn't go by seconds. A full count is actually about 20 seconds. It also wouldn't have matter Fury played the count to rest, he would have been up no matter what. Wilder is too dumb to do the same.
The long count in the 4th round may have been due to Wilder not going to his corner. I have to see the wide shot of that count
Wow thought rogan knew the boxing count down rules.  Obviously doesn't.  Thats not what the book says.
YES JOE, I’ve been waiting with my orange jumper on with a fat rollie in my hand just for this moment. Solidarity brother 💪🏽😎
Fury went down at 17 seconds left in the 4th round. He didn't even get up off the canvas until 6 seconds left. The ref was off by a good 5-6 seconds
Why does Kill Tony/JRE not make an effort to shout out local Austin comedians? Seems weird. Maybe there aren’t any good ones…
I see joe is starting phase 2 of his cult. His minions are wearing uniforms now.  ...and of course he gets the glorious shiny uniform.
It’s a 10 count, not a 10 second count. It’s up to the ref and always has been done that way. If he’s counting faster then fury would have gotten up faster. When you get knocked down you need to take every second you can get to recover, it doesn’t help you to rush if the ref is telling you that you have time.
Wilder was also help out by the referee in the King Kong Ortiz fight
In boxing, its the refs count of 10 - oppose to a literal second count - fighters are just told to listen to the refs count
Why tf does joe talk about badass fights like this with Tony
I legit thought Redban was Segura
My uncles name is actually Joe King! Lol
Excuse me weight classes
Real ogs
Is one of the greatest boxing matches of all time? Not even close dude I grew up in the seventies Look at all the great fighters and all those white classes
I got to give it to both fighters. The shots they took wouldn’t just knock out most people, it’d probably kill them. The power and violence in those hands are insane.
Wylder skips leg day.
Ooo. Tyson fell for his hook.  Dang rope fight for the jab and right hard hook .  Side the head for a KO.   Joe. In front of the ear. Is a switxh.  Numbs the face  numbs the lips tongue  eyes shut off..   Like we call.. Blind wrestling..  Arm reach the bodies.   Fury fell his enjoyment to hooking his long arms.  Even duubke hook. Front inside.  To front hook long outside. Hooking arm the head inward swing like wrestlers arms. ..
Tony ....Tony ... ........Tony.........tuttuttut.....Redbar
The fights between these two are amazing, but you know it's legit taking years off of their lives.
If you're only as good as your last fight then usyk beats fury
If only Deontae had fury’s chin woulda been the reverse result at least Deontae is set for life he has a good story and could stop now and still be known forever
10 count in boxing does not mean 10 seconds count
I was rooting for Fury but when Wilder started throwing bombs after being in zombie mode for 5 rounds I have to admit he won me over. Never seen such a show of heart
Hi I’m here for the Asstronut party. 🥰
Fury can only respond to the count. So whatever the pace he’s managing himself accordingly
8 seconds for both knockdowns in the 4th. Rewatch it before saying such nonsense! Fury beat the guy 3 times ffs give it a rest
The ref had a slow count for Wilder too so at least it was even
When knocked down experienced boxers will watch the ref and get up in accordance with the count. If the ref counted faster Fury would have gotten up faster. WTF are they talking about with a screen and shit, so dumb.
The skill level of this match wasn't anywhere close too Bowe vs. Holyfield 1. Fury is an extremely talented boxer...Wilder has a crushing right hand, kudos to both the fighters.
Grown men playing dress up. Also. For tean aye tea ate
One of the GOATS doesn't work
I’m saying it this was ? Vs ?. And we won
Rogan vs. Uygur when?
"you ain't worf a sausage" Tyson Fury to Wilder 😂😂😭
Count wasn't long, check out the youtube clips, and plus Fury was on his feet within 6/7 seconds so it didn't matter anyway.
This fight was trash. Lots of hugging.
Damn it almost feels disrespectful to Duncan to see the astronaut outfits without him
Tyson Fury TOP 5 Best of all time !!!!!
U can tell Joe wanted Wilder to win.
Wilder has a prison body. All upper body and no legs.
Tyson was listening to the referee. So he got up according to the refs count.
Most likely corruption if Frank Warren is involved 😂
I’m tired of joe belittling boxing
Fury could have gotten up at anytime.
That was an epic fight!
Redband!? 😂
If that punch in the first fight didn’t keep him on the deck those 2 knockdowns in fight 3 weren’t stopping Fury. Fury said himself you have to spark him out cold.
It doesn't matter if it was a long count; the boxer's job is to watch the referee for that nine count or eight count and then stand up. He's supposed to get as much rest as he can, that's not the boxers fault. Tyson Fury clearly wasn't out; his eyes weren't closed and his head was up. His head did not hit the canvas, he was fine.
Get Tyson on the show. They named him after mike and he was actually a really little baby. So no one imagined he’d be so big.
Joe has run out of guests! How many times has he had this guy on already?
Tyson was named after Mike Tyson because his farther was a boxer and Mike Tyson was his favourite.
Joe rogan is embarrassing himself with that outfit
What we’ve all been waiting for
Fury vs Wilder 3 was a blessing for boxing... *Boxing needs more of high level fighter vs high level fighter just like UFC*
The count thing is silly, because fighters wait for that count to get to 8 or 9. Regardless of the speed a fighter will wait a bit if they're smart, they catch their breath first
Does rocky Marciano's record not count?
Tyson Fury sounds exactly like a Character from Street Fighter or KOF
Stop making excuses for Wilder. He a inferior boxer and inferior sportsman. He lost..deal with it
Fury would have got up within the 10 count even if it wasn't a long count. He was only reacting to the referee and taking his time but he was completely lucid and aware.
The downed fighter follows along the count and chooses to get up at 8 to be sure he has his legs under him. That’s the way it is. If the ref had been a bit faster Fury still would have gotten up.
Youngstown. Boxing town! Great fight. Fury all class. Wilder classless. Too bad after such a great effort.
ok Joe cool talk but let's get serious.   Fury vs. Rousey - who ya got?
I totally enjoyed that fight.  I thought he was done in round 4.... not so!!!
Big John said that you don't pick it up. He said that if the punishment for the other fighter not doing what he was told
"Its almost like your watching it live".  AWESOME
Its because of Tyson Fury's fighting Irish lineage
Wilder looked gone after both knockdowns, Fury looked fine. Great fight, Fury is a beast
The bias towards wilder is scary
wilder spent his teens hitting guys out of nowhere with big sidewinders sly as fuck. he was that kind of cowardly bastard
I really, really wish Joe would put talk out of his ass about stuff like this. Daniel Cormier wasn’t correct. He doesn’t know boxing rules. Neither does Joe, he got the rules completely wrong. You PAUSE the count, you don’t mentally continue it. Tyson’s eyes were completely clear, if the count was less he would’ve stood up. No error, only Joe not knowing shit about boxing rules.
Redban knows almost a little bit off nothing about everything. Bigger fraud than Bert Kreisher. Good for him, he suits the industry well.
Fury vs Wilder 3 was earthquakes and people screaming their heads off lol
even if wilder won the first fight...its still 2-1
Joe rogan is a nasa shill
What’s most impressive is Fury took Wilders best and got up and knocked him out.
Most popular President ever! 🤣😂 https://youtu.be/edlR3IiHMUU
Boxing rules is it’s a 10 count! Not a 10 second count! Also when a boxer doesn’t go back to corner after nockdown the ref can stop the count 100% legit! Stick to MMA
Nasa pays joe rogan
I wannna see  Francis Ngannou vs Deontay Wilder... Neither has spectacular technique as far as traditional boxing is concerned, but both carry the great equalizer in their front pocket. Make it happen !!
Wilder burns out like McGregor does I've noticed. It seems the strongest punchers burn out more often.
If Fury goes through the division and has a few more title defenses, there's a very solid argument that he's the best heavyweight there's ever been. Only person I see giving him trouble from the past is Lennox Lewis.
I hate it when rogan wears his nasa Outfit   Eddie bravos heart must break everytime joe goes full shill
Fury didn’t look fazed when he went down those 2 times. Wilder looked gassed from the second round
The better man won.
It's a ten count...not a ten second count. Just saying.
Tyson fury wilder 4? Like damn how many times will they fight
British rules makes more sense  in counting boxers out.
Why does Joe always insist on talking to Hinchcliffe about fighting? lol
Im surprised Joe doesn't actually understand what a 10 count in boxing actually is. It is not as simple as 10 seconds as soon as you're down and you're immediately out. It is supposed to be a 10 second period in which the referee is assessing the condition of the fighter. It does not have to be exactly 10 perfect seconds. If the downed fighter is responsive and answering questions then the count may be 1 or 2 seconds slower. Fury was never hurt, and its annoying how the take away from this fight is how scary a puncher wilder is. The truth is, wilder has had 3 fights now to knock out fury and he hasn't done it once. Fury is a better fighter and a better man. Wilder has been downed more times and hurt more times in this trilogy than fury has. Simple as that.
Wilder also had long counts, it happens, fury was fine
Knuckles on the temple . They always go down.
Watch the fight again and count yourself he clearly made it
LET'S GO BRANDON!!
Fury is the goat
Is there an occasion joe and his guests put on the space suits?
Joe is high asf
Fury is literally miles ahead of anyother fighter now, and it's only a matter of time before he unifies all belts THERE IS ONLY ONE
Tyson fury what a name what a fighter 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Tyson reacts to the count he is given,like all pros
Refs didnt stop the 2nd fight joe ....wilders corner threw the towel in the 2nd fight .... fury won all 3 fight convincingly ...stop trying to make it sound like trilogy was ever competitive  .. its probably 25-5 in rounds to fury over 3 fights
Bruh... why does Joe always discuss the badass fights with people who have no clue and obviously give 0 fucks throughout the whole conversation? smh
There was no error dood got up well before 10 count even with supposed error
got a good whooping from a true champ
I always felt wilder was a paper champ, he def proved his worth for that trilogy. I do believe he’ll have a hard time with the likes of Joshua, Ruiz, whyte, and maybe even usyk.
6:30 Joe is off here I think, Brian Campbell said something different about the matter in MK last Monday, and he might be a donk, but knows his shit regarding boxing
Joe's dumb and Cormier is dumb, go back and WATCH THE TAPE. Fury was down for about 6 seconds(fully alert just resting for a sec). So it doesn't matter what the ref did because he got up in time anyways
everyone knows boxing is full of corruption
Behave, doesnt matter what the count was Fury was getting up!! How can you have a timer on a screen? How is a semi conscious boxer going to be able to look up at a screen after being knocked down?
Thanks for vid been waiting to hear Joe’s thoughts on the fight
Tyson Fury is the best HW of the last 20 years
In Vegas? It’s corruption Joe.
The ripple effect #xrp
Tyson Fury was at 60% and still beat Wilder. I can’t wait for Fury vs Usyk.
Wilder has insane power and mediocre boxing.
Glad joe caught the ripples That moment was insane seeing it
I love u  joe
Most of the Fury’s are Pikies.  The fury brothers look at them
i dont agree with the count, just keep it traditional, if you manage to get up and win you deserve it.
Joe 'I Love Demons' Rogan
Fury got up within 10 seconds. It's been timed..
all fights are scripted
Their fights always look a bit fake especially when they knock each other down they look like pushdowns.
The thing is that Fury always waits until the 7th or 8th second to get up, he said he likes to take advantage of the full count so if the ref would have counted faster he would be up faster 🤷‍♂️
Joe rogan always screams but it's  real
Dont think it was the greatest fight...it was fury beatin up a tired wilder the whole fight
Heavyweight division is back !!
People need to give respect & props to Fury’s coach Sugar Hill... *Legend Emmanuel Stewart would be proud*
It should not be 10 seconds, if its a countdown it should be 15
Joe.. that fight was good, it was not an all time great fight.
his names luke tho
human cockfighting
Joe totally got the rules in regards to the 10 count wrong
Tyson let that man have it…all of it
How about a dam digital counter
Watch the clock when fury gets knocked down he gets up at 9 on both times stop with all this slow count talk its bs he still got up before 10 seconds accept the L dont be tyson after buster Douglas
So happy he got rid of that aggressive background.
Fury harder than a coffin nail.
"He hit haaard" Joe channeling his inner Tim Dillon
3:39 most useless input in any conversation i have ever heard
whenever the astronaut suit comes out the weirdness appears! And I am fucking here for it!
Def is wilder is Young he will be there after fury us gone
This was the greatest trilogy of all time
ITS THAT TIME OF THE YEAR!! THE SUITS ARE BACKKK!
His parents named him after Mike Tyson
“Did you shit your pants?”  “Uhh”
Fury is this generations Ali.
Joe “ Look at that fat roll down” Rogan
Fury is a traveller, they have a boxing culture and settle all disputes with it
Someone wana tell young Jimmy that he was named after Mike Tyson. His Dad was a bare knuckle boxer and all his brothers are boxers. But whats the odds him being a boxer
Wtf is Rogan wearing. Lol. Bysos/Capt Kirk
CNN: Racist white supremacist knocks out black man
Tyson fury was named after Mike tyson
Fury made Wilder look good. Furys only fought b level fighters since coming out of retirement
Tyson vs Wilder 3 brought boxing back to life... The real winner was us fans 🙌
These are definitely my favorite pods, just Joe and his buddies hanging out shootin the shit
Fun fact: Tyson Fury's dad was a professional boxer and named his son after Mike Tyson because he was his hero.
In my humble opinion Wilder was carrying more weight during his walk to the ring so that’s unfair.
Get Lucas Botkin from Trex Arms on your show!!
Redban looks horrible
the better man won at the end of the day
I don’t know why this musician decided to fight Deontay Wilder before his concert
So astronaut suits go on when they take psychedelics, right...?
Been waiting for this !
It was cool.
Thank u Joe    u help my son in law and I get along    we  lesson  to u and it give us something  to speak about    thank u sir for all u do
Come back to YouTube please
Joe
Stop defending Brendan
Tyson might be built like a tube of toothpaste that was squeezed in the middle but he would smash most anyone alive. Well earned champ.
You know it’ll be good when the spacesuits come out
I like how they're wearing spacesuits
I went to go see it in theaters. The whole theater was going nuts the entire time. An amazing fight to say the least. Props to both guys.
Joe needs to get more interesting guests.
Been waiting for this
Wilder lost cuz his costume was too light. 😤😤  He'll smoke Fury in the next fight. 🤡
Wow that's crazy I was just thinking about when Rogan was gonna drop his reaction to the fight 😳
Joe rogan is going fucking insane.
My favorite boxing fight by far
Joe "Look at the fat roll down!" Rogan
Wilder isn't good.
Joe "look at that fat" Rogan
Joe “Neanderthal” Rogan
"Look at the fat roll down!"
I'm gonna watch the fight tonight
More bluster and bull from the King of losers
Wilder is a beaten demon. God won
This is the JRE
63rd
Hey! Finally, a subject Joe’s qualified to have an informed opinion upon.
Wilder looked like he was on horse paste at the end 😉..
Deontay fought his ass off, he lost to a better fighter. Now he has to fight Joshua and prove his worth….he’s still a top 5 heavyweight, he can bounce back.
Tyson is right about the 👃's
